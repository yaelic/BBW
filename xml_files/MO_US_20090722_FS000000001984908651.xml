          <p>Good day, and welcome to the Altria Group Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Cliff Fleet, Vice President, Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. This morning, we will only be discussing Altria's 2009 second quarter and first half business results, and will not be discussing the status of tobacco litigation. Our remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct you to the forward-looking and cautionary statements at the end of our earnings release for the review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.</p>
          <p>As a result of the spin-off of Philip Morris International in the first quarter of 2008, our reported results for the six months ending June 30, 2008 reflect PMI as a discontinued operation. Revenues and operating companies' income for PMI are therefore excluded from Altria's continuing results.</p>
          <p>Since Altria acquired UST and its smokeless tobacco and wine subsidiaries on January 6, 2009, U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company's and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates' financial results from January 6 through June 30, 2009 are included in Altria's first half of 2009 consolidated and segment results. For a detailed review of Altria's second quarter business results, please review the earnings release that is available on our website, www.altria.com.</p>
          <p>Altria reports its financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  Today's call may contain various operating results on both a reported and on an adjusted basis, which excludes items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these measures as well as reconciliations are included in the earnings press release.</p>
          <p>Now it gives me great pleasure to introduce Mike Szymanczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Altria Group, Inc.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Cliff, and good morning to everyone. As was the case with our first quarter, our second quarter results unfolded pretty much the way we expected. Altria reported strong adjusted earnings per share growth of 8.7%. Our tobacco businesses continued performing well in what I describe as a challenging environment. Our cost savings programs remained on track.</p>
          <p>Our cigarette business delivered exceptional financial results. The UST integration continued to proceed smoothly. I think we remain encouraged by the initial results coming from our actions to enhance the value equation of USSTC's premium portfolio and our smokeless business. And Black &amp; Mild had another quarter of strong retail share growth in the cigar business.</p>
          <p>Volumes for the quarter were negatively impacted by a significant Federal Excise Tax increase on tobacco products that took effect on April 1, 2009. Because the ramifications of these tax increases were different by tobacco segment, the business trends for the quarter are a bit difficult to decipher.  Dave will go into more detail on these impacts when he reviews business segment results, and we'll try to provide further insight during the Q&amp;A portion of the call.</p>
          <p>However, three events negatively impacted our tobacco volumes for the quarter beyond industry performance that do not represent trends and need more explanation. First, during the early phases of the FET-induced period of pricing dislocation in the cigarette business, PM USA experienced share losses as some competitors spent aggressively into the FET, while we did not. Once price gaps normalized at the beginning of June, Marlboro experienced sequential retail share growth throughout the month. Marlboro ended June with a share of 42.4%, which was the same share level as the first quarter. We also allowed our non-support brands to adjust to lower post-FET share levels. Together, these two actions turned out to be a profitable strategy for our cigarette business.</p>
          <p>Second, USSTC executed an everyday low price strategy on Copenhagen and Skoal, and eliminated duplicate inventories caused by large quantities of value pack promotions in the system.  This is a one-time adjustment.</p>
          <p>And finally, in our cigar business, Middleton integrated our cigar distribution system into the one we use for cigarettes, thus reducing required wholesaler lead times. We also moved to zero-day payment terms. These two steps have reduced Middleton's cigar trade inventory system-wide and should result in improved product freshness.</p>
          <p>So far, the impact of the FET increase on industry volumes is in line with our expectations. In the cigarette category, the FET hike helped drive the average industry-wide price for a pack of cigarettes up approximately 25% versus a year ago. To-date, estimated cigarette industry volume, adjusted for changes in trade inventories, has decreased in line with historical price elasticity.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, PM USA did not spend into the FET increase, but rather waited for the marketplace to settle. Price gaps widened to about 50% early in the second quarter, but we saw the discount category grow in April and May. The price gaps returned to below 40% by early June. In June, PM USA changed its promotional programs to focus on single-pack offers. The result of this plan was retail share loss during April and May, and rapid sequential retail share gains for Marlboro and sequential share losses for the discount category during June. PM USA's promotional spending on a per pack basis was essentially the same in the first and second quarters of 2009.</p>
          <p>The UST integration is proceeding very well. USSTC's sales force and one-to-one consumer engagement functions were combined with those of PM USA to create two new support organizations, Altria Sales and Distribution and Altria Consumer Engagement Services. Creating these companies combined with other ongoing Altria cost savings initiatives has enabled the integration to proceed quickly. 98% of the planned employee separations resulting from the UST integration have occurred. We expect integration cost savings to begin enhancing profitability in the second half of 2009 and beyond.</p>
          <p>USSTC's premium portfolio has responded well to the marketing changes implemented in the first half of 2009. USSTC's premium share stabilized sequentially as USSTC transitioned from multi-can value pack promotions to an everyday low price strategy on single cans to reset the brand's value equation.</p>
          <p>As a next step, in the third quarter, USSTC will adjust the price gap on Copenhagen and Skoal in some states where price gaps remain too high and/or where particularly difficult economic conditions exist. Also in the second half of 2009, USSTC will enhance its brand building equity programs to help return Copenhagen and Skoal to modest retail share growth.</p>
          <p>Altria's cost savings programs continued to proceed as planned. 25 million in cost savings were achieved across the Altria family of companies in the second quarter. UST integration savings along with the savings from ceasing cigarette production in Cabarrus, which will occur by the end of this month, as well as other SG&amp;A cost savings programs, should further enhance profitability. We remain confident that we will complete the $1.5 billion in cost reductions off our 2006 cost base as planned by 2011.</p>
          <p>On June 22, 2009, the President signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act into law. The legislation provides the Food &amp; Drug Administration regulatory authority over tobacco products. While we did not agree with every element of this legislation, including those that we believe cross constitutional limits, we supported its enactment. We believe this comprehensive national regulatory framework, implemented thoughtfully, can provide significant benefits to adult consumers by establishing a common set of high standards for all tobacco manufacturers and importers doing business in the United States; by providing a framework for the evaluation of tobacco products that are potentially less harmful than conventional cigarettes; and by creating clear principles for accurate and scientifically grounded communication about tobacco products to adult consumers. We hope that the FDA will implement this new regulatory framework consistent with these principles and we will work constructively with the agency to support its enactment.</p>
          <p>This regulatory framework will bring change for our tobacco businesses, and we have been preparing for this change for the past several years. Immediately after the President signed the legislation into law, Altria established a Regulatory Affairs Group to oversee our future work in this area.</p>
          <p>We remain very pleased with Altria and its operating companies' 2009 performance to-date. Our cigarette business continues to grow income in a challenging environment. The UST integration is proceeding very smoothly. USSTC's premium MST portfolio is benefiting from our actions to enhance its value equation. Black &amp; Mild continues to generate strong retail share growth. And our aggressive cost savings programs continue to enhance overall profitability. Altria remains well positioned to continue delivering strong shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>Given Altria's strong year-to-date EPS performance, we are raising our 2009 full year guidance for adjusted diluted EPS to a range of $1.72 to $1.77, representing a growth rate of four to 7%.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave Beran, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike. Let me begin with the cigarette segment, which delivered strong operating companies income growth.</p>
          <p>Reported cigarette operating companies income increased 6.7% versus the prior-year period, to $1.4 billion, due to list price increases, partially offset by lower volumes as well as charges primarily related to Cabarrus facility closure. Excluding those charges, the cigarette segment's operating companies income increased 7.4% to $1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Second quarter results were impacted by the April 1 increase in the Federal Excise Tax. In the first quarter of 2009, trade inventories were substantially reduced to minimize floor tax payments. And in the second quarter, the trade rebuilt inventories, though not back to their prior levels.</p>
          <p>PM USA's cigarette shipment volumes were down 6.8% in the second quarter, but are estimated to be down about 12% when adjusted for changes in trade inventories. PM USA estimates that total adjusted cigarette industry volume declined 8% in the second quarter. Overall, 2009 cigarette industry volumes have performed in line with PM USA's expectations.</p>
          <p>For the first half of 2009, PM USA estimates that adjusted total cigarette industry volumes declined 7%. PM USA estimates that its cigarette shipments were down 9% on a year-to-date basis when adjusted for changes in trade inventories and calendar differences.</p>
          <p>When comparing PM USA to the total industry, the difference in volume decline can be attributed to volume lost during the period of price gap dislocation and share losses on unsupported brands due to higher retail prices. Initial adult consumer reaction to the FET hike was consistent with our expectations. There was some adult consumer down-trading to competitive brands as some competitors chose to spend into the tax increase, driving a widening of the price gap between Marlboro and the lowest price brand. This gap reached a peak of about 50% at the beginning of the second quarter. However, as the quarter progressed, price gaps closed below 40%. As price gaps closed, Marlboro's retail share began growing again, and ended the month of June at a 42.4 share.</p>
          <p>The trade down from premium to discount that occurred in the first part of the second quarter was most evident among non-menthol brands due to less competitive activity in the menthol segment.  Marlboro Menthol grew 0.4 of a share point in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>At the end of the quarter, PM USA began shipping Marlboro Blend No. 54 to continue building on Marlboro's success in the menthol segment. Retail acceptance and initial adult consumer trial of this new packing have been very strong.</p>
          <p>Overall, we are pleased with the second quarter cigarette business results. Profitability growth was very strong, and Marlboro's retail share performance returned to growth in June after the initial period of dislocation following the Federal Excise Tax increase.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the smokeless segment. USSTC's actions enhanced the value equation on Copenhagen and Skoal with a list price reduction of $0.62 per can that was effective at the end of the first quarter. As we anticipated, national net price gaps versus the leading discount brand closed to below 60% at the end of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We are encouraged by USSTC's premium retail share performance as its share began and ended the second quarter of 2009 at the same level. Importantly, USSTC's premium revenue share increased 6.6 share points versus the first quarter of 2009 as the company eliminated multi-pack deals.</p>
          <p>USSTC's domestic MST volume declined 3.4% in the second quarter, but is estimated to be essentially flat versus the year-ago period when adjusted for changes in trade inventories, the discontinuation of multi-pack deals, and the discontinuation of its Rooster brand.</p>
          <p>The trade continued reducing inventory levels on USSTC's products as the company transitioned from multi-pack deals to everyday low pricing, which eliminates the need for promotional inventory.  USSTC believes that the long-term growth rate for total MST industry volume remains at six to 7%.</p>
          <p>Reported operating companies income for the smokeless segment was 177 million in the second quarter. When adjusted for exit, integration, and acquisition related charges, second quarter smokeless segment operating companies' income was $213 million.</p>
          <p>Now let's discuss our cigar business results. Black &amp; Mild reported another strong quarter of retail share growth. Black &amp; Mild's retail share was 30.4%, up 2.7 share points versus the prior-year period. Black &amp; Mild continued benefiting from the support on the Altria sales and distribution infrastructure at retail as well as the successful launch of Black &amp; Mild original Wood Tip earlier this year.</p>
          <p>New products continued to be an important component of Black &amp; Mild's retail share performance.  Middleton recently announced two new line extensions that are expected to ship to wholesale in the third quarter of 2009, Black &amp; Mild Wood Tip Wine and a new non-tip cigar product, Black &amp; Mild Cigarillo, which will be test marketed in the state of Georgia.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, cigar shipments were impacted by the FET increase on April 1. There was no floor tax on cigar inventories, so the trade increased inventories in the first quarter in advance of the tax increase. In the second quarter, the trade fully depleted this FET-related inventory build.  Additionally, the trade further reduced cigar inventories in the second quarter as Middleton migrated to the Altria sales and distribution system. Middleton does not expect to recover volume lost to this one-time adjustment. Second quarter cigar shipment volume was 270 million units, a decline of 23.8% versus the prior year period, but is estimated to have grown moderately when adjusted for changes in trade inventories and timing of promotional shipments. Middleton believes that the long-term industry volume growth rate for machine-made large cigars remains at three to 4%. However, the growth rate may have slowed in the second quarter. We will have a better understanding of the volume impact as the year unfolds.</p>
          <p>Reported operating companies' income for cigars decreased 28% versus the prior year period to $36 million, reflecting lower volumes. Excluding integration cost, adjusted operating companies' income was $40 million, a decline of 21.6% versus the year ago period. The first half of 2009, adjusted cigar operating companies' income increased 3.2% versus the prior year period to $97 million.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to our new Wine segment. The Wine segment's second quarter results continued to show strong underlying performance, but were negatively impacted by continuing wholesale inventory depletions and weakness in on-premise sales that includes restaurants and bars. As a result, Ste. Michelle's second quarter wine shipments were down 1.5% versus the year ago period to 1.4 million cases. Ste. Michelle's volume from wholesale to retail increased approximately 5% in the second quarter and first half of 2009, due primarily to higher off-premise channel volume that includes supermarkets and liquor stores, partially offset by lower on-premise channel volume that includes restaurants and bars.</p>
          <p>Retail volume, as measured by the Nielsen Total Wine Database for US Food &amp; Drug, increased approximately 12% in the second quarter of 2009 versus the prior year period. Reported second quarter operating companies' income for the Wine segment was $9 million. When adjusted to our acquisition-related charges of $6 million, adjusted second quarter operating companies' income was $15 million.</p>
          <p>Let's conclude with Financial Services. Reported operating companies' income in the second quarter increased $53 million to $83 million due to higher gains on asset sales, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for losses of $15 million.</p>
          <p>On June 1, 2009, General Motors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. PMCC leases various types of automotive manufacturing equipment to GM under leases, which expire from 2012 through 2023. Automotive equipment under lease to GM represented approximately 4% of PMCC's portfolio of finance assets as of June 30, 2009. As a result of the bankruptcy filing, PMCC has ceased recording income on these leases. All other PMCC leasees are current on their lease obligations.  PMCC has assessed its allowance for losses for its entire portfolio, including its exposure to GM, and believes that the allowance for losses of $315 million is adequate.</p>
          <p>As you know, the jury in our LILO, SILO tax refund case in the southern district of New York reached a verdict in the government's favor. In that case, we were seeking a refund for taxes and interest we paid following disallowance by the IRS of tax benefits we claimed in the 1996 to 1997 years related to four LILO, SILO transactions.</p>
          <p>There are critical legal issues involving these transactions that will be raised in post-verdict motions that will be filed by the end of July, and that we expect will be resolved by September. If necessary, depending on the resolution in these issues, we will pursue an appellate strategy. We had previously paid approximately $150 million of federal income tax and net interest related to disallowed tax benefits for LILOs and SILOs for the years 1996 through 1999, including the four transactions that were subject of the July verdict.</p>
          <p>The IRS has indicated to us that it intends to disallow tax benefits we claimed in the years 2000 to 2003 with respect to the same four leases plus other lease transactions characterized by the IRS as LILOs and SILOs. The total disallowance for the 2000 to 2003 time period for these leases and federal income tax and related interest would be approximately $1 billion. If the IRS in the future disallowed the tax benefits for these leases for the period from 2004 until December 31, 2009, the disallowance for that period and federal income tax and related interest would be approximately $900 million, taking into account the federal income tax paid or payable on gains associated with sales of leased assets during that period.</p>
          <p>PMCC entered into no LILO or SILO transactions after 2003. We intend to contest all these disallowances vigorously, whether and when we make payments of these amounts will depend on the timing and outcome of future IRS audits and any related administrative challenges and litigation. LILO and SILO transactions represent approximately 36% of the net finance assets of PMCC's lease portfolio. Although there will be some likely impact on our reported earnings in the event of an ultimate adverse outcome to these matters, management believes that resolution of the LILO, SILO matter will have no material adverse effect on our dividend policy or on our ability to satisfy our financial obligations.</p>
          <p>Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items. Marlboro's c-store price gap versus the lowest affected price  cigarette averaged 42% in the second quarter. Marlboro's net pack price was $5.22 and the lowest affected price, cigarette pack price was $3.68. The cigarette discount categories second quarter retail share increased two share points versus the prior year period to 27.3%. The estimated average weighted cigarette state excise tax at the end of the second quarter of 2009 was $1.15 and is estimated to be $1.22 at the end of July.</p>
          <p>Five states, including Florida, increased their SETs on July 1. Through July 22, nine states and Puerto Rico have increased their cigarette excise taxes in 2009 with an average increase of $0.53 per pack in those nine states. Our second quarter MSA and quota buyout accruals were $1.4 billion or $0.67 per pack. Of the $0.67, MSA represents $0.61 per pack and the quota buyout represents $0.06 per pack. Copenhagen's national retail price was $4.16 per can in the month of June.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, CapEx and ongoing depreciation and amortization were both $69 million, and we anticipate that our 2009 full year effective tax rate on operations will be approximately 37.1%.</p>
          <p>Operator, do we have any questions?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from the line of Christine Farkas of Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. I had some questions on smokeless, if I could. You talked about premium share stabilizing by the end of the quarter.  Firstly, could you comment on the category growth for the second quarter and/or the first half? And secondly, are you implying that the premium growth in June, for example, approached that of the first quarter. Can you just clarify what the share was, for example, at the end of the quarter, and if you were referring to premium?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's kind of hard to characterize category growth given some of the movement in inventories that took place in the first half of the year. Our best estimate coming from USSTC is that they believe it continues to be running at about a six to 7% category growth rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's best I think to look at those things over an extended period of time because things like large FETs and inventory movements and some of the changes that we made can kind of cloud the read. We've got a number of moving items going on relative to the smokeless business, which was our intention for the year, we're making lots of adjustments in that business. So we've adjusted the cost structure significantly. A lot of that's been done; we still have a little more to do in the second half.</p>
          <p>We've adjusted our list prices as a first step toward getting our value equation right. We've said, in the process of talking about this, that we would take that a step at a time. We would do what was necessary we thought on a broad basis. And then we'd look at hot spots that developed around the country or places where that list price reduction was inadequate to get to the range of gap that was going to be necessary. And so we couldn't do that until after we'd taken the first step that was just completed in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And so now in the third quarter, we're moving on to look at discrete particular areas, and we'll take a more surgical approach to getting things right there. And really, that's just getting pricing right. In the long run, we want to build those businesses using equity tools. And we'll begin to do that as we move on through the second half. We've formulated strategies there. We've developed some programs and opportunities we think will benefit the brands on a longer-term basis and certainly influence the outcome as we move into 2010.</p>
          <p>So I think you have to look at the smokeless category and our business, given the size of our business relative to the total category, in 2009, as operating in a period of adjustment. I wouldn't get too excited about trying to predict trends or read trends during that period of adjustment because it's hard to nail down numbers as trends when you've got so many things moving around.  So, it's tough for me to give you an answer to a question that I don't think is really answerable relative to trends right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for that. A follow-up on smokeless, though. You gave us the price gaps now at the second quarter. Were any changes in weight-based tax structures helpful in closing that gap in the quarter in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure there were any that influenced that. You'll probably see some of that take place the second half of the year as Texas goes, but you've got some offsets relative to Florida and I think Wisconsin, if I remember correctly, that work the other way. So, no, I wouldn't say that the gap has been driven by that. I think it's been driven purely by the changes in the price structure that we put in place as well as whatever other competitors did. I'd say that that gap is still kind of moving because, as you know, the impact of the FET on many of the competitive brands wasn't reflected until late in the quarter. So we really haven't seen that play out in the gaps at this point. So that's still kind of moving, and I think we'll likely see a bit more narrowing of that in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A final question for Dave. On your SILO, LILO comments about potential impacts not disrupting your ability to pay dividends or meet financial commitments. Do you have a comment on whether or not that would impact your plans for potentially resuming a share buyback in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we said earlier in the year, the Board will take that decision by the first quarter of next year, and look at the total business, including potential impact of LILO and SILOs when they make the determination on future share buybacks. But just let me remind you that when we look at our companies, okay, and how we manage our cash flow, we're always looking to have a strong balance sheet and to make sure that we have a strong dividend policy. But specifically, on stock buybacks, we will make that call later on in the year.</p>

          <p>Thanks. David, just a follow-up on SILO, LILO here. The $1 billion that the IRS intends to disallow between 2000 and 2003, my understanding is you have to pay for it before you can litigate, is that the case? And if that's the case, when would the cash obligation be due?</p>

          <p>Well, let me comment on that and then Dave can comment on it. But I would say there are several different options relative to that. So your assumption could be right, but not necessarily right. So it depends on which option you choose. Dave?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then Mike, just in terms of on the cigarette side, the narrowing of the price gap in June that you saw and the subsequent share improvement that you saw in your brands. How much of that is driven by competitors sort of backing off from their promotions as opposed to your increased promotions on Marlboro? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether your promotional strategy has changed as the quarter progressed or just competitors kind of backed off in June?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I mentioned, our spending rate per 1,000 for the second quarter was the same as it was in the first quarter, so I don't think you can attribute that to increased spending by us. I think you did see some lagging of the reflection of the tax in the marketplace. In a number of cases, you even saw some spending in to the tax increase, then that moderated as you got on through the end of May. And I would say that we would attribute it more to that than anything else.</p>
          <p>We made some adjustment in our promotion plan on Marlboro. We moved from where we do run on some packings or have run two pack deals. We moved to a one-pack strategy because we felt like as pricing went up, particularly in this economic climate, that was a better approach for our consumers. But at the same time we did that, we actually lowered the rate per pack that we were spending from the level we had when it was a two-pack deal, but broadened modestly the amount of activity that we had. So, we adjusted our strategy, but I wouldn't say we made any dramatic changes in the amount of spending that was reflected in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, in terms of the Menthol category, Mike, you've talked about the category not facing as much price competition from the lower end or the trading down being more limited in that category. Can you maybe talk about the Menthol category growth? And within it, the new product that you've introduced there, what is the sort of the position -- how is that different than other Marlboro Menthol line extensions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Marlboro Blend 54 really did not impact market share in the second quarter because it really didn't hit the marketplace and started to have an impact until the third quarter. So Marlboro's Menthol strength for the quarter was driven by other packets in the brand. It's a different taste profile. And it seems to -- among Menthol smokers, seems to be very attractive to a pretty good segment of Menthol smokers. And so it kind of fills a bit of a void in the portfolio of Marlboro Menthol SKUs, and that's why we decided to put it out in the marketplace.  And so we'll get a chance to get a early read on it in the third quarter as it kind of unfolds. And at this juncture, we're just trying to give Menthol consumers, adult consumers, the opportunity to give it a try.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just had a couple of questions for you. The first would be that if you look at the inventory rebuild, if you will, that occurred in the second quarter, I guess somewhere around 2.2 billion sticks <mark type="inaudible" /> . Are we at a level now that's a good sustainable level going forward for inventory or have you had any continuing out of stock problems for example like you had in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Out of stocks on Marlboro are still a bit higher than they were pre-FET. As I've spoken to people in the retail distribution, part of the retail -- the retail part of the distribution systems, I would say they're still kind of finding their way and adjusting their inventory level. They -- I think they pretty much recognize that cost of inventory has gone up, but they tend to operate with the idea of wanting to satisfy demand in the category. And so you'll see I think some continued adjustment in inventory as the actual category volume level begins to settle in, in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Typically, when we see one of these larger excise tax increases, we'll see a dip in volume and then a return of volume. And that return is on a slower curve out over several months. And so if you believe, as I do, that retail inventories tend to follow the actual outflow of volume for retail stores, you're likely going to see those inventory levels continue to adjust a bit on through the third quarter and maybe even into the fourth quarter. So I would say that's not finished yet. It's still moving around a little bit, and that's reflected in some out of stock -- increased out of stock levels on Marlboro in the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I had one more question for you, which is related to smokeless in the UST business. You talked about making some second half adjustments, it looks -- sounds like the Copenhagen price and some brand building programs as well. When you look at sort of the net cost savings from UST, are there other adjustments you're making to help pay for this, if you will, or is this kind of cutting into the cost savings? Is that a fair way to look at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, ask me that again. I'm not quite sure I understand...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, I looked at it like you have $300 million in cost savings from UST. They're going to send a portion of those back as you did with the $0.62 decline or reduction in price in Q2. And now you're going to make a few more adjustments in Q3 it sounds like, Copenhagen and then some brand building adjustments. Are those -- have you found more cost savings or a way to pay for those or will that cut into, I guess what I regard, as kind of the net cost savings from UST?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we've always anticipated we would have to make -- as we do in the cigarette business, make some more localized adjustments in order to deal with particular circumstances. You have some circumstances where the tax structure or the amount of tax in a particular state has a bearing on whether or not the gap falls in the range that we're talking about. You also have some circumstances in some states where you have high unemployment. So the gap that you can sustain may be a little bit less. We had anticipated that that would be the case all along. And so factor -- we factored much of that into our calculations when we were determining what we thought we'd have to spend back into the marketplace.</p>
          <p>You just can't get there though until you do the first step, otherwise you're just wasting money. So we had to make the list price adjustment, let that set in so that we could see where the gaps were and where the issues were. And then now we can move on to the next step, which in some cases may only be on a particular brand or in other cases may be on both brands. And in the majority of cases, there's no more to be done.</p>
          <p>So, no, it's not new news. You shouldn't look at it that way. I think I spoke to this -- discussed it relative to strategies with UST. That we use both list price, but also localized by state more surgical approaches to dealing with the price gap today because it's more efficient than simply doing it all with list price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that makes sense. I had one quick follow-up, if I could, for Dave. And that is, is it fair -- could you give us an idea of what the tax rate would be say in '08 or '09 excluding any LILO or SILO benefit, is that something you can answer?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, I'm curious, first on the cigarette business. And certainly, in the second quarter or arguably for the first half, you prioritized profitability over share. And I'm curious, is that solely a reflection of sort of the tactical things that were happening in the marketplace? Or is there a more secular shift in how you are thinking about balancing profit versus share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would go back to the objective that we've stated relative to the cigarette business, which is to maximize earnings while maintaining modest share momentum on <mark type="inaudible" /> 47:15  Marlboro. And I would say what we did in the second quarter is very consistent with that. So, we looked at a discrete event in the marketplace. And so we looked at it to say, well, what's the most efficient way to manage around that event relative to how we're going to spend our money. And it seemed to us that the most efficient thing to do was to not try to deal with all of what was going on in a period of dislocation, but instead, to let the dislocation pass to see where we were. And then go back to the business of maintaining momentum on this key brand that we have, Marlboro. And we'd see where we adjusted to on the other brands, which we don't spend a lot of money on. <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then on the UST?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's how we did it. I wouldn't suggest to you that the second quarter represents any fundamental change in our strategy. It just says that that strategy is a longer-term strategy. It's not something that you necessarily are going to do regardless of what's going on around you. There may be points in time where it makes a little sense to go ahead and let those more price sensitive shoppers shop and come back and then return them to the brand, which is precisely what happened. I mean, it was -- if you saw the sequential share growth in June, what you'd see is it just stepped up every week once the gap was corrected. And the Marlboro business was very strong as it went through the month of June.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was some of the issue, Mike, in the early part of the quarter actually the price promotion level on competitive premium brands? Because the 42% gap you called out for the quarter on average is fairly narrow in a historical context for Marlboro to have lost share. So was some of the issue promotional spending on premium brands, which isn't captured in that 42% number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the 42% is basically irrelevant in terms of looking at the business, and that's because it ranged from over 50 to down below 40 by the end of the quarter.  So, the average for the quarter doesn't mean much. In April and May, it was driven by a number of factors, largely discount. So it was largely dragging your feet by some competitors in terms of reflecting the increase, and in some cases, it was some big expenditures into the FET. So it was not only not reflecting it, it was also spending into it pretty aggressively for a period of time. And there was a share gain by those discount operators, and in particular, I think there was one brand that had very aggressive share growth behind very aggressive spending. And then, as the reflection of the tax played out and the gaps began to narrow, what you saw was equilibrium return. And then ultimately the discount share began to decline and the premium share began to pick back up in Marlboro in particular, which kind of rested during April and May, it came back very strongly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on Copenhagen and Skoal, are you surprised or a little disappointed that the $0.62 reduction in wholesale list prices wasn't alone sufficient to generate sequential share growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, and I said this at the beginning of this proposition, that to some degree, given my experience in the cigarette business. And remember, I date back before Marlboro Friday. So I think it's fair to say that when you go back that far, and given the tools we had back then, that the depth of the change in the business, which resulted in some significant share growth over a short period of time for the cigarette business, in the Marlboro business, wasn't the most efficient approach to it. So as we've looked at it, and we said this before we did it, that our objective was not to use price gap management to drive growth. It was rather to stabilize the share in these businesses. And then grow them using brand enhancing approaches that really allow you to sustain a larger gap because you have a stronger brand equity. So we've approached it differently, and it's a step by step process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're stepping our way through it because that's the most efficient and most profitable way to do it, and that's what our objective is.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, two last things. First, on SILO, LILO, thank you for the increased disclosure. Can you help us understand, if you were to approach the issue just how you have to-date, which is the IRS challenges you, you pay the money, you litigate, and you go through that cycle over time. In that hypothetical, and then you -- the government prevails throughout. Under that hypothetical scenario, can you give us an assessment of this 1.9 billion you called out, what the phasings of those cash payments would be, by year, approximately?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so, at least not right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And then, lastly, as it relates to the FDA, what gives you confidence that they're not going to mandate product specifications or product modifications that are going to impair the consumer enjoyment of your tobacco products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, it's going to be an extended process here, and I don't think that any of us can predict exactly what things the FDA will focus on. I think they've opened up a web communication page, and so you can comment to the FDA. We've begun to communicate with them, but -- and we've put some structure in place to engage with the FDA. But remember, they're building an organization. They've got to put that together. They've got to take comments. They've got to write a Reg. And there are some things that they have to work toward implementing, and we're focused on the things that need to be implemented, and engaging with them on how they want to have them implemented. But it's very early in the process. So I can't predict what areas they'll land on. What I can tell you is, whatever it is, it'll be a level playing field. And so, we'll compete on that playing field to try to give our consumers products that they enjoy. And certainly, I would hope that the decisions the FDA makes would be ones that are focused on allowing consumers to have choice, be informed, and hopefully mind waste to reduced harm through offering them products that help do that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, folks. Thanks for your time. On smokeless, now that you've had about six months to get a better idea of Skoal and Copenhagen, can you talk a bit on whether loyalty differs between snuff and cigarettes? And might loyalty for rival brands like Grizzly help explain some of the difficulty that you folks have had in taking share at this point. Thanks for your answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at the loyalty factors on those brands, they're slightly below Marlboro, but they're certainly within a few percentage points, call that less than five of a Marlboro. Marlboro has a very high brand loyalty level. So, I wouldn't say that their loyalty factor is weak. I would say, while the gap was pretty wide, and we saw this in the same kind of circumstance with Marlboro. And so we've narrowed it, but we didn't narrow it as much here as we did when we narrowed it on Marlboro. And we think as we've done research and evaluated this, that there are some opportunities relative to these brands and the way they're positioned and their offerings, that we can take advantage of that will help them grow.</p>
          <p>We're just taking a pretty methodical approach to it. We're not trying to buy business here. What we're trying to do is build brands. And so that takes a little more time. And I would kind of hasten to point out when somebody says to me, well, it's been six months. And you know, the train's not going 100 miles an hour yet. I would say, it's only been six months, and we've absorbed the company, taken on a massive amount of costs, reduced a sizeable amount of head count, and repositioned the pricing in the marketplace, and we're just getting started.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You mean, overall or related to UST?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Both, both.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, the UST program kind of first goes through the initial approach, which is taking out the identified cost opportunities to kind of restructure the business, insert it into the overall operation, and take advantage of the synergies that exist. And so, that's what we've been focused on with UST. As we move into 2010, they'll kind of move into the normal mode. We have, in all of our companies, which we expect them to find new better ways to operate and become more efficient. So, yeah, I would expect to see that business become more efficient over time.</p>
          <p>And the same thing is true in the rest of our businesses, that's how we operate. Now, we've got a cost savings program that we put out through 2011. We bumped it up a little bit this year in terms of what we expect to get. We continue to look for new, better ways to do things, and as we uncover them, we put them on the table. So that's an ongoing part of the company's strategic planning process. It's to look at ways to improve processes to allow us to be more effective and more efficient, and nothing will be different about UST in that regard.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede of Credit Suisse.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The 8% industry volume decline on an adjusted basis that you pointed out for the second quarter, is that the rate of decline that you expect for the rest of the year as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That rate of decline represents the price elasticity, one, the price changes that took place in the second quarter. We would expect to see that historical price elasticity would hold in the third and fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So translated, that means unless a more measure price increases, that 8% of volume decline should be what we should expect for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't give -- we don't give forward-looking forecasts on projected cigarette volumes going forward, especially in this year of dislocation. But just let me reiterate, that what we've seen in the first six months is reflective of historical price elasticities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't think we've seen anything unusual relative to historical price elasticities. Now, what happens in the second half of the year, your guess is as good as mine.  I mean, we'll watch and we'll see what happens in the marketplace. But so far, the way it's behaved is much with what the numbers would have said from other instances of tax increase or a price increase in the marketplace that should have happened. That's what's occurred. So...</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if it recovers more than that or less than that as we go on through the next three to six months, I think it remains to be seen. But so far, so good..</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you seen any changes in cross elasticity between cigarettes and smokeless?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have not at this point, but still we're talking about a FET hike that took place at the beginning of April and we're only three months into it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a little soon to be evaluating that, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough, okay. And then one more question. The UST integration, with the cost savings, the response from the brands to your price cuts, the overall progress of integration, would you say everything right now is on-track and is exactly where you thought it would be at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, pretty much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If we progress on-track and everything runs as smoothly as it has so far, when would you think to be able to tell us whether '09 is going to be accretive or not? Do we have to wait until the end of the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably, in January, we'll be able to tell you that.</p>
