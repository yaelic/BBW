        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full-year preliminary results conference call.</p>
          <p>2010 has been a very good year. We have delivered outstanding operational achievements and laid the foundations for our future growth.</p>
          <p>In E&amp;P, a particularly strong fourth quarter led to full-year production of 1.15 thousand BOE [sic] [1.15 million] per day, 1.1% higher than in 2009. This growth was driven by the timely delivery of all 12 of our planned start-ups, which contributed 40,000 BOE per day of new production in 2010, and will account for 230,000 BOE per day of production at peak.</p>
          <p>We also make excellent progress on our key projects. We count Zubair in Iraq as a major success, having been the first IOC to reach production growth targets. In Venezuela, we established a joint venture with PDVSA to develop the giant Junin 5 field and further increased gas in place at our giant Perla discovery.</p>
          <p>In Angola, we have sanctioned the west half of Block 1506 and recorded significant exploration success. In fact, new discoveries have been one of the highlights of the year. Exploration successes in Indonesia and Brazil, on top of those in Venezuela and Angola, added almost 1 billion BOE of new resources overall at a very competitive cost of $1.50 per BOE.</p>
          <p>We are also very excited about the new countries and place we have entered in 2010. We added acreage in Togo and in Democratic Republic of Congo and gained unconventional gas exposure in Poland and China.</p>
          <p>Turning now to gas and power, we have faced unusual market conditions due to oversupply and the gap between oil-linked and spot gas prices. We are tackling these new conflicts through contract renegotiations with our suppliers. The revision with the Libyan NOC has been delivered successfully, and we are now well in track in negotiation with Sonatrach and Gazprom.</p>
          <p>In RNN, despite repressed refining margins, we substantially improved our performance, more than halving losses compared to 2009. This improvement has been achieved thanks to efficiency.</p>
          <p>Sandro will take you through now through our fourth quarter results.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paolo. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our fourth quarter results presentation.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of '010, the macro environment was positive compared to the same period of last year. The Brent price averaged $86 a barrel, up 16% compared to the fourth quarter of '09. The average European refining margin Brent/Ural was $3.78 a barrel. While it remained depressed compared to historical trends, it was higher than in the corresponding period of last year. Finally, the euro depreciated by 8% versus the U.S. dollar, compared to the corresponding period last year.</p>
          <p>Moving to our results, adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter amounted to &#x20AC;4.7 billion, up 28% year-on-year. This result mainly reflects the stronger contribution of the Exploration &amp; Production and the Refining &amp; Marketing divisions, partially offset by lower results in Gas &amp; Power.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net profit for the fourth quarter was &#x20AC;1.7 billion, up 24% year-on-year. This result reflects improved operating performance, partially offset by a slightly higher adjusted tax rate, up by 2 percentage points. The adjusted tax rate for the full-year '10 was 54.4%, up slightly from last year 53.6%.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of '10, Eni's reported oil and natural gas production reached the record level of 1.954 thousand [sic] (1.954 million) barrel oil equivalent per day. When excluding the effect of the updated gas conversion rate, production increased by 2% compared to the fourth quarter of '09.</p>
          <p>Our performance in the quarter was positively impacted by the contribution of ramp-ups and the startups of the 12 projects we launched in '010, especially Zubair. The new production was partially offset by declines of mature fields in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as by lower entitlements from our production-sharing agreement contracts. Production entitlements in the fourth quarter include revisions in some countries of North and West Africa, in line with the similar amounts in Q4 '09.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;4 billion, up 44% compared to the fourth quarter of '09. This was mainly the result of higher volumes, higher oil and gas realized prices in dollars, and of the positive impact of the depreciation of the euro over the dollar.</p>
          <p>In terms of reserves, we replaced 125% of our production. At constant prices, we delivered a reserve placement ratio of 135%, maintaining the life index of our reserves above 10 years. These results compare well with last year performance of 96% at <mark type="inaudible" /> prices and confirm the solidity of our upstream portfolio.</p>
          <p>In Gas &amp; Power, overall gas volumes sold, including consolidated and associated companies, totaled 27.2 billion cubic meter, up around 2.5% year-on-year. However, adjusted operating profit decreased by 31% compared to the same period of '09, in line with our guidance.</p>
          <p>Gas &amp; Power adjusted pro forma EBITDA for the fourth quarter of '10 was &#x20AC;921 million compared to &#x20AC;1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of '09. International transportation results showed a 16% decrease, mainly due to the accident which occurred to Transitgas in July.</p>
          <p>The regulated businesses generated &#x20AC;389 million, up 7% versus the corresponding period of last year. The increase mainly reflects the recognition of new investments in tariffs as well as the remuneration of fuel gas cost, the higher volume transported, and the synergies achieved from the integration of Italgas and the Stogit.</p>
          <p>Adjusted pro forma EBITDA in the marketing business was negatively impacted by increasing competitive pressure in Italy and Europe, due to oversupply and the sluggish demand, resulting in price reductions to customers. Margins were also penalized by persisting differentials between oil-linked gas prices and the spot prices, which have become reference for customers. These negatives were partially offset by the renegotiations of certain long-term supply contracts, as well as by portfolio optimization.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Refining &amp; Marketing, in the fourth quarter of '10, the divisional recorded an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;39 million, up 80% compared to the same period of last year. This improvement is primarily due to a better scenario for Eni's complex refineries, which benefited from a larger re-separation between light and heavy crudes, the wider spread between gasoline and gasoil spread, and higher utilization rates.</p>
          <p>Refining also benefited from improved efficiency, the synergic integration of refineries and optimization of supply. Marketing was affected by a rapid rise in the cost of these delays that couldn't be immediately transferred to final prices, and by lower retail sales in Italy. These negatives were partly offset by higher sales on European networks.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of '10, the petrochemical business reported an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;74 million compared to a loss of &#x20AC;104 million in the fourth quarter of '09. This improvement was driven by higher volumes, partially offset by higher feedstock costs.</p>
          <p>Saipem delivered adjusted operating profit of &#x20AC;378 million, up 33% versus Q4 09. Other activities and corporate showed an aggregate loss of &#x20AC;129 million compared to a loss of &#x20AC;151 million in the fourth quarter of '09, and this improvement reflect the ongoing <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Net cash from operations amounted to &#x20AC;14.7 billion for the full year. Working capital benefited from optimization measures for around &#x20AC;1.3 billion compensated by cash outflows associated with the pre-payments under take-or-pay contract of &#x20AC;1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Proceeds from divestments including non-strategic upstream assets, 51% of Sale Energia and 25% of the Greenstream pipeline, amounted to &#x20AC;1.1 billion. Total cash inflows therefore amounted to &#x20AC;15.8 billion. Cash outflows referred to capital expenditure of &#x20AC;13.9 billion and dividend payments of &#x20AC;4.1 billion, which included the payment of the interim dividend of '10.</p>
          <p>Net financial debt as at the end of December amounted to &#x20AC;26.1 billion, resulting in a debt to equity ratio of 0.47, essentially unchanged compared to the previous year. Planned pipeline disposals for a total of around &#x20AC;1.5 billion expected in the first half of '11 will contribute to reduce year-end leverage.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention, and now I will hand you over to Paolo for his final remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sandro.</p>
          <p>And now our outlook for 2011. Our upstream production will grow to around 1.830 thousand [sic] (1.83 million) BOE per day at our $70 Brent scenario, confirming the growth profile set out last year. Ramp-ups and start-ups will deliver around 90,000 BOE per day of new production.</p>
          <p>In Gas &amp; Power, regulated businesses will perform well. Our marketing activity will continue to face oversupply and a gap between oil linked and spot gas prices. We expect to close the renegotiation of the supply contracts with Sonatrach and Gazprom by year-end. These renegotiations will have a material impact on 2011 results and provide the basis for a more competitive marketing strategy in Europe and in Italy.</p>
          <p>Our Gas sales will benefit from our position in key European markets. In Italy, we've invested heavily in our retail customer service, aiming to strengthen our position in this robust market segment.</p>
          <p>In R&amp;M, refining margins will remain weak. We will continue to improve the division results through further efficiency.</p>
          <p>Consolidated CapEx will remain broadly in line with 2010, and we will be mainly focused on the development of our new major projects. These will continue to fuel Eni's growth in the future, a theme which we will discuss further in our strategy presentation next month.</p>
          <p>We'll now be pleased to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First question comes from Mr. Reid Iain [sic] Ian Reid from Jefferies. Mr. Reid Iain [sic] Iain Reid, please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Iain Reid here from Jeffries. Can I ask two questions, please?</p>
          <p>Firstly, on the production you've had from Zubair, is it possible to say how much profit you realized from that? On a pre- or post-tax basis?</p>
          <p>And secondly, you talked about contract renegotiations significantly improving profitability. Do you think you could quantify that, in terms of how much you'd expect to regain of your previous profitability in the Gas &amp; Power business? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will ask maybe Claudio to give you some detail on Zubair, even if I doubt he can really give you a precise number on that. But maybe he can give you some guidance.</p>
          <p>On &#x2013; as far as our renegotiations are concerned, now of course we are not going to give you a lot of detail on negotiation, which by the way are underway. This is a very sensitive issue.</p>
          <p>Let me just give you the ballpark, in which we are moving. As, you know, all our long-term contract are oil-linked 100%. Now we have in front of us essentially two alternatives. Either we renegotiate what we call the P-zero &#x2013; that is the basis price on which we start calculating the link to oil &#x2013; or we will negotiate the portion of our gas will be achieved linked to the spot prices.</p>
          <p>Now these are the two kinds of negotiations that we are having today. We &#x2013; I have to say that on the basis of the only one renegotiation, which we had been &#x2013; which we've finalized, which has been the negotiation with a leading NOC, we are fairly confident to achieve a reasonable and fair solution, which will restore, at least partially, the profitability of our marketing business.</p>
          <p>Having said that, just to &#x2013; since I'm expecting a few new questions on this area, I just would like to give you a few elements about the dimension of the problems affecting our Gas &amp; Power division. We &#x2013; the EBITDA of our Gas &amp; Power division is only for one-third linked to the marketing of gas. And this one-third of the Gas &amp; Power division represents roughly 5% of EBITDA of Eni.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Paolo, if you won't give a kind of indication of the scale of the recovery of that, is it possible then to give us some indication of where you see EBIT for the Gas &amp; Power division for 2011 as a whole?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We expect our EBITDA &#x2013; we measure normally the EBITDA in this division, because we look at it more like a utility. We expect our EBITDA, pro forma adjusted, in 2011 broadly in line with 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And the value of the Zubair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Claudio will answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a summary of what we have done this year in terms of production, the result of the average daily production in Zubair this year is about 236,000 barrel per day. That means about 29% above the initial production target.</p>
          <p>And that was absolutely enough to recover all our cost, so we don't have any carry-forward in terms of cost sustained in 2010. And we can book reserves and production. And as you know, we got $2 per barrel.</p>
          <p>The profitability of Zubair is based on the possibility to recover completely, in the &#x2013; your cost, get your 2%, and anticipate production. So you can recall &#x2013; you can accelerate production. You can increase definitely the possibility that this contract has. You can increase your remuneration.</p>
          <p>So we &#x2013; at the moment, the remuneration is well above our other rates. That's what we can say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Hi, there. I appreciate you have got a strategy update in March, and can only dig too much into the future. But maybe just to focus on the current operations in North Africa. Could you let us know what impact, if any, you've seen in Egypt from the popular demonstrations there? And given the news flows for further demonstrations in Libya today, what if any impact for operations there could be envisaged?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right. Good afternoon. Congratulations of your reserve replacement last year. Claudio, perhaps if I could ask you a little bit about the schematic in terms of how production will grow from both Jun&#xED;n and Perla.</p>
          <p>So you've given us an indication in terms of the starting positions of both projects for 2013, but I just wondered how &#x2013; what the trajectory is, in order to get to peak volumes from both those prospects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Claudio, will give you an idea about Jun&#xED;n and Perla.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jun&#xED;n and Perla. Jun&#xED;n and Perla, as we stated last year, we have an early production that is confirmed by second &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; third quarter 2013.</p>
          <p>We are starting the production of Perla with 300 million standard cubic meter per day. And that is the early production. And after a few years &#x2013; after four years &#x2013; we expect a full production in Perla of 1.2 billion of standard cubic feet per year. That is based on the first assumption and until the third well.</p>
          <p>Now with the third well of Perla, we discovered additional 2.5 tcf. And that means that we can increase production for domestic, and we can also increase production for export. And that will be the main focus over the next month for a study to upgrade the Perla production.</p>
          <p>For Junin 5, the early production is expected by 2013, with the production of 70,000 barrel per day. And after that, in the next year, until 2017 and 2018, we can reach a production 230,000 barrels per day.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Just back on Iraq actually, could you just talk about how easy it was to lift the production in the fourth quarter? And what actual activities you did actually perform, in terms of was it just starting up from pre-drilled wells, or was there a more complex set of activities that done that?</p>
          <p>And maybe back on the first point about the gas contracts, is it &#x2013; would it be your preference to renegotiate the P-zero rather than look to adopt a lot more spot price gas within your long-term contracts, given what happened in December, where we saw the spot price actually increased above the oil-linked price? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe Claudio will answer about Zubair and will give you &#x2013; tell you something about the gas contracts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in 2010, we have a very strong, intense activities on Zubair. We drilled &#x2013; so we drilled &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; we drilled six wells. We performed on more than 55 rigorously interventional on each well. And six were covers.</p>
          <p>So we had a very strong activity concerning the wells. And we are also active on the de-bottlenecking of a lot of different lines. So that is the result of our activity. And now we are producing, today, 275,000 barrel per day. So we are above &#x2013; we are 35% above the initial production, considering also a depletion of 5% to the year.</p>
          <p>Let me add something about our gas contracts. For example, in the case of Libya NOC, what we did has been to renegotiate the P-zero. And we have also shortened the time of renegotiation. That is, instead of renegotiating every three years, which would be the normal period for a new renegotiation of price, we decided, in common agreement with NOC, to shorten this period in two years, to make sure that the agreement that we reach was still a market agreement in two years from now. Now this is certainly a very fair solution, which I think gives satisfaction to both parties.</p>
          <p>With Sonatrach and Gazprom, we will be debating similar issues, but as I said before, it's also possible to link some &#x2013; some part of our purchases to spot prices.</p>
          <p>We are flexible. In fact, it's the result that counts. I cannot really anticipate what will happen.</p>
          <p>We think that there is preference, certainly from Sonatrach and possibly also from Gazprom, to have a change in the P-zero rather than a proportion in spot prices. But you know, in the negotiation, you can never tell before what will be the outcome.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. Just two questions, please.</p>
          <p>First one is &#x2013; sorry to come back to this contract renegotiation with the Libyan NOC. Can you tell us when exactly the contract was renegotiated? And whether that negotiation was fully reflected in 4Q numbers, or whether that was achieved more recently and therefore should have a positive impact on 1Q numbers in Gas &amp; Power?</p>
          <p>And secondly, could you give us some more color on &#x2013; of the efficiency improvements you expect in Refining &amp; Marketing? And whether you could quantify cost cutting targets? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the first question, I can say that the negotiation with Libya ended in second half of last year. And the impact on results is already seen.</p>
          <p>And for the other contract, I would say that the negotiation most probably will take most of this year, <mark type="inaudible" /> both parties in achieving an optimal result. But what is important to say that whatever will be the final result, this result will apply starting this year. So we know at the end of the year, probably, what would be the result. But those result will apply in full for the year 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now on the efficiency program in refining, we achieved roughly 50 million in 2010, and we expect to achieve double in 2011. So in total, cumulated in the two years, we would be achieving &#x20AC;150 million of savings.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Yes, two questions on gearing of the balance sheet, please.</p>
          <p>First, just wondering if you still regard 40% net debt to equity as a valid ceiling, particularly in the context of how the rating agency are assessing you? And secondly, assuming that to be the case, just wondering if you're going to be taking any measures this year, beyond obviously disposing of the regulated pipelines and the operating cash flow you generate to actually reduce that level of gearing? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now let me first comment to the gearing, and then I will leave Alessandro to give you a more precise answer to your second question.</p>
          <p>Yes, we still consider 40% a target to be achieved by 2013. We're well on track to achieve this growth, and this will be achieved.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we feel that the gearing of 40 rather than 42 and 44 is much less important today as compared to what it was only 18 months ago. But we don't want to &#x2013; not to comply with our target. So we still consider this target that we will deliver to the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And continuing on the same track, as we have already anticipated with our press release, assuming Brent price of $70 per barrel in 2011, and since we expect it to be able to complete the ongoing disposals of the international pipelines within the end of June, we expect it to be able to reduce the leverage of 0.47 existing at the end of the year to below by the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>Of course, we have focused our attention in particular on the working capital, because working capital is one of the most important element to generate cash. And this is the reason why we have already put in place several actions, some of which have been already generated some benefits in the last quarter of the year and will continue all over 2011, 2012. Because it is not only one-off transaction, but is just a framework agreement we have defined with some banks. So it is a real tools in order to improve our efficiency on the working capital.</p>
          <p>Then we have entered also an agreement with a special institution specifically focused on the monetizations of receivables vis-&#xE0;-vis of public-owned entities. And this has been another very important element to generate cash in 2010 and will continue all over 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I had a question on your gas volumes in Italy in the fourth quarter. You actually saw a year-on-year increase for the first time in over two years. I wonder if you could, firstly, estimate how much of an effect the colder weather had on volumes.</p>
          <p>And secondly, you also make reference to recapturing some wholesale clients. I wondered had that been achieved simply through lowering your prices? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in fact there has been some kind of effect from the colder climate. But the effect is mainly on the retail business, as there has been an increase of consumption by industries. And it has been quite big sized and it should be for the entire year.</p>
          <p>So the effects are both some contribution from colder climate and some contribution from real, increased demand due to the better situation in the industrial sector in Italy.</p>
          <p>We expect that this could continue in the next year. So we expect an increase of demand. And on the other side, to be a little bit more competitive in terms of the prices or could &#x2013; we think that the market share in Italy could recover. Probably not in full or to we had three years ago, but at least we expect a recovery.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just one quick follow-up. I noticed in the upstream business, your North African gas volumes had a big jump in Q4 versus Q3, and I can't think of it off the top of my head what that would be. Could you clarify that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The increase of volume in the last quarter is mainly due to the domestic markets. So the domestic market went from around 1.5 billion cubic meter per year to about 3 billion -</p>

          <p>Libyan market. So that will be power &#x2013; to the power, because they are starting a new power plant, so they are disposing all their lots of gas domestic. So we're increasing, on top of what we export, domestic production and domestic utilization.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I would like to have some more color on the guidance of set CapEx for 2011. In particular, say, your assumption on raw material cost and how are you facing &#x2013; if you are facing some price pressure from your suppliers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we do not expect, in 2011, major changes in the cost of our CapEx.</p>
          <p>And we expect our CapEx to be below 2009 with the 2010, both in amount and in composition. That is, our E&amp;P business will continue to represent roughly 70% of the total CapEx. While Gas &amp; Power, which in this case, means essentially our regulated businesses, will continue to represent roughly 15%.</p>
          <p>Then we start to decrease, but you can see the numbers through the analysis of this side of results. We start to decrease quite rapid at the end of its program of new vessels.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There will be some.</p>
          <p>We have an average &#x2013; sorry, if I can say &#x2013; we have an average of about 4% or 5% considering raw materials and services. That's all. We increase CapEx for the new projects, but there are lots of old project &#x2013; they are at the end. So that is the balance between the two. And we have a particularly steady CapEx flow.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you for another chance. Could I just clarify one of your answers? It was Kim's question about whether the Libyan renegotiations were actually reflected in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>And the second question I had was what your strategy was in terms of your Galp holding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me answer quickly the first question, which is simply yes. It is reflected in the fourth quarter, because the renegotiation took effect from the 1st of October, if I'm not wrong. Right, 1st of October. So it is reflected.</p>
          <p>On Galp, I would probably ask Sandro to give you &#x2013; who is our chief negotiator on Galp &#x2013; to give you some detail about this long story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paolo. Effectively, we have a lot of time to repeat that our strategy is not to hold a non-controlling stake in a listed company. It is a situation doesn't fit with our long-term objectives.</p>
          <p>Petrobras actually was just one among a group of international entities, both industrial and financials, who have notified unsolicited expression of interest.</p>
          <p>Of course, we are not in a hurry to dispose our stake, since we have already enjoyed so far a phenomenal return from our investment in Galp. Just to give you an indication, in the last 12 months, the total shareholder return generated by our investment in Galp is something in excess of 40%. And if we extend the monitoring period up to 24 months, Galp was capable to deliver a shareholder return in excess of 87%.</p>
          <p>So this is the reason why we are not in a hurry. We are happy to have received some other demonstration of interest. And in the next few weeks, we will decide on how to proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks also for a second bite at the cherry. And thanks to Lucy for sneaking the Galp question in there.</p>
          <p>Maybe just to go a step further on the MoU with PetroChina that was announced in the quarter, and which &#x2013; I mean you are looking to expand operations in Africa with PetroChina. I just wanted to know if you have made any progress with particular assets and particular countries that might be of might of interest for them at least?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the MoU we signed with PetroChina mainly is based on three points. The first one, as you said, is to have &#x2013; to develop together jointly some initiatives in Africa, especially in Eastern Africa, also in North Africa &#x2013; and deal with some possible firming in some Eni assets. And develop some joint initiative in the shale gas in China. That is the second point. And the third point is an exchange of technology and know-how in the shale gas, and also on the unconventional exploitation of oil fields.</p>
          <p>So that are the three main points. We have six month in front of us to exchange data and to design the main objectives in term of assets of our collaboration of our joint venture. But that's mainly the highlights of the MoU.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon to everybody. Two question, if I may.</p>
          <p>The first, a clarification on the Gas &amp; Power guidelines for 2011. And in particular, can you confirm that the guidelines of the flat EBITDA pro forma factors in the successful negotiations of the contract with Algeria and Russia?</p>
          <p>And secondly, can you give us an indication of the net working capital increase related to the take-or-pay contract that you're expecting in 2011?</p>
          <p>And moving to the upstream, if I look at the slides of your last strategy update in March &#x2013; February or March 2010 &#x2013; it looks like the impact of the start-ups and ramp-up in 2011 was expected in the range of plus-45 kbd. Probably I am wrong. In any case, can you give us an idea if there any delays? Or what are the main start-ups you expect in 2011? Thank you, very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when Paolo said that we expect an EBITDA pro forma of 2011 for the Gas &amp; Power division in line with 2010, of course we made reference to what we expect as a result of one of these renegotiations, mainly with Sonatrach and Gazprom.</p>
          <p>Of course, I cannot just say if it would be too prudent, but I would say that we ask you to make this calculation <mark type="inaudible" />. So we repeat what we said. We said that we expect the results of 2011 be broadly in line &#x2013; broadly in line &#x2013; with the results of 2010.</p>
          <p>For the take-or-pay, expect to still having the exposure to take-or-pay in 2011, if I think and expect that it would be &#x2013; if it's in line with what we had in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to be sure that you have a clear view of what is our thinking about that. If I may add something to what Domenico said.</p>
          <p>First of all, we give you a guidance of broadly in line with 2010. Our view is that we will be surprised not to be somewhat better than 2010. But we &#x2013; our forecast, it depends from so many variables which are out of our control &#x2013; we give a guidance of 2010. Remember that one of the key factors which &#x2013; let's say spread some optimism about the future is that the consumption of gas is growing in Europe and in Italy, as well.</p>
          <p>As far as the take-or-pay, you know that we had a take-or-pay in 2010 of a little higher than &#x20AC;1 billion. &#x20AC;1.2 billion. This number is including some take-or-pay of 2009, so let's say a little more than 1 billion. We would expect take-or-pay in 2011 significantly lower than this number, as a result of the growth of the market and the growth of our market share. Okay?</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now to answer to the start-ups. Start-ups &#x2013; simply in regards to your question about the start-ups in 2010 and 2011. Last year, during the strategy presentation, we talked about 40,000 barrel per day expected in 2010. And we didn't mention exactly any figure for 2011. Now we say that for 2011, our expectation is to &#x2013; actually to get about 30,000 barrel per day.</p>
          <p>And the main start-up in 2011 are in <mark type="inaudible" />. That is already started few days ago. <mark type="inaudible" /> in Australia, Appaloosa in Gulf of Mexico,  Cappellucci in Italy, and MLE in Algeria and <mark type="inaudible" /> in Egypt. So that are the main contributors for 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could maybe give a little bit more color on your forecast for production in 2011, where you're talking about a slight increase on a $70 Brent price.</p>
          <p>Now $70 Brent price looks pretty conservative, given what we're seeing on the screens at the moment. And I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit as to what slight means. Are we looking at sort of 1% to 2%? And where do you think that would be if, in fact, we see an average oil price nearer $80, $85? Anything more you can give on that that would be great. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Okay. So when we talk about slight increase, we talk about 1%, 1.2% in 2011 at our scenario. Our scenario is $70 per barrel.</p>
          <p>If we look at it at 100 &#x2013; let's talk about $100 per barrel, so the price of today &#x2013; is flat, because of the PSA price effect. And we have to consider, just to give more color to our production, that in 2010, we declared a flat production profile. And we increased 1.1%, 1.2% because we anticipated some intervention work-overs in wells, because of the higher price. So that is a reason that our growth in 2011 will be a 1.2%.</p>
