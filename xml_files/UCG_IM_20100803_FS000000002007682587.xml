          <p>Good afternoon. This is the Chorus Call conference operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the UniCredit Group Second Quarter 2010 Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alessandro Profumo, CEO of UniCredit Group. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Many thanks and good afternoon or good morning to everybody. So these are the second quarter results and clearly the first half as well. So shall we start from page four of the presentation, which is the executive summary? We had a 310 million net profit pre-goodwill impairment in the second quarter of '10. After goodwill impairment on Kazakhstan the result is 148 million. As you know, the goodwill impairment is not affecting clearly the capital base.</p>
          <p>Revenues quarter-on-quarter are down by 4.6% reflecting lower trading income, which are down from 560 to 58 million due to change in market conditions. But, what is quite good is a fact that net interest income is slightly up, thanks to the stability in the total assets and the liabilities you will see later on and the stabilization of <mark type="inaudible" />, and the net commissions are up for the fifth consecutive quarter year-on-year you will see are up by 17%, which is quite a good number. The costs are at 1.6 higher than the previous quarter, with staff expenses under strict control and growth of other expenses driven by ForEx and by cyclical items.</p>
          <p>The loan provisions are lower by 4.2% than the previous quarter, down to 1.716 million (sic) [1,716 million] and the cost of risk has been 122 bips, you will see the detail country-by-country in SpA data later on. The gross impaired loans are up by 5.9% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>The total assets are stable. The funded assets are still down by 1%. With loan growth starting to pick up in some areas, mainly CEE and CIB in Germany, we have a reduction in the Corporate Centre and we have a solid deposit trend.</p>
          <p>The structural ratio is well above 0.90, which is an internal limit, and you will see the trends we have on the liquidity side.</p>
          <p>Core Tier I is at 8.41, 4 bips lower than the previous quarter driven by the return to risk weighted asset growth mainly in Central Eastern Europe and more specifically in Turkey and in CIB, Germany and by the dividend accrual as you know as we've done in the first quarter, we are accruing the same dividend of the previous year.</p>
          <p>The results of the stress test on Tier 1, I'm always highlighting the fact that the Tier 1 is different country-by-country due to say differences we have in terms of total amount of hybrid capital we can have is 7.75 after the stress and 7.42 is the core Tier I, which again, we can give a very comfortable base if we consider the overall stress.</p>
          <p>I would like also to immediately to say that, on the stress test that, as you know, on the goal/focus was focus on the trading book. We have been, in our opinion, significantly heated by the fact that the conventionally, the trading book were considered with the duration of five years on a conventional basis for all the banks, while the duration of our portfolio is slightly above seven months. So clearly the cap is significantly higher than the one we should deserve with so short duration.</p>
          <p>Talking of net profit and going through the different lines; here we have the numbers for the second quarter, the quarter-on-quarter change and year-on-year change and then the first half with a similar comparison. As you can see, we are down 4.6 quarter-on-quarter in terms of revenue, 7.6 year-on-year, so if you consider the first expense, where is very important to say that net interest and net commission are both up quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>The costs are slightly up. As I said, the operating profit is down 12.8 quarter-on-quarter and semester-on-semester; year-on-year it's 18.3%. The net write-down are down by 4.2% quarter-on-quarter and 29.4% year-on-year on the quarter, while on the semester it's 14.1. Goodwill impairment, we didn't have goodwill impairment in the second quarter, in the first half of last year. So if we go down to the net income pre-PPA is 206 million, because we had a significantly high tax rate due to the goodwill mainly, so &#x2013; and which is down 64% quarter-on-quarter, semester-on-semester we are down 26.4%.</p>
          <p>Net income excluded goodwill is 310 million, as I said before, which is 40% down quarter-on-quarter, 36.7 year-on-year, while the semester is 11.3% down, if we compare year-on-year. The cost/income ratio is at 60.7% in the second quarter and 58.8% in the first half. Cost of risk is down both quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year and semester-on-semester of the two different years. So &#x2013; which we think is an important signal of the beginning of an improvement in terms of quality.</p>
          <p>Now we go to page six; page six is very important because the &#x2013; the stable revenues are at the highest level since the second quarter of last year, 2.6%. So we are seeing that the deterioration is finally ended and on the contrary, you will see that the numbers have start to improve.</p>
          <p>The operating expenses are up mainly by cyclical items, but we will see the comparison later on. The net write-downs are still going down on total asset at 0.72 bps.</p>
          <p>If we do see page seven; as I said, the net interest is up 1.5% quarter-on-quarter. The commissions are up 1.9%, but also, if we compare year-on-year, we are improving 17 point &#x2013; 17% exactly, which is very important. And the trading income are down much below the level of the first quarter '010 due to the low level of client activity and the fair value adjustments on credit exposure.</p>
          <p>The second quarter results reflect the changed sector condition in markets and dislocation across businesses that later on Sergio Ermotti can provide some comment. We had to say that the reduction is partially due to the market area more or less 300 million, while 172 million are related to the Corporate Centre, which is affected by the spread option on our shares and the &#x2013; which we had in a positive terms in the first quarter and the buyback of our own bonds affect the gain we have realized in the first quarter of '010.</p>
          <p>Net interest &#x2013; first important signal, the average 3M Euribor, which has been 0.66 in the first quarter on average, is 0.69 in the second quarter and today we are close to 0.85, if I remember correctly &#x2013; sorry is 0.89, so is growing, which is a very positive element because finally the compression, the significant compression we had in the markdown, is ended and now we are starting to see some improvement. Clearly, in the &#x2013; we had also a positive flow of deposits, so the loan to direct funding ratio is below 100, is 96.8%, which is also a very positive element in terms of contribution to the liquidity of the group.</p>
          <p>Page nine, net commissions. The net commission are slightly down for the piece which is coming from investment services. We have a decrease in fees from securities dealing, placement and other services. The third quarter &#x2013; sorry the second quarter has been, as we know, very volatile, so clearly the customer have been less proactive in terms of trading activities, so while the assets under management provided the growth of 2.7%, despite the decrease in life insurance, which usually are stronger in the first quarter of the year. Well these very positive are the other commissions and the commission from ForEx dealing the first line are up by 4.2%, the commission on ForEx are up by 15% quarter-on-quarter. This is very important because usually is a stronger sign of the positive cycle of the export-oriented customer base, which usually afterwards comes to an improvement of the performance of these customers as well in terms of bottom line and clearly in terms of cost of risk. So we think that this is an important signal of the improvement of the overall environment.</p>
          <p>Costs are moderately up in the second quarter driven partially by ForEx and partially by cyclical items. At constant ForEx, they would be up by 1% and up 1.6. The staff costs would be down by 0.1 at constant ForEx. The other expenses were &#x2013; we had marketing and advisory up by 40 million in the quarter. In marketing, there are advertising expenditure we have realized in second quarter on a new product, mortgage product which is important in order to reassess our brand and also the numbers you can see in the retail area in terms of new mortgage activity shows an importance of such kind of advertising so we had these expenses, but overall the other costs are under control.</p>
          <p>We continue to right-size our organization we went down by 521 people in the second quarter both in the business region with the usual contribution in the retail area, which is more than one half of this reduction but as well we had a reduction in GBS and Corporate Centre. So the overall organization is streamlining the structure. In this perspective, it's also important to say that, it has been approved as well this morning, the final stage of the One4C Project and tomorrow we start negotiation with Italian Worker Council in order to define the way in order to achieve the target we had in terms of staff reductions. So we are also moving forward in this perspective which is very important clearly in terms of future cost base and the project has been rapidly approved this morning since we had already done all the different necessary steps before.</p>
          <p>Loan loss provisions, so the downward trend continue. We are at 1.7 billion, clearly is not yet the level we would like to be, but we are seeing continuous improvement in the areas where we had the main improvements are retail and CIB. In the CEE division, we are significantly below the yearly rolling, rolling is slightly up because in the first quarter there has been also some write-back in different countries so in reality the first quarter is not very comparable. It's also quite important that the retail sector you remember in the first quarter had a peak, started to improve again and also as a flow of new watch list and restructuring in retail is going down.</p>
          <p>The total gross impaired loans are up by 5.9% with a very differentiated trend. In Poland, we are seeing a decline. In CEE, we have still growth in some specific countries. Germany is back to growth after a quarter &#x2013; quarter-on-quarter decrease in the first quarter. Then Italy is slowing down, but we are still an addition mainly in UniCredit Corporate Banking.</p>
          <p>The growth pays off gross impaired loans, the other gross impaired loans is going down, now we have a migration to the non-performing loan. This is the usual trend, which has been seen also in previous cycles. The coverage down is slightly down mainly due to a lower layer in Germany where we had change the impaired loan mix, we have an increase of the next stock value collateralized exposure and the reduction of impaired assets with a lower level of collateral same-store effective restructuring, then we had a small decreasing Bulgaria due to a different classification so 12 bps are due to Bulgaria of this decrease while in Germany, sorry in Italy we have an increase of the coverage ratio. The generic reserve <mark type="inaudible" /> representing 4.7% of gross impaired loans and 8.2 of the NPLs only.</p>
          <p>We have still a reduction of generalized cost of risk, a small growth, but still a significantly below the second, third and fourth quarter of last year in the new net addition usually in the first quarter which is feasible also in the first quarter '09. That is at slightly lower level, but again what is good for us is the 68 is significantly below 98, 88, 81, that we have seen in previous quarters. So hopefully we will continue to see this downwards trend for the new net additions.</p>
          <p>Non-operating items in the first quarter of '10, I think that is important to signal on the high tax rate 44.7%, which is impacted by Iraq and Italy and the impairment taking in on CapEx spend, 152 million which is due to the performance of the bank in the country. So overall, if we consider both element tax rate is above 55%.</p>
          <p>And the fracture, sorry, total asset are overall stable as you can see the assets excluding hedging instruments are likely down, which is an important element as hedging instruments run off due to the higher markets and currency volatility. The tangible equity is slightly down due to the accrual of the dividend, which sorry &#x2013; due to payment of the dividend sorry, which has been done in the second quarter. So the leverage ratio remains quite low, 22.3 times, so is a very comfortable position. Also, considering a potential eventual introduction as we know in 2018 of a leverage ratio in <mark type="inaudible" /> framework.</p>
          <p>The funding structure. The funding structure &#x2013; we had a small reduction in the customer loan only due to the Corporate Center. So this had a loan with the center counterpart and other entities which are a not significantly contributing, while we had a 3.7 billion growth in the business region, mainly as I said in CEE, Russia and Turkey and CIB. The customer deposits are going up by 6.5 billion and among business service we have a growth in CEE. Again, Turkey and Russia is really important because it means that the new loans are self-funded and there as well a growth in Corporate Center uses interbank clearing house.</p>
          <p>When we see the balance sheet, the balance sheet structure, as you can see is very well balanced structure in terms of asset liability, the structural liquidity ratio is 0.99. So significantly above that 0.90 we have in terms of all the internal limit. Clearly this is a demonstration of the fact that we don't have capital rate position, we had a cost in terms of net interest margin due to that we &#x2013; I mean, as in the past during the crisis to take by all of you a very conservative position that we continue to keep.</p>
          <p>So we're today panelized the potential positive impact of the capital interest rates should be quiet relevant, but again this is today relatively costly for us in terms of net interest margin.</p>
          <p>We have been able on top of retail bonds to issue 1.7 billion of covered bond in &#x2013; just shortly before the end of the quarter and the cost on average has been three month Euribor plus 48 bps which means that our placing capability had a very good price, is quite relevant.</p>
          <p>Finally capital base, we are still quite stronger as I said before both, before and past stress test. The risk weighted assets are slightly up due to the growth partly and due to Forex effect, but due to the growth in Central Eastern Europe and CIB Germany. So we think that we have a quite a comfortable position there to be able to continue to grow on the loan book as soon as the demand will pick up. As I said, we are starting to see some positive change and for instance in the best rating classes in Italy we are also gaining market share in a pretty significant way.</p>
          <p>This is the overall presentation. <mark type="inaudible" /> next the divisions and here as usual with the CFO, Marina Natale, the CRO, Karl Guha plus all the deputies: Sergio Ermotti, Roberto Nicastro, Paolo Fiorentino and the newly appointed Federico Ghizzoni. With all of them we should be happy to answer to any your question. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me this is the Chorus Call conference operator. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question is from Alessandro Roccati of Macquarie. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening every one. Three quick questions, the first one is on net interest income. I've seen an improvement at Group level, but if I go through the divisions, I actually see that Retail is down, Corporate down, CE is down and MIB is down. So I'm just wondering where the improvement is coming from whether it's from the Corporate Centre, if you can give us some guidance on this place.</p>
          <p>The second question is on impairments, you'd done 160 million <mark type="inaudible" /> Kazakhstan. Just wondering whether we can expect any improvements and any unwinding of the acquisitions in CE.</p>
          <p>And finally on the risk-weighted assets, they have decreased from 503 to 486 on a quarterly basis that's about a 4% decrease, just wondering where this decrease is coming from and what can we expect going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start from NII. I'm not sure that we are looking at the same figures since looking at NII at the business division we are after/alpha and the main driver and the main contributor is for sure CIB quarter-on-quarter plus Central Eastern Europe, while the contribution of the Corporate Centre is not positive, is negative mainly due to lower contribution of free funds in Germany due to lower rates. So I'm not again sure that we are referring to the same figures.</p>
          <p>About &#x2013; so in order to underline again positive contribution coming from CIB and from Central Eastern Europe, you're right retail doesn't contribute in a positive way but it's almost stable.</p>
          <p>On CEE and the Kazakhstan impairment, this is the side as you know has to be carried out on a regular basis and these during these quarter review, we, let's say, compared the carrying value versus the variable recoverable amount and the result that based on the projection, we have for our bank in Kazakhstan we have to impair this amount of 162 million, which doesn't mean that we are going to have a further impairment if we are able to meet the projection, which are implied in the plan. We are using for these are the size we are not going to impair anymore and these projections are we are confident that during the second half of the year, we would be able to achieve these result if the market remained stable and as it is.</p>
          <p>Risk-weighted assets again I'm a bit surprised about the comments on the risk-weighted assets, since risk-weighted assets total amount is up, but is up at the group level by 3.1 billion mainly 0.7% the business division are up 4.7 billion and the main driver again is Central Eastern Europe, where we are recording growth mainly in Turkey and Russia due to the new pick up of the loaners / loans are picking up again and so these generate a growth also on risk-weighted assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe that Federico want to make some comment on Kazakhstan freely of its own.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you ask about possible signal of improvement. I will touch couple of points, first of all about revenues. Revenues have been under pressure in the first half of this year, mostly for reduction of the accruals on restructured loans. On top obviously we don't accrue for longer dues over 90 days. And we have seen volumes not growing yet. So for the second half, first of all is good the fact that the GDP growth is <mark type="inaudible" /> is expected to reach &#x2013; I feel let's say the first half 8% so we have a confirmation that the economy is recovering. We are expecting growth in term of volumes. We start to see demand in term of project finance for infrastructure and the dues &#x2013; all the dues have been stabilized, actually in July there was a slight decrease, so for these reasons we think &#x2013; we think that the revenues should be better in the second half versus first half.</p>
          <p>In term of cost of risk even though is growing in the second quarter, what is positive is the fact that the write-downs are stable. Actually the second quarter has been better than first quarter. What we have been not able to match in the second quarter at being the right mix/base of that quite fluctuating. So in term of cost of risk, we think we have reached the level of stabilization. We are not expecting further deterioration, so all in all, we hope to see a second half better than the first half.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Giovanni Carriere of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi good afternoon, a couple of quick question. The first one I mean for me the main surprise was the &#x2013; the acceleration of the gross impaired loans versus last quarter and also the fact that additional new impaired loans also accelerated. Overall do you see this as just a, if you want, a one-off, or just a small reversal in the quarter, but then will you go back to previous levels or do you think that that there is something else going on?</p>
          <p>The other question that really if it's possible &#x2013; maybe to give any figures regarding the migration at the group level by division of watch list to NPLs, I mean is that number stable, going down, going up, I think because that's going to be very important to determine the provisions of the next few quarters? And the last one would be, just to be clear, have you restated the way you report Poland or is it just &#x2013; there is additional detail on the database? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I start from the last question. So it's a little technical one. Now &#x2013; we have now splitted the Poland figures, so Poland &#x2013; into the relevant division and we have recounted figures in order to make them comparable. So you should get the comparable figures in the database you are getting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to be clear -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so, no &#x2013; so to be clear, so when we look at retail, now that includes Poland and -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when we look at CIB that includes Poland.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, exactly, exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, it's a bit counterintuitive. You might want to give transparency to divisions that carry a higher multiple in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but we think it's proper to show the number as they are. We are &#x2013; as you know, there is also an accounting standard, which is asking to present the numbers in line with the way you manage the group. We have been always very transparent in the way we were presenting bonds. So the issue is &#x2013; you enter from the country and you move to the division or you enter from the division and you move to the country, at the end, the numbers have to be the same clearly. For us, it's important to give you the visibility on how things are proceeding in the market. I think that looking to raise / reign in risk weighted assets is relatively easy to understand what is &#x2013; the asset needs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Allow me only to add one comment for the sake of clarity. You will get also in the presentation on page 41, Poland, and in the database as a country, so also splitted in the previous pages into the relevant divisions, and you will get also in the database, the divisional database information for Poland. And tomorrow pico is going to issue their home press release and presentation. So I think that you would be able to capture all the relevant information about Poland from these sources.</p>

          <p>Right. You had two questions. The first question was the increase in gross impaired loan, the acceleration, which in itself is caused by three main factors, which has taken it higher relative to the previous quarter. The three main factors are Kazakhstan and Ukraine combined contributed to 1.3 billion, Germany, the CIB, the corporate portfolio, roughly about 1 billion or 1.1 billion and the corporate book in Italy about 0.5 billion. The German portfolio in and of itself are basically migration of certain highly collateralized portfolios that did actually move across to non-performing. So this is what caused that.</p>
          <p>But this is not endemic to the second question that you are asking, is it indicative of a &#x2013; is it a one-off or is it sort of indicative of a deteriorating trend? No, it's not indicative of a deteriorating trend. These are driven by two or three large names. So this is what has happened in Germany. Kazakhstan and Ukraine are slightly different picture. But the long and short of it is that when you look at the migration from performing to non-performing, that segment in itself, there has been an increase in terms of &#x2013; from bonus to the various categories within non-performing, there has been an increase.</p>
          <p>But the underlying trend that we are seeing is for the first time, there are definitive signs of improvement but these are not accounting numbers. But these are effectively risk numbers, which we look at, which I am not sure we disclose those, but if you look at the underlying trend in terms of expected loss, there are definitive improvements across all asset classes and also in a consolidated basis.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon to everyone. Just a couple of questions, first one is on the sharp change in the use of interbank. I think it's an increase of some &#x20AC;14 billion. I suspect this partly offset a decrease in the use of commercial paper. But I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color about that? And then secondly, looking at the retail division, the risk weighted assets movements, there is a &#x20AC;2.5 billion reduction in Italy in spite of flattish loans, and there is a &#x20AC;2 billion increase in Austria again with flattish volume. So I was wondering if you could just explain that. Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On interbank, so as you can see, there is no change in the deposit &#x2013; on the deposit side, which is growing only by 2.5 billion approximately, while we have a decrease on the asset side where we have a change in the amount of 11 billion approximately.</p>
          <p>This is due to the fact that during this quarter, we have, let's say, reduced the interbank activity by these amounts and these available funds &#x2013; liquidity are now available and being shift to finance the remaining net imbalance. The net imbalance is mainly due to the fact that we got lower deposit &#x2013; sorry, loan, 2.3 billion, going in the same direction, so creating new liquidity.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, we recorded a drop in &#x2013; due to customer and securitization by approximately 15 billion. And the main driver of this reduction has been the drop in CDCPs, as you pointed out. During this month, the U.S. market has dried. And so we've been forced to shift from CDCPs to different type of funding. And due to this, you see an increasing repo and the consequent reduction &#x2013; shifting from interbank towards other activities.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as risk-weighted asset, we have two relatively limited phenomenon in this quarter. On one side, we have, in Austria, an increase of the AAV, as a result of the movement in the Swiss franc, you know that we have a Swiss franc mortgage portfolio in Austria and so the evolution of the exchange rate has generated an increase of approximately &#x20AC;1 billion risk-weighted asset in Austria.</p>
          <p>In Italy, on the opposite side, we had instead the positive effect in the sales of reduction in the risk-weighted assets coming from the extension on the former Capitalia banks, of the AMA approach on operational risk that is allowing an improvement also in the range of &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. A question on fiscal matters, the taxes were pretty high also this quarter. My question is if that include some provision, let's call this way, on a potential bank levy in some of the countries? We have seen one of your competitor doing something like that on its Hungarian operations and what is your view for the rest of the year, in terms of taxation, given the discussion from a lot of government somehow to get some money back from the banking system?</p>
          <p>My second question, you make a comment that tomorrow you will start negotiations with trade unions, as far as the Italia reorganization is concerned. My understanding was that there should not be a lot of changes in terms of head count because of these reorganization, but was more a project to do with the service to your customer and obviously a streamlining of operation at headquarter level. Is there anything you can say to us to help understanding what could be the overall income impact, sorry &#x2013; in the medium-term, on the cost side from this project?</p>
          <p>The last question regards the cost of risk. If I understood correctly, you were saying that the decline we have seen in the second quarter, at 122 bips, is not only a consequence of a progressive decline we have seen already over the past few quarters, but you expect that to continue in the coming quarters. Is that correct, I understood correctly? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On tax, the 44.7%, which is the group tax rate ex-goodwill. So without taking into account good, which is not relevant for tax basis, is mainly driven by Italy, where we cannot say that- we cannot take into account the loan loss provision, while if we look at the other region, we have &#x2013; say, a variety of tax rate, but all in the range between, let's, say the highest is H woodee with 36.8% in Central Eastern Europe, we have approximately 22%, asset management, 27% et cetera.</p>
          <p>So the main part of this impact comes from Italy due to the Europe component. You were asking about new levies. No, we are not embedding in the second quarter result, any new levy, as you know there are ongoing discussion in several country, the more advanced in this discussion is Hungary, where we have also approximately an indication and we know that it might be almost 30 million...</p>

          <p>But still, let's say, we need to refine these figures and also for Germany, UK, there is a discussion ongoing, but no decision taken and it's difficult for the time being to perform an analysis on this.</p>

          <p>While Hungary will affect 2010. On the other account, this will be next year. On the &#x2013; then the accounting benefit of the organization, as we've said, the key focus is on customer services and we have to say that also seeing the numbers in terms of customer satisfaction, we continue to go up quite significantly even in July, both in retail and corporate. So we have a significant improvement. In retail we are also gaining market share on the deposit side, thanks to this activity.</p>
          <p>Clearly, as we have explained in the past, that we have a reorganization of the overall service model. For instance, we'll have more automized branches and less branches with the full service range, we are de-layering the network in order to become closer to the customer. So all these activities are also reducing the structure of the bank, we can assume a recurring benefit in the range of &#x20AC;300 million. Clearly not immediately, because there is a phasing of reorganization. Now the cost of risk, Karl will...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the cost of risk, 122 basis points, I think that's the average and so if you look at the picture it's actually varied and mixed. You're asking for a bit of a forecast in terms of what we can expect. And I think we are &#x2013; as I told you, the expected loss numbers are definitely on the trend, that is an improving trend and we hope that that will continue for the remainder of the year. We do not see any specific signs of that trend that would lead to a deterioration at this point in time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if it's what we have seen already in the second quarter means, you see positive sign in Germany, a little bit less than in Italy maybe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean as you know that &#x2013; I think if you take a slightly granular approach and look at Germany, Germany had I think the positive outcome on the back of the economic recovery will continue. I do expect Austria to be stable and improving, see my colleague Federico Ghizzoni already referred to that, that he does expect that to be &#x2013; the worst is behind us, so hopefully, we'll continue that way. Italy still remains challenging, particularly in the corporate book. I mean I think, if you look at the growth numbers in Italy overall in terms of GDP, this has a very large impact in terms of &#x2013; particularly in this &#x2013; in the very small and SMB sectors of the economy and therefore the companies.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just two question. One on cost, excluding the organization benefit from next year, I remember after Q1, you said that basically your budget for the year was having cost flat and having some loan expansion and revenue expansion. Now look at the numbers clearly the <mark type="inaudible" /> has been tough with flattish volumes, revenue are up only 3% versus the second half, even excluding trading, but costs are still up 2%. So do you think we should expect some recovery in the second half for a more aggressive strategy on costs?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on provision, very clear your math have drawn expected losses improvement and the trend for the second half. Should we assume that anyway, despite the improvement in expected loss provision remain high as the bank we have revealed some of the coverage compared to pre-crisis level both on MPL and watchlist? And third point, more in general, clearly one of the concern of the market on UniCredit, then in general on the Italian bank, is below peers profitability, even excluding the one-off this quarter, clearly we are still on low single-digit ROE.</p>
          <p>It's very clear the potential upside on the top line if rates move up and when provision normalize, but it seems these two things that in the current market will not materialize anytime soon. So do you think that means the profitability will remain below peers for a relatively long period of time, or you think there is some actions that you have, or some flexibility to improve this situation? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before leaving the floor to Paolo Fiorentino and to Rino Piazzolla, in order to talk of the other costs and of HR costs, we do have a view quite inline with what you were expressing. So clearly the cost of risk for us in Italy is higher than our peer group, mainly in the corporate side. So we do expect that, for a certain period of time, with our European comparable peers, we will remain below the target in terms of profitability.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we don't have a view that interest rates will go up in the short-term and we don't have other areas being &#x2013; having been incredibly conservative in terms of risk profile, where we can have significant profit coming from positions because, as I said, we don't have carry-trade and the market activity is only customer driven.</p>
          <p>What we're seeing on the very positive side that clearly the volatility is pretty low, in terms of results, because the net interest margin is quite solid and the commissions are quite solid as well.</p>
          <p>So we are clearly on the trend we want to be. So we are not disappointed by these numbers. So clearly, we have to continue to work in order to leverage on the types of the commercial activities proceeding pretty well when we're seeing the sales activity. We continue to increase our market penetration, for instance with CAD in Central Eastern Europe, which also is quite important. And we are sure that this activity will pay. Paolo for cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On cost, then we have a flat situation, because if we look at the first quarter numbers, we have a cost on ForEx, an increase of 1%, on daily basis we have 0.5. And as Alessandro said before, we have also some cyclical costs in terms of other mutual cost. Quarter-on-quarter being the HR cost may be flat. Those costs are mainly the advertising and marketing cost in which we had, vis-&#xE0;-vis the first quarter, 20 million more plus than in the first quarter and also we had a one-off impact on some legal expenses in the range of 12 million, that also is impacting the trend in the second quarter. So, generally speaking, flat cost under control and as I said before, cyclical cost. On staff costs, I don't know if Rino would like to add something, but we have flat vis-&#xE0;-vis the first quarter and in line with our expectation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one clarification on cost. I was referring basically the <mark type="inaudible" /> cost base for first quarter and second quarter compared to the previous year, but &#x2013; and we are slightly up. Last year also in Q4, you had the benefit on the reversal of the variable compensation. So if this is the trend you are happy with and you will not have this benefit in the second half of this year, so the cost line will end up higher than previous year. Is that correct, or I'm reading wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so the cost line is expected to be higher than the previous year. You have to remember that last year, we went down by 8% year-on-year. And as you can imagine, it's a quite &#x2013; it's been quite a significant change. So the fact that, despite of the fact that we are starting to invest again in some area, because clearly you have also to consider not to lose, for instance, brand recognition since the market is restarting to move positively. And again considering the cut we had last year, we think that we are doing what we have to do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three questions please. The first is on asset quality again. Looking at slide 15, which you always pointed us to, was the connection between net addition rates and impaired loans and loan loss charges. I just wondered is there a certain element of seasonality that the addition rate in the first quarter is always slightly lower, so the trend was not misleading, but there was a &#x2013; it was almost &#x2013; it was seasonally lower. So we shouldn't get concerned that addition rate increased again and read forward from it. And then also in terms of the coverage, could we &#x2013; your comments about asset quality, do they assume that the coverage could further come down, or should it stay at the current level?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on interbank funding, I'm not quite sure why I should not be concerned that your net interbank funding has increased and, I mean you talk at the beginning of the year that for the year you expect wholesale funding costs to be down versus 2009, is this still the case?</p>
          <p>And lastly, on net interest income in the CIB Division, is most of the increased quarter-on-quarter due to market-related revenues? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Karl will start with the comments on asset quality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to your first question, which is the impaired loans and the growth and is it a seasonal pattern, no, I wouldn't say that's a seasonal pattern, but I think it's certainly affected, as I said earlier, by 3 specific cases; if you adjust for those specific cases, it is &#x2013; it's a fairly normalized trend. So, not seasonality per se, but I think most of these things, we should not look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis because most of these are sort of through the cycle moves, and a typical cycle is about 7 years, 3.5 of up and 3.5 of down. So that's how you should look at it, so seasonality is not really so much of an issue in the migration.</p>
          <p>In terms of the coverage ratio, the overall coverage ratio has deteriorated by roughly 130 basis points. Again, in this particular case, there were 3 dominant factors, I would say. The biggest chunk of it comes from CIB in Germany, it's about 62 basis points. It involves two single names, which have actually moved across from non-performing to performing, so therefore releasing the provisions, which has had an impact on the level of provisions. But it has also affected the coverage ratio; this is the biggest mover in the overall &#x2013; so this is &#x2013; 62 is the net, but if you look at the gross impact, it was 99 basis points.</p>
          <p>And because of an internal evaluation adjustment in terms of the rating, in Bulgaria it was 12 basis point and Kazakhstan is 23 basis point due to an increase in the class we call incagli, where in general provision is of course, lower but this was a specific impact. So, adjusted for these 3 specific things that have happened this quarter, in particular the movement from performing &#x2013; sorry, from non-performing to performing, the coverage ratio is stable and in terms of going forward, we expect it to be stable.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on interbank, your question is why we shouldn't be worried about the fact that there's an increase in net interbank; the point I made before was that, if you look at the liability side, that we are not borrowing more in the market on the interbank market, due to the fact that the delta is minimal while it's &#x2013; we have to recognize that, for a certain period of time, the U.S. money market was less accessible for all European banks but also we face these market condition, in the meanwhile, our situation overall didn't deteriorate and we &#x2013; the Group managed to answer with no trouble to our own funding needs. So I think that there are no signal or element of worry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's also important to say that we repaid that completely, the small exposure we had with the ECB.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We are not anymore in ECB, so only for technical issue, because we &#x2013; at the end of June, there was a 4.5 billion of the refinancing operation and in July, the outstanding has been close to zero.</p>

          <p>And secondly, your loans at a Group level have contracted again 3% this quarter, and they've contracted consistently every quarter for the past 2 years. What's your strategy for growth at a Group level? And at what points can we see stabilization in your Group loans and see growth there? And obviously it's a concern of mine because contraction in the loan book would obviously put pressure on your net interest income?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>About the Forex effect on our NII, you're right, there is a contribution due to the development of the exchange rates and the contribution is in the north of 10 million, which is a limited impact but relevant to the overall delta quarter-on-quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The CEE Division overall is up by 38 million, so 10 million of which are related to Forex effect, the 28 are due to the improved business, so is a minority of that. Is also &#x2013; on loan as we said, we went down in the Corporate Center by 8.8 billion and we went up in the business area by 3.7 billion. So overall is a good number. It's not over exciting but &#x2013; and mainly the growth is coming from CEE where we have 2.7 billion, and 1 billion is coming from &#x2013; 1.1 billion is coming from CIB, Corporate and Investment Banking. Retail is flat, so.</p>
          <p>In terms of strategy I have to say that we still have a portion of our own book, which is negative in terms of AVA, so not necessarily we go up in terms of AVA what &#x2013; sorry, in terms of total number, what is important for us is to continue to improve revenues on risk weighted asset. So this a key element that clearly &#x2013; the market side is creating some volatility in that. But F&amp;A in the corporate division to date, where the revenues on risk weighted asset, which is 3%, which for F&amp;A is an excellent number, due to two elements; an improvement in terms of contribution on one side, but also an improvement in terms of loan to risk weighted assets, which are down to 75% while we were at 77 two quarters ago.</p>
          <p>So again the strategy is to be incredibly focused on contribution loan and to look for growth where there is a positive contribution. For instance, CIB in Italy is slightly up, but &#x2013; sorry slightly down quarter-on-quarter '04. But when we do see the rating classes, one, two, three, four, which are the best in class rating classes for us, we gain significantly market share in the market while we are reducing in the worst rating classes, improving significantly the overall contribution of the portfolio.</p>

          <p>The next question is from <mark type="inaudible" />. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good evening. I have three questions. The first regarding provisions, the second on loan demand and the third on Basel 3. It's been quite clear from this call that you expect an improvement in provisions. My question was regarding the shape of it. And therefore in the past, they have been used after crises and having a sharp improvement of provisions due to write-backs. Is this is going to be a scenario in your view, or do you expect a milder improvement in provisions? Secondly, on loan demand, if you could comment on the dynamics that you have for new loans by segment and geography? And finally on Basel 3, the amendments that have been published recently seem to penalize in the relative terms, safer banks and less levered banks. And do you think this could have a long-term impact on your strategy, i.e. I see an incentive from the regulator to taking risk, almost? If you can comment on that, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Before leaving the floor to the colleagues of the business side in order to comment on loan demand. We don't expect a sharp improvement in the provisioning level, because as we have seen a huge portion of the cost of risk is related to medium and small corporate in Italy, where clearly the level of write-backs is expected to be lower than the one we have seen in previous cycles. In previous cycles, namely in Italy to which you are referring to, there were large corporations with significant difficulties. So we remember <mark type="inaudible" /> or others.</p>
          <p>Now the case is completely different. As we have seen in Germany and this is the reason we why we had also the reduction in the coverage ratio in Germany, we had write backs and also a position which went back to performing. So we are creating this change in the coverage ratio. So we do expect that we can have a sense in some good improvement. And you remember, quite a good quality in the CIB in the first and second quarter in Germany due to write backs. But again, it is a mixed factor.</p>
          <p>In Central Eastern Europe, we can add in some countries and write backs, because &#x2013; but it is something which is clearly under negotiation today, so. And since also the judiciary system is less strong than what we are seeing in Western Europe for the time being we are provisioned. And we will hopefully have the write backs.</p>
          <p>Now I'll give the floor to Roberto, Sergio, and Federico in order to comment on the loan demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are starting to see some increase in the loan demand. And this is the first quarter of the last seven, I would say, where we're seeing a slight but a positive increase in the stock of retail loans as a result of different trends, generally speaking.</p>
          <p>Mortgage, we are seeing everywhere a good growth. It has been an especially good quarter in Italy where the 1.3 billion of new close of mortgage, which is by far the highest quarter of the last two years. And still &#x2013; which is quite relevant &#x2013; we've a good customer spread and since these new loans have been booked at 1.4%. Also, what we are seeing terms of demand in these weeks still points towards a buoyant or clear buoyant recovery.</p>
          <p>Also in Germany for the first time, we're seeing a little bit of growth in new flows of mortgage.</p>
          <p>In consumer finance, we have seen growth mainly in Italy and in Poland. In Poland, especially we had quite a good second quarter. And in Italy, we have now a 10% market share in new flows that are well placed to become the number two player in terms of new consumer loans flows.</p>
          <p>Instead, we have not seen yet a very strong &#x2013; very positive dynamics in small business; where, with the notable exceptional Poland that also had the very good second quarter in small business growth, I would say that in Italy, Austria and Germany, the demand remains not so exciting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. For Central and Eastern Europe, we have seen good dynamics in the second quarter. The overall increase in term of loans at constant rate is 2.7%, with some of the key countries for us particularly positive.</p>
          <p>Turkey is growing quarter-on-quarter more than 10%. Russia close to five. Romania, same. Also Hungary and so far. And so all countries except Kazakhstan and Ukraine, which are slightly decreasing quarter-on-quarter, all the other countries are increasing.</p>
          <p>Mostly corporate business, the only country where we see retail picking up is in Turkey. Turkey both small business and individuals are growing. So the trend there seems to be overall positive. The first quarter we see an increase, year increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For CIB, I think that as reported before, there is a delta increase of around 1 billion is that basically all due to Germany. When looking at the rest of the countries in Western Europe, I would say the demand is still quite fragile both in terms of volume and quality still remain high rating class of clients are piling up rather cashed in making investments. So I would say that overall there is a one-off, I would say, development in the quarter in Germany but it's too early to say if this is likely to continue or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, talking of Basel III, I have a slightly different view than the one you had, in the sense that as we know the investment banks will be affected by CRB, the CRB 3, so the new directives, while the decision has been taken by the Basel Committee, which is, I think in my opinion, a very sound decision, is based on the consultation process they had. And as you know there has been a significant change from the acting point of the consultation process because in reality the mistake has been the fact that somebody took the very open framework, which was presented by the Basel Committee as a base, while clearly the Basel Committee sent out an open framework saying now we'll start with the consultation process and with the quantitative in depth study in order to define a first level of calibration. Now they have that first level of calibration and they have significantly reduced the impact on financial holdings and the Fairfax asset which is quite a good news for many different banks, mainly &#x2013; clearly the Fairfax assets are important as well not only for the Italian banks since as you know we cannot deduct the provisions from the current results. So, in other words, we pay taxes on provisions and we recover in 18 years for the 70%. So I think that this will not change our risk appetite on the contrary.</p>
          <p>The Board in this case defines risk appetite, so clearly there is this &#x2013; on this area, we are pretty conservative as we said before. In the meanwhile there will be further calibration by the Basel Committee so I think that at the end the outcome is positive. It's also good that they have decided to study furthermore the next stable funding ratio because the way the previous fund was built was creating some not understandable effect. There, for instance all the banks should be forced to fund a piece of short-term loan with medium long-term funding, which is a reverse on maturity transformation. But &#x2013; so at the end I think that the work done by the Basel Committee has been quite good.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, good afternoon everybody. My question has been partially asked before but my question is what has been in previous quarters to any fair returns. The low returns that we have seen and how quickly we can get out of them. But I would like to focus the question looking at the period that the lengths of the period in which Unicredit seems to be showing them substantially below returns or return substantially below the main peers. ROEs and returns on risk weighted assets remain very, very low even if we exclude the goodwill amortization, return on risk weighted assets is 0.1%, which is a fraction of the average. The same with ROEs, very low single digit, obviously this also in line with your own economic value-added figures, which have been negative for really two years, once again from a different angle showing that for a long period of time you have not matching the cost of equity. So, I mean, we all know the impact from very low interest rates and we know that's very negative for your business model, that's a fact of life. But my question would be, given that it's already nearly two years where these returns have been so low, don't you think &#x2013; don't you have the impression and this is what I'm looking at &#x2013; what I'm looking for from you is more of philosophical answer rather than a specific and numerical answer.</p>
          <p>Don't you think that when you clearly be suffering much more or for much longer, the impact from the low interest rates period, I mean if I look at most of your competitors they have struggled obviously for getting the ones that lost the reserves with sub-prime et cetera. Most of your banks &#x2013; most of the banks that are comparable to you, they have struggled for one quarter, for two quarters, for three quarters and then they have recovered very decent level, saw profitability with <mark type="inaudible" /> was going to one or 1.5 et cetera, but you stay well below and just stay well below for quite a long time, so obviously this is not only a low interest rates case, I think it has more to do with your business model, with a split of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>So, don't you think that it &#x2013; the period in which returns has a <mark type="inaudible" /> too long. And what would you change, what do you think you have to change in your group to make sure that this trend is not going to continue in incoming cycles? You answered into the previous question that you wanted to grow in CEE, but obviously I think given the size of Eurobank, growing in CEE and increasing the risk profile cannot be the only answer to improve returns. So what do you think you need to change in your group to improve returns going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I do agree with a piece of your question and I strongly disagree with another piece of your question. So starting from the piece I do agree, it is clear that we do have a lower return on assets and return on equity. And then in our piece as I've said before this is partially due to the business model, which I don't think that we have to change because for instance the fact that we have a strong franchise in our relation with the customer is, in my opinion, a key strength as Roberto has partially presented in Vienna <mark type="inaudible" /> and the numbers is showing, we are dramatically changing, they've said <mark type="inaudible" /> customers, so because if we do see the number of transaction, we're moving from <mark type="inaudible" /> to other channels as the number of branches.</p>
          <p>We've closed in Italy, we've closed more than 600 branches in one year and now the number of branches we have redesigned closing down, the cash services and so on. We are dramatically changing the service models so in this perspective, there is a huge change of business model that clearly this will require time in order to pay and mainly at different interest rates environment. For many other banks when we're seeing the numbers, so they are not performing better than us in terms of revenues. They are performing better than us in terms of cost of risk because this is a clearly &#x2013; this is something that we cannot change.</p>
          <p>We have to be very open and honest that we're entering <mark type="inaudible" /> with deals that have and at last our loan portfolio and we are not or have been heavily affected by the cycle and values, so we are managing this element but when we have seen the performance in terms of commercial activity, we are doing quite well. So what I disagree is the fact that we have to change the business model in the sense that I'm fully convinced that to be a stronger commercial bank with a strong knowledge of your &#x2013; of our customer base both on retail and on corporate side with the CIB structure but many players who are showing numbers better than us are replicating as you were saying so and I'm fully convinced that this part of the business model is quite good.</p>
          <p>We have to continue to work on the cost side as we are working <mark type="inaudible" /> to this weekend, we have done the migration of the IT platform in Germany, for instance which is quite important in terms of further integration and cost reduction. So we have to continue to work on that and we have to change significantly as I said before the service model to the customer. One for CEE and the redesign of the network the branch model Roberto is realizing in other countries, I think is quite important. I don't see major changes in terms of geographies or weight of the different strategic business areas.</p>
          <p>We think that as we said we have to increase the capital allocated to central-eastern Europe, is a short-term exercise, no it's not but as we have seen also from the cost of equity which went down more than for the other players is quite an important effect, so because the market is appreciating this clear trend of de-risking of the bank. Sorry, if you do see the total securities portfolio some of our competitors clearly they have a significant position in bonds. We have <mark type="inaudible" /> not in taking this in position maybe, but is a decision we have taken in the past and due to the few at the time on an interest rates and also because we have to remember that two years ago all of you &#x2013; less than two years ago, to be honest all of you were pricing asset in order to de-risk and unfortunately maybe we are not flexible enough because we tend to be very consistent.</p>
          <p>So we have de-risked the balance sheet. So overall I do agree with you that we have a return which is lower than our competitors mainly due to the cost of risk as I said before. In terms of change of business model, we are mainly focused on redesigning the retail networks and in leveraging on CIB across the board. We are sure that this strategy will pay and that will be a gain during the time performing in line with our peers.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess that every CEO, every Board of Directors when you create targets to exceed, not only match but I guess substantially exceed the cost of equity on average across the cycle. After having generated very low other earnings for a couple of years and maybe slightly more in order to catch up with that, in order to generate average returns across the cycle of substantially more than 10% I would say, do we need at some point in the next two to four years to regenerate our earnings that should be around 20%, because if not the average will not match the cost of equity across the cycle. Do you think I mean, do you say &#x2013; that you're happy with your current business model? Do you think that your current business model is capable of generating resources 20% in two to four years' time?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>20 &#x2013; first of all, if you are talking about return on tangible equity <mark type="inaudible" />. Because if you talk our return on intangible equity, I think that in the medium term, we can be not to far from that, quite clearly the tax rate is affecting us quite a lot, because you have to consider also this element, but again on tangible equity I think that in the medium then close more to the four year than to the two years I think <mark type="inaudible" /> is conceivable.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Apologies, because we <mark type="inaudible" /> some technical problems. It's a very simple question on the trading line and what could we expect in the third quarter. Saying it differently, how much of the negative effects will be dramatically reversed next quarter by the performance of the market, and we could see substantially much higher level of trading profits that we saw in the first quarter for example.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the question is rather difficult to respond if you just look at the volatility we had in the first six months of the year, months-by-months, one should be very careful about making projections. One thing is pretty clear is that, June was already well above average compared to April and May. And July is also giving a strong sign of recovery, clearly not in line with the first quarter or the best quarter of last year but more solid and more stable environment. So &#x2013; but again, it's only one month out of three and it's too early to judge and we're also entering into seasonality, that usually is not very exciting. Having said that, last year was a pretty good quarter, the third quarter, but it's difficult to predict.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I actually had the same question that was just asked, and then another one. I'm going to reformulate it differently though. Is it possible to isolate from the trading income that you booked in Q2, the impact of two items, the first one is the negative mark-to-market on the Italian Government bonds that you hold in your trading portfolio and the second one is the amount of extraordinary impact, I understand, was in the corporate center and it wasn't clear to me, what that related to.</p>
          <p>The second question, it's just &#x2013; if you could give us a breakdown. I know you don't usually provide it, but it would be extremely helpful to give some clarity on the 230 basis points cost of risk in the Italian corporate book, which was actually higher than what you booked in 2009, which I think it was 199 basis points. Is it possible to add the split of write-backs and provisions, because that would allow us at least to make some sensible estimates on the basis of your comments that write-backs are probably not going to be particularly exiting going forward, but at the same time at least you are not seeing anymore additional deterioration in the probability of default on the Italian loan book. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On, allow me to start from the &#x2013; the easiest point which is one related to the impact and the trading income line about corporate center, there is a drop quarter-on-quarter of 145 million mainly due to two elements. One is the cost spread on our shares which is a derivative and thus have an impact on <mark type="inaudible" /> market and amounted to 45 million drop and there is also an impact due to the fact that while in this first quarter we managed to buy out &#x2013; buy back sorry, our own bonds realizing almost 100 million of positive impact in the second quarter, the amount was only 25 million and as a result there is a drop approximately of 65 million. So these two elements combined plus given this has contributed to these change &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> of 145 million in the corporate center, while about mark-to-market, Ongovis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually the performance in markets was mainly &#x2013; was mainly reflected in the slowdown in equities. If you look at rates and credit rating, first of all was a positive result, and for sure also due to the fact that in those books we had a very, very short duration and I think that there is no elements of negative, the mark-to-market affecting the overall results, but is rather a slowdown. So clearly still positive numbers, but lower quarter-on-quarter.</p>

          <p>I'm looking at slide 28, your mortgage front book in Italy. And I was just wondering, can you share where that competitive dynamics behind the decline of the spread in the past three or four quarters. And what is the level that you see going forward for &#x2013; in terms of commercial spread that will be my first one? And then, I just wanted an update on your leverage buyout portfolios and how big they are right now and whether they are still performing as they were three or four quarters ago. I missing a slide that I use to see in your presentations in the past? And finally, I don't know whether Mr. Ermotti can help me with that, but has there being a significant employee turnover in the markets division that's more out of curiosity really? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, As far as the spread, what you see here is an index number not clearly is not that they it's what you have in second quarter obtained is 83% of the average commercial spread that we had 12 months ago. <mark type="inaudible" /> in reality the precise number been 136 mid-term. The driver of this is simply the fact that we had, as you can see in the same slide a very, very significant increase in volume. You have a production that in this movement is 3.5 times, what you had effectively for instance being the third/fourth quarter of '09 when you had the peak in terms of volume &#x2013; of new mortgage production. Quite clearly, the situation is quite different from what it was nine, ten months ago. Funding cost are now lower, the &#x2013; also outlook in terms of cost of <mark type="inaudible" />. So we decided to be once again more aggressive, reentering the mortgage market. And we are happy to now book mortgages after a 136 basis point of average commercial spread to which we can have the revenues arising from the sale of the CPI insurance products on the mortgage with a cross selling with current account to produce right now and overall a positive spread, and positive AMIA. Something that we did not have despite the best of commercial spread only 12 months ago when the funding cost for each new mortgage were such that each new mortgage was effectively booked with a negative interest margin. So with now market improved &#x2013; market condition we're quite happy to be more aggressive in terms of volumes and in terms of pricing.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in terms of LBO portfolio, the size is basically the same as reported in the past and you remember that it was only a couple of position that's were fairly large in respect of the portfolio, Alliance Boots and Valentino. Valentino has been restructured and successfully, so we feel pretty comfortable about that position has been widely reported by &#x2013; in medias and also in analyst circle. And Alliance Boots is also performing extremely well. Therefore, the rest of a portfolio is spread around 150 different position. So it's absolutely, we feel absolutely comfortable and as you saw also in the credit, the cost of credits reflected under the German segments, we had write backs. So I think that's &#x2013; this is an issue that is close in terms of risk and attention, but of course our colleagues in IRR are more than happy to give you any details if you need it. Then you had a second question but it was not clear, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I was basically wondering whether you could share, maybe the last three or four quarters, if you have been regarding employee turnover in the markets business, which is now part of CIB, is a very detailed question if you <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I would say that's clearly the slowdown in revenues is reflecting the risk of version across the Board by our retail and private clients, any situation of clients. So the employees &#x2013; sorry, sorry, sorry, I missed that. Well we had a little bit of use &#x2013; turnover, I think that we lost some people. We have been able to recruit back some people, it is clear that the competitive &#x2013; the competition for people is still a quite high, difficult to understand, also given the dynamics in the market. But &#x2013; the good news is that yes, we are &#x2013; we have been loosing some people, but we are also able to attract and return other people. So overall the situation that is under control.</p>

          <p>Sorry, but an answer has to be given to Andrea Vercellone (101:35) on Corporate Italian and cost of risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a gentleman from CS who asked the question about cost of risk about Corporate Italy. Corporate Italy, the &#x2013; of the CIB division, overall provision of 805 million for the quarter, Italy accounts for roughly on net, okay, so net provision of 805, Italy accounts for roughly 606 million. In this, the actual write-back component for chip overall is 986, almost a billion. In Italy, this number is very, very limited.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon, three very quick questions. The first one is on AII, if you can please quantify what has been the calendar effect. If I understand properly compared to first quarter, there'd have been a couple of days more. Second question on cost, if I'm not wrong, you gave not really a guidance but a hint at the beginning of the year about how cost were actually going to develop in 2010, if I'm not wrong, it was around 2%. So net of Forex, we're seeing cost up 1%. So my question is did you actually take some action in order to contain cost and that guidance provided at the beginning of the year is somehow too conservative at this stage? My last question is on available for sale, specifically on what the Bank of Italy introduced, if I'm not wrong, a month ago. Actually, Bank of Italy allowed banks to opt for basically a freezing of the government bonds accounted as available for sale. So if you can please just specify what is your situation on such an issue? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On contribution in &#x2013; of one calendar day is approximately the north of 30 million, and is one day. You were asking the second question was in relation to FS effect. I think that Paolo has already pointed out, let say, the action now we have undertaken in order to be able to keep under control the cost and developments in the second half of the year, and I think that there is nothing to be added there.</p>
          <p>And about a &#x2013; the service of Bank of Italy, it's not freezing of Bank of Italy, we &#x2013; the Bank of Italy regulation used to have a filter not applied in all the other European countries. So, and we have been allowed to take out this filter and not to have the deduction of the FS, approximately, say, 400 million starting from the second quarter 2010. So it's a positive impact, but which was due to a more prudent regulation of Bank of Italy to versus &#x2013; not on the capital, yes, of this court &#x2013; on the &#x2013; our capital base.</p>

          <p>The regulatory capital, not the capital, the regulatory capital and in this way we are aligned- sorry, we are partially aligned because this is applied only to EU Government bonds, to what is applied in our nine other countries out of 17 in the Euro area. And so France, Germany, U.K., U.K. is not in the euro area, we are already applying this rule. This is very, very important because it's not a matter of gaining something; it is a matter of being aligned to the others.</p>
