          <p>Good day and welcome to the Atlas Copco Q3 Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to your host today, Mr. Hans Ola Meyer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and a very warm welcome to everybody on the line. We're going to spend an hour on the Atlas Copco's third quarter report 2009 and we will do it in the usual format. So without further ado, I will hand over the word to Ronnie Leten, who is here with me. And he'll take us through his comments, and then we'll take the Q&amp;A's after that. So please, Ronnie, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Hans Ola, and good morning, good afternoon to everybody. I would follow the handout that I guess you have in front of you, and will -- time to time will refer to the slides, so that at least we're talking the same slides.</p>
          <p>Let me then start immediately with slide number three, we call the highlights. While it says the overall demand remains stable at low level for equipment and as we already said during our call in -- last call &#x2013; the last call quarter two, we are looking for some positive signs. And may be some positive possible development is to be seen in the emerging markets like China and India.</p>
          <p>The activity within mining does not materialize really in real orders, although we can say the commodity prices have improved on a good level. So, I'm rather confident for the future on this, but okay, when, we will see. The right spot for the quarter as also before is again is our aftermarket business. It's holding up pretty well and this is very positive.</p>
          <p>We continued to adapt our capacity and our organization and also here the momentum of adaptation is in the organization. And this also has resulted in healthy profitability level of 15.9%. But I should also say that this healthy profit is coming also from a positive effect of the sales mix.</p>
          <p>The reduction of inventory was significant and we have done the same on the receivables side, so also a very good cash flow from operations. We can look forward to a quite solid cash position within the end of the year; I will a bit elaborate later on the cash flow later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Let's now go to slide number four, more figures, order intake decline 30%. We can also say, and that's maybe some highlight also, that the sales prices are holding up pretty well. We have pressure, there is no doubt, but we have managed reasonably level. And also in the aftermarket we have also kept the prices.</p>
          <p>Our profit is slightly helped this quarter by the currency, much less than in the previous quarter. And if we then look to the last line SEK4.3 billion of cash flow, I think that is a very good achievement.</p>
          <p>Let's now go to slide number six, the world map, you can see that geographical spread is all of declines, so no pluses. We should of course not forget we are comparing with, again, with a strong quarter three from last year, so that helps of course -- it does not help the comparison.</p>
          <p>Let me then go to slide number seven, the Americas, we have not seen any highlight in North America. But on the other hand, we must maybe admit that we don't see further deterioration either. So, that is maybe a good point. Prices are staying, service work keeping up. So, that is maybe the positive point in North America.</p>
          <p>Then if we take South America, mining activities are better. Brazil, Peru, and Chile are doing reasonable. And here the activity has increased and I'm rather positive for the outlook when it comes to Brazil and that in overall of Brazil business.</p>
          <p>Turning then to the slide, Europe, Africa, slide number eight. Europe, soft trend, I think it's still very weak there. Especially, Russia is extremely weak. We see some surprises, we can say France is maybe a bit better, we see a bit light and good orders in Turkey, in Holland. But okay these are very small spots we see.</p>
          <p>North Africa, that part is doing better, where on the other hand South Africa is struggling. We can say in overall that the business in the Middle East and North Africa is a bit better and also has resulted in some real orders, especially when it comes to the oil and gas business.</p>
          <p>If we then take Asia, Australia, slide nine. Like I said, China and India, maybe that's the light in the tunnel. Business in China for most segments are improving, we're still missing the large orders if we compare with last year. So on that part we can say we are still down but it's trend wise when it comes to the small tickets it's a bit better.</p>
          <p>India, we got &#x2013; also this quarter good order for CNG compressors. So the natural gas compressors that was good to see that also that market is after many months of silences is opening up again.</p>
          <p>And on the Asia side the weak spot is Japan. And we can also say the same for Korea. Australia, nothing much to say there, it was a soft quarter both for mining and compressors.</p>
          <p>Slide number -- we are now slide number 10 we can take, yes. Organic growth for the quarter was minus 30. Of course, like I said, we are comparing with a strong quarter three last year.</p>
          <p>If we then -- turning to the bridge, currency has helped the numbers a bit, not so much as in the previous two quarters. Our decline is 24 on orders received, 18 on revenue, you see on the slide and slight positive price effect of 1%.</p>
          <p>Let's go to slide number 13, return of our capital employed, it was lower and of course it's rather simple to explain, lower profit and a bit higher average capital employed, what means that also that is affected negatively.</p>
          <p>Let me then talk about the businesses. Compressor Technique is declining organically around 27%. The revenue volume was down around 14, so you can see we are still eating from the order book and this is coming mainly from the bigger compressors in the two divisions, the oil-free division and the gas and process division.</p>
          <p>Aftermarket in Compressor Technique is keeping up pretty well, and, of course, here we are not saving any effort, neither in terms of personnel, neither in terms of investment to build this aftermarket, because there is still more to take in that market and defiantly now that may be the market where we have to go after.</p>
          <p>Looking then to the operating margin, 18.6, I would say a very solid level, and this is coming from a positive mix, hard work, and lower cost.</p>
          <p>Let me then go to slide number 16 and then we come to Construction and Mining. The incoming orders have been pretty stable compared to the previous two quarters, but it's still a significant drop when we compare with last year and this is 34%. It's good also to see that the aftermarket keeps also at a healthy level. We see a bit more positive feeling in the mining community, but, of course, here we have to see when it comes to real orders; that is not yet seen.</p>
          <p>Operating profit, 823, with margin of 13.8, which I am very pleased and we can say that. And given the market we are in today, I think that is a great job. Of course, we are still looking for confirmed data with effect &#x2013; negative effect on adjustments and under-absorptions as still significant and on top of that also we are faced with a negative effect from the currency and this is definitely more in CMT than it was in CT.</p>
          <p>Let me then go to slide number 18, Industrial Technique, and here they are still affected the most of the downturn. Organic order declined by 38%. Okay, we all know in which business they are, very difficult MVI business, motor vehicle business, where we don't see many new big projects coming on today. So it's small businesses and that stuff. We are focusing a lot of our time today in the market which is growing in this and that's Asia, so China, India are really our target markets here.</p>
          <p>The under-absorption is high and will remain also high for a while, so, therefore, the negative effect on the EBIT margin is higher than in the other businesses. We are taking, as I also said, in Quarter two, we are taking measures to bend the trend and come back to higher profitability, but it will take a bit of time. So -- but we ended up with 6.7%.</p>
          <p>Let's now go to slide number 21. Yes, 21, where you have the P&amp;L, profit and loss statement. EBIT margin 15.9 compared with 19.7 last year. And I think the 15.9 is also beyond my expectation, so that was a great achievement. Our profit before tax 14.6 compared with 12% in quarter two. So we're a bit helped here from the currency, but we can say, overall, a very strong achievement.</p>
          <p>In general, we can say that the result is influenced by strong aftermarket sales mix and a low operating leverage, which has then resulted in a good flow-through of 29%, if we go to the other slide where you see the bridges to that compare with quarter one and quarter two. Earnings per share SEK1.42, so I think that's a bit better of course also coming from the EBIT margin.</p>
          <p>Slide 23 &#x2013; 22 and 23, I will not comment much on the business area bridges. You see that flow-throughs are coming a bit different, down compared to the beginning of the year. So may be during the Q&amp;A we can elaborate a bit more on that one.</p>
          <p>Then come to slide number 24, the balance sheet. Here you see the comparison with December. We have, of course, a decrease and this is coming from the significant capital &#x2013; working capital reduction, which is, of course, partly offset by the cash accumulation we have now on the balance sheet. But I think given the direction of the sales, I think, it is the right direction also of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Then next slide, net debt-to-EBITDA, 1.2, of course here currency plays a better role and I think also our earnings had also, of course, affecting positively the number. So I think it's a good level.</p>
          <p>Turning then to slide 26, our loan maturity profile, I don't have anything more to say, it has not much changed, except maybe for the currency that you see the levels, but for the rest, I think we kept it more or less the same.</p>
          <p>Slide number 27, here I would say, yes, 4.3, cash flow a very good one. Very strong cash position we have, a healthy balance sheet. So I think also if I look to Hans Ola, I think the 4.3 is maybe the highest we ever had. Of course, we are helped, we should not forget that, of course, the business is going down. And then I think it's a bit easier to create cash flow. But any how it is a very good achievement coming from working capital reduction and that is -- it's all about.</p>
          <p>Investments will stay low for a while, so we are not planning to do any big capacity increases and that I think you will understand why. So now coming to the outlook, I can say here we expect to stay for the next period at the current levels. We see a bit better upturn in Asia, but there are still a lot of uncertainties in most parts of the world. So, in other words, I would say the timing of the overall recovery is still for me uncertain and especially for our business.</p>
          <p>So, thank you, and I hand over to Hans Ola for the Q&amp;A.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will now move to our first question from Simon Smith of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. I had two questions, one was related to currency and the other related to mix in CT, I mean obviously you've given us the currency bridges there and you obviously -- you seem to have -- had quite a negative currency progression in CMT business, but it will appear to be some gains at the central level. I just wondered if you could quantify in CMT the impact that you had from revaluation of receivables and then also of that &#x2013; of the sort of positive contribution you have in central costs, can you give us some feel as to how much of that has come from hedging, how much will you have in coming quarters at current rate? And just also any other contribution you had there from asset disposals?</p>
          <p>In terms of CMT, would be good to get an update as to change in mix again equipment versus aftermarket, and just also now that you're increasingly living off the backlog I guess the backlog was more overweighed some of your higher margin product lines such as the more the kind of oil and gas and sort of large turbo processors, I just wondered if you give a feel as to what mix you've also seen on equipment side there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Will you take the currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Why don't I start and let's see if I can remember the things. You are right that it's -- it is a bit -- trick to estimate and project these effects. And &#x2013; but the first is of course to recognize of what you said that we are commenting in a more negative way in Q3 compared to the two first ones. And we've had substantial positive bridge effects compared to the rates we had in the beginning of 2008 versus the beginning of 2009. And now it came down dramatically in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Basically what we try to do, as we say, what would the effect be on our result this year if we would have had the same rates as the previous quarter or the same quarter last year. That's where we start from. And that simple analysis of where were average rates last year compared to this year. It gives us a positive effect this year, which is probably more in line with what you all had expected to see, in the tune of perhaps three, 400 million even.</p>
          <p>Now to contrast that, we also have another effect that is in the specific third quarter of last year. There was movement from a relatively weak U.S. dollar to a very strong U.S. dollar during the quarter, which means that -- and not only that, since we report in Swedish kroner, there were also currencies that moved in the same direction. That gave us a positive revaluation effect last year in third quarter, purely due to the movement of the currencies.</p>
          <p>That effect this quarter, in Q3 this year is totally opposite, because here the krona has strengthened throughout the third quarter, not to the same extent really, but it gives -- when you talk about comparing without currency effects the third quarter of last year and this year, it gives, of course, a double effect. And that is the reason why we have a negative effect when we look at the revaluation effect on the receivables, but underlying we have a good contribution, because the average rates are still more favorable this year than last year.</p>
          <p>And on top of all that we have, so if these two balance more or less each other, these two effects, we also have some gain in corporate from hedges that we took late 2008, perhaps even beginning of 2009. Put that altogether and that's the 60 million that we referred to.</p>
          <p>In the case of CMT, you're right that since CMT is big and it's very much Swedish krona based, when it comes to costs, it has a more negative effect of this revaluation that I talked about during the third quarter compared to CT. It's &#x2013; it will have &#x2013; it has an effect of a couple of percentage points that if you would just do a mathematical exercise of seeing what would the operating margin have been using not having this negative effect in the result.</p>
          <p>So, guiding forward, well, we now see that the currency situation compared to the third quarter is slightly worse for the Group in Q4 already. At the same time, the opposite situation was also continuing last year. So, we will have a widening negative effect in the fourth quarter when we talk about the bridge in the fourth quarter. So, this is &#x2013; this is really what we can say. Will that number then be negative for the fourth quarter? Yes, that's the best guess we can have for today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe then I can talk a bit, Simon, on the mix part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course what you see is that there is definitely a shift &#x2013; a positive shift to the aftermarket where we see in the aftermarket a slight drop, if we take it over the period. So that of course helped the profitability. I think there is no secret for anyone of us that you have a better contribution in &#x2013; from the aftermarket than you have from equipments sales. So that is I think influencing positively the bottom line.</p>
          <p>The order-to-bill level, okay, we're coming closer to say a one-to-one on that one. But there is still some backlog in -- like we also set in the high, and the bigger compressors the oil and gas compressors. So this is coming through and that will go on for a while. The margins, because I don't know what you were hinting, but the margin in the business of the larger ones if you take just on the equipment side are not significant different. There can be project because these are projects; it can be one project a bit better than the others. But if you take it overall there is not a big significant difference on that one. So if you take it over the next period then you say, okay, you will bill more significant, bigger compressors than, okay, it will have an influence. I think it will not be so much difference on that one. I don't know if that was the answer of the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, no, absolutely, absolutely. I was assuming that you would have a margin lift from sort of more of the -- the sort of lower end equipment, probably being the more cyclical. And then some of your sort of larger and longer duration product lines at a higher margins. It doesn't sound like....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, I don't think <mark type="inaudible" /> you will not see it and neither I don't see it. So, we don't see it then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And aftermarket, I think, you said it risen to about 35% of sales in the last quarter, is that still a similar number now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That depends a little bit on how you define, if you take the pure aftermarket, it's still slightly lower than that. But it's moving in that direction as we are now closing the gap between orders received and orders invoiced. But then we have, of course, specialty rental and consumables that also is gaining share from the equipment share, because they are both less negative in their development than the equipment sales. But the pure aftermarket is moving towards 35%, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and just one final follow-up, in terms of the comment you made about currency there, the -- in the central cost area, were there also any significant gains on equipment disposal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. No, no sorry. The only major explanation for the positive corporate common cost line as you say is these corporate hedges that I talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, If you eliminate for that and if you do the same for the previous quarters going back historically, you will find somewhere in the region of minus 100 to be perhaps the guide per quarter. That -- if you exclude, let's say, the currency hedges effect that goes sometimes up and sometimes down. So, for the modeling purposes, perhaps round minus 100 per quarter is as good a start as any.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll now move to our next question from Ben Maslen from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning everyone. It's Ben from Merrill Lynch. Three quick questions, please. Firstly, on the cost savings, you said that you're now at a run rate in excess of two billion, which I think was your target. Is that it now or is there more that you can do you think in terms of taking cost out?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on your profit bridge analysis the incremental margins in Compressor Technique and CMT were very low and lower than the second quarter, is that sustainable going forward may be you could just explain why that was better than Q2?</p>
          <p>And then just finally on this currency debate, because your corporate hedges all go through the central line, does that mean that your divisional margin that you report for the quarter is effectively more relaxed at the spot rates that we saw during Q3? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Maybe I take the first one and then the incremental margin, the corporate hedging, that maybe Hans Ola you can explain the technique on that one. Of course, we have, and this was also stated in the document we released, you see also that we have achieved the cost saving. Is there more to come, are we doing more? Of course, we are working constantly on making the organization more efficient. If you look to the drop of the sales and you see also our in total the head count, there is still some work to do, because also we see some shift, so that we continuously work on it. It is &#x2013; we also had done in the years before, I cannot say that we haven't worked on efficiency and process alignment and all that in the previous situation. And that we strive for operational excellence in all the processes we are doing.</p>
          <p>So there is a lot of activities going on, on that one. And there is still some more to come on that one. But it is not, let's say, so significant that we decide, okay, we will launch another program on this one. It could, may be compared to, if you compare before the crisis, it's a bit more than normal Iet's say, but not from that point that we say, okay, we need to announce it. If there is a big one that we should come up on that one then we will announce that. So that's a bit the approach we have today in the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You also asked about the profit bridge, Ben, and yes, we see of course, that from the first quarter, particularly, but also through the second quarter now into this one, the so-called incremental or decremental margin...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>... analysis shows a decrease and I mean the direction is no surprise to us. It's moving down to levels of what we think is now already fairly well reflecting our business model to be honest. So if we lose a krona on revenue we will lose 25 or 30 or -- on the EBIT line. That's the logic behind it and the reason for that is that it's not the very highly operationally leveraged business. And so there is nothing particular in this quarter that explains a lot of that it's very, very low, it might not be exactly these numbers when we report the fourth quarter later on, but I mean, if there is nothing specific that we see is, is explaining these numbers that we see right now. The Industrial Technique number continues to be higher than the rest, but that is also something that we have talked about before that they are still more operationally leveraged than the other two.</p>

          <p>So, I don't think that there is anything strange in the analysis this time. When you asked also, should we interpret that when it comes to the currency effect in the third quarter that the business area margins are really reflecting the average current, so to speak, raise, yes, that's right. The thing one could add perhaps, and that touches my previous comment on currency effects, is that the quarter also includes a negative revaluation as I talked about.</p>

          <p>That we have to do in the balance sheet. If then the same level stays going forward we will not have that repeated, so to speak, in the next quarter. So there are a few of these things involved, but, yes, it's reflecting current rates, yes.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. A few questions, first on Construction and Mining, Caterpillar two days ago has guided for 10 to 25% growth in 2010. I wanted to hear your view on this guidance. And I would like to know how your business compares with Caterpillar's.</p>
          <p>And finally, I'd like to hear your view on the likely demand drivers for your Construction and Mining business in 2010.</p>
          <p>As far as under production is concerned, can you tell us how much lower it was compared to sales in Q3 and as a reminder how much it was in Q2, and what you expect for Q4 please?</p>
          <p>And finally on this issue, what has been the impact on your EBIT margin? That's it, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That is the couple of questions. Let me -- on the Caterpillar, of course that is what is their figures on this one. Now, our business model is maybe a bit different than the Caterpillar one and I would also say that if you look to our channels a lot of our business what we conduct is in direct mode, so we are not, so to say, piling up stocks with our distributors in this case.</p>
          <p>What -- if you look to the model of Caterpillar, which is much more done via distribution, so where -- where I assume, and I have not done my analysis myself and just to understand what they come up the 10 and the 20, but my reflection was immediately of course they're going back in the stock refilling part, which of course for Caterpillar is revenue, but doesn't mean is it real sales or not, I don't know.</p>
          <p>But I think this is a bit my interpretation of these figures. I can be right, I can be wrong. I cannot comment on that one. And our case is -- and then coming back to your 1B question what are the drivers for us, obviously there's of course the drivers are definitely the demand and investments in mining, the demand and investment in construction. And when I see on the mining side there is -- more likely also said, there is a more positive attitude also seeing that commodities are better and this is especially going when it comes to gold and copper where we see some &#x2013; still some activity going on, and that also it's explainable why we see some reasonable good demand in Chile, Peru, and also in Brazil.</p>
          <p>So these are on the mining side some of the drivers. When it comes to construction, okay this is the total investment what's going on in that area. There -- I'm I bit reluctant to see in the next period that we're really taking off. I have not seen on the really stimulus packages, really that -- that is also come to our business to say, that we still are looking for that one. And the only thing may be on the driver side then when it comes to CMT and then on specially on the construction side, of course you can take China and India who are investing more in the construction part than the other part of the world.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the question two, is production lower than the sales? I can say, we are more or less on par. I think there are &#x2013; we &#x2013; of course, we are reducing our stocks further, but more or less you can say that in volume terms, it's more or less what we produce is also for sales. This way it is a bit maybe in one or two divisions where we still sell a bit more from -- and that's on the construction side we sell a bit from stock. But it's -- I think it's very &#x2013; in French they will says "it's quantinely Jowla" I think it's very -- it's very low that -- I will not take that in the model. I am looking here also to Hans Ola and he knocks the same on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that when we comment that there is a low &#x2013; less negative effect from under absorption compared to the beginning of the year, it is quite natural that in -- for a period of time there was more of a lag, we had more of a clean-up, we didn't get the costs out the first couple of months and that of course was hurting a little bit more in Q1 and Q2. If, without commenting exactly, I mean this was that much in million krona in Q2 and now it's this in Q3, but I mean, the effect on the margin compared to how it has been previously in the year, we might be talking perhaps a percentage point to between one and two percentage points from the &#x2013; let's say the beginning of the year to the situation in the third quarter that how much these adjustments or under absorption costs are affecting the margin. So that's why we mentioned it generally in our comments that we have cost reductions, yes, that explain the good margin development in the third quarter and also some contribution from this effect, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This is of course, when you say just to highlight a bit, I think we are more or less in par when it comes to sales and production.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. Our next question now comes from Guillermo Peigneux from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Guillermo Peigneux from Morgan Stanley. Good morning. First on your OpEx side, looking at components, I think in the past, Atlas was taking initiatives to get better sourcing prices or pricing. Could you mention how much of that was factored into the quarter or whether the quarter was already showing better pricing for some of your components?</p>
          <p>Then the second question is regarding your CMT operations, could you sort of elaborate a little bit of what happened in Australia, probably related to mining, so maybe some of the aftermarket comments that you've mentioned before should apply to them as well. So I am a bit surprised about how big of a negative was during the quarter and also just going ahead into the fourth quarter looking at negative contribution from currency. Would you say that we are likely to see lower margins in CMT, or actually operate in or operations or increase in operations and production will mitigate part of the pressures that you're going to have from currency? That's I think basically. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, when it comes to the cost, of course, what beside, okay, creating efficiency and having the people at the right place and not having over capacity, of course this is a process which goes on constantly on that one.</p>
          <p>When it comes to product cost reduction, as you know also we are constantly renovating, innovating, redesigning our products portfolio, and this is going on. We have not to released any effort on that side and this of course we do for two reasons. We do that for having a better offer to our customers, so a better product, but second also for the cost reduction. And this is resulting in &#x2013; they also is helping us. And this is also when we talk about cost reduction you should see it from operation, but you also see it from product point of view.</p>
          <p>And commodity prices are -- of course has helped us if we compare with last year or as we go back with two years from now. I think on that one we are a bit helped on that side. So that is a positive effect what we see, what helps us.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Australia CMT, I think, you should not try to read that it really gets very bad in Australia, because I have actually been a week in Australia visiting the whole area there. And there is definitely a good momentum in the business. But of course in the way we compare with previous periods, then we should say it was definitely weaker than in that period. But it is so to say not from a disaster point of view, it is -- it is softer, significant softer with -- compared to last year. That is the way we should quote it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>More than seeing it as a new trend so to speak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes. And this was the same -- the quarter was a bit weak for CMT and mining we should say that. I think it -- of course if you look then for the trend from the beginning of the year then it was definitely not weak. When it comes to -- I don't know what was the last part...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes we have -- you wondered about looking forward the currency effect on CMT primarily being Swedish based and so on. No, I won't be able to guide you to any numbers as you well understand. The comment is of course that if nothing changes from today, I repeat what I said before, yes, we have a tougher currency environment, but we also had in the third quarter a much tougher currency situation compared to Q1 and Q2. So, you are perfectly right that there are other factors that also change between the quarters. So, I cannot give you a good guidance how the net effect of these things will be on the operating margin. I mean that is very difficult to do.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We now move to our next question from Sam Edmunds of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen. A couple of questions. First off, and this is probably my own lack of intelligence, but just your comments about under production, well just -- if you haven't been under producing in the quarter I was wondering how your inventories came down so much. And just looking ahead as well thinking where your production rates will be next year relative to where your sales are likely to come out.</p>
          <p>And the second question was just on your pricing strategy, I've always assumed that Atlas doesn't cut its prices, but just really wanted to check that you are not tempted with business stabilizing to start pulling in some volume with a cut in prices? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, when it comes to production, I think that this you should see that we are rather lean on the -- say on the added value what we do of added cost, what we do in the production side. So that is &#x2013; so that the low leverage allows us really to adapt very quickly the capacity. So -- and that's also what we have done. If you would see the amount of people which we have reduced on the production side compare what we have reduced in the service side and the service side, just to give you an idea, I think we have maybe reduced less than 5% maybe less -- maybe two, 3%. And if you take in total, we have reduced the workforce with more than 20%. So the -- you should see it in that case -- in that way of my comment about that the production and sales is more or less in line. We have a bit in a couple of divisions where we had a bit of stock, but we had to reduce and we have done -- reduced drastically also our production. But to reduce the production capacity is rather not -- I will not say simple because you talk about people, but it is easier to execute.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I mean we cannot see a perfect, let's say, correlation between a quarter as you describe it where of -- we reduced stock this much the demand, the incoming order only was this. And then we come out with a perfect modeling of what the effect is on the under absorption and so on. It's not really working in that way like a switch watch and I think that on top of the natural reduction of inventory, if we call it that because we are adjusting to -- down to lower level of business in general, there is also of course a lot of effort put into making sure that the level measured in days or in time in stock is being attacked or is being worked on so &#x2013; as well. So you can say that the strong reduction of inventory in the quarter is a combination of those two points and not necessarily an automatic effect of the order versus production levels. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and then it was the question about prices &#x2013; price strategy, okay, can you just repeat the question again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just -- I was just wondering whether given that the markets appear to be stabilizing to some degree, whether you have any temptation to cut your prices to try and stimulate your volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that could be &#x2013; anyone could have and go for volume, but &#x2013; you know, also if you go to cut your prices you have to -- to make the same amount of money, you have to really boost your sales a lot, especially if you have a reasonable gross profit on that. And this is definitely not the message we spread in our organization, so the gospel we are spreading is of course, okay, we have to sell value to our customers. We have new products and then we have to stay and -- the enterprise leader on that one and that is what we also do.</p>
          <p>There are pressures. We cannot say because we have moved from a sellers' market to a buyers' market. So now it's in areas it's definitely tougher. But if I see in general, I think we do not have more pressure and I don't see that risk on this and we have here different meetings and all that and I must say I have not heard it beside a couple of areas where -- in automotive there it can be a bit tougher because there is the market very thin and more competitors are playing. But overall it is rather &#x2013; rather, yes, stable, let's say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fantastic. And so just one follow-up on the production question, SKF mentioned on their call that they were now looking to negotiate raw material agreements with their suppliers for next year and were happier to commit to higher volumes. I was just wondering what where in terms of the way you see production developing whether you're confident enough yet to start negotiating with suppliers and raw material suppliers on next year's volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But of course, you can &#x2013; if you look to our way of working you -- of course, it's &#x2013; the model is a bit differently to SKF because they need to really negotiate directly on the iron ore and raw material where we buy a finished component on that one and we do -- of course we really look into motors, electrical motors, which is a big part. You have canopies, which is a big part, which is going on, and this process is going on constantly. And like I said and I hinted a bit to that when we talked about the product cost development, it goes together with a new product design, which is constantly moving around, but it's not one single component. And there is a good evolution. I don't see -- for the timebeing, I've not heard in the organization that we get same price increases, let's say, in this part. It's even on the contrary on that works.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you and we now move to our next question from Colin Gibson of HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. It's Colin Gibson, couple of questions please. First of all, looking at Construction and Mining Technique, you say consumables sales were still down year-on-year, but less down than they have been earlier in year; I'm wondering whether you can give us any numbers of that. And also when do you think consumables sales actually starting picking up given what's happened to commodity prices and what presumably is happening to mine utilization rates? That was the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, I note too with interest that you say you've introduced a new oil-free scroll compressor in the quarter. Is that a sign of strength or it's a sign of weakness? You obviously were famous for oil-free screw compressors, so does this mean, is this just yet more evidence of you effortlessly expanding your franchise or are you admitting that some competitors who offer alternative technologies have done quite well? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Colin, I like your question, especially the last one, which is my field. Now, on the C&amp;P side, of course, the consumables are down and of course, what has happened over -- if you'd say over the last 12 months, definitely when the drastic stop come is that everybody was de-stocking, which was, of course, on the consumables side, where some of the customers had stopped for six months or 12 months even. So this is of course there have been sitting out, and have reduced drastically their stock, and that we have seen in our sales.</p>
          <p>If we talk about figures, I think on the consumables side we can say that we are down between 15 and 20%. That is where we are down on that side that is we could say and I'm looking out to Hans Ola if he is &#x2013; if he is on that....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We -- yeah where we have some segments of consumables that are very much directly linked to the sale of equipment and I'm talking particularly on the exploration drilling side and that is explaining this relatively large decrease to and when we look at the more bread and butter of why the widely applied drill bits and drill steel, et cetera, that is much less negative than this. So one has to see it a little bit in that respect, so perhaps 15 to 20% sounds quite a lot, but as I said it's an average of two things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But what we see is definitely in these divisions handling it, if you see the recent trend, I think we see also that &#x2013; okay the down trend. Of course we compare always with the quarter or 12 months back. But if we see over the last five, six months I think we see a reasonably good stabilization on that front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the scroll side we -- as Atlas Copco has &#x2013; as such has no opinion on technology. I think we only want to deliver that technology, which is the best fit for the customer, for the application. And we are mastering and that is I think is the mission of the leader, we must master the best technology for that application. We must master them all.</p>
          <p>On the scroll side, what we have done there is we have launched a large scroll, which we had never had. There was only one competitor who had that and this is specifically Hitachi was it, which has a 5.5, which give some advantages in certain segments of the market and what we're talking about here we're talking about here about printing machines like customers like Heidelberg. We are talking here about medical applications. We talk here about oil-free brake compressors.</p>
          <p>So this is a part where we have now also been able or will be able to also to compete better than before. But it definitely does not jeopardize or does not hint or affect any of our oil-free business and then we talk about screws or turbos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. It's Nico Dil from JPMorgan. A quick &#x2013; two quick questions here. First of all, with a book-to-bill of around one, actually quite -- a little bit below or upward 95, it appears you are close to a trough in sales. The first question I have is whether you are close to a trough in the absolute EBIT or in the absolute EBIT margin of around 16%?</p>
          <p>The second question is around the one-offs. Two quick topics here, the first one is on the pricing spreads between raw materials and output prices, where you have seen a positive spread here this quarter which might potentially tailor off in the coming quarter as I have heard from some of your peers. And the second question is on the negative revaluation effect. I was just hoping you could quantify it for this quarter and with that so we could understand what the clean underlying margin was this quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Yes, I think I mentioned it but perhaps a little bit too quick. It's in the region of three to 400 million negative. If -- not -- sorry -- not in the quarter. It's about 100 to 200 million negative and the reason why I mentioned a higher number is that it was as much positive in Q3 last year. So when we were talking about the bridge it became a double effect. But in the quarter we have that negative effect of about 100 to 200 million, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I would caution, let's say, to say if you just take that and then you deduct that and you get the new operating margin, I mean it is not as mathematical as that and that's the problem really, but it's that magnitude, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can your repeat then your second question &#x2013; take the second question first then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question was on the spread between raw materials and output pricing. Some of the &#x2013; some of your peers have highlighted that they had a positive impact this quarter and I was wondering whether you had a similar impact and whether that can perhaps tailor off going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No way. I am not aware about any of this thing that has affected our area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, as Ronnie pointed out in a previous question, we have a long lead time, if we call it like that, from raw material affecting our costing and we have a number of sub-suppliers in the chain and so on. So for us it's almost impossible to see, and even less quantify, such an effect in the quarter. No, we cannot see that. No, no, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then on the book-to-bill, yes, we come in close. I think there will be a bit also in quarter four because we are now around 95%. So we gradually will move towards say the 100 or the one, whatever we say. So that is what we are working. Then you were asking something about the EBIT now I missed that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The EBIT margin or the absolute EBIT level, do you feel reasonably comfortable that this is getting close to where it's a trough in EBIT or EBIT margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that is a one billion dollar question, of course. I think that we're working hard in making the organization more efficient, and at the same time, and this is also the message I spread this we have to invest in markets where we see some potential. And this is what we are working on. And at the same time, I believe, which was one of the first questions, I still believe there is some efficiency to gain in the organization, but to make really say an assessment on, say what will be the bottom or the top of the EBIT that I would like also myself to make that.</p>
          <p>And because there is a lot of complex mix, you can say the mix if it goes on the mix is helping us today where the currency effect is not helping us, you see the dollar to the euro. I just talk about that one what will that be affecting us. We have geographical mixes, which was not maybe in certain cases not helping us on that one. But we are working on that and working hard on improving the efficiency. We still have on the business area IT where our profitability is today around six, 7%, where we said okay this has to improve. And we're working hard to bring it up. I am pleased with the profitabilities what we see in CT and CMT. And we must make them, yes, repeatable. This is what the message and the mission we have taken on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I think we have time for one more question, possibly two, depending on the lengths of the answers that we give.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We will give shorter then okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Now we will move on to our next question now from Peder Fr&#xF6;l&#xE9;n from Handelsbanken. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Unfortunately many questions, my first one, could you help us with how much your aftermarketing total is down in CT and CMT, respectively?</p>
          <p>Second question is linked to how much the positive &#x2013; how much the mix affected your margin positively in percentage point wise in CT and CMT?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, what &#x2013; how much the part of your construction equipment business that are direct sales?</p>
          <p>And finally, from historic perspectives, the historical lag within mining from raw material high until you actually see orders, if you could spread some light over that. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last one, what was it, can you repeat that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The lag.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The lag</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the mining side, looking at the historical pattern, when we see a large hike in raw material prices, how long does it usually take before you see the actual orders from the customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with that last one because that was also one of my interesting visits when I went to Australia and to see that one. But I think that's extremely difficult to also when you meet the miners and say, okay, what is your demand, when will you invest? It's also extremely difficult for them to say, okay, we will do it exactly at that moment.</p>
          <p>I think one thing and this is a bit what make me looking for, there is still a big demand for all these commodities. I think the prices are not bad. So that means there is, yes, there must be a margin coming in for them to invest. But it's depending a bit what is their utilization, what is their capacity, which is idle today and I think there is still a bit of idle capacity in that area. So it's a very difficult -- we can &#x2013; I think we can go on for another week to discuss about that and making reaction on that one.</p>
          <p>I think the only thing what I said to the guys, it doesn't make any sense if we make projections, we must be ready when it comes and we must make sure that we meet the people and we are in the market with the right products. So that is my answer on that one.</p>
          <p>When it comes to aftermarket, your first question &#x2013; aftermarket drop for CT, CMT, it is between, you can say it's between five and 10%. It's a bit less in CT and a bit, yes, then a bit more in CMT.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now we're talking then about excluding consumable...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, yes, purely aftermarket on that one. You can on CT, it is may be less than five and CMT is a bit closer to 10 on that one. Is it a positive effect on the mix? Yes, you've heard me saying that. I think we are not going further in detail on say -- on the margin effect while it has, but it has had a good significant effect, and as you know the aftermarket margin is higher than the equipment margin. I think that is for no one a surprise on that one.</p>
          <p>Then the third question, I say how much is our construction direct sales I think the majority in our business, and especially the Atlas Copco model is that we try to sell as much as possible direct. I don't know exactly the figure. I don't know if we have ever calculated that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean we &#x2013; it varies of course, Peder, between certain ranges of Dynapac, for example. Historically it's drill &#x2013; drilling equipment and then the other light equipment that we sell. So it's very difficult to pinpoint, but &#x2013; so that's why the only answer can be that the majority is still direct if you talk in value. But if you talk certain products, it could well be a different picture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you take the light and concrete and you take the hydraulic small hammers and attachment and pneumatic hammers on that one, okay, they go &#x2013; most of them go by the rental companies. So you can say that is an order that is direct sales for us of course, but is rental business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you can say the majority is by far in value is direct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I think we have passed the hour, perhaps we can take one final question then, operator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, our final question now comes from Sasu Risomacci from Carnegie. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, I'd like to say I've got very short questions. One is, do you see further potential for inventory reduction from these levels or are you kind of reaching the points where customer service becomes important?</p>
          <p>Then could you just give us a simple number for how much do you think aftermarket sales were a percentage of total Group now in Q3?</p>
          <p>And finally, are you seeing any demand for introducing vendor financing, particularly in the CMT area at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the vendor financing, we do. I think when there is a potential or a need for we do, we have now &#x2013; we take the case, and we take the project that goes on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We started a little bit more focused activity on customer financing or vendor -- or you're talking &#x2013; sorry, you're talking about the vendor financing, sorry, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The vendor financing. That we do and there is no, I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No significant trend in the increasing or not...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Then when it comes to the inventory reduction, I still see that the risk potential in reducing and this by improving the process, improving the flow, improving the flow of orders, because you're right, you can of course reduce your inventory so much that you jeopardize your customer service. But I think this is just the trick and that is the professionalism in logistic is to making sure your balance your flow, your inventory, and making sure you have the right customer service on that one.</p>
          <p>But we're keeping going on this. In relative terms I still believe we can improve on the inventory that is for sure. Then I think this &#x2013; the second question was, how much &#x2013; is it how much is aftermarket, was that your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, roughly of the Group revenues in Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we'll just that if we start from the other end, so to speak and say equipment has of course come down. The equipment share is somewhere in the region of 55% for the Group right now in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's equipment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's equipment part, and then the &#x2013; sometimes we refer to everything else as the aftermarket, but to be a little bit more exact we have the consumables, we have the pure aftermarket, and we have also a small piece of specialty rental revenue. So if those three together is about 45% right now. The pure aftermarket is slightly lower than 35, but, as I said, the trend has been slightly increasing in the last months and quarters. So that's why we said that it's moving towards the 35% level perhaps.</p>

What I mean by that is that we're, of course, happy to receive your further questions directly through &#x2013; to our Investor Relations department or to me if we can help you further. But for now then from me and Ronnie, we thank you for participating. And then hope to speak to you soon.</p>
          <p>Before I leave you, perhaps I should just remind you that on the 19th of November, we have our Annual Capital Markets Day in Stockholm. And I won't give you more details right now just as reminder and you can on the website and you probably also had mails from our Investor Relations department regarding this. And so I hope you will sign up and hope to see you in Stockholm on 19th of November. Thank you very much.</p>
