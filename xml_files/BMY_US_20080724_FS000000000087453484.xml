          <p>Good day and welcome to today's 2008 Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. This call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Elicker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks Anthony, and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us. We're here this morning to review our Q2 results. You've seen our release and associated financial information out about 7:30 this morning. It's also posted on our website.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks John.  Good morning everyone. We're glad you could join us today. In the next few minutes I'll update you briefly on our financial performance in the quarter and our progress against our strategies. Overall, I'm pleased with how we are delivering on our commitments. We're making measurable strides against the strategy we outlined for investors late last year, both investing in our future through business development activities like the String of Pearls, and strategically lowering costs to prepare for the 2012-13 timeframe.</p>
          <p>In the near term, we're in the midst of sustained earnings growth we forecasted in December. Our financial performance at both the top and bottom lines continue to be very strong in the second quarter. Revenue grew 16% over the second quarter of 2007. This growth was driven by the strong overall performances of our pharmaceutical business including our medicines for cancer, heart disease, viruses, mental illness, and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
          <p>We posted second quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations at $0.36 a share up 20% from last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth from continuing operations was $0.43 a share, up 39% from 2007 with the help of a tax refund. In the U.S., pharmaceutical sales increased 17% to 2.6 billion in the second quarter, compared to the same period in 2007.</p>
          <p>Internationally, sales increased 15% to 1.9 billion in the second quarter with foreign exchange rates helping the revenue growth. With good sales execution, the product portfolio is performing nicely, particularly ABILIFY, which grew worldwide. PLAVIX sales increased in the U.S., where we also had strong results from our HIV and hepatitis portfolios.</p>
          <p>Overseas, recently launched products such as BARACLUDE and SPRYCEL grew substantially. The strength in our top line also reflects good science. Our R&amp;D team has been hard at work to achieve additional and expanded indications in our product labels. And commercially, we're seeing disciplined execution in the marketplace. We have also made a conscious decision for further investment behind the right brands, as evidenced by the 19% increase in Q2 advertising and promotion spends, particularly in the U.S.  We will continue that trend into the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>As we've grown the top line, we've also become more profitable, which you can see from our non-GAAP net income margins. This measure increased approximately 300 basis points in the quarter, compared to the same period last year. Our margin improvement is tied to the progress we've made against the 1.5 billion in productivity initiatives we first announced in December.</p>
          <p>I'm glad to say we're well on track to achieve our goals with these initiatives. We are also able to reaffirm guidance for 2008 without ConvaTec results. On a GAAP basis, we expect fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.36 and $1.46 per share, and on a non-GAAP basis to be between $1.60 and $1.70 earnings per share.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that ConvaTec's after tax earnings contribution last year was approximately $0.12 per share. Over the next three years, we're also confirming our non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations to grow at least 15% compound annual growth rates from the 2007 base, again without rebasing for ConvaTec.</p>
          <p>On the scientific front, we're steadily advancing our pipeline both through the milestones of our current portfolio as well as through business development strategies. We're pleased with the recent regulatory submissions in the U.S. and Europe of our diabetes medicine, Saxagliptin, which we plan to market as ONGLYZA.</p>
          <p>.We also saw encouraging data coming out of two medical conferences. At ADA in June we presented data on both of our late stage diabetes compounds, ONGLYZA and Dapagliflozin, showing further evidence that these medicines can help control diabetes.</p>
          <p>At ASCO last month, we saw important data demonstrating ERBITUX's potential benefits in treating lung cancer, and for the first time new data for SPRYCEL and prostate cancer. Coming up in September, we're excited about Phase III ONGLYZA data we expect to share at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, in Rome.</p>
          <p>The scientific progress we're making internally is being complemented by our business development strategy. We're honing in on potential acquisitions and alliances that can make us competitive in the therapeutic clusters we work. Along these lines, we agreed in May with KAI Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize a novel acute heart attack medicine, which we think will be a positive addition to our CD portfolio.</p>
          <p>In June we completed the acquisition of Kosan Biosciences, a cancer therapeutics company, for $190 million. From Kosan we've acquired a library of novel compounds including an Hsp90 inhibitor in Phase III, and a microtubule stabilizer program we think they may applications in Alzheimer's disease. As we continue to plan for our future, we're taking definitive actions now to manage our costs in light of the challenges facing the entire industry.</p>
          <p>We're managing our costs proactively, even though we expect to continue in a period of sales growth for some time. We've begun a second wave of productivity initiatives which will result in another billion of cost savings by 2012. We've already commissioned several teams to execute against some projects we've identified.</p>
          <p>We'll provide you with updates on this second wave of productivity by year end. This comes as part of our plan to maximize growth opportunities through 2011 and improve our earnings base in 2012-13.</p>
          <p>A few weeks ago the Management Council and I met with the top 200 global executives of the company for a couple of days to take the pulse of our strategic execution. I came away with feeling newly energized and confident that we're making excellent progress against our goals and that our corporate culture is shifting to become more agile, entrepreneurial and accountable. Now I would like to Jean-Marc Huet, our CFO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Jim. So what I would like to do is first review the Q2 results and guidance and then we can open up for Q&amp;A thereafter. So let me first start with revenues. Our total sales from continuing operations were up 16%. Please note that this excludes ConvaTec, which we are reporting now as a discontinued operation.</p>
          <p>Importantly, our underlying sales growth was very strong at 11% in Q2. If we segment sales, 5% came from FX, 4% from price, and 7% from volumes. Our most important division, pharmaceuticals, sales were up 16%, which includes a 5% favorable impact from foreign exchange. We had broad based growth in Q2 across the portfolio, driven by important products such as PLAVIX and ABILIFY, as well as BARACLUDE and the rest of our virology business, ERBITUX and some of our newer products, including ORENCIA as well as SPRYCEL.</p>
          <p>If I just go through the different categories starting off with cardiovascular, U.S. PLAVIX sales were up 19% in Q2. This is the last quarter where we see a positive impact from Apotex that impacted Q2 of last year.</p>
          <p>Neuroscience, ABILIFY was up 28% globally, and 25% in the U.S. 19% prescription growth in U.S., which reflect execution against the opportunities in bipolar, and the new Major Depressive Disorder indication supported by a strong DTC campaign launched at the backer end of last year. Growth in Europe was also very strong at 39% supported by the new bipolar indication.</p>
          <p>Turning to virology, REYATAZ was up 28% globally including 13% U.S. TRx growth. SUSTIVA Franchise sales were up 21% globally behind the strong performance of ATRIPLA.</p>
          <p>Please take note that the U.S. sales for HIV are somewhat flat versus Q1. This was driven by the timing of ADAP purchases that took place at the beginning of the year. Also importantly within our virology franchise were the sales of BARACLUDE, which were at $136 million, with over 100 million outside the United States. This is becoming an increasingly global product, up 131% versus where we were last year.</p>
          <p>Immunology.  ORENCIA sales were at $106 million, up 22% compared to Q1, which is a reflection of our increased execution capabilities over the last six months. U.S. sales have accelerated, up 19% compared to the first quarter of 2008. We're making good progress in the U.S. in share of new to biologic and first-line patients.</p>
          <p>Turning over to oncology. ERBITUX sales were $196 million, up 21% from Q2 of last year. Global SPRYCEL sales were at 76 million, up 15% now on comparing with Q1 of this year with strong growth in Europe.</p>
          <p>IXEMPRA, launched in the U.S. at the back end of last year generated sales of around $25 million. Our other division is Mead Johnson as you know, increased 17% or 12%, were you to take out the favorable impact from foreign exchange out, amounting to sales of around 728 million.</p>
          <p>So in summary, quality revenue growth in each business and each geography, and the U.S. standing out with particularly strong growth at plus 17%.</p>
          <p>Now turning over to expenses. If I compare to the second quarter of last year, and excluding specified items, gross margin increased 20 basis points to 69% compared to the same period last year. This is driven by favorable mix in the pharmaceutical business and manufacturing cost improvements partially offset by a lower margin growth in our Mead Johnson business.</p>
          <p>Compared to the first quarter of this year, and again excluding specified items, gross margins in our pharmaceutical business were at 70.7%, up 80 basis points. And Mead Johnson was at 63.2%, down 110 basis points from Q1.</p>
          <p>Now turning to some of the other elements of cost. If I again exclude specified items, marketing, selling, and administration increased 3.6%. Importantly, MS&amp;A is down 1% if you take out the impact of FX. This is as a result of our productivity efforts, and as Jim mentioned, this was launched at the back end of last year and we're seeing be it through gross margin as well as these line items, and specifically G&amp;A, which was down high single digit, the results already of our productivity initiative.</p>
          <p>Advertising and promotion increased 19%, but if you exclude 5% FX, approximately 14%. This increase in A&amp;P reflects the investments that we've decided to put behind ABILIFY as well as ORENCIA, and the spending behind the launch of IXEMPRA. This trend is going to continue in the second half of 2008 as we are investing in revenue growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>Now turning to R&amp;D. Again excluding specified items, this increased 8% to $795 million. This is a reflection of higher development spending, as well as a 2% impact from foreign exchange. Our guidance for R&amp;D is unchanged, but I should take note that it includes the R&amp;D spend associated with the Kosan acquisition and licensing agreement with KAI.</p>
          <p>Turning to our tax line. The effective tax rate from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes and excluding specified items, was 20.9%. As I go through the P&amp;L, there are one or two so called one-off items, two of which are of note. Firstly, within the tax line, $0.04 in favorability from audit settlement that took place relating to 2002-2003.</p>
          <p>This release was build into our original guidance and expected in the second half of the year originally. Our full year guidance remains approximately 24% and assumes the R&amp;D tax credit is approved, which will most likely be in the fourth quarter of this year. The second one-off of note and partially offsetting this tax favorability is the $0.01 adverse impact from ImClone's write-down of auction rate securities which affected the income stream which we receive as a shareholder in that company.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to cash flow from operations, which will continue to be an area of increasing focus in the future; this amounted to $1.1 billion. We had some improvements in working capital and this will be an area of more focus in the future. Net debt decreased by just less than $400 million from the end of Q1 2008.</p>
          <p>So, in general, we had strong sales, improved gross margins, an effective expense management that has driven the improvement in pre-tax and net margins. Non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations grew 39% to $0.43 from $0.31 in Q2 last year. GAAP EPS from continuing operations at $0.36 due to specified items. Specified items totaled $173 million for the quarter.  Of this, around 109 million was related to the productivity initiative.</p>
          <p>Importantly, and as Jim mentioned, we have identified an additional $1 billion in cost savings opportunities. This is to improve our base earnings in 2012 and 2013. Based on our experience and the success that we have had so far, as demonstrated in our P&amp;L for the first half of this year, against our 1.5 billion target, we are confident in our ability to deliver this additional 1 billion.</p>
          <p>This 1 billion is a reflection firstly of our success to date with productivity, and secondly, and importantly, our decision today to strengthen our earnings base in 2012 and 2013. This coupled with our current growth trajectory and exciting pipeline will make us a stronger company in 2012 and 2013. The full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP EPS adjusted for ConvaTec is posted on our website.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to guidance. We are confirming our full year 2008 GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. Our non-GAAP guidance remains 160 to 170. This does not include any contribution from ConvaTec, now classified as a discontinued operation for the full year. The only change in our line item guidance is advertising and promotion, which we expect to increase in the high single digit range.</p>
          <p>Based on our strong revenue performance during the first half we have decided to increase our investments in key products such as ABILIFY and ORENCIA. We are looking to maintain our current sales trend and are investing with an eye towards revenue opportunities in 2009.</p>
          <p>As Jim mentioned, we are also confirming our three year minimum 2008 to 2010 15% EPS compound annual growth on a non-GAAP basis without rebasing 2007 for ConvaTec.</p>
          <p>So in summary, our second quarter underlying operating performance was strong. We sold double-digit sales and non-GAAP earnings growth along with improved gross and pre-tax margins. The company has entered in to a period where we expect continued growth and improved operating leverage based on product mix and our productivity initiative.</p>
          <p>Our strategic view of the company looks at three distinct phases. The first phase is the current period of sales and earnings growth through 2011, and execution is key in delivering. We must continue to focus on the top line while delivering on our 1.4 &#x2013; 1.5 billion productivity initiative.</p>
          <p>The strength of our business is reflected in our guidance for 2008, and our outlook through 2010. The second phase is focused on improving the base business in 2012 and 13 when we lose exclusivity on some of our key products. Our next wave of productivity, the additional 1 billion in productivity as Jim mentioned, demonstrates our commitment today to deliver on our growth outlook and improve the base business in this timeframe, i.e., 2012 and 2013.</p>
          <p>Important areas of savings will be head count related, savings in procurement, and the streamlining of various operations as we become a BioPharma business. This initiative should be complete in 2012. We will be able to provide more details on the savings as well as related charges later this year.</p>
          <p>We focus, and we will continue to do so, on the growth of our currently marketed and potential new product launches to contribute, and we will also look for contribution from potential business development opportunities.</p>
          <p>The third phase is a second period of growth coming out of 2013 driven by our current pipeline assets, as well as externally developed assets, that are part of our String of Pearls strategy, as demonstrated today by SAXA as well as other recent developments and our recent acquisition of Kosan. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thanks Jean-Marc. And Anthony, I think we're ready to go to questions now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  And we'll take our first question from Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>ORENCIA, that seems to be ramping nicely. Can you describe how that product is being used at present in terms of things like first-line setting versus refractory setting? Any sort of off-label use or anything like that? And then can you provide development timeline for the subcu formulation, when could that conceivably make it to market? And also a development timeline for the lupus indication?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes let me &#x2013; this is Lamberto. Let me summarize where we are with ORENCIA in the U.S. Q2 sales were 87 million, and this is 64% above last year. And where we are focused is we are focused on increasing our penetration rate in the biologic night patient population by positioning ORENCIA as the IV biological choice and focusing patients on the efficacy and the durability of response over time of this product.</p>
          <p>Now what we have is we have a share &#x2013; these are data of Q1 '08, we don't have Q2 yet, and we have a new to biologic patient share of 7.5%, and this is up from where we were in Q4. We were at 6.5%. And what we see, we measure a number of things of ORENCIA versus REMICADE, and on all these metrics we are improving our ratios and we're improving our performance &#x2013; relative performance to REMICADE. So what we're doing is we are solidifying the use in second and third line and increasing our first-line use of the product.</p>
          <p>You know that recently the FDA has removed the requirement that patients must first fail at least one demod before initiating therapy with ORENCIA, and this obviously helps us simplify our message to both physicians and patients.</p>
          <p>The same label change broadens the adult indication and at this point ORENCIA can be prescribed in all patients with moderate to severe RA, regardless of prior treatment received. So we have a much wider possibility of using ORENCIA, and we have a product that is now supported by more data and a better label. And we're taking advantage of all this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, this is Elliott Sigal. Your question was regarding our lifecycle management program, which continues very intensely, specifically with regards to subcutaneous formulation. Our pivotal trial has been initiated with regulatory feedback, both from the FDA and the CHMP, and we expect to have Phase III data in 2009. The dosing frequency will be once a week. And that enrollment is progressing.</p>
          <p>With regard to developments this year, Lamberto mentioned the expansion of the label, which I think is very important. That came with our approval in Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis. We recently reported Phase II data that was very exciting in terms of the prevention of the development of rheumatoid arthritis, which supports our belief in the science that we can have an impact in earlier forms of disease. We will have one year data in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis, that is the Methotrexate Naive population, to be presented at the ACR. At that time we will present the lupus data, the Phase II exploratory study. This is in generalized, that is non-lupus nephritis. That registrational program in lupus nephritis, a 2/3 program continues. And we are also continuing our programs in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Tim. Anthony, can we go to the next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question from Roopesh Patel with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. In the context of the $2.5 billion in cost savings programs that have been announced so far, by my estimates that's worth roughly about $0.95 in EPS. And in that context, I was wondering if you can provide us with a rough sense of what the potential EPS hit will be related to the loss of PLAVIX and ABILIFY in the 2012-13 timeframe. Alternatively, what do you expect the operating margins of the company to look like post the loss of ABILIFY and PLAVIX? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe an answer to the question which doesn't directly answer your question is the following. If you look at the 1.5 billion that we announced in December of last year, that provided us with the comfort that we could continue our trajectory of 15% EPS growth till 2010. The additional 1 billion that we have announced today is very much focused on 2012 and 2013. So one needs to differentiate the 1.5 billion which really contributes to our current trajectory, and the 1 billion which is very much a strategic message that we today are approaching and making moves to tackle what one calls the cliff year 2012 and 2013. And that is driven by the loss of exclusivity of some of our products. So that's basically how we strategically look at the 1.5 and the 1 billion. We will not give comments in terms of financial impacts in those years.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. Question for Jim Cornelius, just has to do with the growth trajectory that you put Bristol on here going forward. You find it rare that you have a 15% grower that is paying a 5.5% dividend. And especially in light of your appetite for M&amp;A, and especially the attracting of 15% grower to growth investors, it seems that you are kind of at a hybrid period within your evolution here, Jim. So I guess the question really has to do with your commitment to the dividend in light of your search for additional assets that can keep you growing on that trajectory, in fact filling some of that pack cliff. Thanks</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I do feel like a hybrid. We're both growing and returning a significant cash dividend to our shareholders. I think we believe, and our shareholders believe that's an important part of total shareholder return and we are committed to it. The String of Pearls execution is dependent on receiving the proceeds from ConvaTec. We are quite optimistic with the EU regulatory approval that's been received as early as August. And we will have those proceeds, and we will be in a very, very strong cash position in the middle of this year to go forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you very much. The question really relates to the guidance for the CAGR being maintained through 2010 at 15%, which obviously you had to put out there prior to the news about PLAVIX potentially facing generic competition outside the U.S., and today's announcement of an incremental $1 billion from productivity initiatives obviously looks to be focused out on a longer term basis. So can you just share with us maybe an update of what you know about the situation with Schweizerhall in Germany and then other European markets, and what kind of assumptions you are making relative to having generic competition on the market outside the U.S. and what kind of penetration that may get over the course of the next couple of years? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. The obviously biggest chunk of our PLAVIX sales are in the U.S., but that doesn't mean that we are not concerned about certain evolutions in Europe. In May, the German FDA, the German Health Authority, gave marketing authorization to a company called Yes Pharmaceuticals for a product that is based on clopidogrel besylate, different sold than the one we have in the market in the U.S. and Europe and elsewhere. We took legal action, and that legal action was based on the grounds that our &#x2013; that  Yes marketing authorization was relying on data that was originated by Sanofi and BMS, it came from our dossier, and was protected under our data exclusivity provision through July 15 of 2008. And as a result, that marketing authorization in Germany was suspended as of today, is suspended.</p>
          <p>Now they, this company, Yes Pharmaceuticals and its marketing partners have taken legal action. This legal action is still open and we cannot predict, it is difficult to predict when the local court will rule in this matter.</p>
          <p>Now, I think we feel very strong about our legal position, about the first submission by that company, and the subsequent approval by the German authorities. That doesn't mean that we are &#x2013; disregard the possibility of others submitting files in Europe or the same company resubmitting file for getting something out of the German court.</p>
          <p>Just to clarify things, our data exclusivity expired on July 15 in the European Union. We have a patent in most European countries, by most I mean all major European countries excluding Spain, and some smaller countries, we have a patent that covers clopi bisulfate until 2013. So we may have in certain countries where do not have that patent, generic application and generic competition, and think about Spain and the other minor countries for the same salt. There might be applications by others also in our core countries for different salts and it is not up to us to decide what the different health authorities should say about the applications of &#x2013; related to these other salts and the evidence that is submitted in their regulatory application. So a long story short, it's an open question. We are taking all necessary actions to react legally where we can and where we must, and we are taking all actions to deal with the possible commercial impact, country by country, and mitigating actions where necessary. We are working very closely with sanofi-aventis in all these issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just to finally add on to Lamberto's point there is, in this type of situation where there is some uncertainty, you can assume that we are building in general contingency plans and making sure that we are agile in terms of preparing about these types of situations today rather than tomorrow.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. With respect to your cost reduction initiatives, Bristol was obviously hard at work to reduce the cost that you've outlined, but you obviously also have to reinvest in growing the business. Is there any way to provide some color on the outlook for absolute cost and frame how you think absolute cost levels of the company will trend over time? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's actually a question which is difficult to answer because I just go back to our EPS guidance of 15%. What you are seeing if you look at our P&amp;L is that we are investing more in advertising and promotion. This has taken place in the last six months and this will continue in the next six months. And what we are seeing is that the DTC campaigns coupled with improved execution, we are improving the revenue potential as we are reinvesting in this type of line item.</p>
          <p>I will also say that at the same time we're trying to keep marketing, selling and administration flat. And so what you see is that our G&amp;A is down and that contributes or partially offsets any increases, be it either in sales distribution, as well as advertising and promotion. So what we're trying to do is we're trying to finance some of the reinvestment into advertising and promotion by being very strict on the cost containment side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we also have a pretty disciplined exercise of reallocating resources from the more mature brands and the established products into the new products. This is part of our productivity transformation. We have started applying this and therefore we are finding resources for the new launches by cutting expenses and investments behind the products that are more established in the market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. Just two quick questions. First, timing of Belatacept in terms of your filing expectations and when we would expect to see Phase III data presentation. And then quickly on Saxagliptin and SGLT2 program, just any takeaways from the recent FDA Diabetes Panel for your clinical development programs there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Chris. We have two important Phase III studies on Belatacept, which is a compound that is rationally designed on the foundation of ORENCIA, but specifically appears to perform very well in preventing transplant rejection. And as an immunosuppressant, we think the unmet need in this area is to replace cyclosporine, because despite the advances in utilizing that medicine, there are drawbacks that need to be addressed in terms of deteriorating graft function of the renal transplanted kidney as well as cardiovascular complications. These Phase III data will mature this year. We plan on presenting this in May of '09, and when we review the Phase III data, we will be giving more of an update on our filing strategy.</p>
          <p>With regard to Dapagliflozin, this is an exciting new mechanism. We did present some Phase IIb data, of course, at the ADA. That was a basis upon which we and our partner, AstraZeneca, put this program in to the late stage, Phase III. We have a very exiting &#x2013; a comprehensive Phase III program. We've been working with the agency in all aspects on how to clearly define the safety and efficacy and advantages of this compound. Among the advantages they're not only Glycemic Control that is independent of the insulin pathway altogether, but also the fact that through caloric loss that this induces, there appears to be the potential of weight loss.</p>
          <p>The advisory committee of course was very interesting. We all agree that our number one obligation is to provide information to make an important decision about the safety and efficacy of innovative drugs. We are waiting for the advice and guidance that will emanate from that, and as we have in the past, continue to collaborate with the agency with regard to requirements, and then we have plenty of time to incorporate in this program any new guidance that would come out. And as we have in all our programs such as ABILIFY, BARACLUDE and ORENCIA, we are committed to studying after approval to really inform in wider and wider populations what's the ongoing estimate of benefit and risk.</p>
          <p>Today we're very excited about Saxagliptin's progress in this field. We were able to submit the application not only in the U.S., but in Europe, and we're working specifically with our partner AstraZeneca. We feel we have a very comprehensive program and this is very good clinical data and perhaps Lamberto will say something about our plans and our partnership.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, obviously we are very happy of this filing in both the U.S. and EU. In the EU we were originally planning for a later filing.  So we are happy to have an earlier filing.  And the good work with AstraZeneca is taking place also in my shop. In all counties of the world we are already interacting with them. I am preparing a very detailed plan for the launch of  ONGLYZA if and when we get an approval. This will be an interesting launch. I think we have an important profile that is developing for the product. We are looking to presenting the data at the EADS meeting after this summer, and obviously we are already working on that data and profiling the products and defining the action, pre-launch and after launch.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Catherine Arnold with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. I have few questions regarding Dynamics and PLAVIX growth outlook. As I look at the products performance, it seems it has sort of settled out sequentially in terms of mid single digit growth, and that is actually close to what some U.S. pricing audits would suggest, the actions that you're taking in the U.S. I'm wondering could you comment, is there sequential volume growth left in the U.S., and if so, do the pricing audit obviously are misleading because there is rebating or stocking effects that have impacted the growth. And if volume growth is underlying the result, is this coming primarily from new patients or longer duration of therapy? And then lastly, we've heard from some of the stent folks this quarter that the penetration of drug eluting stents is showing early signs of recovery, and I am wondering if that's impacted your results and if you anticipate this to be a noteworthy dynamic over the next 12 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Catherine I think that our premise is that we have stopped looking at the IMS data or at least we don't look at the IMS data as intensively as we did in the past, because there are a lot of inaccuracies that IMS itself acknowledges when they speak about PLAVIX. So we are focusing more on our sources and including looking at our net base. So if you take the Q2 UMS sales of PLAVIX, they were 19% versus &#x2013; in the U.S., 19% versus previous year. If you eliminate the effects of the Apotex last year in Q2 '07, we are at 12%. So in that 12% there is solid volume growth, not only price. And what we see is that the market dynamics had evolved in an interesting way. New patients that had been declining in 2007 have stabilized now, and this is due to the fact that stent procedures have stabilized after the decline of 2007. So, we still get new patients from that segment of the market, and that segment of the market is stabilizing as opposed to declining last year. Then we have all the other indications of PLAVIX, which is &#x2013; relative ACS medical, which is P.A.D. and both indications in our opinion will generate the additional growth opportunity for this product. We think about P.A.D. and polyvascular treatment. This combined with increased Lymphotherapy give us the possibility of maintaining a certain positive view of PLAVIX in the future.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. You very nicely addressed the PLAVIX EU situation. I'd like to ask a specific follow-up question. Schweizerhall said last week that the injunction in Germany does not apply to other countries. Is this consistent with your view that the injunction does not apply to other countries?  And relatedly, foreign PLAVIX sales were up only $6 million year-over-year in the second quarter, I realized it's a small base. But was there de-stocking in Europe ahead of a possible generic? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>let me start from the second question and then I will move to the first, and I'm not the lawyer, so I apologize for probably not being fully accurate. But on the first one, you may remember that we booked only a small portion of the in international sales of PLAVIX. We booked the full sales of PLAVIX in the U.S., Canada and other few countries, and the sales in Europe only in the markets where co-market with sanofi-aventis.</p>
          <p>In the rest of the world, outside the U.S. and Canada, it is sanofi-aventis that have booked these PLAVIX sales, and therefore our 6 million is not very indicative of the overall performance of PLAVIX outside of the United States. The legal situation in Europe, obviously, a German court can only rule on a German application and therefore what the German court has ruled about, or will rule about, will only apply to the German application. On the other hand we're not aware of any approvals that were granted by any other authorities outside of Germany, and therefore there is no court that should rule outside of Germany yet, because there has not been any action yet on the submission by Schweizerhall.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. I was just hoping that we can get a little bit of an update on the nutritional business and the plan for the nutritional business in the second half of 2008 and 2009, and also if you can help me better understand what happened in the nutritional business in the United States where the year-over-year growth certainly appeared to slowdown fairly substantially. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so let me just a take Mead Johnson in its totality.  What we are seeing in the Mead Johnson business is some very exciting growth which is driven by price and volume outside the United States, and we have some very important markets in the Far East which have been performing very, very well. Recently, just now making a comment on a U.S. business, and again a quarter is only a quarter, it's three months, we have seen some impact of pricing, and as a result less volume, and there has been some market share gained by one or two of the private label players over the last three to six months. So we made a concerted effort to increase prices, and one of the reasons to do that was to cover increasing commodity costs as you know dairy and other prices have actually had quite a rise, although they are coming down over the last three to six months.  And so that was the strategic reason behind our price increase, but that did as a result, given that it's a consumer business, have some impact on volume and gave some share to the private label competition. Lamberto, anything to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we can add that, obviously we are very, very happy about the evolution of sales on Mead Johnson outside of the U.S. But as far the U.S. is concerned, we have also identified where we are losing market share, without entering into many details, the identification of where we are losing market share is now prompting a clear action to keep consumers on our own products rather than switching to cheaper competitors. And this is something that is ongoing and our Mead Johnson team is working very actively at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So overall the business is performing well on the top line as well as the bottom line and we are very much on the track to file a registration statement prior to year end in advance of the IPO, which is expected to be between 10% to 20% of the company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. ABILIFY has seen a sharp uptick since the start of the year and I am wondering how much is that due to the new depression indication versus something like the DTC campaign that I think you are running for other indications. And then REYATAZ sales internationally in second quarter look very strong. Was there some sort of stocking for the product or is that just be underlying run rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with REYATAZ. No, there is no stocking. REYATAZ is doing extremely well everywhere. This is a strong product and we're very happy of its performance worldwide.  Probably one of the most, how can I say, most global product that we have. You must also remember that in Europe we had recently the inclusion of naive patients in our label. This is very important. This is for the first time ever that we got the possibility of promoting, and based on the label, the use in naive patients.  And obviously this gives additional opportunity to our European team to work on REYATAZ and  to European prescribers to use it.</p>
          <p>As far as ABILIFY is concerned, I'm very glad to say that there is a lot of elements that are supporting the growth for  ABILIFY.  So it's not just the one DTC campaign or one additional indication. First of all, there is a lot of good clinical data across all the indication of this product, and second there is a very strong very effective execution of our plan by our sales, marketing, and medical teams.</p>
          <p>We are making aggressive effort in all areas of our marketing strategy, including DTC, and the result of the DTC campaign obviously are important and obviously are very visible.  And then there is the newly approved Major Depressive Disorder indication that is important. This is the first time that a product like ABILIFY is approved for indication like that. I think that if you think of ABILIFY as a product with a low rate of sedation, and then a good weight control and a good weight and lipid profile, you understand that this is a product that can be interesting for patients affected with depression and for their prescribers. What we see &#x2013; we have started &#x2013; we launched 24 weeks ago, so we see that an increased awareness of this indication and an increasing intent to prescribe. We have increased our &#x2013; we have redeployed our sales force. So we have added to our traditional target, 15,000 additional prescribers, approximately 8,000 of the 15,000 are high potential depression primary care physicians. So we are reaching more doctors on this indication. And recently, we have agreed with Otsuka, our partner, to add another 10 to 12,000 primary care physicians to our global target by using approximately 70 reps that they, Otsuka, will contribute to the overall effort.</p>
          <p>So summary, a good story for ABILIFY, many elements of success, success in all three key indications and the confidence that we can continue to support the product aggressively with a good and diversified marketing activity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Thanks for taking the follow-up. A question related to PLAVIX for Lamberto and Elliott. Just wondering, Lamberto, in your plan for PLAVIX, are you assuming a launch of <mark type="inaudible" /> Prasugrel here in the back half? Is that taken into account in your plan and how prepared are you for competing at least in the cath lab against the data that you think Eli Lilly would have? And harsh reality has to do with OASIS 7 current trial. Has it been fully enrolled and when can we expect to see results? It would seem that that would be a pretty important trial for the sales force to have in the hospital segment. So any update there would be helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. I like this question, because I love to answer it. The way I said, if and when approved, Prasugrel at this point will be a niche product. But if it gets approved, we are ready to compete with it and in fact we have been ready for some time now. Why I say that it's a niche product. Well, the TRITON study, on which Prasugrel is basing their application, is going to be focused only on small ACS patient population, and that patient population represents approximately 15% of our PLAVIX base.</p>
          <p>On top of this, there are three important subgroup of patients in the TRITON study that seem to derive either net harm for no clinical &#x2013; net clinical benefit from Prasugrel. That means that Prasugrel, if approved, will compete on a limited number of patients, and with a different profile than the one we have. So we have one product that is one dose for all indications without patient exclusions, widely studied, much broader label, and therefore yes, we are ready to compete in the cath lab. If Prasugrel is approved, we will increase our hospital sales forces, both for ourselves and sanofi-aventis. We are using a lot of time on our medical field organization to focus on ensuring that the PLAVIX data and important real world information on the use of antiplatelets is disseminated to the medical community. We are already there, but we continue to work behind PLAVIX for all the indications that I indicated before and we are very confident that we will continue to see important results from PLAVIX. Now, you want to speak about currents Elliott?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, John, you mentioned on the OASIS or current trial, which is our high loading dose trial of PLAVIX; this will be important information that also tracks with guidelines that stress the early administration of this agent, not to wait till the patient is on the table. And I think this information should be available in March. Our outside investigators did announce recently that because of low event rate, which I think is good news for patients undergoing this treatment, the low event rate, we have increased our enrollment. And that has been progressing well and hopefully the data will be presented at a major conference in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me use that opportunity to reiterate there will be a continuing news flow from our clinical programs to support our marketed products as well as our development products. We have mentioned in the past, and I will reiterate, the complete profile of Saxagliptin will be much more visible, but with multiple Phase III programs being described at the European meeting for diabetes in September. This is the add-on to the sulfonylureas; it's an add-on to the TZDs and initial combo with metformin. So in addition to the prior Phase III programs that have been announced, you'll see the entire profile there.</p>
          <p>We also have some data that will be maturing, Phase II data with Apixaban on acute coronary syndrome. And this will be presented hopefully in September at the European Society for Cardiology. And that will be a very important indicator for some increased opportunity, very high value opportunity for Apixaban. As we've said before, Phase III data on the orthopedic indications will be presented in December at the ASH meeting.</p>
          <p>I'd like to call your attention though to the fact we haven't talked much about our clinical stage Alzheimer's programs. And this week, at the International Alzheimer's Conference in Chicago, we have two oral presentations, one in the Hot Topic session, and one on Sunday. The one on Sunday is the presentation of a microtubule stabilizer that has strong proof of concept preclinically for interrupting with the Tau pathway, and presumably the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's. That results from a collaboration we've had with the Mayo Clinic and also involves an important clinical compound that we've recently acquired though Kosan along with the backups in that program.</p>
          <p>In the Hot Topic section on Wednesday, we have the first data presented in humans in our Gamma Secretase program. We have been after a very selective compound that does decrease cerebrospinal fluid, a beta measurement at safe and tolerable doses, and that will be presented at the Hot Topic section on Wednesday.</p>

          <p>Thanks, John. And thanks everybody for your time and your questions. For some final comments, I'd like to turn it back to Jim.</p>

          <p>Thanks, John. It was a great quarter. It was the best since I have been here. Operationally, our strong financial performance was led most importantly by double-digit sales growth. As Elliott has just commented and previously in the Q&amp;A session, our clinical science is moving steadily forward though the regular progression of our portfolio, it is being complemented by business development strategies.</p>
          <p>Based on the success we have had with the first billion and a half productivity initiatives, we're about to execute another billion of productivity with our long-term future in mind. And finally, I believe we are well on our way to being a leading next-generation BioPharma company. Thanks very much for your attendance.</p>
