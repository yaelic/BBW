      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone.  Welcome to the Munich Re Analyst Conference.  Welcome on such a sunny day, a couple of housekeeping issues before we get started.  Basically today we have four presentations and afterwards we have the opportunity for Q&amp;A both from the room, as well as from the telephone and I expect that Q&amp;A round to start at around 3:30.</p>
          <p>Now the formal part of the presentation, including Q&amp;A, should then be finished around 4:00 and we then invite those investors and analysts who traveled to Munich to have some drinks and food with us and there's more time for further informal discussion.</p>
          <p>And I will now introduce the panel and I'm starting with my very right, on my very right, we have Jeff Davis, Head of Central Reserving, then we have Joachim Oechslin, our Chief Risk Officer.  Next to Joa is our CEO, Nikolaus von Bomhard, then we J&#xF6;rg Schneider, our CFO and my name is Sascha Bibert, I'm the Head of Investor &amp; Rating Agency Relations.</p>
          <p>Now before handing over I'm going to ask you to please switch off mobiles and BlackBerries.  This conference is transmitted over the web and those a technical issues can interfere with the equipment that we here in the room.</p>
          <p>And with that I am delighted to hand over to our CEO Nikolaus von Bomhard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, a good day to you, to some it's a very early morning and to some it's an afternoon. I'm glad to see so many of you here in Munich, but I'm also glad to know that so many do listen in. Well I think I should warm us, including myself, up a little bit for today's session and that's why I would like to take a little bit of a high level start.</p>
          <p>How do we see us in these times of uncertainty, turmoil and disruption?  I think we can see ourselves as a pretty solid rock. How do we want to be seen or what do we think we do offer to our shareholders and along of course with our shareholders to our clients and to our employees?  I think Munich Re offers a very solid combination of three different business segments.</p>
          <p>One, we are a global and leading company in reinsurance with very strong customer relationships with a deep and unique almost know-how as regards to risk.  Our risk expertise is outstanding and the third important ingredient is what I consider an almost unmatched franchise.</p>
          <p>Second, we do offer all of our investors an attractive primary insurance business, strong retail orientation, multi-brand strategy, multi-distribution strategy, focused region-wise on Europe and Asia. And thirdly our youngest child, if you like, we are one of, as we see it, only two truly international players in International Health, a new, a younger business segment.  Which we also think quite tangibly shows what one can achieve if you flexibly combine activities both in primary and reinsurance to after all of course create shareholder value.</p>
          <p>The good news being that all these three business segments are clearly profitable.  Running three business segments along each other of course offers, and this will be tangible today, offers a very strong diversification upside. Secondly, also fairly clear, I think we work off a very, very solid balance sheet and there's two features that make us hopefully different at least from some of our peers, a very clear underwriting focus and a lot of emphasis on our integrated risk management.</p>
          <p>And important here, it's not an academic exercise by some backroom boys, but this is an exercise that we have fully implemented, instilled in the entire organization of the Munich Re Group. Well the question that is asked rightly slow and frequently is and how about profitable growth?  And here of course we have to differentiate between the business segments.</p>
          <p>If you start with reinsurance and look into P&amp;C reinsurance, it is absolutely clear to us that this is not the time to grow your book into additional P&amp;C reinsurance. That's because we foresaw that. We started early enough to try to build as we call it intelligently smartly other opportunities to grow our book profitably.  This is talking about of course Changing Gear, could be product initiatives, distribution initiatives and what have you.</p>
          <p>Life reinsurance is a growth area for us; I come to that later on.  If we talk primary insurance I think it is also obvious that there is room for us grow with Torsten Oletzky and his team we have a management in place in D&#xFC;sseldorf that has set up a very ambitious strategic target for itself that both refers to Germany, here it's mostly what we call provision business, life and health.</p>
          <p>And at the same time of course getting the distribution power into the street again and of course it has to do with international expansion of directivities. The International Health is obviously a growing segment; they have the most ambitious targets out there.   I come back to those again.  After all what it's about however is growing the existing business profitability.  We think we have the resources in place to do so.  This is maybe more obvious with the financial resources, but it also is holding true for the human resources.</p>
          <p>We have over the last three; four years recreated the option space you need to be able with a free hand to develop the business.  We have the hands free, strong earnings are coming in actually so strong that we cannot fully deploy them on the profitability level that we have reached over time.  That is why capital management is so high on our list.</p>
          <p>Well, what you see here and now I start with Slide 1, is the program of the day. We have informed you the investors all as it regards our P&amp;C reinsurance business and ARGO on special investor's day, the next one to come in October is then life reinsurance.  So I will actually try only to update you on some of the Group initiatives, Changing Gear will play a role.</p>
          <p>We shall take a closer look also to our recent acquisitions because I'm personally convinced that we have entered these acquisitions very well prepared. We can swiftly execute on what we have set out as a post-merger integration target and I would like you to see to make it as tangible as possible so that you can full-heartedly support our approach here.</p>
          <p>Joa Oechslin, our Chief Risk Officer, then will update you on our what we call the regular risk capital disclosure and highlighting some model changes.  It's not a dead thing, it's still the thing and it will continue to live. There is a significant increase in our diversification benefit.  You know that already, but he will give you the details.  He will also introduce you first time to our strategic risk management framework.</p>
          <p>This is important for you I think to have a better understanding for our risk appetite, what is the kind of volatility we are ready to take and why?  And of course the intention is that you truly understand what risk position Munich Re is effectively holding and what could be or should be or is in fact the cost of equity we're working with.</p>
          <p>Jeff Davis then will fill a gap that we have left open for some time, the gap of transparency as regards the reserves.  We will disclose a lot more information first time today to you and it's split up between the US and non-US businesses. I may say already that we think we are prudently reserved, we do have margins, yes indeed we do.  But the expectations of massive reserve release in the near future is not high on our &#x2013; or it should not be high on your list.</p>
          <p>J&#xF6;rg Schneider then will close the presentations by presenting to you the first quarter, which in the morning was already presented to the media.  It is characterized the first quarter by a handful of major single individual losses and of course a challenging capital market environment.  The good news being we faired well through these difficult times and we can stick to what we call our target for the year.</p>
          <p>Well now let me start with a couple of details. Here what you see is what we have done; we're on Slide 4, over the last four years, what we have achieved.  This is the result not only of the hard market in reinsurance, it's way more as I see it the result of truly hard work and the described focus, focus on underwriting, focusing all what we do and this truly pays off now.</p>
          <p>We have for those who know us longer and deeply, we have reengineered the company in a sense that we have changed how we want to create value for our shareholders.  It's mostly happening today on the liability side of our balance sheet.  Accordingly we could take a very reserved approach to credit risk when we felt the pricing was not right, we shied away from it, if you like.  And the same was holding true for equity risk, which we downsized you could almost say dramatically over the last years.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, we could reallocate part of that capital into liability driven businesses, but as I already said, with the strong earnings coming in there was not enough business to be fed. Another good news is we hardly have any under-performers in the Group.  This is not only holding true for the business segments on the high level, but this is also holding true if you deeper into each of the businesses.</p>
          <p>The only case that we have maybe right now is Italy and you can rest assured that we work on these situations, either improve them or sold them otherwise; including a sale and that the tolerance at each of the upper levels in the Group to sustain under-performance over time is extremely limited.</p>
          <p>Cycle management and capital management, we use the term already, auto-insisters they belong together, that's the name of the game right now in P&amp;C reinsurance, no changes there.  And I will repeat that sentence at least twice today; we have no intention whatsoever to warehouse capital.</p>
          <p>Well so far so good.  As regards to the reserves, I said prudently reserved, yes.  We think we are, so it's an easier one for Jeff today to talk about reserves. The fact that we have a potential margin there on the reserving side does not mean that we try to manage earnings with that kind of a cushion, if you would like to call it a cushion.</p>
          <p>We think a conservative reserve profile is a necessity for a company like us. Certainly in times like today and it is not a luxury if you want to deliver sustainable returns. I think in terms of uncertainty and this structure the opportunities do and will arise. I don't know whether there will be more; it will depend of the markets development. But we want to have the powder dry when it comes to be able to picking up the lower hanging fruit. That is important to us.</p>
          <p>Well this is a summary of what we call our Changing Gear Program.  The Changing Gear Program is a program that is important to the entire Group, but the most tangible possibly it is within the P&amp;C reinsurance. The program is now 14 months old and the good news here at this point in time is it works.</p>
          <p>We can not yet shower you with success numbers and show this is what we produce because many of these initiative are initiatives where you have invest first, so the net income is negative even some times.  But it is moving the way we wanted it to move, so this is the good news, it works. There is no changes to our Changing Gear Program overall.</p>
          <p>The challenges I see today is you might call it even a happy problem is that the results over the last two years specifically have been coming in so well and so high that we have to normalize them down all the time and that leaves sometimes a funny taste in some people's mouth.  But the fact of matter is the results were just too good already and I personally have a hard time now to manage expectations.</p>
          <p>Well so far so good. Here you see a high, high level view of the ultimate targets for the three business segments.  2007, the old year, truly and nicely delivered on these targets, as I said, too good so.  But even if you normalize these last two years and certainly 2007 because Changing Gear only started in the early 2007, 2007 also on a normalized basis was well on track with what we wanted to achieve under the heading of Changing Gear.  And we are clearly on the path to achieve our 2010 targets.</p>
          <p>And I may add here and this is important, no one's sitting here now on the panel of these gentlemen, all the three running the business segments, the two Torstens and Wolfgang St&#xF6;gbauer, reinsurance, primary insurance and International Health, are personally committed to these targets to me.</p>
          <p>Well this is an overview of some of the initiatives and actually it shows also the status where we are with these initiatives.  Seven of these initiatives I will flesh out a little bit more going forward.  Some did in the past question whether this is not just a basket of different initiatives with no cohesion, no mastermind running them.  I can assure you there is a mastermind behind the master plan behind it.  It truly exists; it is not a conglomerate of random activities.  It is steered, it's <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>It's made up to be one entity of initiatives. Ultimately the goal of all these initiatives is to enhance profit, to enhance the value of the company.  Now let's go into the details of some of those.  I start with what I called the A examples, A standing for ambitious growth and here we start with life reinsurance.</p>
          <p>As I said, the life reinsurance they will be taking place in half a year from now more or less.  I should also start by saying that the life reinsurance had an early when it comes to Changing Gear because they started before we even called it Changing Gear because they started in 2006.</p>
          <p>No more, no less, it is a clear complete overhaul of our life reinsurance strategy what is being done here. We really went though all the villages of our life reinsurance universe and redefined the strategy of our reinsurance business.  The target is to double the value added by new business compared 2006 to 2011, which corresponds to more or less a 15% CAGR of our VANB.</p>
          <p>So what is standing behind these blocks here on Slide 9, if you talk about improving core business this is about, just two examples, our US life reinsurance.  We actually mentioned it in the past mostly in the context of a question would you acquire a reinsurance company, then we always refer to life only and said if at all it could be there.  But this is going well beyond this question; this is about really moving the Munich Re Group in life reinsurance in the US to a different position.</p>
          <p>And not just by trying to desperately add top line to our business, but by rather changing the skill sets and the appearance of our life reinsurance entity in US.  Of course it started with redefining strategy, we have new top people in place in the US already and they gain traction.</p>
          <p>We will most likely see an increase of our top line as well, but this is just a consequence, not the goal and some competitors already described what we do as and that is not from us, the sleeping giant is waking up. Well I take that as compliment.</p>
          <p>The second regional focus of improving the core book of business is Asia. In Asia we have not been at the let's say at the top of the reinsurance companies, our competitors.  We probably have been number three over the last years, quite different from P&amp;C.  We wanted to change that, we have two major ups now in Asia, Hong Kong and Singapore who with a full broad array of activities will make sure that we will leave a stronger footprint in Asia as a life reinsurance company.</p>
          <p>Part of the strategy actually you would also find in box three, investigate alternative distribution, so you see there's an overlap between these two strategies.  Alternative distribution means that we do to the extent our clients want us to and we feel there is strong movement in that direction to help them out by doing some of their job in their value chain.  So when it comes to IT systems for underwriting, when it comes to distribution support, be it direct distribution, for example.</p>
          <p>You name this service you could possibly think of, we will try to be as broadly present with different service offers to support the clients because what we feel in many of the businesses today rather do I have access to the client, but leave me alone with the rest.  So as much as we can cover from that value chain we will at of course competitive cost and then as a reinsurer all through fee or both be reimbursed for what we do.</p>
          <p>So alternative distribution could be assistance with assisting banks, for example, who want to enter the insurance business, it could be that we do the complete underwriting for a company, at least set up the entire IT system for the underwriting and so forth.  It's a long list of services.</p>
          <p>Non-traditional, number two, grow non-traditional business, just one example there.  There is a budget under way which is almost ready now to go into the market to support our clients with hedging variable annuity business.  That is of course at the boarder line between insurance, reinsurance and capital market business, but we feel a reinsurer has a lot to bring to the table and there's room for us because there will be few only who will be in a position to offer that service and business.</p>
          <p>So far I think to life reinsurance you will hear a lot more of that later this year. P&amp;C I said Changing Gear is pretty tangible when it comes to P&amp;C reinsurance.  This slide in one form or the other I think you have seen already.  We cannot put down all the 15 initiatives on one slide here, it would be too much, but you can categorize them.  At the heart of all of course is maintaining and developing our traditional reinsurance business, let's never forget that.</p>
          <p>But as was said, the times are such that it is not easy to grow this book now. But what we do is actually a strategy and we introduced it well in time before the market was really starting to soften as regard to products, niches, new distribution lines in reinsurance, getting closer to the client and even regional strategies.  Maybe two examples, one I think was presented to you already earlier on that was our Agro business.  It is a very nice piece of business.</p>
          <p>I know it so well because in 2001 I was responsible myself for that book on the board level.  At the time we had close to &#x20AC;200 million of business.  This year if everything goes right and it looks like it we probably have three times that top line and it is a very solid and profitable book of business with a combined ratio in the low 90s.</p>
          <p>And we do not see any reason to not assume that the growth we have shown over the last years will continue.  It is obvious with the growing demand for agricultural products of course governments will well think whether they can support in a WTO compatible manner the protection of the income or the farmers and that is of course insurance and then reinsurance.</p>
          <p>A recent regional strategy is Brazil, close to my heart because I was down there in the late 90s.  We just received the first reinsurance license of any reinsurance company to set up a subsidiary, a daughter company and I think it's 60 years that this monopoly was in place.  And now we are the first non-Brazilian reinsurer that opened an office in Brazil as a daughter company.  We are there for a coupe of years already.</p>
          <p>So far as to Changing Gear and our growth initiatives, they of course always have to live up to our hurdle rates as regards profitability. Talking about our second business segment, primary, again here only two slides.  Torsten Oletzky, I mentioned his program, he set up a program for the next five year, there's a German part of it, but there is a very important international part to it.  And when we talk growth this international part is even placed higher on the priority list than the German because the growth rates of course are double-digit if it comes to international expansion.  We have to focus region-wise here, region is Europe, mostly Eastern, Southeastern Europe, slightly Southwestern and Asia and it's a selected Asian approach, that is very important to us.</p>
          <p>We do have not only the financial resources in place, but also the human resources to do that and I admit the limiting factor here is human resources, to have enough people on board to be able to develop these businesses because many of these activities are greenfield activities. So you need quite some people do it on the ground in the very country.</p>
          <p>Sometime I do get asked are we too small as a primary insurer or are we too small to develop international businesses? I think this is the wrong question. The question is are we good enough to produce profitable business?  International primary business is not a scaling exercise. It's not about creating scale, there's the cost synergies that you produce by crossing your border are not extensive.  It's a revenue, it's a know-how, it's a skill game in the first place.</p>
          <p>It's not about costs, so size is not the matter. Do you have the minds, the brains in your company to do it and can you live up to the profitability level that you think is right for your company?  So that's why I think size is not the utmost question here, it's about are you able to do it. That is also why we think big acquisitions to pep up or to move quicker up the ladder here is not at the high end of our priority list.  I should not ever exclude anything, but the likelihood of a bigger acquisition to grow our primary book is low.</p>
          <p>Well, a very concrete example because I was there myself just recently, in our Asian strategy to internationalize ERGO, India and China are very high on our list and we're slightly ahead in India.  In India we have now the reinsurance company down on the ground for a couple of years in the market for more than 50 years and we have now three joint ventures on the way. The first one was one of International Health with a hospital group in India.  The second one was with HDFC Financial, very reputable company in India and the third one now the recent one was a joint venture to develop life insurance in India with HERO Group.</p>
          <p>I must say it was a pleasing experience for me being in India and being complimented by people who did not have any reason whatsoever. A journalist, for example, to congratulate me on the partners we have chosen and I can tell you that we took a lot of time to find the right partners.  Of course we could have started that business at least the year earlier if we were impatient and just tried to get it started to be in the media, as being in India as well.</p>
          <p>We did not do that, we took the time.  I think if you develop that kind of business in these countries patience is a virtue and we took all the time and we still take some time in China because I think in China it is even more the challenge to find the right partner whether you go national or through the provinces you should think a lot about that and really be sure that the partner you have is truly aligned to what you think is right.</p>
          <p>International Health, I said these are the guys with the highest flying aspirations, but the reason being of course they start from a lower base.  The market is not overfilled yet with competition, except we only see one other player that we consider truly international and strategy-wise close to us.  All the others are actually mostly national players.  Unfortunately we do observe that competitors both on the reinsurance and insurance side start to enter that business area as well.</p>
          <p>The good news still being that we are ahead of them and it's not so easy to replicate, it takes time and we are in that business for more than 10 years now, both sides, primarily and reinsurance. We do indeed combine here primary and reinsurance under one management group and that proved to be very helpful because it gives us full flexibility to be opportunistic when it comes to finding the right business model for the very feature of a market. That worked well.</p>
          <p>The challenge of course in health business is amongst other things the political risk, that's why we think you have to be active in different markets, not just in one and you have to have an understating how governments can and could react in specific situations. Overall we feel that our understanding is deep enough to make a good living and the last years proved us right.</p>
          <p>Here you see what I mean if I talk about multi-brands strategy, that is a very tangible example here, colorful even.  You see we are out there with a couple of different brands.  We appear as a reinsurer with the Munich Re brand, we have Sterling as the recently acquired brand, we are using the brands of our joint venture partners in India and China or we use the DKV or our TPA brand MetNet. We could not care less what the brand is.</p>
          <p>We don't think that in that business you need a universal brand because it's very local business. The different projects are developing nicely, they are very different the projects.  It goes from Spain to India; we presented that once where we built a hospital.  It's a capitation model that will start in the second half of 2008 to produce premium because we had to set up everything.  We are replacing here the government of the province and taking care of 150,000 lives in the province, plus at least twice as much tourists, twice as many tourists coming Dinya.</p>
          <p>That will take off very soon in this year.  Another very different example is what we do in the GCC countries.  One striking example to me always was the company we have set up for the government of Abu Dhabi, Daman insurance.  They just crossed the line of a million insureds.  We are running the company for them for a limited time.  Of course we are their exclusive reinsurer.  It's a nicely developing business and very profitable also for us and the government is also happy, what more can you ask for?</p>
          <p>Well the B examples, here I brought along only two.  B initiatives is about best in class and one I think that one has to bring along these days on the P&amp;C side is cycle management. It cannot mention enough.  This is the name of the game in traditional reinsurance growth and that traditional book is very, very difficult.  Again, I could say here patience is a virtue.  You have to know when to go into the market and broaden or extend you book and you have to know when to shrink it.</p>
          <p>This still today at least is rather shrinking days.  I'm very anxious to see what will happen July 1 and January 1 come the next renewals.  It's difficult to foresee that, external events may change the picture.  But as of today at least the best we can assume is a sideway movement, so it is important and as you see here in the little box on Slide 16, strategy is our, I would call, the cardinal virtues in these times.</p>
          <p>And the good news being that we started early enough to find other ways to develop our book and to at least to some extend refill what might drop out because we have to shrink the traditional reinsurance. This is our MGA businesses, our niche businesses and the products initiative that we have on the way, all under the heading of Changing Gear.  That is exactly why we did it because we could foresee that the market would slow down. Whether it will slow down dramatically we don't know so far and I always said that we are doing okay, but I don't know where it will stop.</p>
          <p>Another example coming from the primary segment is the ERGO operating model, EOM, as we call it, operations model; others call it the target operating model. We don't have to call it a target operating model because it's there.  And ERGO did invest a lot over the last three, four years and I sometimes was inclined to say that there was way too much internal focus at ERGO and they turned their back to both clients and markets.  We can change it now because this model is in place.</p>
          <p>Of course that will change also amongst others things, the efficiency of the way we do business, along with the efficiency of course costs will come down.  You see that here at the lower right corner of the slide and I can assure you that we will not stop by 2010.  All what we do there is a continuous process and here I may say some less nice words about things later on, here insurers still can learn a lot from banks. So we have some way to go, all of us, still and we will go this way.</p>
          <p>So the ERGO operations model is in place, it will continuously be improved and there is some deficiency gains for us to be picked up. Well, a little breakout if you stay within the ABC logic. I'd have to take a little break up here with the M and it is about mergers and acquisitions and I said it in the beginning and we said it when we acquired the companies we promised to you that to the extent possible we will try to keep you abreast about what did we do with these acquisitions, how do we integrate them successfully, less successful, where are the challenges.  Of course I'm here, there still, confronted with doubts when it comes to our M&amp;A strategy.</p>
          <p>I have brought along three examples, again from all the three business segments.  A recent one and the bigger one is Midland.  First of all let me show you we have learned lessons in the US compared to our last acquisition, which that is back more than 10 years already.  So we do it very differently this time.  Before we even acquired the company we had what we always called our M&amp;A toolbox ready, we have the PMI strategy and the PMI set up completely prepared.  We have sent one of our best people to Midland and to Princeton now specifically to help to integrate Midland into Munich Re America.</p>
          <p>This is well underway, we are slightly, well if you take the year '08, a lot in relative terms ahead of what we thought we can mange.  There's synergies, it's a split of cost and revenues synergies here and we are very well underway.  We could sell the transport company that belong to the Midland group, we could not hold it for legal reasons in the US, you're not suppose as a foreigner to hold a transport company.  We could sell it actually higher than we priced it in, into business case, so that worked well.</p>
          <p>And again and also we do see additional earnings potential because our business case as we have set it up when we set up everything for the acquisition was maybe a little bit too conservative.  This is good news and I can also tell you that the investment side we have a general conservative approach when it comes to investors and again here even the changes in the US market after signing, specifically closing was only in April, do not create any problem at our end, none, does not change our business case at all.</p>
          <p>So this is very underway, it's being actively managed Tony Kuczinski, CEO of Munich Re America and John Hayden, COO of the Midland Middle Group, they're working very closely together and meet regularly here with Peter R&#xF6;der, the board member responsible, with Torsten Jeworrek, with myself and we have our people on the ground to make sure this will be a success.</p>
          <p>Another one, a little older stemming from the primary side of our business is Isvi&#xE7;re, we acquired it in late 2006. Isvi&#xE7;re is a completely different set up when it comes to managed integration because this was a family-run business and that brings along challenges of it's own to transform a family-run business into a daughter company of a group like ERGO.</p>
          <p>Completely different corporate governance set up, completely different requirements also being a European company reporting in IFRS, halfs closing, what have you.  All that comes along with it has and have been implemented and instilled in Isvi&#xE7;re already.</p>
          <p>We have set up a holding company now because the life and pension business will be 100% our business, we will run it alone.  <mark type="inaudible" /> is still a 75/25 split, as being the majority shareholder.  You see here, of course, the timeline is relatively limited so far because we started only in 2006.  2007, of course, was a good year.  We did already, of course, check everything that has to do with reserving.  I think Jeff will not mention this today. It's too small for him but big enough for me and we did check the reserves of <mark type="inaudible" /> and the good news being everything's fine, everything's adequate.</p>
          <p>We did rehabilitate the health book, which did go at the cost of some of our net income.  All this is being done and we are very well underway in 2008.  And integration, of course, is not all done yet, but the good news also being that on the sales side we did not suffer from the fact that the family owner is not the maturity owner anymore.  And you can imagine that in a country like Turkey, the family left a strong footprint in sales.  And now having a different shareholder, the risk was high that we might lose on the sales side just for the fact that the company is perceived as a non-Turkish company now, did not happen.</p>
          <p>Last example on the M&amp;A side is Sterling, a recent acquisition in the US in the senior and the retail, re-health segment in the US.  Here, they are slightly behind, Midland when it comes to integration because they started later.  The signing was a little later.  The closing was almost the same day, early in April, but as well here we have our best people on the ground to help to integrate Sterling.  And it is interesting also.  Sterling and Midland have a couple of things in common.  Not only size-wise, it is also about the management.  We do mentality-wise feel very close to the top management of these companies.  They are very down to earth people, very reliable and trustworthy people.  I don't want to insinuate that on the coast it's sometimes difficult to find this people but there are people that give that sort of heartland US feeling to me and it runs very well.</p>
          <p>The integration is on the way.  Important and this is different from Midland to some extent, Sterling is not so much the case of cost synergies because it's an add-on, a bolt-on acquisition to the existing health book that we have on the ground already in the US.  So it's rather, so when it comes to cost kind of synergies, it's actually only capital.  We can run the company more efficiently as regards to capital and we do have things to our &#x2013; tax carryforwards of course, a tax issue there positively because they want to pay taxes for the short-term or foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>But way more important here is the revenues side.  And I may add here that I personally also have a slight preference for revenue synergies over cost because the history tells us if you are too wild and too heftily pursuing cost synergies, you risk managing down the business you acquired.  So you have to really take a smart hand, I wouldn't call it a soft hand, a smart hand to balance out cost synergy and the revenue synergies because if you make it a cost efficiency case only normally, you end up with half of what you have bought from it.  So it must be done very smartly.</p>
          <p>Here is the revenue case in the first place.  We are well on our way as I said, closely manage the integration like we do with Midland and we also do incentivize all the people who are owning the business to this very acquisition.  So the business plan, as I called it zero, the first one that was the basis for the acquisition is in their personal target and they have to deliver on that business case.  There is no way that someone says, too bad, things changed.  We have to rewrite the business plan, too bad.  The business plans stays and they personally have to commit themselves to deliver on their business plan.</p>
          <p>Coming back to the AVC, with a C and these are my last two slides.  We promised to deliver and I think we did deliver.  What you see is the minimum targets we have set up.  You see them on the slides.  We always said this is the least we want to do.  We are entering the market right now with the next repurchase program, the billion that we have set as a target until the General Assembly 2009 and we are as of today starting to reenter the market and the question &#x2013; okay.  Thank you.  And the question will be of course, how do we proceed.  I do not commit myself now to things I don't know.  Let us cross the bridge once we get there.  One thing is for sure and I said I will repeat the sentence at least twice here's the second time.</p>
          <p>We are not interested in warehousing capital just for the sake of it.  But we do want a conservative capital structure in place.  We have a strong balance sheet.  We know that and we think this is a very important part of our value proposition to our clients certainly more on reinsurance than in primary.  But it is an important upside for Munich Re in today's environment and all through the history of Munich Re, this was always with very few and short exceptions, one of the key ingredients of our value proposition in general.</p>
          <p>Yes.  Organic growth and that is no secret and I mentioned it will not to be big enough, at least as far as I can see to consume all the capital that we produce.  So we have that sort of happy problem to sort of get rid of it.  And don't get worried of course it will not be M&amp;A just for the sake of getting rid of capital here.</p>
          <p>The diversification is so strong in our group now thanks to the three business segment we run that every business we add is not just a straight-forward add on to the risk capital position, many times its less thanks to diversification in place.  And that is why it's so hard for us to deploy the capital we make.</p>
          <p>We don't keep buffers for M&amp;A.  Of course smaller acquisitions and so far we did, I would consider all of them smaller.  We could do out of the current earnings stream.  But once they and should they get bigger, could be international health, then we would talk to the capital market and we will not warehouse and that's the last time I mentioned it capital just to be able to do it without talking to anyone.</p>
          <p>And I think a last comment on ROE.  When we first came up with our target of 12%, here and there we received a big smile.  Now we have the third year where we delivered the 12%.  I personally think 12% is not bad.  Sometimes get asked shouldn't it be more?  Of course I wish to have more, but if you look and Joe will show that to you and my last slide again will refer back to that and our cost of capital.  Wherever it is, it should be south of the 8 and the 12% to start it is not bad.  So if you believe that this is 8%, then you could only have questioned whether we can sustainably deliver 12.  Fair enough you can do that.  Three years we did.  This year, J&#xF6;rg later on will reconfirm that we think again, we could deliver the 12.  To deliver the 12 is not our main target, it's the RORAC target.  But we always look at the ROE as well.</p>
          <p>And now &#x2013; what I wanted to mention, as regard to things that are less nice.  The banks did deliver that 20% over the last years or more some even did.  But one and I always already at the time did ask myself is that the fair price for the risk they run.  At the time no one really listened to me because I had this discussion even with some of you up and down whether the EEV is exposed or isn't it exposed.  And my argument was there is way more exposed and with the benefit of hindsight today at least I would question whether the 20% was high enough, and that our 12% no matter what you compare it with is a pretty good return.</p>
          <p>It does not mean that we should not try to improve it, by improving our capital structure, or trying even to grow our ERM without losing more EEV.  Of course, we will try to do that but I think the 12% is not taken for what it is and I think it is a good result . We did not over expose the EEV nor did we one-dimensionally try to squeeze the business to produce a huge ROE.  I can only say what I always said this is not taking care of risk and if you really look deep into the businesses, I think sometimes a 12% with a moderately, correctly exposed EEV is a better return than a 20% with a heavily and sometimes unreasonably exposed EEV .</p>
          <p>So far from my end and now it's up to J&#xF6;rg.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Well ladies and gentlemen; this is the first time I have the pleasure to talk to the analyst and the investor community on behalf of Munich Re.  I am now with the company some eight months and I have a good &#x2013; had time to get a good understanding of the group, its businesses, its risk return profile as well as on its integrated risk management processes.  Fortunately, I can say that during these eight months I've not been coming across anything that did shock me, did surprise me, that I didn't know, should have known but nobody told me so I'm glad.</p>
          <p>Munich Re has invested materially in enterprise risk management over the past years and there is a very solid risk infrastructure in terms of risk governance, risk assessment, risk models, but also risk management in place.  Risk infrastructure is embedded in the business, in the governance and how we make decisions very strongly.  So it's an excellent basis for me to start very clearly, but that does not mean that there is nothing to do anymore for me and I have also used this first month to think after priorities.  And before I go into the real subject of risk exposures and risk appetite let me just spend five minutes on explaining these priorities to you.</p>
          <p>And to do that, let me take a step back and talk about how enterprise risk management has been developing, where we come from and where we go.  Let me go very quickly back to the late 90's, very clearly a phase of growth everybody had growth in mind, not profitability.  And enterprise risk management those times wasn't centralized.  There were different functions doing risk management in different segments of the business, in investments, in underwriting and so on, very little coordination, very little centralized frameworks.  We all know that.</p>
          <p>Then came the crisis 2001, 2002 and that has changed things.  First of all, the focus has changed and we went into a focus of restoring, restoring earnings, restoring capital, restoring frankly, also the credibility of the management.  And in that face came a new approach to enterprise risk management.  I will call that an emancipation phase of enterprise risk management.</p>
          <p>We have been establishing chief risk officers, establishing risk governance, we have been developing models, frankly, in this emancipation phase, a lot of the discussion was centered around technical things like how to measure, how to model risks.  ALM has been improved, market consistent valuation have been introduced.  So all-in-all building the technical foundation, and I think now, we are again in a different phase.  We're in a phase of profitable growth again, in the industry, so it's not anymore the restoring of capital and creditability, it's really about growth and risk management needs to come into a different mode here as well.</p>
          <p>And I believe risk management or enterprise risk management needs develop into what I call a business enabler.  We need to make clear where we can contribute to the development of our businesses and not just be the policeman of an insurance company.  I think that's the general thing.  Now coming to Munich Re, I think clearly the integrated risk management processes at Munich Re have passed the stage of emancipation.  We are towards the right end of this chart.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, it's not all perfect yet.  Very clearly there are some priorities that I've been setting that still fall into this emancipation phase technical things.  I would like to briefly mention just two things.  We have been launching a comprehensive program in our group to strengthen the internal control framework.</p>
          <p>What we're essentially going to do is to integrate the various control frameworks we have around compliance, operational risk, strategic risks and so on into a central control framework that will take some of the attention.  And another priority is clearly to further develop our risk models.  And I'm going to talk about some these developments that we have already done now in a minute, when we come to the risk capital numbers.  But really my primary focus is not the technical groundwork because if that is already very good, it's really to develop the risk management function to a business enabler.</p>
          <p>I will make just one &#x2013; two or three small examples.  The first example for me is the strategic risk management framework.  I'm going to talk to you about this today.  Strategic risk management is business enabling for me.  It takes the next step from measuring risks, which we have been concerned within the past to using this transparency and managing these risks top down, that is business enabling for me.</p>
          <p>Another example, and Nikolaus von Bomhard has already mentioned that, is to enable new sorts of products.  And products are more and more designed today with risk management and risk transfer consideration in mind.  Let me make an example, variable in annuities.  Nikolaus von Bomhard has mentioned that.  Variable annuities life insurance product is a product that is now emerging in Europe, in the US 20 years ago, that are designed with risk management consideration with hedging strategies in the background.  Hedging and managing risk of the variable annuity product is a internal part of the production of these sort of products and those risk management isn't unable for developing the business in this particular area.</p>
          <p>And a last example is turning Solvency II in an opportunity for reinsures; Munich Re has been some 12 or 18 months ago, establishing a so-called solvency consulting team.  The objective of that team is to advice our clients in designing the risk transfer and thus improve the relationship and strengthen the relationship we have with our clients.</p>
          <p>This solvency consulting team has now been merged with the risk management team, with my group and the purpose of that merge is that we can bring our experience in enterprise risk management and Solvency II directly to our clients and help our clients to structure the risk transfer in a way that optimizes Solvency II.  This is another form of enabling business for me.</p>
          <p>Well with that, I would like to come to the real matters of today.  First of all the group risk profile as per year-end 2007.  Before we look at the number, let me just remind you of how these risk models and numbers that I'm going to show you are embedded in the group, in the governance of the group.</p>
          <p>We do assess these numbers on a quarterly basis.  We do discuss economic risk capital numbers in various risk management bodies throughout the group, in the group risk committee and in the risk committees of the two segments, Primary Insurance and Reinsurance.  So top financials are exposed to these numbs.  We discuss them.  And more importantly, these number are embedded in various business processes, such as strategic risk management, going to discuss that today; capital allocation and more importantly pricing.</p>
          <p>Economic risk capital numbers directly influence the pricing of our insurance contacts.  It goes into performs measurement, it goes into &#x2013; it's embedded in the annual planning process and so forth.</p>
          <p>Our risk models and the numbers you see are consistent with the principals that are emerging on the Solvency II.  We are intending to use our internal risk models directly as internal risk model in Solvency II as of 2011 and 12 when Solvency II is likely to be in force.  We did disclose the results of these risk models consistently on an annual basis since 2001.</p>
          <p>But now let's come to the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>J&#xF6;rg just give me a second.  By the way, we have realized that we have a problem.  We're working on that.  Fortunately if I may say, it's just in the room, it's not on the Internet and we're trying to fix that problem with the screen.  I hope that we get it done otherwise we'll have a little headache, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our risk exposure has declined from year-end 2006 to year-end 2007 by some 11% from 18.4 billion as of year-end 2006 to &#x20AC;16.4 billion as per year-end 2007.  Most of this decline in risk exposures actually comes from the reinsurance segment and within the reinsurance segment mostly from a reduction of capital market risks.  The exposure to capital markets has been declining by to some 26% over the year, mainly due to a reduction of equity exposures through both straight sales as well as protecting through options.</p>
          <p>The equity quota has been reduced from 14.1% at year-end 2006 to some 10.8% as of year-end 2007 and actually has been further reduced to 7 point something as per end of March this year.</p>
          <p>Credit risk has been mainly unchanged.  Note that the trade credit risk we were running on the insurance side of our businesses is actually included in the P&amp;C segment rather in the credit risk segment.  P&amp;C risk has also declined by 7% roughly during the year 2007 and that is mainly driven by an update of our Atlantic hurricane exposures as well as updates of terrorism exposure.</p>
          <p>Our Life and Health risk has increases by some 13% mainly due to portfolio growth in life reinsurance mainly in the US but also due to an update of pandemic modeling that has been contributing and these increases were partly offset by the devaluation of the US dollar against the euro in 2007.</p>
          <p>Prime reinsurance segment increased by some 11%.  Market risk is almost unchanged, actually in fact slightly down.  Credit risk somewhat lower now as per year-end 2007 due to the reduction of corporate bond exposure at the ERGO holding.</p>
          <p>Property and Casualty risks at ERGO is up and it seems to be large in term of percentage but in absolute numbers, it's not very material and that has a technical reason to a certain extent.  We have been including three of our international businesses at ERGO fully into our risk model.  Previously, they have been included as a participation, and has been summarize under the market risk.  And now we have included them fully and the risks are spread under various categories and this is why the P&amp;C risk actually goes up.   There is also some exposure updates that we have done in the German markets specifically also considering the European strong period and in our models.</p>
          <p>Life and Health increased as well by some more than 50% in absolute terms also relatively small numbers.  The primary reason for this increase is the large increase of market consistent embedded value that we have seen that we shown to you on February 25th, with the disclosure of the MCEV figures.  Higher MCEV also means higher MCEV at risk, and that is essentially our risk measure that we have here and there are some other effects that drive this number.</p>
          <p>So all-in-all the risk is down.  We have been reducing risk and you can also see that in Munich Re's own data.  There is a further reduction of our Munich Re stocks beta visible.  In absolute terms the beta is now below one for more than a year.  With that Munich Re's cost of capital has been declining further and is now in the order of magnitude of 8%, we believe or even a little bit low than that.  Note that Munich Re's beta compared to the industry's beta is only about two-third of the industries beta.  It's been the other way around back in 2003.</p>
          <p>Now the figures I've just shown you are on a comparable basis.  That means the year-end 2007 figures did not include a number of model changes that we have done throughout the year 2007.  And I'm going to explain you what these model changes are very briefly.</p>
          <p>First of all, we have changed our risk measure.  The previous risk measure that we have used for years has been two consecutive, 1-in-100-year losses.  That is a very appealing and intuitive risk measure; two consecutive 1-in-100-year loses.  But in practice, it was actually difficult to work with.  It required to modeling of the first 1-in-100-year loss, then an update of the exposures after this first loss and then modeling a second loss on the updated exposures.  This resulted in difficulty, specifically in analyzing the results because of you always need to have two steps, analyze what happened in the first loss and then analyzing what happened on the second loss in terms of the reduced exposures.</p>
          <p>So that has been adding complexity.  The new measure that we have chosen is clearly less complex.  The new measure is actually based on a simple value at risk to the 99.5 level of confidence over 200 year &#x2013; once in 200 year loss and we take 175% of this value at risk 99.5.</p>
          <p>So why do we do that? Why 99.5 value at risk?  A number of reasons for that, but specifically Solvency II is going to evaluate risk 99.5%.  That will make it easier for us, so we are basing our risk measure on something that is the standard on the Solvency II.</p>
          <p>Why 175%?  Because if that bring us back to what we had earlier namely, roughly the confidence of two consecutive 1-in-100 year losses roughly.  175% of VaR 99.5 equals roughly a 99.98% confidence level and that reflects our AA to AAA rating ambition.  So that's the first change.</p>
          <p>The second change is a change in aggregation methodology, how we aggregate risks between the reinsurance segment and prime insurance segment of our group.  Previously, that has been done using a relatively simple approach using covariance aggregation, also recognizing tail dependencies using Acopula and actually for certain businesses we have just simply added the exposures because of it was difficult to model with the tools that we had at that time, specifically for the primary insurance life and house business.  These exposures were just simply added without considering any diversification in the past.</p>
          <p>Now what we have done is we have introduce the technology of replicating portfolios consistently also for the Life Insurance business, Primary Insurance business and the replicating portfolios allow us to much better quantify these risks and improve the aggregation methodology.  So what we now do is we are assimilating a large number, 10,000 scenarios, real world scenarios and apply those sceneries equally to the reinsurance and the Primary Insurance business and then aggregate scenario by scenario.  And that allows us a much better reflection of diversification between reinsurance and prime insurance business, and you will see that this would change the number in terms of diversification at our group considerably.</p>
          <p>Other model enhancements, I was talking about that already.  We have been introducing replicating portfolios, which allows us to more precisely quantify the exposures.  And another change we did is we strengthened the tail dependencies between various risk categories at notably between asset risks and insurance risks.</p>
          <p>We did &#x2013; we do reflect also certain model uncertainties we have with increasing these tail dependencies.  And we accounted for these uncertainties previously already, but only in terms of stress test.  So if you look at our 2006 year-end disclosure and previous years, you will see the stress test.  We have now incorporated to the stress test into the model.  They're part of the model now.</p>
          <p>Now what does that do to the number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>In order to prevent the headache that I was alluding to, we have now switched off, that is not visible on the Internet.  So we will just do it on paper right now and sometimes maybe you want to mention the slide numbers then we are sure that everyone is following you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  I'm on Page 32 right now.  And I will show you the impact of this Re changes to the model.  We started with 16.4, which you have seen on the previous slides.  The change of risk measure added some &#x20AC;1.7 billion to the required capital.  A change in aggregation methodology did take away some 2.5 billion from it.  And finally, the other model changes and primarily the stronger tail dependencies added another 0.9 billion and that actually brings us back to 16.5 billion, which is very close to the original number.  However, the individual changes are actually material while your oil change is not very relevant.  That was a sign for me for me that the risk models as we have applied it in the past were actually good.  We're capturing the exposures; we have now a slightly different breakdown of these exposures.</p>
          <p>These changes &#x2013; now while I was to also show the results in a different form and that is what you can see here on this next slide.  Those are the results according to the changed models.  Note that we now show the aggregate risk exposure at the group level also by individual risk classes.  So the 7.0 billion for property and causality, the 3.3 for life and health, I've not been able to show that and you've not seen that in the past.</p>
          <p>And secondly, we have stripped out the operational risk charge that was previously included in the four other categories.  We have now separated that to provide more transparency.</p>
          <p>Let's now have a look at the right column at the bottom.  This number minus 2 billion, is the diversification effect that we have between the primary insurance business and the reinsurance business in the group.  These 2 billion in the old model have been 0.5 billion.  So there is a very significant change in how we assess the diversification between the two businesses in our group.  That is now a realistic assessment, I believe, of the diversification between primary insurance and reinsurance business and this was possible through the change of these models.</p>
          <p>Now clearly model changes or a cumbersome something for you as analysts, but nevertheless risk model they develop and they should develop.  I believe we have now developed the structure in a way that will not see significant structural changes in that model.  I don't believe that, that's about it.  Clearly there will be improvements from year-to-year on the models and we're already working on some.  But I hope no major things.</p>
          <p>Now let's come to the available financial resources.  The number we need to compare with the economic risk capital and we usually start with IFRS equity.  That was &#x20AC;25.5 billion as per year-end 2007.  We then add a number of adjustment valuation reserves mainly on real estate, the valuation adjustment on P&amp;C and Life and Health business.  That is primarily the discount of reserve.  That is not in the IFRS balance sheet for the P&amp;C business.  But that is also embedded value uplift, as we call it, so the portion of embedded value that is not recognized in the IFRS equity.</p>
          <p>We deduct the intangible assets, goodwill, 3.9 billion adjust for tax assets and end up with what we cal the economic equity of 29.4 billion as per year-end.  And we than also add the Hybrid capital.  On top of it when we are ending up with a risk bearing capacity with available financial resources of &#x20AC;34.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me show you how that develop over the year.  We started the year was &#x20AC;30.9 billion available financial resources.  Our IFRS profit was added to that, 3.9 billion.  There has been a change in valuation reserves across the year in the IFRS equity that didn't go through P&amp;L, minus &#x20AC;1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>We did dividend out and give back to investors some &#x20AC;3.3 billion in terms of dividends and share buyback across 2007.  And we had a change of the economic adjustments all-in-all of some positive &#x20AC;2.9 billion.  A large share about two-third, of that &#x20AC;2.9 billion comes from the increase of embedded value or what the &#x2013; or what is recognized in the IFRS equity and the remainder, roughly one-third, is actually coming from a model harmonization.  We have been harmonizing the way we quantify the market value margin across our segments and that is roughly one-third.  And then we have been issuing 1.5 billion of Hybrid capital in 2007 and that brings us to the 34.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let me summarize all of this on this chart.  Available financial resources 34.3 billion, economic capital required 16.5 billion.  That leaves us with quite a considerable economic capital offer.</p>
          <p>Adjusting for dividends we have by now already paid for the year 2007.  In 2008 the buffer is some &#x20AC;16.3 billion and that is actually up by some 5.5 billion from the end of last year.  So the equation is relatively simple.  We have reduced our risk exposure by some &#x20AC;2 billion.  We have added some &#x20AC;3.5 billion in terms of financial strengths and that brings us to the 5 billion.</p>
          <p>Clearly this economic capital buffer is strong as Nikolaus von Bomhard has already been talking about that.  Clearly it also will fluctuate, no question right?  And I can give you some indication of how it already has fluctuated towards the end of the first quarter.  The developments on the equity markets have been reducing our IFRS equity; have also been reducing our available financial resources in the order of magnitude between 1 and 1.5 billion from the year-end level.  Munich Re is also prepared to carefully increase its exposures specifically to market risk and specifically to credit risk now that we see opportunities arise in the capital markets and that is another source of changes in the economic capital buffer.</p>
          <p>And with these remarks on capitalization, I would like to lead over to our next topic, which is how we manage our risks strategically.  I call that the Strategic Risk Management Framework.  For simplicity I will just say SRMF to not get tired of this loan expression.</p>
          <p>This is the first time we are discussing the Strategic Risk Management Framework publicly with analysts and investors.  The purpose of the SRMF is to manage, to explicitly define and mange the risk appetite the group has and cascade the risk appetites down to the individual businesses, deviation, lines of business.  This is top down process, not a bottom up like risk measurement.</p>
          <p>The Strategic Risk Management Framework complements the business strategy.  It's not the same, it complements the business strategy.  In the first place, with the SRMF is actually an input factor into the business planning and its place annually.  On the other hand, insight from the business planning process can in turn influence the strategic risk appetite.  So it's a give and take.  It's interaction and this is why it is complementary.</p>
          <p>The strategic risk appetite is determined with three objectives in mind.  It's to protect shareholder value and sustainably generate shareholder value, number one, second is ensure highest degree of confidence in meeting policyholder claims; and thirdly, to protect the reputation of the group.</p>
          <p>The Strategic Risk Management Framework is deeply rooted in the economics steering concepts that we use and particularly the economic risk capital you will see that.  But it actually also uses more traditional risk measures such as exposure data and simple PML daytime.  Why do we do that?  We believe these traditional risk measures make the Strategic Risk Management Framework more robust.</p>
          <p>Statistical risk measures, such as a value at risk, they are great, but they have certain disadvantages and I believe the banking industry has just experienced what the shortcoming of certain value at risk and statistical risk measures is and this is why we actually complement these statistical measures with very simple exposures measures.  So these traditional measures improve the robustness of the Strategic Risk Management Framework.</p>
          <p>Now SRMF consist of two major building blocks.  I would say those are the whole portfolio criteria as well as the supplementary criteria.  The objective of the whole portfolio criteria is to express the overall risk appetite of the group, taking all risk categories into account and specifically taking into account how they actually correlate with each other.</p>
          <p>Within the whole portfolio criteria we have two sub criteria.  It's the financial strength criteria with the objective to ensure highest confidence in meeting policyholder claims and secondly, the financial distress criteria, which is more geared towards protecting and generating sustainable shareholder value.  Whole portfolio criteria are actually based on the statistical risk measures like value at risk and earnings at risk.</p>
          <p>While the supplementary risk criteria, we have also two.  We have essentially peak risk limits, such as for NatCat perils, pandemic exposures, terrorism exposure but also maximum per risk retention, these sort of things, whose objective is to manage concentration and actually enforce a certain level of diversification.  And we have also asset liability management appetite criteria's and these criteria's are more based on traditional risk measures.</p>
          <p>Now we are on Page 40, on the financial strength criteria.  The financial strength criteria actually is made up of three sub-criteria as well.  It's the internal model criteria, either criteria that the group available financial resources needs to exceed our economic risk capital, which is comfortably the case, as we have seen on previous slides with the 16 billion buffer.</p>
          <p>Secondly the regulatory capital according to Solvency I.  Also this one is very comfortably passed with, I think 342%, that's per year-end 2007 and is very unlikely to become a constraint any time soon.  And so did the rating agency capital requirement with a AA target rating in mind.  There is improving <mark type="inaudible" /> as well on this dimension.  But clearly it's still the tightest of the three sub-criteria in term of financial strength.  But overall, in terms of financial strength that clearly is the answer and we are very solid in term of financial strength on all dimensions.</p>
          <p>Now we're coming to the most interesting criteria I think, the financial distress criteria.  The risk appetite that we have given ourselves in terms of financial distress is constraining us the most.  We're actually almost fully exploiting that at this point in time.</p>
          <p>What do we mean precisely by a financial distress criteria or what we do we mean with financial distress?  We mean a situation in where the cost of financing for Munich Re is increasing sharply due to either severe losses, raw material uncertainty or loss of confidence in management, either of these reasons.</p>
          <p>We are using an earnings-at-risk criteria to define our risk appetite for financial distress risk.  And when I say earning-at-risk, I mean economic earnings at risk rather than accounting earnings at risk. The economic earnings are derived from the change of available financial resources over a year before any capital management measures such as dividend or share buyback. So it's essentially the growth or the development of the AFR before any capital is distributed to shareholders.</p>
          <p>We start our consideration with the expected economic earnings for the year, which is the gray bar on this chart; on the left side of this chart. These economic earnings are always slightly higher than the planed IFRS earnings so they are north of 3, &#x20AC;3.5 billion for the year 2008. And then we are actually defining our risk appetite, such that to have positive economic earnings in nine out of ten years.</p>
          <p>We'll put it in other words, we accept to have negative economic earnings once in ten years. Now, we've been thinking a lot, is that right? Is that too much? Is that too little, right? We have been doing in-depth analysis and had looked at lots of publicly listed companies and have analyzed how many times are they actually delivering earnings, and less than zero or negative earnings. And obviously, we have analyzed accounting figures rather than economic earnings and take that as an indicator.</p>
          <p>But actually, the outcome is, in average, listed companies over a very long period in time show negative earnings once in ten years, roughly. And that makes us confident that this is a reasonable risk appetite for us. As I said, we are exploiting this risk appetite currently and that is what the graph shows you.</p>
          <p>Let me now come to the supplementary risk criteria and let me start with the one for asset liability management. Munich Re purposely takes on capital market risks through a liability-driven and investment process. We do that for a number of reasons. We do that to reflect policyholder's expectation in the Primary Insurance, life and pursuit of health, business.</p>
          <p>We do that to balance and improve the Group's risk return profile also having the risk return profile of our peers in mind. And frankly, we also do that to create value through out-performance of the relevant benchmarks.</p>
          <p>As you know, Munich Re is managing its investments based on a benchmark portfolio approach. The REIT, the insurance companies, actually define a benchmark asset allocation on considering the boundaries of the strategic risk management framework and considering the liabilities, and these benchmark portfolios actually partly already include certain protection. For example, for equity risks; that's already part of the benchmark in certain instances.</p>
          <p>And then these benchmarks are handed over to MEAG our investment manager in the Group, our asset manager, and MEAG is actually managing the portfolios relative to those benchmarks.</p>
          <p>Now as I said, the strategic risk management framework is the framework to define these benchmarks and actually to run the investments, the real tactical investment strategy. Now how do we define the strategic risk tolerances for ALM risks? We define, essentially, four value-at-risk limits for market risk and for credit risk, on the one hand, and for the Reinsurance and the Primary Insurance business. And in the Primary Insurance business, we break that down to the major legal entities.</p>
          <p>So we set four value-at-risk limits and these limits are actually derived from a stochastic analysis of the Group's P&amp;L projected over a ten-year period in a number of thousands of real growth scenarios, actually considering new business that is being written in those ten years.</p>
          <p>The goal of this stochastic analysis is to find the level of market risk and that optimizes a certain utility function. This utility function is made up of three components for which management allocates a weight, each, and those three utility components are minimizing financial distress, maximizing total return, and to a much lesser degree, minimizing the difference that we have to peers in terms of investment strategy.</p>
          <p>As you can see, these limits have only been utilized to a certain degree as per end of March. These numbers are actually end-of-March numbers. Specifically in the Reinsurance Company, we have utilizations around 50%, in ERGO a little bit higher. So we do have room, in terms of strategic risk appetite, to increase these exposures carefully; not dramatically, but carefully.</p>
          <p>Let me just make two concluding comments on investment strategy. This equity protection strategy has actually worked well. You remember the level of protection that is built-in in the benchmark portfolio already, has been leading to the fact that we have been reducing exposures in Q1 and we have been living very good with this strategy. And as I said, Munich Re is prepared to enter certain positions when we believe there are opportunities.</p>
          <p>Page 43. Let's come to the supplementary risk criteria on insurance risk. The purpose of those is to limit the maximum loss from any single systematic risk-type to ensure that we do not over concentrate in any single risk and also reduce, actually, the risk of model; the model on certainty. We do that by setting limits for very remote events and that is usually the 1:1000-year loss, so the 1000-year P&amp;L or the 1000-year value-at-risk that we are looking at in a percentage of the available financial resources. That's how we express our risk appetite for these insurance scenarios.</p>
          <p>Our strategy is to not over hedge expect on a digestible short-term volatility. And with that, actually, minimize the reliance on risk transfer and also keep the profits in house. So we do not over hedge ourselves. And we do have a different risk appetite for the following scenarios. You can see that in the bottom part of the chart; NatCat, by scenario. We do have a limit: terrorism, pandemic scenarios, but also individual risk accumulations in the life and non-life business. These limits are reviewed at least annually and reflect business opportunities and are around in the markets.</p>
          <p>In order to make an example, I show you the two most relevant NatCat scenarios, which is Storm Europe and as well as Atlantic hurricane. Both gross and net of risk transfer for different return periods: 25, 100, 200 and 1000 years.</p>
          <p>The Storm Europe scenario is actually the largest with 1000-year valued risk of some &#x20AC;5.5 billion, and this scenario is close to what is our risk appetite for NatCat scenarios. We do look at some 30 or more individual NatCat scenarios; each of those, individually, is subject to this risk appetite. These individual scenarios have relatively little correlation between each other and with other insurance risks.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the combined risk from all of these NatCat scenarios, obviously, is subject to the whole portfolio criteria that we have been discussing earlier. Munich Re has been disclosing these numbers in the past. This time we have actually included exposures and have previously been shown as stress test, as I have been mentioning earlier. And we have now included those stress tests into these P&amp;L or valued-risk numbers for first time. And we've also reworked the Atlantic hurricane scenario. We have been combining various hurricane scenarios to a single Atlantic hurricane scenarios that also considers multiple landfalls.</p>
          <p>Let me go to other insurance risks that are relevant for us &#x2013; pandemic and terrorism &#x2013; for which we have a different risk appetite than NatCat. In terms of pandemic, we have been investing a lot of energy in developing Group-wide scenarios; what a pandemic could do to us. We have three scenarios: a weak, a moderate and severe one, and we have been attaching different probabilities to that.</p>
          <p>There is quite some model uncertainty. We need to be honest here, that's very clear. We have seen three pandemics in the 20th century and the most severe one, the real one, was 1918; Spanish flu. It is very difficult to imagine what a virus of 1918 would actually do today to our society. Very different; almost not to compare to 1918. So there is field model uncertainty.</p>
          <p>There is also uncertainty in how a severe pandemic, what that could do to the capital markets? Very clearly, there is some spillover that we need to expect, at least short-term. So and this makes it further, I would say, uncertain. And this is why we are actually having a considerably lower risk appetite for pandemic risks &#x2013; for insurance risks resulting from a pandemic &#x2013; then, for example, for NatCat, where we can just can model better. So risk appetite is lower and also our exposures are quite close to our strategic risk appetite right now in that scenario.</p>
          <p>In terms of terror, we also do have Group-wide scenarios developed take into account property and casualty or property as well as life insurance risks. We do have a budget on a portfolio basis, not a single-scenario basis, so we want to limit our total exposure in terms of aggregate annual loss towards terrorism. We have good capabilities, two models. Specifically, the severity, the frequency, the return periods are inherently much more difficult to quantify in terms of terrorism risk.</p>
          <p>Strict budgeting and specific capital allocation in place, and in terms of terror risk, our risk appetite is even lower than what we have for pandemic and it's actually utilized to a lower degree. So much to the supplementary risk criteria's. Let me now quickly come to how we use the strategic risk and framework to design the risk transfer program. Clearly, the SRMF is the key driver of designing the risk transfer program.</p>
          <p>As you can see, the program is designed to address the key insurance bottlenecks we have in the Group, and that is European windstorm and extreme mortality risk, as you can see. European windstorm we have address with two capital markets transaction; one in 2005, the Aiolos transaction &#x2013; and I believe that was &#x20AC;110 million at the time &#x2013; and now more recently, action in 2008 with the Queen Street transaction, which was &#x20AC;170 million. A sponsor of these two transactions has been Munich Re to manage our own risk towards European windstorm.</p>
          <p>Same for extreme mortality risk. We have addressed that now for the first time in 2008 through the mortality bond, Nathan. We have been transferring some $100 million in 2008 out of a shelf structure that is actually much bigger; the shelf is some $1.5 billion. Besides the strategic risk management framework and other key consideration in the design of the risk transfer program is to create arbitrage gains and that is what we can see on the next page.</p>
          <p>This slide shows the risk transfer program in place as at April 2008. As I said earlier, the program is tailored to generate arbitrage profits and to improve diversification through the reduction of peak exposures. The net impact on the Group's economic risk capital of this risk transfer program is actually relatively modest.</p>
          <p>You remember the Group's economic risk capital is &#x20AC;16.5 billion as per year end and this retrocession program has a total impact of some &#x20AC;0.5 billion on this number. So growth of this program, the ESE will be 17, net it's 16.5. Some specific comments. We have been increasing the use of indemnity retro quite considerably throughout 2007, and that is just because much more capacity is available for reasonable prices, as we go with the cycle.</p>
          <p>We've purchase more industry-loss warranties, also because the prices seem to us more attractive, also compared to our internal models. And we have further increased the diversification within the NatCat portfolio through risk swaps. This brings me to the end and to the summary of these two sections.</p>
          <p>We have been derisking our market risks very significantly, with an impact on the Group's risk profile as per in 2007. And you can also see that in the reduced data &#x2013; further reduced data of new increased stock. We have been doing a number of changes to our risk model, with the objective to further integrate the model into the business and develop it into a real Group model with the aggregation of everything.</p>
          <p>Overall, there is no considerable impact on the numbers but, in isolation, these changes have been material and, certainly, we have improved the presentation of the economic risk capital numbers such as to provide more transparency to you. We do have an even improved economic capital, bought for economic strength as per year in 2007, despite share buyback and dividends.</p>
          <p>In terms of strategic risk management, the SRMF is now daily business for some 1.5 years. It's influencing the way we are making decisions in the Group and it's aligned and it's complimentary to our business strategy.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to hand over to Jeff talking about reserves. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, and good morning to our participants in the United States. As evidenced by my failed attempt to cut-off Joe's presentation, I'm excited to share with you some more insight in transparency into the Munich Re Group's strong reserve position.</p>
          <p>Nicholas, in his opening comments, talked about Munich Re's presence around the globe, offering a multitude of risk-transfer products. This global presence brings with it a certain amount of complexity. We operate in multiple legal entities and each one of these legal entities throughout the world; have history of data and legacy issues. They operate in different accounting environments. They have different managerial information systems, different marketing practices, in terms of what data is submitted to the reinsurers and different business concentrations.</p>
          <p>So these challenges, if you will, make it somewhat difficult to put together a simple and transparent reserve disclosure for you. In P&amp;C Reinsurance, we have 75 people dedicated to just examining this on regular basis. So trying to put together something that's very simple for an outside user to look at and make their own conclusions is a challenge. But I think what we have here today moves us a big step in the right direction, and I hope that you agree.</p>
          <p>The disclosure is basically in two pieces. First is a formal presentation that I will go over about why we believe our reserve position is strong. The second part of the disclosure is actually the paid and reported loss development triangles for about 75% of our P&amp;C business. These are in Microsoft Excel format on our website and these allow you, as independent analysts, to form your own conclusions about the ultimate losses and thus the reserves embedded in our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So let's get started. At the end of 2007, we ended the year at the Munich Re group level with &#x20AC;41.3 billion with reserves. The top chart shows the segments from which these reserves emanate. As you can see, 75% of the reserves come from reinsurance for Property and Casualty business. If we add on the 11% from the Primary Insurance business, it's evident that 86% of our reserves are dedicated to Property and Casualty business, with life representing the residual amount.</p>
          <p>The property-casualty reinsurance sector &#x2013; which is the biggest one, again &#x2013; 90% of those reserves come from two major legal entities, Munich Re America and Munich Re AG. As such, when we talk about the reserve disclosures later on, in terms the triangles, we focus on three major legal entities Munich Re America, Munich Re Munich and ERGO.</p>
          <p>The second graph shows the line-of-business breakdown for the largest segment, Property-Casualty Reinsurance. If you look at the line of businesses as reported in IFRS, you'll see that 65% of our reserves emanate from casualty lines of business. This would include the liability portion, the motor portion and the accident portion. And in here, the accident portion does include the workers' compensation exposure from the United States.</p>
          <p>Now on Page 51, there are really three different facets of why we believe we have a strong reserve position at the Munich Re Group. The first reason is simply diversification, as we've talked a lot about this morning. Our global presence across the full range of insurance and reinsurance products before it's a tremendous and natural volatility mitigator and that's diversification.</p>
          <p>The second facet is prudent reserving. We will talk later on, that management does carry reserves above the peer actuarial and claims estimates. This level of prudent margin, we feel, is necessary based on survey of the volatility in the individual point estimates and it is there to absorb any volatility that is not naturally diversified away, through diversification.</p>
          <p>And the third facet is our reserving risk controls. As Joe talked about, we do you use the strategic risk management framework to have a process in place to address all the risks that we face as a company, and this includes reserve risk. And this process mandates that we actively seek out the risks that are varied in our reserves, quantify the potential for those becoming reality and, if necessary, develop reserve risk-reduction strategies or risk-reduction strategies for this.</p>
          <p>Let's first talk about diversification. Just to put it in context of the reserves. As we all know, diversification is the basis of the insurance and reinsurance system, and here's an illustrative example of how the different segments that we have get diversified away. As you can see here, we have three different loss distributions, and not to make this too technical, but the loss distribution for each segment just represents the likelihood of outcomes for that different segment. And here we see the blue area would represent what we think would be the reasonable best estimate range for that different segment. The dark vertical line would represent the actuarial or claims best assessment for that segment.</p>
          <p>It is important to note that when we discuss volatility as represented by each one of these three segments, volatility is the potential for upward development, meaning our reserves could go up, or also for downward development, meaning that they could go down. So we actually have a very balanced discussion about things that could go up and down in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Segment number one is probably the typical scenario. In this, the fluctuation around the mean or the distribution around that vertical line, is basically symmetrical, with a slightly skewed distribution to the right, which means that there is a likelihood of things going up. But the likelihood of that is lower than it is to go down. A typical example would be for us, a portfolio of basic engineering losses.</p>
          <p>Segment two is also a very common scenario, at least for us here at the Munich Re Group. In this segment type, there are strong indications that the potential for settling claims is below that of what has actually been indicated from the actuarial and claims analysis. Typical examples of this type of segment, for us, would be German motor proportional business or our reserves from the hard-market years.</p>
          <p>Segment three represents the more risky segments in the portfolio. It shows that there is a potential for large developments in the segment, but the likelihood of these developments is low. Examples include workers' compensation excessive loss in the United Sates, or motor excessive loss claims here in the European markets. When we combine all of these segments across the globe, across reinsurance, across insurance, the distribution of likely outcomes resembles more of a normal distribution, with an equal likelihood of pluses and minus, and this is simply the power of diversification.</p>
          <p>If you look on Page 53, you'll see that our run-off triangle that is published in our annual report, and this is a good example of how diversification works in our favor. What we show here is across the top, the different accident years for the past ten years. And then the triangle shows the ending balance sheet of the reserves associated with that accident year along the diagonal. As you go down on the left hand side, you'll see at the different valuation dates of each balance sheet year, what that reserve estimate was for that accident-year period.</p>
          <p>If we focus on the last two lines, which is the year end 2006, and the year end 2007 &#x2013; once again, just in the triangle, not the bolded lines down at the bottom &#x2013; you'll see that the difference between those two lines is actually what happened or transpired in calendar year 2007. As you can see here that we had pluses and minus across the different accident years, in this case, a positive number means that we were able to release reserves and a negative number means that we were able to or that we choose to increase reserves responding to actuarial information that we were seeing in the portfolio.</p>
          <p>For example, in the most recent years, 2002 through 2006 in aggregate, you see strong reductions. Behind this would be the reductions that we saw in ERGO business and in short-tail lines of business. In addition, for the older years, we saw the need to increase reserves for risk that combined longevity, risk where are living longer with medical inflation and the cost of care inflation. Once again, examples of this were motor claims in Europe as well workers' compensation claims in the United States.</p>
          <p>However, even though we had different fluctuations across the accident years, in aggregate, we only increased reserves approximately 89 million. And of that 89 million, 77 million was associated with workers' compensation discount accretion, which is simply an accounting accretion of losses to unwind the embedded discounts in those reserves.</p>
          <p>So overall, even though we had large movement, if you look at it as a percentage of ultimate losses, it was about 0.1%. If we were to look at it as the amount of carried reserves at the end of last year, of 2006, it would have been a change of about 0.3%. So in this case, diversification works to our benefit.</p>
          <p>On 54, Slide 54, we show, once again, how that diversification results into a normal distribution. At the Munich Re Group level, the management team evaluates the overall reserve situation, which do diversification to once again resemble a normalized distribution.</p>
          <p>The management team then selects the amount of carried reserves to be shown in the balance sheet. Based on the discussion, the elements of the portfolio, which may show volatility. If you look at the top of this distribution, once again, the blue area represents our range of best estimate after diversification. And here you see basically pluses or minus. The red line is the sum of the indicated reserves across all the branches and subsidiaries of the Munich Re Group. The white line represents the carried reserves at the Group level.</p>
          <p>The difference between the white and the red line represents the risk margin that is being carried. Historically, we have been carrying that risk margin in the neighborhood of 3 to 5% of the total carried reserves in the Munich Re Group. So if you go back to our original slide, where we said we had 41.3 billion of reserves at the end of 2007, that would indicated that the reserve margin embedded in our current reserves is in the range of 1.2 to 2 billion.</p>
          <p>I think it's also good to point out that we are quick to respond to when we see things that could affect us in an adverse development situation; we tend to respond very quickly to that. However, when we see things that look positive, we are cautious to respond to that, given the surprises that people have seen in the industry on the reserve situation.</p>
          <p>It is also important to note that the external parties who look at our reserves &#x2013; and we have people who look at all the reserves of Munich Re Group &#x2013; have confirmed the reasonability of the red line, which is the actual indication, and so the white line, or the carried reserves, would be above those indications.</p>
          <p>I would also point out that the reserve margin is not a specific percentage that we target. Once again, as we will elaborate here in a minute, we base those discussions on what we see as being volatile in the portfolio, based on the information that we have at the time of making those decisions. And let me now go into our reserve risk management strategy and give you couple of examples of how this works.</p>
          <p>On Slide 55 you'll see, shown, the statistical ranges and reserves risk key map. . But first let me say, when Central Reserving was established back in 2006, it was decided at that time that reserving area would no longer report to an operating area. And as such, my area reports directly to the office of the CFO. And in that capacity, I also have direct access to the Board of Management on a regular basis, either through the Reinsurance Committee itself, to the full Board of Management or to the Global Underwriting Risk Committee.</p>
          <p>And we are in front of the Board of Management, I would say, on a monthly if not every-other-month basis. And our discussions with the Board of Management mainly center around two topics. First of all, what is our expected value of the ultimate losses associated with different segments based on the actuarial knowledge and the claims knowledge and the underwriting input?</p>
          <p>The second more critical piece is, how volatile are these estimates? What reasonably could happen in the future and what could we do to manage this volatility? In these discussions of volatility, we do use statistical ranges to some extent. However, we do recognize that there are limitations with statistical ranges.</p>
          <p>For example &#x2013; not to get too technical, but statistical ranges assume that all risk can be quantified as either process risk or parameter risk. It assumes that you're using the right model to measure your volatility. And we find that one of our greatest challenges as a reinsurer is model risk, and that is not captured in the statistical range.</p>
          <p>The second part of statistical range is that it assumes that the past is representative of the future, and we know, once again, that may not be the case. And three, statistical ranges do not give our management team concrete evidence of what are the cost drivers underlying the reserves; what tends to be driving the volatility; and what can we do, if anything, to manage that volatility.  As such, we've develop a concept in conjunction within integrated risk management call the reserve risk heat map and this is an illustrative example.  Basically it's three dimensional, the x-axis if you will, is the timeframe and we have focused on what can happened in the next one to five years.  Obviously, times change and things could be much different than they are today and part of the risk that we need to manage is risk of change.</p>
          <p>On the y-axis is the potential for upward or downward movement.  Once again, our discussions with the Board of Management focus on things that could happen positively as well as negatively.  And then the bubbles if you will, on the reserve risk heat map are simply different portfolios that we would like to highlight to the Board of Management.  The shading on the portfolio would represent what is its likelihood of something is happening in that regard.</p>
          <p>A lighter shade would mean that it's not very likely where a darker shade means that it's more likely.  It's important to note here that these are all possibilities of what may happen in the future.  If something &#x2013; if we've identified as something as being probable, it automatically becomes part of best estimate and is booked into our actual best assessment that we present to the management.</p>
          <p>Let me give you a clear example of one of these cases.  On Slide 56, I highlight a case study that we did for the Board of Management which was the European motor excessive loss claims.  In our portfolio of claims, we actually saw different characteristics starting to manifest itself.  First of all, in the environment of what has actually happened in the different markets, we saw less incidents of traffic deaths, but higher incidents of severely injured people.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, we saw that the injured parties of the claimants were &#x2013; there was an increasing proportion of accidents with young people.  Giving medical technology and just longevity increasing in general, these two facts coupled together would simply drive up costs as people needed more medical attention, more indemnity payments or higher cost of care.</p>
          <p>In addition, if you add into what are the inflation in the cost trends, we did see significant price increases in medical care.  We see in a lot of European countries increasing amounts of annuity payments and then we also see societal shifts in who is providing the care for these injured parties.  In the past it has been family members who have taken care of their injured family members, but now those services are now been provided by third-party providers and thus the costs are then subject to the insurance contract.</p>
          <p>All those pieces fit together to push up cost into the excessive loss layer where Munich Re has played in the past.  So in these examples, all of these cost with penetrate our layer.</p>
          <p>Let me show a real example on Slide 57.  This was a case in involving a five-year-old who was involved in a car accident in 1992 and suffered severe head injuries.  I think this claim demonstrates the model risk that we face and also demonstrates the lack of clear market information we sometimes get in assessing case reserves.  Munich Re was first notified of this claim 1994; two years after the accident happened and at that time the best estimate of the medical expenses associated with this child was &#x20AC;1.5 million.</p>
          <p>What you see here has been the reported activity that we saw on this claim over the next ten years.  You see the costs and the frequency of medical services increased, the child was projected to live longer and third-party care was sought as the parents needed more assistance.  In addition, in some of our European markets our ceedents are permitted to discount their case reserves, but that's not always evident to us when we receive the claim.  So as their discount factor has gone down over the past few years, then that shows as a nominal reserve increase.  Since we have to project out the ultimate value because we are required to carry ultimate reserves, and nothing discounted, that produces a difficult challenge.</p>
          <p>So 13 years after the accident, the original 1.5 million claim has grown to 11 million, which is over a 700 million increase on this one claim.  So these were the type of discussions that we had with the Board of Management about these portfolios and I think it's important to also recognize what did our Board of Management do as a result of these discussions.</p>
          <p>First of all, we said we definitely need a new model to get at how do we project out the ultimate value of these risks.  So we are working on a new claims model, which actually looks at the individual characteristics of the claimant, their age, the severe injuries that they have, how long they are projected to live, what's the medical inflation projection to be, what are the costs of care components?</p>
          <p>In addition, on the underwriting side, this is a clear example of where reserving information was tied into the underwriting operations of our organization.  Further rate increases were sought on the business that was renewed, more contract limits were put into the exposures and in addition, some concrete cancellations were put in place for business that was deemed to be unprofitable in the near-term.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, I'd like to give you an opposite example, something that where we would see the potential for not necessarily upper development, but potential for positive development.  On the improvement slide, Munich Re has tremendous exposure to the hard market years of 2003 and 2006.  And let me explain this graph because it can be somewhat confusing.</p>
          <p>Across the bottom you see the different treated years or accident years that we have and the bar chart above them is simply the ultimate loss ratios that we had at the end of 2007.  We've broken this down into three components, the paid losses to date on those different accident years, the case reserves and then on top the IBNR component.  On the right-hand side you actually see the loss ratio scale for that.</p>
          <p>In addition we have imposed the gold line, which is simply the earned premium that we earned for each one of those accident years.  And on the left-hand side of the graph you see that scale.  So you can see that from this graph two drivers of underwriting performance.  The first driver is simply the underwriting cycle and we've actually drawn this in the gray bar to illustrate what that cycle could look like.  This is not based on any actual indications.  This is mainly just a freehand illustrative example.</p>
          <p>So we have the soft market years of 1997 through 2001, followed by the hard market years of 2002 through 2006.  And this is echoed by the premium that we see increase in opposite direction of the loss ratio.</p>
          <p>In addition to the underwriting cycle, you see the second driver of loss performance, which is the presence of natural or manmade catastrophes.  In 1999, we had the winter storms here in Europe. 2001 we had events of September 11 and in 2004 and 2005, you had the US hurricanes.  But what you can clearly see here is that in the hard market years of 2002 through 2006, we believe that there is potential for those to decrease and really that's based on two different reasons.</p>
          <p>First of all, we do see the actual indications coming in very positively and consistent with that happening.  Second is &#x2013; well consistent with that, if you look back on the history of data and look at it from an industry perspective, studies have shown that hard market loss ratios tend to improve over time.  So not only did we see it in our own data, but it is an industry phenomenon that we've seen as well.</p>
          <p>And two, the second piece of why we think that these loss ratios will improve is we did a considerable re-writing of the portfolio after the soft market years in a variety of markets and a lot of times we can quantify things such as rate change in different markets.  In other times, different aspects of rewriting portfolio are much harder to quantify such as changing limits, changing terms and conditions, going into lower risk classes. These are much harder to quantify. So when we setup the loss ratios initially for those years, once again we were cautious. We were not aggressive in setting those loss ratios up. So now that we can actually see the loss activity coming from those years we have more concrete evidence then to respond to, to make loss ratio projections, and once again it looks like those will be coming down over time.</p>
          <p>I think it's also important to note that with this, even though we're talking about diversification, we see some upside on the hard market years in different portfolios and risky areas in others. As it relates to this side, I think it's important that one of our challenges going forward is to establish the right loss ratios if we enter into continuing softening markets. And as you can see here, we do see some increase in the 2007 loss ratios as compared to the historical past, once again responding to that those market cycle dynamics that we see out there.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion of my part of presentation, let me just reiterate why we believe that our reserve position is strong. First of all, diversification, with the liabilities across different countries, different markets, different lines of business and different coverage types and market cycles; we have a natural volatility mitigator. In addition to that, if the diversification does not work in our favor or does not absorb everything that we would like it to, we have put in reserving it in place which has resulted in margins on top of the actual indications, which could be used to absorb that volatility. And three, we are active in our reserve risk control procedures to go out there and find risks, to quantify them and address them in a proactive manner.</p>
          <p>Now, I will introduce the second part of the disclosure, which is the loss reserve triangles that are on our website. Due to time, I don't want to go through each one of the line of businesses in the actuarial disclosure; but instead, I would like to give a brief introduction to the information and point out some of the key differences between the two major legal entities Munich Re America and Munich Re Munich. This data should enable the interested party or interested analysts to go out there and to do their own analysis about what they believe is the ultimate losses associated with these portfolios. And by subtracting off the paid amounts, you can see what is the indicated reserve.</p>
          <p>For those people in the audience who are not familiar with how to analyze loss reserve triangles, I would refer you to the Casualty Actuarial of Science, Foundations text book. There's a chapter on loss reserving and there is also a chapter on reinsurance. And some of your peers have also put out good, explanatory memorandum on how to analyze loss triangles.</p>
          <p>At a simple level, we have produced just one triangle that if you want to start with just one simple triangle, this is the property-casualty triangle for reinsurance and primary combined. This case, this is financial data. So on the left-hand side, I'm sorry; yes, on the left-hand side you see the different accident years going down. In the premium, this would be our calendar year-earned premium that we had for each one of those accident years. And then across the top are the typical reported loss ratios associated with those different accident years. We also show our ultimate loss ratio projection that's embedded in our balance sheet, and then we show the component parts of that, the paid losses, the case reserves and the IBNR. This is the information that was embedded in the graph that we just talked about in terms of the hard market years. In the lower left-hand corner, you'll see that we show the reported loss ratios, mainly in graphical format. Some people are more picture oriented, and so they would like to see how do those lines or those accident years develop over time, and where will they end up? What you see here, the different colors of the different accident years and what is actually happened to date. On top of that, you'll see the white areas, which is what we think will happen in the future, and that represents the IBNR that we would get a need to get us to an alternate loss position. And in the lower left-hand corner, sorry, lower right-hand corner, it's the same information that you saw before. It's underwriting loss ratio performance over time.</p>
          <p>For those of you who are eager to see more detail, we have provided representative loss triangles, as we said, from Munich Re America, Munich Re Munich and ERGO. In addition, we have disclosed information on our accident, on our asbestos and environmental reserves. With this disclosure, we give you more details on about 75% of our total reserves for the Property Casualty segment. As I say to my opening comments, the Munich Re Group does operate in a complex environment due to our different legal entities. So although we have tried to streamline the triangles to look all the same, there are some particular differences that I think should be noted. And these differences are highlighted on Page 63.</p>
          <p>First of all, from Munich Re Munich business, we focus in on the net business of Munich Re Munich. And in this case, we exclude special contracts such as finite contracts; we exclude our major branches and subsidiaries. We tend to use statistical data, and that, it just means that we use the data of our client and how they report their development. And more specifically, when you look at the Munich Re Munich triangles, those triangles do include the paid and reported amounts of very large events.</p>
          <p>As contrasted with the Munich Re America triangles, we have done all these triangles net of specific retrocessions. But they are before the LPT and before the variable quota shares and the other corporate retros with Munich Re Munich. This way you get a very clear picture of Munich Re America without the interference of inner company retrocessions. We do use financial data for Munich Re America that's historically what they've have, and in contrast, they do not have in their triangles the paid and reported amounts of very large or unusual events.</p>
          <p>Instead, those are separated out in term special liabilities and shown separately. So just to give you a quick example of Munich Re Munich, Munich Re Munich this is the motor excessive loss piece that we talked about in the Reserve segment and also as a Risky segment. You can see here the underwriting performance over time. Because the underlying claims are actually already in euros, there are no exchange rate issues. Because we are using statistical data, the premium that you see here is our alternate projection of premium before we have transferred it into the balance sheet. And you can see here, for example on Item Number 1, we had a very large and unusual loss, which we refer to internally as a Selby loss, which drove up that accident year.</p>
          <p>As compared to property for Munich Re America, here you will see financial data. This is our accident years across the bottom, and because we're using financial data, it is the premium that's shown here is calendar year-earned premium. And once again, the special liabilities are shown separately. In this case, examples Number 1, 2 and 3. Number 1 is the September 11th losses. It's shown all together as an ultimate loss amount on top of the loss ratio. 2 and 3 are the different hurricane seasons that we had in those respective years.</p>
          <p>I realize that these caveats can be somewhat technical and somewhat confusing. So I would encourage you not to get buried in the details. I would encourage you as you look at this to focus on the major analysis pieces overall. And if you do, we're comfortable that you will come to the same conclusion and comfort level, the strong reserve position that we have here at the Munich Re Group. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So it's a long session, ladies and gentleman. Good afternoon. Therefore, I want to lead you as quickly as possible to the most important elements and few features of our first quarter results. There were three circumstances which were particularly very important. First, the strength of the Euro vis-&#xE0;-vis the US dollar, the pound and the Canadian dollar. Second, higher claims activity than usual for our Reinsurance property-casualty segment; and third, the capital market turbulences. Our premium income declined by 1.8%. The organic growth was partially only compensated and partially compensated currency impacts on our gross written premium. The reinsurance property-casualty combined ratio was disappointing with 103.8% due to above-average claims, both for man-made and for natural catastrophes.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, primary property casualty combined ratio was very good with 89%, and this is well below our full-year guidance of 95%. For our investments, we had relatively low values losses in value. In very difficult circumstances we were and we still are well positioned with a moderate-risk portfolio, and the return on investment was 3.9%.  The return on equity almost reached 13%, and the return on risk-adjusted capital, almost 17%. The operating result declined by 12.3%, and our consolidated result is with &#x20AC;785 million down, 19.4%, against an extremely strong first quarter of the preceding year. We can confirm our prognosis for the full year with 3 to &#x20AC;3.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Let's start with some details on the investments. On Slide 68, we had a severe downturn in the capital markets between January and March. Euro stocks dropped 17.5%, interest rates went up by roughly 40% for German government bonds, and we had massively-increased credit spreads, and we had the strength of the euro. You'll find the data on Page 94 in the Index to the presentation for the balance sheet. It was roughly minus 8% value of US dollar and British pound, and for the income statement it was roughly minus 12% from Munich Re.</p>
          <p>The strong euro and the decline in the stock markets led to a reduction in our investment portfolio to &#x20AC;170 billion. This decrease was with 3.4%, relatively small, thanks to, first, a low-risk, fixed-interest portfolio. The split is in the Index to the presentation on Page 89. It's very much geared to government bonds and semi-government bonds and German <mark type="inaudible" />. We very early reduced our equity exposure in 2007 and in the first stage of 2008. So when stock markets really fell drastically in the fourth week of January, we were clearly below 10% equity ratio in our investments. We used a lot of derivatives, and with these we partially compensated the losses on the equities.</p>
          <p>The mark-to-market gains on derivatives show up in the P&amp;L account, but so do parts of the development in value of the equities themselves because we avoid artificial inflation of our investment earnings by using hedge accounting here to a very large extend. So we wrote down the equities as we wrote up the derivatives protecting these equities.</p>
          <p>We still have very high valuation results with &#x20AC;5.6 billion and subprime hasn't been an issue for Munich Re. Our investment results declined by 46% with very substantial deviations in comparison to last year's first quarter where we had quite high gains from disposal. This time gains and losses and altogether you should rather look at the development of the value of the portfolio and at the development of the equity instead of the investment results. The IFRS return on investment was 3.9%.</p>
          <p>We further reduced our exposure in risky assets as I said before. Last time I repeated for the end of last year about an equity gearing of 51%, we are now down to 35% only. And if you also include in a more extended view real estate, structured products and corporate bonds as also being somewhat risky assets, then you can see on the right-hand side of this slide that the ratio is also at a very conservative level with 66%. This is the overview of our segment results. On the left-hand side, the earnings before interests and taxes operating result, on the right-hand side the consolidated after-tax numbers &#x2013; the after tax numbers and at the bottom, consolidated.</p>
          <p>Reinsurance life and health, premiums were down due to currency effect, basically, but expenses were even more down; and therefore the operating results went up by &#x20AC;59 million, and furthermore, the after-tax results went up somewhat more due to a lower-tax burden. Reinsurance property-casualty was down minus &#x20AC;342 million due to the above-average claims and below investment returns. Same with primary property casualty, in spite of the very good underwriting results. Our shareholders equity decreased by roughly &#x20AC;1.7 billion due to unrealized losses on available for sales securities and to currency fluctuations and due to our share buybacks. Of the generated earnings of &#x20AC;785 million, we repatriated &#x20AC;575 million in share buybacks. They're off only 450 in cash. This is the final part of our 2007 share buyback program, and the remainder of being &#x2013; buying put options in the first couple of weeks of this year. As of today, we are again in the market to continue with our share buyback program. To the segments Reinsurance, investment results down by 25%, or &#x20AC;324 million, and this sounds relatively moderate in comparison to the numbers for the primary segments. But this was due to the fact that the level of asset protection was even higher in Reinsurance.</p>
          <p>So the right ups were offsets to a large extent by the increase in value of the derivatives. The underwriting results was affected by the above-average claims, and the operating result was down by &#x20AC;200 million, or minus 27%, on the background of an overall relatively difficult environment. Foreign exchange effects had an enormous impact on our premium income in Reinsurance. On Slide 74, you see that minus &#x20AC;379 million value to the decline in foreign currencies. Overall, the decline was 5.6% in premium income. This was also influenced by an arranged cancellation of the handful of very big quarter share treaties, both in non-life insurance and in life reinsurance.</p>
          <p>Adjusted for foreign exchange effects, we would have had a very small decline in life and health, and a small increase in property-casualty premium income. In health reinsurance, the negative currency effects were somewhat compensated by organic growth, especially from the Middle East. Property-casualty reinsurance, we had an increase in loss in our loss ratio compared to the preceding year as a whole and only a slight decrease when we compared to the first quarter of 2007; and our expense ratio also went up. The expense ratio was 29%, is still within reasonable range, and the number of the first quarter of 2007 was extraordinary low; also due to deferred acquisition effects. The increase is also due to higher commissions. The administrative expenses remained more or less stable or even went down slightly.</p>
          <p>The losses came in quite high. Clearly, it is a random clustering of losses on a quarterly basis, which is typical for our business. I would like to stress here the two major losses from two floods in Australia, which hit us with each with almost &#x20AC;100 million, and on a quarterly basis this inflates this loss number to a large extent. Also, the man-made losses came in very strong, you can see the comparison to a five-year average on Page 93 of the annex.</p>
          <p>Primary Insurance, we had a sharp decline in our investment result. This is easily explainable by the one-time gains of disposal of our real estate portfolio in last year's first quarter where we sold over 1 billion in market value under market, and with that, realized a substantial gain on disposal in the order of &#x20AC;500 million.</p>
          <p>Same applies for gains from disposals of equities. We did not use our basis of unrealized gains to compensate for the incoming losses in this first quarter because, also, the overall result looks quite favorable. The excellent results from the underwriting side within 89% combined ratio led us to a decline of only 22% of the operating result for the Primary Insurance segments.</p>
          <p>Premium income was more or less flat. In Primary Insurance, we do not have major currency effects because most business is written in euros or in currencies which are closely linked to the euro. And the development was in property-casualty slightly favorable with plus 2.3%; from Germany 2.5; from the business abroad, 1.8; especially good from Poland and the Baltic States. In life, it was down on a gross-written premium basis, but on a statutory basis also taking into account investment-oriented products like the very important list of products, it was up by 1.7% overall. In health insurance, we sold of lot of supplementary products instead of the full-coverage product. In Germany and abroad, especially business came in quite well from Spain and from Belgium.</p>
          <p>I've already mentioned the very good combined ratio with 89% with loss ratio going down almost 10% and expense ratio 3.2%. Loss ratio can easily be explained to some extent by the difference between the very strong storm Kyrill last year and Emma this year, with Emma producing substantially lower losses.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand, there's a better allocation of premiums and losses through the quarters which leads to a technical reduction of the combined ratio in the first quarter. But on an overall basis, it's really a very good underwriting result, and we expect it to remain clearly below our 95% target.</p>
          <p>Quickly, on new business in life. Annual premium equivalent was up 30%. This was driven, to some extent, by the four-step of list of products was a kind of automatic increase of business. And overall, we were not so satisfied about our sales in the first quarter due to the very rigid compliance to the new rules of the insurance loss.</p>
          <p>And selling business has become a little bit more burdensome and takes somewhat more time, so we expect it to increase in the course of this year. The overall picture for 2008, first of all, due to the strong euro we have a substantial currency effect as you could see in the quarterly result. And this has cost us to reduce our expectation for the turnover in reinsurance by &#x20AC;1.5 billion, and so the expectation for the gross premium written for the group as a whole to now, a range between 36 to &#x20AC;37.5 billion.</p>
          <p>And in after the high losses in the first quarter, it will also not be easy to meet our target of 98% for the full year, but that is still possible. And the same applies for the natural catastrophe expectation of 6.5% after having had more than 10 in the first quarter. We are somewhat lagging behind here. But we are still confident, especially after April, and the first half of May was somewhat better &#x2013; or the first third of May.</p>
          <p>Overall, with our &#x20AC;0.8 billion for the first quarter, we are well on track, and therefore we can concern our target of 3 to &#x20AC;3.4 billion and are quite confident to reach it.</p>
          <p>Now, back to Nikolaus for his final remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, J&#xF6;rg.</p>
          <p>To conclude our presentation, I hope you could understand why I do sleep well at night. The first quarter was a good start into 2008. I don't have any issue with results, nor do we have an issue with our integrated risk management; quite to the opposite, we are so well advanced with the ERM that Joachim can talk about enabling business rather than restricting it because it's under control.</p>
          <p>Well, coming to the last slide of today, Slide 83. It's about diversification; an important part of our value proposition is diversification. As you could hopefully see, diversification works in our group. It works in many regards. It works across the three major business segments. The fact that we look so very well capitalized is an immediate consequence of the fact that diversification not only works within the segments, but it also works across the segments. It even works within sub-segments. I think it was a very good example to see also how diversification works within reserving affected how it was there with less volatile resource. Different distributions of its claims is a wonderful addition to the different distributions of claims and resource in the Reinsurance segment. So diversification works.</p>
          <p>What else did work? We ditched the risk our balance sheet overall, more so on the asset side, but we also worked on the liability side. What you see here is, again, a view on our development of the beta or the cost of capital after all. You see the result of it. This is the same assumption that was used by Jorg. It's a one-year beta consideration. You see the cost of capital by the end of 2007 should certainly below in the 8ish range, if not below, probably rather below.</p>
          <p>We still can work on our beta a little bit, I'm sure we can. But the curve is getting flatter and flatter, so it will be much more of a work to achieve relatively little, and the beta of course can never be zero.</p>
          <p>We are concerned about managing the risk and return profile. That is very close to our heart. I think we owe this to you. If you want to create shareholder value, we have to be good in managing the risk return profile. It goes for each side of the balance sheet, within the side of the balance sheet, but it also goes for the two together. That is also why we think equities make sense because they'll improve the risk return profile if you do it smartly.</p>
          <p>Well, I said I can sleep so well. We have a happy problem to some extent by managing diversification the way we do, actively managing it, or finding out at the end of the year where we stand but rather trying to influence it upfront by the risking what we do; we created more and more of a capital buffer. And now we have to make sure that our outside stakeholders give us a chance to realize part of it, and that we internally are capable to realize part of it. Regulators, rating agencies and our own structure within the group and access to money that can be distributed is the challenge for us today. It's a happy challenge because you first have to come to the point where you can manage capital the way we can do today.</p>
          <p>Well, we are and you accept it, not only on track as I see it, for what we have is the target for 2008. We are on track to meet ambitious goals. We have a business model in place that certainly gives us an edge over some of our competitors. We are sure this is the case. Of course, this can only be proven if times get more difficult, so don't &#x2013; I never wanted to wish for softening markets. Now they are closer, we have had some turnaround in the capital markets, now it's the time to prove that you are different, if not better.</p>
          <p>So the business model is in place, the strategy is in place. We have the skilled and loyal staff to execute on our strategy. We have faithful clients; we have good products that does not say we can't invent something new and better even to please our clients more. We are well under way, and I think we have the option space needed to also exploit chances and opportunities that now lie ahead of us if the markets continue the way they have started in this year. So you have staying power apparently, we do to. But thank you for all the time that you devoted to us, listening to us now, and now we are more than pleased to give you an active role and take your questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Nikolaus. Yes indeed, we are starting the Q&amp;A session now. I will start with questions from the room, and then I take questions from the telephone. If you want to ask a question in the room please help me just by signaling that, raise your hand. Once I've selected you, just press the bottom, you see the red light and then we continue. The next favor that I ask from you is please to limit, doesn't matter whether you're in the room or on the phone, limit your questions to two. If you have more questions, we'll give you a second chance in the next round. So questions, please. Okay, I start on the right-hand side. I start with Will Hawkins and then Kevin afterwards.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Sascha. It's William Hawkins at KBW. Two questions, I mean just the first one on the quarterly results. I mean you kind of implied that you're broadly satisfied, but 104% combined ratio in the reinsurance businesses is clearly well above your target. I'm just wondering, to the extent that's been driven by large losses, are you completely happy that this is just normal business volatility? Well, do you think you've learned anything about your exposures from some of the losses that might mean you want to take some action in the future? And then secondly, I know this isn't a popular question, but your rhetoric is clearly stated you don't want to warehouse excess capital, but your numbers are showing that your excess capital is up some 50, 60% or some &#x20AC;6 billion. So I'm just trying to reconcile the rhetoric with the numbers here in terms of why you aren't willing to do anything more on the capital management front? My numbers are referring Slide 36 there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you Will. The first question, you sort of suggested the answer already, and it's exactly the away we and I do see it. The combined ratio is not our utmost goal as a target, so it's rather a slight target if you like because we do run our business on a value-based management concept and economic concept. So the combined ratio is an accounting number in the first place, and it does not reflect risk as such. Do I like to see combined ratios low? Of course I do, but we will have quarters and quarters of relatively short amount in time to look at a reinsurance result, so if we happen to run into random losses in a more concentrated way in a single quarter; does not worry me at all. Of course, we always look then if concentration risk was managed carefully, if all those things went right; but we should never go back to an underwriter and blame him for the fact that there's a loss. So that's why I would love to see a lower combined ratio, but this does not change anything as regards to our business philosophy. We are there as a reinsure, last man standing in the row. We take on risk and we like "volatility" that's what we are there for. And we think with the money that you give us to run the business, we should take on volatility because this is where the value can be created. It's an in transparent market, and we know better hopefully, and I'm convinced we do. Then ask us, let's not shy away from these risks. This is what can happen, and Jorg showed you also how what size of risk we are ready to take when it comes to the big nat cat. This probably one of the biggest exposures we have, the European storm. So this can happen, yes. Well second question, yes, we do not want to warehouse risk. I said in my last words that we, of course, by being so efficient and so successful in both managing diversification and derisking our balance sheet, now we created ourselves a problem. How can we make money available to our shareholders? Jorg will talk about the restrictions we have there, but one thing is important, we try to do what we can; but I would like to repeat something I did not repeat yet. It's a conservative set up that we run, and we think we should run it. Munich Re is considered the one and last man standing if real bad things happen. This is part of the value proposition. We will never be the most levered company, this is not part of the business model; then we would have to be a different company with a different strategy. So we will never be all sort of paid out because then we would have to change the strategy completely. But there is some obstacles or actually one more or less, Jorg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is first like Joe mentioned during his speech. There is the fact that rating buffers are not as high as the buffers according to our internal measurement but they are not the driving constraint at the moment. There is some room to go here. What, at the moment, is really the constraint, which is most pressing that is the level of the revenue reserves of the Munich Re Parent Company under local GAAP. So that means we can only pay dividends and do share buybacks out of the revenue reserves. And we have already expired them with the dividend of this year. Now there is more incoming that is the dividend from ERGO and also the current gains in the cause of this year. One can also measure that from quarter to quarter. But nevertheless, there is not much on the parent balance sheet. Why is this a case? For two very simple reasons. One, is there are unrealized gains on our investments kept by the parent company. They can be realized, there's only a small tax involved as far as it is &#x2013; as it has to do with equities. And second, and much more important reason is the existence of an equalization reserves and similar reserves. And most of these reserves are not taxed. That means it has to do with tax savings that we have these reserves, and one can, to some extent, manage these reserves down. For example, by we preceding business to another jurisdiction, but that wouldn't be in the interest of our shareholders because it would immediately trigger taxes; and second effect is that you should also see the value of these equalization reserves. Even with a very high loss from natural catastrophes or from casualty events, this equalization reserve also protects our distribution program because in such a case we can use this equalization reserves to compensate for these losses. So therefore, the management of the situation of Munich Re AG, there are the disadvantages of triggering taxes in case of different situation, which have to be weighed against the interest of the shareholders and the advantages of having a more efficient balance sheet here. And perhaps one additional remark on what Nikolaus said from these events, especially in Australia, we haven't learned something new with regard to the exposure. So we knew about the exposure, but it just happened what was all included in our modeling of the risks involved.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, then Kevin Ryan from ING.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I wonder if you could add a little color to the very good primary P&amp;C result. In particular, you've obviously improved the expense ratio a lot in the last year, is there any more scope to continue that? And the other thing that strikes me very strongly is the underwriting. What was very much better than certainly I was anticipating, even striping out cyro, there seems to be a genuine underlying improvement, which I wouldn't have expected given the competitive environment in Germany. Can you comment a little bit about how the underwriting's going and clearly you're doing something different to the market here? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Kevin. It's going well. The underwriting, also on an economic basis, but if you look at these numbers on a quarterly basis; there are some distortions from accounting effects. As I mentioned before, we have a better allocation of losses to quarters now because in the two or three preceding years we always had a peak in the loss ratios in the first quarter, which came from some specialties in the booking because the company closed its book and just before Christmas in order to be busy with the financial reporting for the full year. And therefore, there was a time lag in claims booking, which showed up in the first quarter. And this was dealt with now and therefore, this explains part of the reduction; but overall, ERGO is doing quite well with regard to its underwriting results, especially in Germany because we have relatively low exposure to the most difficult part that is motor business and a much higher expose to personal accident business, and also our commercial business is doing quite well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes Mark Nicholson, Standard &amp; Poor's. I was interested in Slide 33, the diversification figures, which you showed. By my rough estimate that's something like 28% diversification of the required capital. Does this calculation bare any resemblance to that what you might expect to use as your official capital when Solvency II to comes in? And so far we can tell because the diversification figure quarterly it seemed a little lower, and I thought been mentioned in the past.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Off the top of my head I don't recall, but I do recall that when you were looking at the amount which usually required capital on the potential modeling force obviously to the higher figure saying they're 30 to pushing towards 40% as being mentioned?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But does this figure here represent who you think would be applicable and understandable underling you, European solvency regime?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely this &#x2013; do the figures that we have shown here, are based essentially on the measure of 175% of a valid risk of 99.5%. And the solvency to regime is going to based on 100% of valid risk, 99.5. So what you essentially can do is divide these numbers in this table on page 33 by 175%. And you would find out what our best estimate is of Solvency I, Solvency II capital requirements in the future. So these recounts will be lower by a factor of 175%. I will also expect the same diversification to apply insolvency to as we show here, so this is our best estimate of what's on the two essentially means for Munich Re.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Andy from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Andrew Broadfield from Morgan Stanley. Two questions, first of all the life reinsurance, not something you expected about much in the past, but I know you plan something in the future perhaps. And the steps you mentioned that you're taking, I was just interested in whether you can tell us a little bit more about any products that you're looking at or changes to that distribution you mentioned bank insurance potentially? But just to get some more on that interesting, that would be interesting? The second thing is just the comment that was made around risk management being a good business enabler, which is very clear. I was just wondering whether, two parts to this I guess; one is, are you &#x2013; you mentioned those are new, and I was just looking at the timing of your entry into that market simply a little bit behind that perhaps some your peers. I wondered if that's a reflection of your speed of risk management advancement or whether it's perhaps as far as different attitude by your peers on that fund? And also, if there's any other examples in terms of your business enablement from the risk management process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the second one is a good one also for Joe because he's the one that mentioned enabling and he's of course heavily involved in making sure that whatever we establish as a hedging platform is absolutely state of the art when it comes to front, middle and back office, and what have you. Of course he's not the risk taker, he's the risk controller. But he knows exactly where the process stands, and I think up to the point where we give out competitively interesting information, I think you can make a statement there. As regards life reinsurance steps to be taken and details, I would ask you, I can't to do it right now. I don't have them with me. Of course we will present a lot more in October, if you're interested earlier, we would have to call you. The VANB target, of course, is quite talking because we had it in 2006, a 200 million value-added new business that we created and we want to double that within the five years to come. This is a target that is out there and that is in terms of embedded value, of course quite as strong and solid target.</p>
          <p>The distribution of the different initiatives to achieve the target, I can not give you right now off hand. And the products that we plan for is actually it goes across all the range of life reinsurance that you could possibly think of. Take the US, mortality risk still of course is an issue there. We have checked long-term care; we are rechecking the possibilities in critical illness in the UK. We are, of course, like everyone trying to find the golden act in longevity business. So it's the full range of reinsurance that you could think of. And we will make sure that we are up to the level in terms of skills market; know how, client penetration to take what can be taken from someone like us. But take longevity, just as one example, we really took again quite some time to think about it, how it can be done. It's not an easy exercise if you follow a strict risk management and risk controls rules we have, and the brightest brains not only in town, but at least in many big cities, try to come up with their solution from consultants to investment bankers, reinsurers and insurers and brokers. Still, I haven't seen the one solution. We are working on it as well. So that's, you see, it's a full broad scale. The service side that I mentioned is a little bit of a different approach here. It's not the single product that is straight away sold and is creating reinsurance volume. It is rather additional product that together with the reinsurance then is what we sell. And that is typical for us. We are not a commodity reinsurer; we are rather a service-oriented reinsurer. That means, along with a pure capacity, we many times offer services and we observe many of the newer players in life insurance actually are not ready anymore to be present at all on all the links of the value chain. They're ready to carve out certain links and say, couldn't it be you to do it and that could be, for example, in IT-supported underwriting tool express system, what have you, it could be administration straightforward. It could be more of these links, and the more you talk to clients that are further away today from insurance, take banks as a proxy, the more of these links probably are available for us. And Asia is a region where we think, when it comes to bank insurance support, could be an interesting target. This would be it, but I can't give you now, off hand, a split of numbers; but the latest you will see them, October, and if you really are interested in such, I will make sure what we can deliver today can be delivered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of variable annuities, I think we need to differentiate the two segments. What we do in Primary Insurance and what we do in Reinsurance, and you're right. Munich Re hasn't been the first insurance company launching these products, that wasn't our ambition, that's not what we did. But actually when we look at primary insurance, we are still one of the earlier ones. You noted that Alcoa has been launching variable annuity products recently out of Luxemburg for the German market, and we are expecting a decent business to grow, specifically as after year 2009. So we are still, I think, in a good timing here of launching these products in Europe. On the reinsurance side, we are very much working on establishing the platform of variable annuity hedging, providing a service to primary insurance companies. We think that this product category is going to grow in Europe, in Asia very strong, and that we can provide a service as a reinsurer to the smallest specifically and mid-sized primary insurance company in that area. We have also been deciding to establish one; single platform of hedging these exposures for the primary insurance business in the group and for the reinsurance business, and that is actually one area of synergies. Synergies not premiering terms of cost, but also in terms costs but primarily in terms of know how. So we're going to establish one, single-hedging platform for all the activities in the group, and in that sense, I believe risk management is indeed an enabler.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm so grateful for this question not only for the synergy that again becomes tangible here but also to prove and to show to you that in today's world, with these complex products, you really have to start developing the product. I wouldn't say right from the back end, but you have to make sure that you do not just create the idea tested and go out. And then desperately try to catch up with the back-office systems, but rather today work the other way around. You start in the back office, he will ask all the nasty questions up front, unless he's happy, nothing will happen.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you.  I have two questions.  The first one is on investment income in the year 2008.  Here I would like to know how this could be modeled.  So please answer some sub-questions like what your equity investment ratio is going to be in the medium-term.  It looks quite low at the moment and also in a weak yielding of only 38 points.  A second one, a duration of the bond portfolio and the current average yield on those bonds.  And then the hedge you mentioned that you haven't used hedge accounting.  That means that do you some extra buffer of profits to come.  And now a second question is on agricultural insurance.  I probably don't understand the segment well enough.  And I see what food prices do and I see that some harvests were destroyed.  So here I suppose there is some connection between agricultural insurance and food prices and maybe you give some flavor of what kind of risks are insured here and how this division performed in the year 2007 and in the first quarter of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>J&#xF6;rg I'm afraid the first part is for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Okay.  With investment income it's really difficult to predict.  Reason is that all these distortions between balance sheet and P&amp;L are very difficult to forecast.  I would like to start with one of your later questions, it's about hedge accounting.  I would like give you a very simple example.  I have one stock with a market value of 100 and thereby a put option for 10.  In that case, if the market drops, if the stock price drops to 85 or so, I have a gain on the derivatives, all other things being equal, of some 15.  This is held for trading; therefore it goes to the P&amp;L immediately.  If I apply hedge accounting, which I can do when I have such an efficient hedge, then I write down my stock by 15 and can fully compensate the gain on the derivative by a loss on the underlying stock.  This works in both directions, which is very important.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, for a lot of the derivates this does not apply especially when I use index futures or index options because I do not have an efficient hedge between an underlying on one side and the derivative on the other side.  What happens then?  We have in case of a market decline like this one, we have a gain on the derivative but we don't have a loss on the equity itself unless there is non-temporary impairment.  And to make it even more complicated, once impaired, always impaired.  So whenever there is a situation that I impaired, that I wrote-down stock in the history of applying IFRS accounting, I have to immediately write it down, whatever the size of this development is.</p>
          <p>So taking all these distortions from accounting into a prognosis, it's extremely difficult.  What we try to do in the first quarter is we saw that we had this enormous derivative gains and therefore we tried to write down as much as possible in order to compensate for it.  Not to smoothen earnings, but to reflect the result in the most economical way.  And so we will continue doing.  In case of rising stock markets, we will have some losses on the derivatives, but we will not be able to write up the equities because there is no write up under IFRS accounting except for hedge accounting.</p>
          <p>So for the unhedged part, which was now written down, this is &#x2013; we have to stay with the book value where we are.  That means there is a potential for additional distortions in IFRS P&amp;L accounting going forward in the course of this year and the next years.  Therefore we ourselves plan it very much on the basis of the development of the values and we protect the values.  And we trust that we will be able to explain the difference between balance sheet and P&amp;L going forward.</p>
          <p>Your next question was about our equity ratio.  It was down to 7.2% of our overall investment portfolio at the end of March.  I suspect it's a little bit higher now because stock markets have somewhat recovered.  But the protection has still been intact.  We have changed it a little bit.  We have changed it from going out of upside and downside risk by moving from forward sales to put options, which comes at a cost but leaves us with the upside potential, but I would suspect that we are still where we were and I must admit we are also still very critical about the further development.  We still see a difference between the state of the credit market on one side and the state of the equity markets on the other side.  Therefore, we remain for the time being on the more careful side here.  Bond duration is about five point something for the whole portfolio at the moment.  And the average yield on bonds is about 4.5% as far as I remember.  I think that's it at the moment.  Did I cover your questions...?</p>

          <p>Agricultural business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That will be me.  Well, first of all the Agricultural business is a business that has some 25 years round about in Munich Re and I think we can say that we are the market leader in agricultural reinsurance because most of the engineers working in that business area with our competitors are coming or came from us.  So we have some 25 engineers both in Munich and its different offices abroad.  I said already that book did grow since 2001 until today more or less threefold and the combined ratio even so it's not a measure of risk but it's certainly an accounting result that you can derive from it is on average in the 93 range.  So if you apply that to the probable income of close to 600 million, you come up with a technical result, underwriting result in the 40 million range on the normal &#x2013; in a normal year.</p>
          <p>Of course, the investment income on this business is relatively limited because it's a very short held business.  It's profitable also because we like business that has been done in public private partnerships.  The big schemes and reinsurance like in US, which is our biggest market, normally is in an arrangement together with some state from the agency that looks after the interest of farmers to protect their income.</p>
          <p>I briefly mentioned in a side remark that the government can support farmers by subsidizing the premiums.  This is WTO compatible.  That is a very important ingredient here.  So by subsidizing the premiums that can support the farmers and we are partnering with these agencies to set up the schemes together with the producers.</p>
          <p>Network's very well.  When it comes now to risk capital consumption, the fact that you work together with these state entities limits up and down side of your business, which means less risk capital supporting it, so without knowing now the exact number my guess would be that the rollout is pretty descent to say the least.</p>
          <p>What do we want and what do we need?  We need a commercially developed production process.  We would not work with small farmers in God knows which country.  We rather like to work with a highly developed production concept in a specific country and we see now for the strong demand increase and prices going up more of a request for coverage and the state or the governments I think will go on and continue to support it, specifically in emerging markets like take Russia, Brazil or in Asia. knows, which country we rather like to work with a highly developed production concept in a specific country and we see now for the strong demand increase and price is going up more of a request for coverage and this states or the governments I think will go on and continue to support it, specifically in emerging markets like take Russia, Brazil or in Asia. That's why we think there is a market for us to be tapped in. I think that would be it in the nutshell what do we cover, we covering normally it's multi-peril coverages, mostly natural catastrophe to protect the income of the farmers, hail, storm, drought and we do go for the basic fruits or cultures I would call it. We would not go for the apple orchard in the first place. We'd rather go for grain, wheat, soya. That's the basic concept.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thorsten Wenzel, DZ Bank.  I've two questions on capital. The first, would you be so kind to give us just an idea on the amount of excess capital you have in terms of the rating agency models?  And then secondly, a question concerning the confidence you have in your internal capital model. I mean, if we assume for a moment that rating agencies were non-existent and there were no other obstacles, would you really trust your internal model enough to pay out the economic capital profit to shareholders?  I mean, this would easily increase your return on equity to amounts which were recently reported by banks, and you make some critical remarks on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's two questions. The first one is for J&#xF6;rg; the second one is for Joe because he has to put his head on the block. I trust him. So let him explain why I can trust him, but I do. But question's still then by the end of the day of course, even if we trust our models, that's for him to answer.  My preliminary markets of course, we're still going to have to make a decision with what kind of layers of security we want to work. The 175 of course, is quite a layer already. So, is there any need for something else for whatever reasons and that may have to do with the confidence, but J&#xF6;rg you go ahead with the rating question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's not so easy to quantify it precisely because for two reasons, one is there's more than one agency who has a model. The second is that in these -- most of these models are relatively new and there are for this reason some questions to be resolved in the course of the further discussion. But as a rule of thumb, I would say it's about a single -- mid-single digit billion amount.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the confidence in the risk model, I'm actually glad you're asking the question because I can explain a little bit what I did in my first months. Obviously, when you're coming in from outside, the first thing is to review the risk model and to challenge the assumptions. And ideally to find 1, 2, 3 billion you could add to the risk model. And I thought in the first place I would be successful by changing the risk measure and there is advantages, many advantages of the new risk measure. But I also found other things like the diversification and aggregation methodology that was going just the other way round. On the other hand, I am -- we have strengths in the assumptions on the tail-dependencies as you have seen. You will certainly believe me that if I didn't trust the model; I would have been pushing the number up at this point in time and not in a year's time very clearly. Now, would we dividend out all of the excess?  Possibly not, exactly for the reason Nikolaus Bomhard has mentioned. Even if we had no restrictions we would certainly say our ambition is to have 175% of that at least 99.5. But we would certainly choose to have a cushion above that because of -- we didn't want to fall below that target capitalization if the first storm hits us. And will that be as much as we currently have? Definitely no, very clearly not.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions please, that are related. First of all, can you reconcile comments made by Nikolaus and by Jeff? Nikolaus, at the beginning you said we should not expect reserve releases, Jeff said that '02 to '06 loss ratio OpEx could probably come down. I don't quite -- if you could just reconcile the difference between those two comments? And then secondly, if you've got this risk margin now built into your stock of reserves, what are you doing about when you establish initial loss ratio OpEx?  Do you also go to loss ratio and build a risk margin into the reserves that are entered in the balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the first one and second one's for you, Jeff. Well, I only make a strong point in saying don't expect a sudden release short term of any reserve cushion. Of course over time we cannot avoid releasing here and there reserves. It's not earnings management and it's rather the fact that also our auditors will ask us to do something about certain reserves. And if you -- you do I know, remember in 2007 we did release some of the shorter tail excessive reserves.  And we will of course have a look into our reserves every year. And all of the years skipped, and depending on the line of businesses, is it an asbestos reserve or is it a straightforward general liability reserve? We will sooner or later have to address the question of over-reserving. And of course depending on what you add to the reserves and how you do it, of course, you either just move it around and there will be a zero sum game or if you follow the approach and that is now for Jeff to answer, you start rebuilding that margin.  And then of course there would be releases going forward. But it will not be a sudden release in a very short amount of time. Depending on the profile of the research we will have to address that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to further elaborate on that, my comment was related to within the total book of reserves and that being element of diversification. So, although we saw some things that could be risky, we also saw some things that could be positive. I could have also used an example of German motor proportional business or some other segment in that regard. But if we do see in terms of positive development that would be one area we'd see and as we go forward, time will tell whether or not that would outweigh any negative development we might see in other areas. Going forward we do look at variety of pieces of information to evaluate our 2008 and then going forward loss ratios. Part of that's underwriting information, part of that's market cycle information and we would say that, yes, our recommendations from a reserving standpoint would be, we should put up a reserve &#x2013; a prudent reserve for the current accident year or underwriting year. Obviously, it's the year that we know the least about from a loss standpoint. We have some evidence when we look at projections there about what's happening in the marketplace, but until you actually see what has actually panned out in terms of competitive pressures, it's hard to forecast what it is. So I would assume that going forward we would recommend prudent reserves for the current underwriting years which would imply some type of risk margin, if you will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just ask a quick supplement to that one? So how do you feel now about your stock of risk margin, that's 3 to 5%. Are you happy with that level or are you still on the curve and building it up?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  I would say, once again based on the assessment of our volatility in the portfolio, we tried to be very candid about what the risks that we see. We talked about European motor excessive loss and the workers' compensation excessive loss. Yes, we have our best estimate up, but could those, dependent on what would happen over the next three to five years, could we get new information that says, gosh, we need to do something about that?  And we would respond to it at that time. So we would use diversification and then to the extent that that was enough we would use the margin to absorb that. And that's why we believe it's really part of our reserves versus some type of future net income forecast.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We take now our first question from William Morgan from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have two questions. The first one relates to some disclosure at the back of your quarterly report, Page 39. I gather everyone has got it on them. But in just looking at the regular income from your reinsurance operations in property-casualty, obviously, clearly currency is depressing your investment income, but there appears to have been about a 15% drop in the regular income from P&amp;C reinsurance year-on-year. It's 375 million in Q1 '08 but it says 443 in Q1 '07. I mean clearly things like currency, et cetera will be playing a part, but I guess that is quite a big drop. Could you maybe say how much of that is due to currency and how that may swing back, and to what extent we could use that as an indicator for the full year or not? The second question I have is just on your reserving tables that you've shown. I mean again, always <mark type="inaudible" />, always a little bit of a complication relating any of this to what you actually report in the calendar year. But the kind of 89 million adverse development that you -- I mean you obviously relate that to kind of a calendar year change. I mean is that something that we would've seen in your numbers in '07? And also sort of relating to that, it looks like the 2005 accident year started to have a slightly negative run off. I guess that's not intuitively a year that we would have thought would run off negatively especially given that the main negatives seemed to come in 2007. I just wondered if you could elaborate on what exactly that is. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I thank you. Well, let Jeff start, because I think he's right, ready. And J&#xF6;rg, you're ready as well? Then you go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's not only currency but it is currency, the decline of the regular income, but it's also a lower level of deposits retained. This is due to the cancellation of the major quota share treaties and therefore, this is not something which will further decline going forward from now. So this is a level without these major treaties on the basis of the current currency. Does it answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean if I was thinking very simplistically, I mean if you were to multiply that number by four, add in kind of actually dividends for the second quarter and then add in some kind of view of normalized gains, that you think is a reasonable way to get to your full year investment income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a bit difficult. When you cancel these big treaties, then you might have some distortions. Let's see what comes out in the second quarter, but according to our forecast, it remains now like it is plus the dividends in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to -- and in terms of when those treaties were exactly canceled, I mean is that a 1st of January thing, or is there -- I mean I guess obviously the 15% reduction we could assume is the sort of, kind of 15% for the entire year underlying, which is obviously pretty major? I just wanted to be clear on that. Did the contracts maybe go out at a different time last year, which might mean that actually the effect won't be so large as we go through the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's quite large and also there's a clean-cut arrangement involved and this has also an impact here because also the reserves move here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the questions regarding the 89 million and whether or not that would be apparent in our financial statements. We do not show that explicitly in the calendar year incurred losses but it would be an implicit part of the calendar year incurred losses not only for the whole segment, but it's particularly in terms of the property-casualty segment. So that would be implicitly in there. In terms of 89 million more additional incurred losses in calendar year 2007, that would have been associated with 2006 prior accident years.</p>
          <p>Regarding you observation about 2005, as I stated, this is a technical detail and so I'll try to keep it a very simple answer. This is what you're seeing is financial data. It is accident year allocation of our ultimate loss projections. When we talked about the Munich Re Munich portfolio, a lot of that analysis is done on an underwriting year basis. And so once we do the actual projections, we actually have a very simple algorithm that just mechanically builds that back to accident years. So you might see some different fluctuations between the individual accident years that look somewhat odd. So I would tend to look at two to three year blocks so you can get a reasonable figure on that. And as you can also see, even though it was a difference of 111 million on a ultimate loss basis, it was still less than 1%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the next question on the floor, and I think comes from Michael Huttner, JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fantastic, thank you very much. I had two questions. One, did I hear you right, do you really want to go back to AAA rating? I heard somebody say AA to AAA and I thought -- I was a little bit puzzled by that. And if so, what will the ratios become because I guess a AAA is not 175% of the <mark type="inaudible" /> I don't know, is it 200% or 250? Maybe you can give us some light on that. And then I must &#x2013; sorry, I was actually very, very nervous when you gave your reply saying, well, one quarter's losses, hey, it's just one quarter. It's kind of a little bit accidental. And I was thinking no, that's your core business, you're supposed to get it right.  And of course there are quarters. But the reason I felt a little uneasy about my perception to the answer was, I couldn't quite get it. Is that &#x2013; from what I understand, a lot of the one-off offers came from one company, from BHP Billiton. And I'm just wondering if BHP Billiton is facing some issues, which means that for whatever reason standards are suddenly declining, maybe maintenance is low, who knows what it is? And suddenly you're getting these ginormous claims. And the fact that you're saying, well, it's accidental. It's not accidental. It's a little bit like having all of your investment portfolio, say invested in JPMorgan stock or something like that.  It's that degree of concentration risk, which I'm not very comfortable with. And I just wondered whether you could explain a little bit more how you see the situation there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start, Mike with the AAA on the high level, and then the calibration will be redesigned by Joe. No, it's not our strategy to go back to AAA, and if you talk to rating agencies, we are still far away because it's not only about capital but also on the capital position. This is not our target to regain AAA from that end. But when it comes to calibration and where are we, Joe, maybe you can phrase that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You need to interpret that in the following context. We have chosen a 175% of valid risk 99.5. We have been looking at what kind of confidence level this reflects when we look at our overall loss distributions, taking into account the entire group. And that results in a 99.98 confidence level. A 99.98 confidence level is somewhere in the middle between a AA confidence and a AAA confidence. Clearly, a little bit closer to the AA, but it's north of the standard AA confidence which is usually quantified at 99.97. And this is why we said it's kind of north of AA towards AAA. That's our risk measure. Clearly it will take some time until rating agencies would follow our internal risk models entirely.  We see a convergence at rating agencies, pay more and more attention to what we do in our risk models, but we are not yet there, that this is a major factor. But in three years' time, I believe, that it's going to be a major factor of their capital analysis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you. Maybe the &#x2013; also one, I think you mentioned it already in the beginning of your presentation, the old model was actually calibrated to exactly the same range, was also north of AAA and south of &#x2013; north of AA and south of AAA. If there's room left in between, I don't know. But it's more or less and that's why, magically you could say the risk capital for different reasons, but it wasn't too far away from each other. But the calibration in terms of security level or risk tolerance did not change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, now coming to the second question, the BHP as an insured that had these two huge losses, I think first of all I would like to mention, when it comes to managing financial distress we do not take a quarterly approach. It's a yearly approach.  And we do not put a lot of effort into managing our quarterly results, as a most of doing of quarterly results is not a high on J&#xF6;rg's or my list. We do what is there and that's it. And if we happen to have two losses from one insured, I would also not read too much into &#x2013; if you have the book of mine risks and there is as you know, and if they had acquired their competitor, there would be even less.  There's not too many companies out there anymore who have a huge portfolio of mines. And one of the most important perils if you insure a mine is flood. Because then the mine is filled by water and then you have a huge business interruption loss. And if then at the same time prices soar, then you have huge losses. That of course must be reflect in underwriting, it must be reflected in the way you manage accumulation risk, that all is being done.  That the BHP has several mines in a country like Australia is no surprise to me and not to you I suppose, because this is one of the countries where natural resources are a major export factor. There could be other countries and one day we might have something of that kind in Russia. If we have or happened to have two heavy rainfalls in four weeks' time only that affect two different mines, pretty close relatively close to each other. But it does not &#x2013; I would not read anything into the quality of the insured nor would I take any drastic conclusions as regards our philosophy and underwriting accumulation management.  It's random. Of course, I would rather not have it, but it does not confuse us nor make us worry beyond the fact that we just have a loss. That's it.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Michael.  So next question on the phone then comes from James Quin from Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Hello there. Two and a half questions, please. The first one is just going back to the reserves and I guess Munich Re is one of the few reinsures or insurers in the world which probably haven't &#x2013; which haven't had reserve releases on the recent accident years.  Now although there seems to be some distortion with the way the accident years are put together. But I guess if you were to compare your data with <mark type="inaudible" /> what you'd see is for them there was good news on the recent years balanced by increases to the old years, whereas you don't seem to have much development on any of the years. I guess the sort of real question here is, if you've been building cushions, are those effectively on the recent years and is it the case that implicit deficiencies might be the wrong word, but, put it this way, if the recent years proves to be redundant, then would you look to build out the margins on those older years for some of the nasty stuff like asbestos? And part B of that question is, I think you mentioned that the historical reserve margin has been in a range of 3 to 5%, could you tell us where it is now? The second question I've got is just going back to a point on Bloomberg, which may not be fully reliable, but it implies that you could be interested in RVF insurance. And I think that will probably leave quite a few people scratching their heads, because it doesn't seem to sit with what you've previously suggested is your likely spectrum of M&amp;A targets. I guess, should we read anything into that? Should we assume that really you're almost interested in almost anything that's for sale? And if not then where do you draw the line? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the first one is for Jeff. He is of course not a free man when it comes to some decisions. Not that we interfere unduly in his work. He comes up with his proposals and then we from the management with him of course have to discuss what should be done. But I think within that framework, Jeff you are a free man.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. First of all, I think it's no surprise that the insurance industry and the reinsurance industry has had issues with reserves in the past. And so we at the Munich Re Group have worked very hard to get to a conservative position our reserves that are consistent with our management expectations and what we feel are the expectations of our shareholders. So, I think in that we take reserve adequacy very seriously. And thus given what we have seen in the past associated with old accident years, makes us reluctant or cautiously approach the positive information that we see in the most recent years. Obviously we have responded with reductions in the most recent years as it relates to property business or short-tailed liabilities. But for the extent that we have casualty covers or covers which handle medical inflation, we are reluctant at this point to make any drastic moves in a positive direction until we have more time to see that information come through.</p>
          <p>In regards to the margin, James, what I can say is, yes it has historically been 3 to 5% and in my comments I calculated for you the top level, that that would be in the neighborhood of 1.2 to 2.1. We've discussed that that's as much as we'd like disclose at this point because we do not want to build into any type of future net income calculations. It really is there to absorb what we would see as undiversified volatility.</p>

          <p>I'm not sure I fully followed that. Was it the margin at the moment is 1.2 to 2.1?  Is that below the range of 3 to 5?</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. 3 to 5% is if you take 3% times the 41.3 billion of total carried net reserves you get roughly 1.2 billion.  And if you take 5% you get roughly 2.1 billion. So we can tell you that it's in between that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that's as of now then basically.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>James and also let me add with regards to reserve policy in general, in my few years as a CEO of that company of course, in the early days I have seen quite a number of reserve increases and I think psychologically you can understand that I'm taking a very cautious approach here. Well, coming to the M&amp;A question, we have the strategy in place and we have a screen with the couple of targets on the screen smaller, mid-sized and bigger maybe, but prioritized. And RAS is not among them, to answer that question. And it really depends, it must make strategic sense and that takes away probably 95% of the comers you possibly could buy, more, 99. And then what is left, then we must be absolutely sure that we are the better owner of the company. And that again takes out a huge portion of the targets we have. And then, after all these hurdles have been passed we have to pass all the hurdles that we have in place when it comes to investment cases. And that is where actually of all the things we had in the pipeline recently, and now I have to re-base it. If you have 100 cases in the pipeline, maybe two passed all these tests. Why? Because prices in most of the markets where we are interested in buying, be it Eastern Europe or Asia, but mostly Eastern Europe are still too high.  And it's amazing almost to me that even in today's world the prices are what they are. So, unless we are absolutely sure that the target is in better hands once it is with us, we will not buy. And the examples I brought along today, the three, Midland, Sterling and <mark type="inaudible" /> were targets where we are and we were and still are convinced, then we can create value. That's why we acquired.  And all these cases were, sort of you might call it -- I always them strange cases, in the sense that the seller was in a situation where it was not a straightforward auction.  Midland was maybe most of an auction, the others weren't really auctions. So we like situations where the buyer does not go all through the market, take RBS right now, we rather want cases where we are approached and someone is saying, you would be an owner we would like and then let's see what can be done.  Then we don't have to run through the auction and this mostly, up to today, where the cases we're in pricing-wise we could come to terms. All the auctions that I have seen over last two or three years we did not win one.</p>

          <p>Thank you. I'd now take a final question from the phone and then I propose that we close because we are already well beyond time, and then we'll have a couple of beers.  So final question from the phone comes from Ben Cohen, UBS.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask J&#xF6;rg if he could be a bit more explicit as to the German statuary reserve around the -- any excess capital that you could return?  Sort of how quickly will that be filled up and are there other mechanisms that you're looking at to speed up the replenishment of that reserve? Basically I suppose, what I'm trying to understand is, is there any way in which you could do more than &#x20AC;1 billion of capital return through to the AGM of next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, so one can do something with regard to the realization of investment returns.  And also there is a normal limit to the equalization reserve, so what we see now equalization reserves of almost of &#x20AC;10 billion. This is a mixture of two things which led in the same direction.  One is a higher volatility in the past of our underwriting reserves, and second is a very successful result during the last few years.  And therefore the threshold amount was quite high, first. And second is, we really filled it up in that time. So going forward there will not be similar increases of the equalization reserve from now on as far as we see it because we have widely de-risked our business portfolio. Second is, there could be more group internal dividends, but that takes time and there are also again limitations in other jurisdictions. So, I do not want to promise anything now.</p>

          <p>All right, then I would say on behalf of the Munich Re management, I'd like to thank you, thank you for your questions, thank for your participation be it on the phone, on the Internet or people that made it to Munich. This now closes the formal part of the presentation. I hope you can enjoy the rest of the sunny day, and for those people who are actually in the room we look forward to some more informal discussions outside of this room. Thank you very much.</p>
