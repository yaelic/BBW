          <p>Good morning and welcome to this Presentation of the 2011 Results for the BBVA. We will have the presentation first after which there will be Q&amp;A and we'll also be receiving questions over webcast after which the investor relations department will be open to any further questions.</p>

          <p>Good morning, and welcome to this presentation of the BBVA Group's results for the year ending in December 31, 2011. We're going to be going over the highlights to the performance of the Group and then we'll go on and have a look at the key factors driving the different business areas.</p>
          <p>I'd like to start by just having a look at the macroeconomic environment worldwide. At the end of the year, the world economy will have grown at nearly 4%. And if we look at where that growth's coming from, South America will be growing about 6.5%. Mexico didn't reach 4%; it will be more likely 3.8%. Asia without taking Japan into account, will be close to 7.5%, Turkey 8.5. And when we look at the most developed countries, both Europe and the United States will be growing slightly above 1.5%.  Maybe the most relevant issue here is that the outlook for growth for 2012 going to be worse than in 2011.</p>
          <p>Maybe one of the keys to understanding the year is that the focus of the entire international community has been on Europe and the crisis in Europe. But if we compare the situation now against what we had a year ago, there has been clear progress. First of all, there have been widespread changes in governments, in countries where they were having difficult problems in achieving their fiscal targets.</p>
          <p>Secondly, during 2011, we've seen fiscal adjustments and corrections in order to achieve the budget targets by the end of 2013. The measures taken at the end of 2011 by the European Central Bank have clearly lightened the tension in the markets, and with the negotiations on Greek debt coming to an end, it's been possible to bring down the risk premium for peripheral countries bit by bit. And that means a lower interest payment cost for these countries and the banking sectors.</p>
          <p>The crisis however, has had an impact on the financial sector especially on four key areas. First of all, capital, then liquidity, on the situation of risks in a very general sense of the word, and then the results, the earnings of the sector. And that's where BBVA, yes, again has managed to stand out, outperforming its peers in all these areas.</p>
          <p>In capital, we're going to comply with the new EBA capital recommendations of 9% capital ratio by June 2012. And as we move into 2012, we're already on a very sound financial footing.</p>
          <p>In risk, once again we've got stable indicators. So that's eight quarters running that we've been reporting stable indicators. And in a very tough environment, yet again we are reporting highly resilient earnings.</p>
          <p>So first of all, let's have a look at the capital. We're looking at it from two focuses. First of all, Basel II or well, Basel 2.5 and then we look at it in terms of compliance with the EBA requirements. Under Basel 2, Basel 2.5, we've got to 10.3% core capital. And the main impacts are well-known, I think. Organic generation of capital, 80 basis points in the year, of which this quarter, we've brought in about 20 basis points.</p>
          <p>The conversion of preferred shares into convertible bonds, which is 1 percentage point and then including the impact of Basel, the BIS 2.5, that brings it down 0.2 and then we have other impacts coming to that 10.3 ratio.</p>
          <p>In terms of the EBA requirements to the 30th of June, well, at the 31st of December, we've got to an 8.7% capital ratio. So we're very close to the recommended levels already. We started at 7.1% a quarter again, in this quarter, we've generated &#x20AC;5.3 billion or 1.6% that is, which means that if you look at the buffer that we required, we have another &#x20AC;1 billion outstanding.</p>
          <p>What do you have to take into account? Well, simply, organically generating capital through earnings in the first half year will be more than enough to cover that amount. And it will make it possible to go on with the same dividend policy, both in terms of quantity and in terms of the way we do the payout. And we'll be able to go on maintaining the highest quality in risk-weighted assets without having had to sell any of our strategic assets that are going to be generating growth for the future.</p>
          <p>In terms of liquidity, I was saying before that we have a very sound financial basis to start 2012 and very quickly we can say that we've brought down our funding requirement by more than &#x20AC;24 billion since the crisis began. So in this quarter, there's been another &#x20AC;4 billion added to that closure of the gap.</p>
          <p>We've been able to go to the ECB to get finance lines that we can use strategically, that was &#x20AC;11 billion and that will cover our wholesale funding needs for all of 2012 pretty well. So, we feel very comfortable about the markets in 2012, because it doesn't matter how they're performing. In 2011, nonetheless, we were able to top the markets with relative ease, even at times of adverse conditions. And finally and very important, we still have available collateral in order to cope with any additional liquidity shock that might hit us in 2012.</p>
          <p>I was talking about risks and saying that it was the eighth quarter running that we're presenting stable ratios. With respect to risk premiums, cost of risk as well we are seeing that we're very stable there. And we can look at the NPAs, the net balance has hardly increased in 2011 with very stable balances throughout the year, which has meant that we are able to present NPA ratios slightly below 4%, 4% when we rounded them up, but very stable over the last few quarters. And we are stabilizing our coverage ratio as well at 61%.</p>
          <p>The other thing is the resilience of our earnings, despite the fact that we are operating in a highly complex environment, &#x20AC;4 billion in net attributable profit without including the impairment of our goodwill in the U.S., because without that we'd be talking about &#x20AC;3.4 billion. This is thanks to the contribution made by our diversified business portfolio covering so many geographical areas.</p>
          <p>Some of them are growing very well and in the developed markets we're seeing that we're resilient to the complications we're seeing in countries like Spain. In the U.S., we will see that later, we have a clear example of the kind of transformation that the group can do. And then the new region we have, the rest of Europe and Asia is already growing its contribution, and has become as important on our books as South America as a whole.</p>
          <p>Where are these earnings coming from? Well, they're starting from the most recurrent business on the income statement, the net interest income, which this quarter has shown the biggest quarter-on-quarter growth of many quarters, 6% which means at the end of the year we will have grown 1%; in constant exchange rate terms which is the outcome of a mix of the developing world or emerging markets growing very fast and the mature markets being managed very well with excellent pricing management.</p>
          <p>If we look at net trading income and dividends, gross income has gone down 1.6%. Here perhaps the most important impact is the lesser percentage that trading has brought in in 2011 compared to 2012. However, if we look at the recurrent earnings, getting rid of some of the volatility of the trading, we'll see that the gross income is growing very soundly quarter-on-quarter. And the quarter-on-quarter growth is the same as that of net interest income, namely 6%.</p>
          <p>What about costs? They're growing 11% and as in the income statement in general, we're seeing more growth in the emerging economies where there are a lot of growth opportunities whilst they are being brought down in the mature markets.</p>
          <p>It's important to understand that 11% and where it comes from. It basically comes from two points. In terms of growth we're seeing non-organic growth, what we would call changes of perimeter and that has an impact of 4.2% of that 11%. Basically that comes from the investment in Turkey and some purchases in Uruguay and Chile in South America.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of organic growth, we've been opening new branches and setting up new ATMs and we've been meshing our business networks. And we've got a big investment in technology which we've been keeping up throughout the crisis so we've got the best technology platforms wherever we're working which means 1.6% of that 11%. So what we can consider to be recurrent growth would be 3.9%, which is below the average inflation in the group.</p>
          <p>What about provisioning? Well, that's pretty stable too. In fact the tendency is for it to go down over the last three years, bringing down the cost of risk to 1.2%, which is what we present for the end of 2011. 1.2% has meant that we've been able to maintain generic provisions here in Spain at the level we had at the end of 2012, and take advantage of capital gains or the better net trading income that we got in the final quarter.</p>
          <p>So here we're presenting an income statement that's highly resilient, &#x20AC;4.15 billion, which means that we can present one of the best returns on equity that you'll see in the industry in the forthcoming presentations. 10.6%, 0.8% over total assets and &#x20AC;0.85 a share in terms of earnings per share, which means that shareholders are getting the same kind of return they've always got at &#x20AC;0.42 for their share. And we've maintained the two interim dividends which could be paid optionally in shares or in cash and the others directly in cash.</p>
          <p>In Spain, the main characteristics have to do with pricing. In the last few months, we've seen a reduction in the cost of funding for retail deposits whilst the price of lending is also improving, which means it's possible for us to say in the last quarter, that there's been an improvement of the customer spread of 20 basis points. This means that we are able to confirm in this quarter, that we have touched rock bottom in our net interest income over the last five quarters. And we now think that definitely the outlook is positive as 2012 begins.</p>
          <p>Looking at costs, I already said that in the mature markets, we're keeping a strict control on crisis. Since crisis we have seen a reduction of cost in Spain this year. There is another drop of 0.5%. And in terms of the risk indicators, this country, where we're having a very complex market for the eighth quarter running as in other geographical areas, we've got stable coverage and NPA ratios and we're keeping down the specific cost of risk.</p>
          <p>In terms of how we deal with the forthcoming write-downs we will have to have in the real estate sector, we've now become subject to the new regulations. We are already in a privileged situation in terms of the percentage of foreclosed assets to total assets and the percentage of our exposure to developers in our total loan book. And we've got about &#x20AC;3.6 billion in net margin in order to be able to deal with any additional requirements that we might have on our operating income, which means that even in adverse conditions like we have now in Spain, we've got income of close to &#x20AC;1.36 billion.</p>
          <p>The next region in the group is the rest of Europe and Asia. This is due to the dynamic investment in Turkey and the investments in China; and also the resilient growth in the wholesale markets, both in Europe and in Asia, which has meant that we've made a balanced contribution to the income statement. So with all of this, we have reached a figure that is slightly over &#x20AC;1 billion contribution to the total earnings for the group.</p>
          <p>Mexico, especially analyzes the latter half of the year, we're starting to see how loans are starting to pick up, basically in local business and rather than the global business. But in most of the retail headings, because retail is growing by 14% and companies by 18% and from the point of view of customer funds it's the same story. We're seeing greater growth in transactions where costs are cheaper than in long-term and we're recovering our quota in funds.</p>
          <p>And what's also important, of which you will see later is costs. We're investing basically in technology and the new business segment enables us in 2011 to bring over 2 million new customers to the bank. I was saying that the dynamic business started to come into the net interest income in recent quarters and especially in this fourth quarter where we're starting to see it far stronger.</p>
          <p>And this has been stronger because as I said before the greater dynamism we're seeing in local business where the net interest income has grown by over 14%. And in corporate and investment banking we're seeing growth throughout all our geographies where our peers are not, which means that the total net interest income has ended up by growing over 7.2%. And this growth in the net interest income and also in the gross income means that we can offer the markets the highest figure in our quarterly margins, in our entire history in the Mexican franchise.</p>
          <p>And as I said, I talked about the investments we're making in, and the new segments in Mexico, we have to break down growth in Mexico between the recurrent costs and the performance regarding to the organic growth in Mexico. We can say 5.6% of this 9.4% is a consequence of the investment that we're making in new staff, opening branches, new ATMs and TPVS. We're also investing in POSs.</p>
          <p>And also with regard to the risk indicators, we're seeing stability from both in NPA and coverage ratio, but also the risk premium, especially, if we compare this with the last five quarters. So as we can say this has remained stable and dropping which takes us to an income statement that is growing from 7.2% in net interest income to reach an attributable profit of &#x20AC;1.741 billion, which is over 5% growth.</p>
          <p>The next business area, South America. The dynamism here is even greater. The lending is growing by around 30% both in lending and also in customer funds. We are gaining market share both in customer funds and in lending. And as in Mexico, this is due to investments in segments and in technologies and people. We're growing, over a million new customers will come in from the different geographies of South America this year.</p>
          <p>And we're seeing this very quickly in the net interest income, both quarter-on-quarter which is nearly 9% growth and also year-on-year where we're seeing almost 27% growth. And this clearly comes through to the gross income which has grown by more than 21%.</p>
          <p>As in Mexico, here in South America this is also the highest quarter in our history, both net interest income and also for gross income. Costs, once again this is the same as in Mexico.</p>
          <p>If we separate the recurring part of the costs from the organic growth and the, sort of the change the perimeter, and we can see that about half of this comes from recurrent business and the other half is a consequence of the investment that we're making, to a slight extent for new franchises in South America and Uruguay, but also our holding in Chile. But we're also growing our staff because we are opening new banks and we're bringing new ATMs into the network.</p>
          <p>The risk ratios are the best in the group both from the point of view of the NPA ratio but also from the point of view of the coverage ratio and clearly the risk premium is totally stable and dropping slightly, which leads to an income statement which has also grown.</p>
          <p>We're going to see over &#x20AC;1 billion sales grown by over 16% and we're seeing major growth in net interest income which we've seen has grown by over 30%.</p>
          <p>And the final geography is the United States and clearly the U.S. is where we're seeing the greatest transformation in our business model. This transformation is clearly translated into how we're seeing the performance both in lending and also in customer deposits.</p>
          <p>And the lending side, once the balance sheet has been totally transformed from the point of view of the weighting on each of the more risky business such as commercial real estate, we're starting to see sustained growth and we're starting to invoice of over $1 billion a month. The most profitable products are the ones that are growing in this new business.</p>
          <p>And from the point of view of customer funds, once again, we're improving the mixture of these customer funds between those that's gained the most and those who gained the least which means that this quarter, once again, will have reduced the cost of the customer deposits to 0.36%, which together with the performance in business, lending business, at the end of the year, we're seeing a customer spread up to 3.9%. And this basically is translated in the net interest income in local business as we're seeing positive growth quarter-on-quarter. And if we compare this with 2010, it's also positive.</p>
          <p>So what we can say here is how the weight of the local net interest income is not too great, but it offsets the growth. But in local business, we're seeing the performance is growing, is doing very well.</p>
          <p>From the point of view of provisioning or loan-loss provisioning, this is another one of the best news from the United States. Once again, we get the clear confirmation of the performance of this. So the risk indicators, there's a fall in loss loan provisioning of even 50%, the risk premium is below 1%. And if we look at the NPA ratio and coverage ratios, we can see here, these are improving quarter-on-quarter. And all of this is due in part to the gross entries of over 40% and a strong increase in recoveries, which in recent months, the net additions have been zero.</p>
          <p>And this means that the income statement that has been growing over the last three years in a sustained manner. And this is thanks to four main characteristics. The change from product to customers; leverage and technology which has enabled us to carry out this transformation; the fact that we have not stopped changing the mix of our balance, both on the liabilities and the asset side, which has added the right price management, which has increased the spreads; and improvements in the main net interest income margin.</p>
          <p>So, if we look at the net interest income we can see that profit is nearly &#x20AC;300 million, which is a growth of 23%, which in this franchise if we took out the wholesale world, this growth would be closer to 40%.</p>
          <p>And finally, wholesale banking and asset management covering all the difference without the asset management, we can see that the resilience that have come from the income for several reasons. First of all, because the geographic diversification and secondly, because of the diversification of products and third point here is the levering in our customer franchise.</p>
          <p>As we can see here, over 90% of our revenues in this area comes from the customer franchise. And only 9% of our business comes from trading. And it's the customer franchise, even in difficult times, such as now, that has grown by 4%. And this has lead us to an attributable profit of &#x20AC;1.12 billion profit, which has only fallen by 7%, which is a good result, if we compare ourselves with our peers.</p>
          <p>Okay, so this takes the income statement of over &#x20AC;1.1 billion. The important thing here in summary, there are four keys issues that have affected the whole financial industry. Capital in BBVA, we're certainly going to easily meet the requirements without having to sell any strategic assets, the new ratio of 9%. We can look forward to 2012 from a very strong and solvent position and from the point of view of risks over the last eight quarters and we think that the future is going to be similar. The indicators are stable and well under control. The earnings are resilient and we're starting to see an upward trend over the last few quarters in our income statement.</p>
          <p>Looking forward now to 2012. Depending on the geographies, I think, in Europe, we're seeing a recession with a duality between the center and the periphery. In the United States, I think, we're going to see a progressive recovery. And in the emerging world, I think, we'll continue to see strong growth in their economies. In any event, the common feature to this will be the final resolution of the European crisis.</p>
          <p>From the point of view of the BBVA group, once again I'll repeat from the point of view of capital, we will easily cover the new requirements without having to go into the markets, without having to increase capital or without having to sell strategic assets. The liquidity is okay. There is no problem there. And risks, we've got stable indicators and I think this is what we're going to see in the future as well.</p>
          <p>And moreover, especially in the case of Spain, we're going to see a capacity to absorb new regulatory impacts without any problems. And finally earnings, what we're forecasting for 2012, our growth to a certain extent, in each and every one of our geographies in the profit figures.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. And I'll now move on to whatever questions you may have.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start the Q&amp;A session. And as before I'll try to put the questions together into different blocks so that we can answer as many questions as possible. So we'll start with the questions on capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rohith Chandra from Barclays and Carlos Joaquim from BPI are asking about the EBA ratio which at the moment is 8.7%. Can we reach 9% by July 2012 solely with organic generation of capital? Have we given consideration in this calculation of the 9%, the additional provisions that might be demanded in the course of 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, to answer your first question as to whether we will hit the 9% ratio by the end of June, as I said in the presentation just by organically generating capital without including any of the internal plans that we have to improve our balance sheet. So, without anything like that, just with organic growth, we'll be able to easily overshoot that 9% figure. And if we then include the impact of the possible new regulations that will be coming out over the next few days, in this comment obviously we haven't included those.</p>
          <p>But when I was saying that business in Spain and worldwide has the capacity to absorb new requirement because of the high net income that we consistently bring in, that means that &#x2013; of course we don't have information about what the impact of these regulations could be, but we do know that things like, well, we've got close to &#x20AC;8 billion generic provisions available, we're generating each year. Or we're provisioning more than &#x20AC;800 million provisions each year for the real estate assets we have in our books. And moreover as I said before, we're going to be presenting growth in all geographical areas in our income statement.</p>
          <p>So, apart from that, in the figures that we were giving you before we haven't included the impact of the sale of any strategic assets or non-strategic assets indeed, so we have a lot of capacity to actively manage our balance sheet still. We don't foresee any kind of problem in reaching that 9% by the end of June.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of funding and liquidity, Rohith Chandra from Barclays asks about the European Central Bank December figures, can we confirm those &#x20AC;11 billion that we got from the ECB in their auction. How have these been used? Have we been doing any carried rates and what plans do we have for 2012 with the new financial facility coming from Europe for February?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Daiwa is talking about liquidity and asks what we'll be doing with that financial facility? And that's what we were asked for before. And Carlos Joaquim from BPI is asking about how much we have in terms of funds from the European Central Bank and what plans do we have for the forthcoming auction from the ECB in February.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I'd like to confirm, as I said in the presentation, the &#x20AC;11 billion, we haven't used this &#x20AC;11 billion, as I said in the presentation, for trading, but rather to reduce the cost of our fund or the rest of our wholesale funding. We haven't used this in retail. With regard to 2012, we haven't taken the decision yet. We're going to have to wait to see what we have available in the new regulations that might come out from the ECB. So once we have all the information available, we'll take the decision of when we can go to the ECB and if we do, we will let you know as we did when we went into the market in 2011.</p>

          <p>New requirements with regard to real estate provisioning, Mediobanca asks what we expect in the potential reform that it is going to be approved in the Council of Ministers tomorrow. Some of our rivals have started a process of increasing their coverage for foreclosed assets. So what do we think the final coverage ratio will be, if we include doubtful assets and substandard ones and foreclosed assets with regard to our exposure to real estate in the course of this cycle?</p>

            <mark type="indiscernible" /> from Aiowa (31:52) is asking how much we should book to the income statement of 2012 to cover the effects of the Spanish government's decision.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And Carlos Joaquim Peixoto is talking about the new regulations and asking about real estate. What do we think the impact of the new regulations will have on our income statements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And along the same line, there's Rohith Chandra from Barclays has covered the same ground, basically asks if we believe that with &#x20AC;3 billion or &#x20AC;4 billion more in provisions, will this cover our total exposure to real estate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, all these questions are asking the same basic thing. First of all, what are we expecting? Over the next couple of days &#x2013; three days, we'll not just be hearing about the new regulations, but also the impact, depending on how they word the new regulations, if it goes into enough detail to get precise calculations or not, we'll have to see.</p>
          <p>So in the next couple of days, as we always do, when we have relevant things like this, we will have to make a filing, so that the market knows what the impact will be exactly and how we'll cover the impact and what kind of capital requirements it will mean. We'll have to wait though, because we don't have information that we could consider suitably detailed to give you any figure. And it wouldn't make sense to give you a specific figure, the kind of estimates that the analysts have been using as an average and we think that is more likely, obviously, but we haven't got any more information than you do.</p>
          <p>And what's important is that we've got two possibilities. We could have initiated the provisioning against this item before it happens. We have to comply with the regulations and the regulations will be published in a couple of days. So it seemed to us that taking a stopgap measure before it happened didn't make sense because we think it's best to close the books under the prevailing regulations with the kind of coverage that we've been reporting, which, if we compare ourselves against the others, is really amongst the best, 34%, the best.</p>
          <p>And then there's the management of our real estate book. From the beginning of the crisis, we have been dealing with outstanding risk in a very active way incorporating, from NPAs, the assets that we had to our provisions. So that meant that we've got better coverage ratios, and also meant that we could have provisioning for the future, like the regulations coming up, with lower levels than our competitors needed. And so that's what we're expecting, lower amounts than our competitors' need in provisioning. We have coverage, and in the next few days we'll see exactly how much will be required.</p>
          <p>But at the moment that the levels will be clearly above the prices that we'll be able to get on the market through liquidation, so there shouldn't be any more impairment at all, given that everything's provisioned and we've got all the levers that we can use to meet the capital ratios we'll have by the 30th of June, and with the new regulations, we definitely don't think we'll have to tap the markets for any additional capital, and we won't have to get rid of any strategic assets that could undermine our outlook for future growth in business areas.</p>

          <p>And then strategy and M&amp;A from Mediobanca. We've been asked &#x2013; well, we have a sound geographical diversification over several regions in the world. And now, possibly, we could increase this position in Spain. Is this likely, whereas with the consolidation of banks, are we worried about the potential exercise of political influence and what criteria would we use to evaluate non-organic growth in Spain?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>From Fidentiis, we have a question, about the conditions in which we'd be willing to take part in the consolidation of the Spanish financial system?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>From Daiwa, we have a question about our estimate for the composition of our earnings coming from the different regions in the next three years. What kind of percentage would we expect from each of the main regions?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>From N+1, we've got a question about the role we could play in consolidation of the market in Spain. And Carlo Di Grandi from HSBC asks, if we say, that we are not selling off assets, does that mean that there is going to be growth in assets over the next couple of years in group as a whole? Does this mean we are not expecting deleverage over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question, as we've been saying in recent quarters, we are not suffering any pressure either from the government or the Bank of Spain and, in any event, even if we do, our attitude to this pressure will be the same as we didn't. And that is that we would analyze each situation, study any opportunities that come up in coming quarters, months or whatever, the same way as if we were making an investment in Turkey or in Mexico, we do exactly the same thing. Investments that generate value for the shareholders will be made. So we're always looking out for value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>The next part of the question or next question was under what conditions we'll be willing to anticipate. Well, the same thing, really, the same criteria, if they generate value, then we're interested, if it doesn't, we're certainly not going to put up with losses because of this restructuring. If anybody thinks that, they'd be wrong because we're not going to take on any losses that could be generated by this restructuring process.</p>
          <p>As for what we're going to be looking at over the next two or three years, obviously, the U.S. will make, I mean, growing contributions to the group's earnings without shadow of a doubt. And if we look at the stronger growth that we're going to see in the emerging areas both in Turkey, Mexico, South America, I think what we're going to see is going to come up to the same point of Spain, even though it's growing in business activity. But I think it'll grow less in percentage terms than other geographies. So I think we're going to see a similar structure to what we're seeing now but the U.S. will contribute more and the emerging markets will be the same or a little bit more and Spain, in order to maintain its weight, this will be due to the fact that it's weakened &#x2013; we're seeing greater growth, either organic or non-organic, depending on the opportunities we see in the market.</p>

          <p>Santiago L&#xF3;pez from Exane says that the bank subsidiary, Compass, has generated an accumulated negative profits since 2006. So his question is when are we going to amortize the &#x20AC;4.5 billion of &#x2013; in goodwill?</p>
          <p>In his opinion, the business is not generating enough money to justify the current goodwill. So over the next two years, can we expect more &#x2013; another &#x20AC;1.5 billion in goodwill in the fourth quarter, can we expect a write-down of this in the final quarter of 2012 or the first quarter of 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, Manuel has jotted down that there are two matters that I didn't cover on the previous question about not selling of assets. I said that we're not selling strategic assets. And I'm saying that because we think that after the new requirements come in, we want to maintain all our strategic assets. And that's the assets that are going to be the very backbone of future growth of earnings and growth of business over the next few years.</p>
          <p>And are we going to see deleveraging in the next couple of years especially in Spain? Well, we think that there will be deleveraging in some sectors, but we think we'll start to see growth in others. That means that the overall mix will be that of low growth in lending activity, on average, over the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>I think, it was Santi L&#xF3;pez, was it, who was asking about the goodwill, right? First of all, if you looked at the figures and if you looked at the items that we are reporting in the U.S., if I had to say which business unit has evolved best and has transformed most in 2011, but this is true of previous years too, it would definitely be the United States.</p>
          <p>If we look at the numbers there, we see an improvement in all the ratios related to the generation of new business, with the model, which is clearly more customer centric than it used to be, because in 2011, we have the BBVA customer centric model not a product centric model. And we are rolling out our IT technology and it should be completely in operation for the end of 2012 and running at full speed in 2013.</p>
          <p>And then if we look at the business model, we can say it's not just that, but also the balance sheet, the assets and the liabilities on both sides. We've seen enormous transformation, which means for the better, bringing down commercial real estate's impact, bringing it down to the right kind of levels that we need to have between 2010 to 2011. And so in 2012, we wouldn't have to have any more write-downs or provisions, and we'll only be working in the areas that, again, to bring us in earnings, as you saw in the presentation. And also because of the high liquidity that we have in this franchise, we are able to have an active management of prices.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead, the outlook is very good, it's true. But there are external issues to the business in the U.S., such as the rather slower recovery of the economy than was expected, the frequent incorporation of new regulations that have an impact on the financial sector. These do have an impact on us and our protections in the U.S., maybe not in very high amounts for 2014 and 2015, but nonetheless, we thought that because of those changes, it was a good idea to reprice the goodwill we have on our book.</p>
          <p>What are we expecting for the next couple of years? Well, we'll have an impairment but it's done on a very remote basis. So we'll be seeing the fruits of the transformation that we've been rolling out over the next few years, and we'll see how that passes on immediately to our income statement. But over the next two years, we don't think there will be any additional impairment at all to the figures that we have there. The chances are very remote.</p>

            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:23) from Ahorro is now asking about 2012. He says that through the European Central Bank, we have covered our maturity schedule.

          <p>Antonio Ramirez from Keefe asks something that's already been answered about the use of the &#x20AC;11 billion, and how much we're going to be asking from the auction in February. And then he asks about wholesale funding and deposits in Spain. Will they be impacted by the ECB facility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then we have a question from N+1, asking about the funds and how we're going to use them &#x2013; the funds that we're going to get from the February auction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All these questions, really, are dealing with the same issue. With regard to funding costs in 2012, ever since decisive action was taken by the ECB, we're seeing continued improvement in the lending spreads and both the sovereign spreads and the bank's spreads are narrowing in covered unsecured and in secured loans. What we're also seeing is that funding costs, especially, in the short term are falling. So I think it's reasonable to assume that if things remain the same throughout the year, then we're going to see improvements in funding costs in 2012, in comparison with the marginal terms of the cost that we've seen in 2011.</p>
          <p>Whether we're going to continue to go to the capital markets, the current situation is we're very, very comfortable. We have no need, whatsoever, to go to the capital markets on our euro balance, but this is a leading international group, so we have to maintain the discipline of going to the capital auctions because they're very useful as price references on the marginal cost of funding in mid to long term. So our intention is to continue to go to the markets but in a more opportunist form, but we are very, very comfortable about it if the spreads in these prices are right.</p>
          <p>The 29th of February auction, what are we going to do? How much are we going to use? How are we going to use the funds? Basically, we have this whole month to assess the situation. Obviously, the facility established by the ECB is very attractive, which guarantees funding over a three-year period, and this gives us the option of start to using the position once a week, after a year, which means it's a very valuable point for managing our <mark type="ph" /> balance in both (47:52) and, as Angel has said, we will weigh up the situation and will decide exactly what we're going to do.</p>
          <p>We have been totally transparent with regard to how much we have tapped the markets for in December, and we have no problem with giving you the full details about this, the reasons and the amount, as to whether this will translate into falls in the cost of deposits</p>
          <p>In Spain, what we're seeing in the fourth quarter and this has been mentioned by Angel Cano when he talked about this in his presentation, that the customer spreads are improving and this is accelerated in the fourth quarter in our retail banking and also in our commercial banking. In fact in the second half of the year, the renewal of term deposits, the average cost of renewal term deposits has been 1.53% when the stock was 2.06%. So we're already seeing now in the last quarter of the year, we're seeing an improvement in liability costs and it's a significant one in our case.</p>
          <p>Over the year, we've gained over 1 percentage point in market quota in term deposits. So I think we are seeing a progressive process where spreads are getting back to normal and if you remember, we've always said, this is the great opportunity that we have to improve our earnings in the business here in Spain.</p>

          <p>Ignacio Cerezo from Credit Suisse asks about our optimizations for our risk-weighted assets, the plans that we had announced in order to meet the capital requirements put out by the EBA. This has not come about, apparently, this quarter, so he would like to know why we haven't reduced our RWAs, which would increase our EBA ratio by June to 9%, and what should we expect in coming quarters?</p>
          <p>He also asks about the dividend policy that we have planned for 2012 and the distribution between cash. But as Angel Cano said in his presentation, there's no reason to change our dividend policy. So there will be two cash dividends and two in scrip, this is risk-weighted assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, if I remember right, in the presentation we said 64 basis points coming from the optimization of our balance sheet. And we've brought in 18 of these points in the last quarter of the year. The plans are still being rolled out, they depend on us to a large degree, but mainly, we don't have any requirements to even go to the Bank of Spain. So we'll just have to see gradually, over the next few months, how things rollout, but we think that this is going to be supplementary. So that when we get to the end of June, we'll be able to meet the requirements with the mere organic growth that we're expecting to get, because we can easily get in.</p>
          <p>And so now, we think that the plan was presented at the end of the year and 18 basis points is a figure that we think is quite reasonable. And we will incorporate that straightaway, and the rest will come in through the rest of the year, just being generated by normal business. We have the advantage that we are not under pressure, really, to get to that 9%, because we've got sufficient drivers to get there quite comfortably.</p>
          <p>And I'd just like to remind what the COO said in his presentation, that this impact of improving the treatment of models that we've got for operational risk has made it possible for us to, this quarter, offset the increase of the consumption of capital by bringing in Basel 2.5. So we've made a lot of progress there with the use of our models and we think that the plan is being rolled out very smoothly. And we have a lot of upside to come in the next few months.</p>

          <p>And then with respect to asset quality in Spain, from N+1 we have a comment, we wrote-down a lot of NPAs at the end of 2009, which turns out to be enough until 2011, but given the macro impairment, we're expecting in 2012 in Spain. Do you think it's possible to keep the NPA ratio at the current level in Spain? Antonio Ramirez from Keefe asks about the tendency that we're observing in NPAs above all for SMEs and for mortgages in Spain, what we expect will happen here in the country? For NPAs yes, NPAs and credit &#x2013; asset quality.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Antonio Ruiz (53:15) from Kepler asks about what kind of impairment we could expect in NPAs if, in 2012, the Spanish economy were to go into recession between 1% and 2%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ever since the end of 2009 when we started these exercises and as we saw how we were &#x2013; the NPA from developers and especially after the second year, i.e., 2011, we're seeing the appearance of what we expected with the information that we had.</p>
          <p>With regard to 2012, we always look at the macro situation, and what we look at is the unemployment rate and we realized the quality of the customers we have and the asset quality that we have in our balance sheet, in our case, in BBVA. And this means it's true, that unemployment is very high but fortunately, there are far more people who do have jobs and they continue to pay their mortgages regularly.</p>
          <p>When we talk about mortgages, we shouldn't forget that we have 3% NPA ratio. And another way of looking at this is that 97% of our customers continue to pay their mortgages regularly. So forecasts after the economic outlook for 2012, our budgets for 2012 include the consideration that we are considering to &#x2013; continued stability in the NPA ratio, in average, to all segments and products. And if there was a creep up, we think that it will be a small creep. But we still think that NPA ratios will remain stable.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Regarding the risk premium in Spain for 2012, of course, we have to recognize that there will be new regulatory treatment given to real estate risk in general, but the government is going to be reporting on that very soon. Meanwhile, we think it's going to be likely that we will be able to continue with the stable provisions, as the COO said. This year, we haven't needed to use generic provisions in Spain, so in fact, we boosted it back out to the levels that we had at the end of the previous year. And so we've got a lot of slack available for us, nonetheless, our budgets suggests provisioning being stable in Spain over 2012.</p>
          <p>And I insist we obviously have to make an abstract hypothesis about what the regulations could mean. And obviously, the real estate issue is an important issue, when valuating the impact of the new regulations, as the COO said before, it's relevant because our budgets here in Spain, a lot of the provisioning that we have for 2012 has to do for the real estate sector in general.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then there's a question about regulation, I think we've already answered this. But if you wish, I can say some of the key issues again and what we are thinking about here. First of all, I'll remind you that once we get the information, once we get all the details, the ramifications then we'll do our calculations. And we think that possibly that won't be the definitive estimate until we get the further ramifications of the regulations. But the initial announcement with the figures we've given, we will have a conference call or something, so that you'll be immediately informed of the most relevant aspects and the main impacts on BBVA.</p>
          <p>And I should remind you, because I think it's a good idea to have a kind of checklist in our head, we can generate recurrent earnings in Spain, &#x20AC;3.6 billion at the group level. It's more than &#x20AC;10.6 billion. That's just recurrent earnings. And I was saying that we have generic provisioning, quite apart from what we have at local level in the different geographical areas of &#x20AC;860 million.</p>
          <p>And then normally, over the last few years in the normal course of business, what we had for 2012 is once again to be provisioning of about another &#x20AC;800 million. And so any new requirements that might come in aren't going to impact us very much, because we'd just be able to do more provisioning maybe in 2012, 2013 and 2014. We'll do more of the same probably. So just with the provisioning that we have for the next three years, we would already be ready to comply with the new regulations. That's very possible.</p>
          <p>And then finally, we shouldn't forget that we've got a buffer for sovereign debt. So with these requirements of 9% under EBA, that means that's &#x20AC;2.3 billion for the BBVA. And we all know from what's been communicated to the market about the new recommendations about capital, it's very likely that we'll get instructions that that buffer will no longer have to exist, which will mean that we will be freeing up more capital with the buffer that will be available of <mark type="ph" /> &#x20AC;2.3 billion (01:00:09). And we don't think that that will be a very different figure from what's going to happen.</p>

          <p>I'll repeat what I said before. With or without the influence of the Spanish Government or the Bank of Spain, we've never taken our decisions due to pressures from the government or the Bank of Spain and nothing is going to change here. So our approach to assessing up any opportunities that may arise, in particularly in Spain, are going to continue. Well, we're going to be professional. It'll have to generate value for the shareholders. And of course, we are not going to cover any losses in restructuring the banks here in Spain. And I'll say this outright, we are not going to take a share of any losses in this process.</p>
          <p>The geographic areas in Spain that we'd be interested in. Quite honestly, we're interested in growing our market share in general terms, especially in places where we have a lower market share. I could give you names, but it doesn't really make sense until we know exactly what's going on. But obviously, we have the infrastructure and we have the scale to take on more business and far more customers without having to invest very much in infrastructure. So this is something that we'll have to keep an eye on over the next 12 months to 18 months. And obviously, we have to continue to play a leading part in this restructuring process.</p>
          <p>Turkey, we can grow our investment in Turkey. In the short-term, we have no plans to grow our investment in Turkey. But it's just a question of time because in the coming years, what we're seeking to do is to live up to and comply with our shareholders contract. And that is to end up having control over the bank in Turkey. But I can't give you the exact details of the timing at the moment. We know that this won't be in the short-term.</p>

          <p>Spain, we have several questions. Carlos Peixoto from BPI asks about the impact of the increase in the guarantee fund in 14 basis points.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Britta Schmidt from Autonomous asks about whether we expect any deleverage in lending in Spain or do we continue to think that the loan book in Spain will be around &#x20AC;210 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Marzello Zanardo from Bernstein would like more information on our outlook for earnings in Spain, mainly in the net interest income and provisions. What are provisions going to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the impact of the new requirements with respect to contribution to the deposit guaranteed fund in Spain in 2012, it'll be in incremental terms, about &#x20AC;130 million. That's before tax. So that will be the additional impact of the new requirements regarding the FGD, the Deposit Guarantee Fund in Spain.</p>
          <p>And then the question about whether there's going to be deleveraging in Spain in 2012 in terms of the growth of our loan book. Well, our estimate for growth in Spain, as our research department has recently published for 2012, is that it should be a drop of GDP of 1.3%. That's what we are expecting for the general domestic product. And there, we think our loan book will behave better, will outperform that of our peers. But there should be a slight reduction maybe between 2%, 3% down here in Spain.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of our net interest income and how we expect that margin to perform in 2012 here in Spain, basically what we've got at the moment in our estimates is as follows. We will see an improvement in the cost of deposits of customer funds, an improvement in the wholesale funding. And at the beginning of the year, everything would seem to indicate that that is very likely. And with re-pricing on the loan book which we've been seeing from 2010, so the front book is beginning to contribute more as time goes by, means that even in this context, we should see a progressive improvement in the net interest income we get during 2012.</p>
          <p>And in general, we think things will improve over the year if, of course, all these assumptions turn out to be correct. But they seem quite likely at the moment. As to provisioning with the current regulations without taking into account the new regulations that the government will be passing, at the moment, we want to maintain the provisions as they stand in 2012 in Spain. Although, there will be more of a bias towards the real estate business where we have the highest level of provisioning anyway. And wholesale funding costs, Manolo?</p>

          <p>As we see them will be another driver, which will be positive for our net interest Income in the Europe area because we think that will evolve positively. But we'll see what happens over the next few quarters. It probably will be positive though.</p>

          <p>Spain, Axel Finsterbusch from JPMorgan asks about the impact of the cutback in the dividend to be paid out by Telef&#xF3;nica and now we're expecting further cutbacks in 2012, 2013.</p>

          <p>Juan Tuesta from Banesto asks about the expected performance of the commercial gap in Spain in 2012 both on the lending side and the customer fund side. What we'd really call the liquidity gap, isn't it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then F&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Teschner from Natixis asks about what idea we have for 2012, 2013 regarding MBAs in the light of the new regulations that the Bank of Spain will be bringing out. What kind of performance will we expect to see in non-performing assets over 2012 and 2013 after the expected additional provisioning requirements that the Bank of Spain might bring out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The announcements of reducing the Telef&#xF3;nica dividend and the fact that part of it is going to be paid in scrip under the hypothesis that we only bear in mind that dividend that's going to be paid in scrip, this will have a negative impact of approximately &#x20AC;130 million. So we're talking about a cash yield of approximately 8% and a total yield, if we include the scrip, of approximately 11%. So this is still an attractive yield.</p>
          <p>With regard to what's going to happen in 2013 and 2014, quite honestly, we can't say anything because we have no more information than the market has. I think Telef&#xF3;nica explained this in detail. The hypothesis with regard to the credit gap for 2012, as I said before, we're expecting a fall in lending of between 1% and 3% approximately. And a growth in customer funds, one digit growth and 3%, 5% which for another year and this is a process that we've been carrying out since 2010, a very important process, which will enable us to reduce the liquidity gap in Spain in 2012 significantly.</p>
          <p>And your question of why we maintained NPA ratio stable since 2009, maybe this is because the worst part of this in outstanding left in NPA was among developers. It's also true that we've forgotten that in SMEs, we also anticipated part of the NPA in 2009. But the main focus of this was in the real estate world.</p>
          <p>So what we're looking at the predictable NPAs for the next 18 months or three or four quarters. So the reason for the stability was the fact that we anticipated it and this has enabled us to maintain the stability over the last few years. The increase in real estate, the foreclosed assets in the balance sheet in 2012 is very difficult to predict exactly what the figure is going to be. But I think the net effect of additions and sales will be positive. But it's very difficult to give you exact information on this. But the combination between NPA and foreclosed assets, I think, all together is going to be stable for 2012.</p>
          <p>And with regard to the impact the regulation will have on NPAs in 2012 and 2013, I think we're going to seek to increase the coverage rather than adding new NPAs. So I think what we're going to see under the new regulation is the improvement in coverage ratio for foreclosed assets and NPAs and also substandard balances. And I think that's what we're going to see over the next few days.</p>

          <p>Alexander Pelteshki from ING Bank asks quarter-on-quarter, the fourth quarter 2011 with regard to the third, we've seen a fall in customer funds which goes against our forecast of growing deposits to reduce our commercial gap. So how can you explain this and what's the outlook going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Benjie Creelan from Macquarie is asking for information. It's practically the same question. What explains the fall in the customer deposits quarter-on-quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the question is focused on the balance sheet in Spain. And basically if you look at it, the drop we have in deposits and then you have a breakdown in the documents we've been given about the composition of that, but it's associated to temporary assignment of assets. And there, you can see that there's going to be less there in our markets area.</p>
          <p>If you look at the deposits, the current and the term deposits, and then we also have the promissory notes in the network which come at a booked to negotiable instruments which is, I think, going to go very much hand in hand with the performance of deposits, we see an increase in the most recurrent customer funds, which is significant increase in Spain. So this gap on the balance sheet that we were talking about in the presentation of our business in Spain has improved by &#x20AC;4 billion over the last quarter.</p>

          <p>And regarding dividend, Carlo Tomaselli asks what plan we have for the dividend per share for 2012? Are we considering a possible reduction of the cash dividend and to payout in scrip?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As the COO has already said and I think Tom&#xE1;s has also mentioned this, we are considering the same dividend policy as we had in 2012, i.e., a total dividend of &#x20AC;0.42 per share with two dividends in scrip or the option the investors can make their choice. They can have it in cash or in scrip. And to cash dividends, i.e. there is no change in policy here.</p>
          <p>I think it's important to consider the sustainability of this dividend in 2012. If we have a fully diluted profit return on shares of &#x20AC;0.85 per share, we're paying &#x20AC;0.42 per share and approximately half the dividend is being paid in cash. And I think it's an important point to bear in mind when we're weighing up to what extent this dividend policy is sustainable for 2012.</p>
          <p>Three further questions in two different blocks.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Capital, Juan Tuesta from Banesto has asked whether we should consider in 2012 any kind of operation to reinforce our capital by putting one of our subsidiaries on the market or floating them or selling shares.</p>

          <p>Carlos Peixoto from BPI asked whether the 8.7% core Tier 1 ratio under the EBA recommendations includes the sovereign buffer. Is this included in the 8.7%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:16:19) from BNP Paribas asks about how willing we would be with our balance, whether we could increase the real estate provisions over and above what's required, bearing in mind the earnings we've reported in the last few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the capital requirements for 2012, if we're going to put out any subsidiaries on to the market or float them, I said in the presentation several times that those strategic assets that we have in our business portfolio that are going to be generating growth for our future business aren't going to be sold to shore up capital ratios. And that's the fact of the matter. I can confirm that we are not going to sell off strategic assets to shore up capital ratios or to reach that 9% level.</p>
          <p>And then you asked about the sovereign buffer, is that included in the 8.7%? Yes. And are we going to increase the provisions over and above the requirements of the new regulations? Well, we think that the new regulations will put up the coverage to high levels, and with what we've already got, we don't feel that in net terms, if we look at all the sales we've had over this period with all the provisions, we haven't had losses. So to go further and to further provision over and above the regulations at any way are going to put up the provision levels with the net position we have where we don't have any losses to book, it wouldn't make sense. So of course, we'll comply with the new regulations. Our balance sheet is further strengthened with this kind of coverage, but we are not expecting any further losses because of our sales process that we have.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding the consolidation of the financial system here in Spain. there's also a question about are we expecting any public capital to be put into the Cajas savings banks to solve their problems.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlo Tomaselli from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale asks, well, this morning the Spanish press reported potential support from the state to the financial sector. Do we think that this kind of financial support would be giving 8% loans to the Cajas? Can you go back to what you were asking before that the exposure to sovereign risk? There is an update to the 31st of December and then public capital being put into the Cajas and if that might trigger restructuring of the entire system?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we're seeing in the media, I think we're going to find out a lot more over the next couple of days when the new regulations are published which we think will include comments on this particular aspect. And so, we will finally see what the final decision is with regard to holdings in capital for restructured banks. So it would appear that there will be holdings before these are auctioned off. But this is something we'll have to wait for the details to come out in the next few days. And I think for all the rest of these questions, I can handover to my CFO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There hasn't been any major change to our exposure to sovereign debt in this quarter with regard to the &#x2013; in debt certificates we have &#x20AC;32 billion at the close of the year, &#x20AC;26 billion of this is Spain. And on top of that, we also have the loan book which hasn't changed very much either in comparison to what we'd already told you about. So there are no significant changes to our exposure to sovereign debt.</p>
          <p>There's one question I didn't answer. It would appear that at 5:30 this afternoon, there's going to be a press conference to explain in detail the details of the new regulations and the process of the public sector taking part or not in the banks. So it's not going to be in the coming days but in the coming hours we will have this information. So as soon as we can, what we would do, we will pass on the impact that this will have on the BBVA.</p>
          <p>As for the question as to whether it could galvanize, whether this is done through loans, whether this is going to trigger a restructuring of the financial industry, these banks that have been restructured, if they're in a vulnerable situation, with all the uncertainty, obviously, the financial sector can get back to business as usual and kick start the economy again quickly once this is completed. As to the financial interest, we hope that this is done quickly, properly and in-depth because the economy of a large country like Spain cannot recover in a sustained and sound manner if it doesn't have a financial system that is sound, solvent, and with the strength to channel lending in the country.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the final question concerns Mexico, comes from Ignacio Cerezo from Credit Suisse. Can you give us an outlook of Mexico in 2012 with regard to margins, costs and provisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very quickly, let us try to answer that question. As you know, the performance of the Mexican economy is being very positive. In fact, our specialists in the research department estimate growth in Mexico next year easily above 3%. And we are looking at all the data and yesterday, we got some more data regarding transfers made from the U.S. to Mexico over $20 billion and that's a record figure.</p>
          <p>And we're also seeing an improvement in the American economy. Slowly but surely it's improving and that's beneficial for Mexico where domestic demand is also very buoyant. So in this context, we think that the upward growth we saw in 2011 will continue throughout 2012 and that will have its impact on the retail loan book where we get the highest margin in cards, SMEs and businesses with slightly less growth in loans to big corporate customers and government institutions which might be a bit lower. But all in all, we're talking about double-digit growth in our loan book there.</p>
          <p>We're not expecting significant changes in MBAs in Mexico in 2012. We do think there will be sound growth in deposits as we've seen in 2011, which was a very good year for deposits. And in Mexico, customer funds make a significant contribution to income and we've had low double-digit growth there.</p>
          <p>So we think that our income statement will continue to grow ever faster. Revenues will be going up. Costs will be slightly above inflation because of the growth plans that we have as we opened new branches and employ new staff. And also associated to the segmentation of our network in Mexico, which is a very important plan for us to bring in further growth. And we think then that we'll have a moderate year-on-year growth, but it would definitely be very sound, robust growth.</p>
          <p>And then in 2013, we'll see that expenses will be growing significantly less than 2012, and the growth will have already gathered speed. So that's best outlook for now with the estimates that we currently have to hand. Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Having answered that final question, I'd just like to thank you for coming to this webcast. And if you have got any questions that you feel haven't been answered, they will be covered by the Investor Relations department during the rest of the day.</p>
