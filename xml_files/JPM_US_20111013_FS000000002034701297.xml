          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be placed on mute for the duration of the call.</p>
          <p>We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Doug Braunstein. Mr. Braunstein, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, operator. It's Doug. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation. As you know, it's available on our website. We'll take questions after walking through the presentation. And then remember to refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements in the back of the presentation.</p>
          <p>With that, if you turn to page one, for the quarter we generated $4.3 billion in net income, $1.02 a share, on revenues of $24.4 billion. There are a number of significant items for the quarter which we're highlighting upfront. I want to discuss each of those in more detail actually when we get to the businesses in the presentation.</p>
          <p>At the bottom of the page, you'll see we ended the quarter Basel I and Basel III ratios of 9.9% and 7.7% respectively. And that's after the impact of repurchasing $4.4 billion of JPM shares and warrants in the quarter, and that completes our previously approved repurchase authority of $8 billion.</p>
          <p>It's worth noting a number of items this quarter. For credit, you see our loan loss coverage ratio of 3.74% on total loans. Firm-wide reserves remained essentially unchanged quarter on quarter. From a loan growth standpoint, we saw loans grow across the company $7 billion, and that's despite the runoff we see in our home lending portfolio. We had meaningful year-to-date growth year over year in our small business originations, up 71%; market balances up 18%; trade finance up 70% year over year; just some examples of some of the strength in various categories.</p>
          <p>We also experienced significant deposit growth, $44 billion quarter on quarter; total deposits up $1.1 billion; and deposit growth year over year up 21%.</p>
          <p>Finally, return on tangible common equity is the circled number on the next page of 13%.</p>
          <p>And with that, I ask you to turn to page three and the Investment Bank. Results here were clearly impacted by the challenging market this quarter. We have circled net income of $1.6 billion. That's on revenues of $6.4 billion. IB fees in the quarter of $1 billion, down 31% year over year, largely driven by the challenging capital markets environment. On an absolute basis, it was our weakest IB fee quarter since the third quarter of 2005. But having said that, we did maintain our number one market share in terms of fees; and we also had very positive league table results, which you can see in the appendix on page 21.</p>
          <p>Markets and CPG results, as you know from the upfront highlight, include $1.9 billion in DVA, and that largely resulted from the firm's credit spreads widening this quarter. They actually more than doubled in the quarter. Now if these spreads reverse themselves, we would ultimately book losses. Neither the gains nor the losses relate to the underlying operations of the company. So if you remove $900 million in DVA that's associated with structured notes, fixed income revenue would be $2.8 billion, down 34% quarter on quarter. That largely reflects lower results in our credit related products. And that was offset by solid results in our rates and our currency businesses.</p>
          <p>Equities revenue of $1 billion, down 9% quarter on quarter; that's driven largely by the volatility I talked about, lower volumes, and the continued deleveraging of our prime service customers.</p>
          <p>$578 million you see in the credit portfolio; remember, three parts here; NII and fees for retained loans. We had a $1 billion DVA gain in the credit portfolio. And that was largely offset by a $700 million CVA loss after hedging. And that's again as credit spreads widen for our counterparties, CVA increases as well.</p>
          <p>Expenses in the quarter of $3.8 billion; that's down 12% quarter on quarter, up 3% year on year. And you see the comp to revenue ratio of 29%. We continue to expect to remain full year in the range of 35% to 40% comp to revenue ratio.</p>
          <p>And before I talk about 4Q, I just want to step back. So if you &#x2013; and everyone will adjust differently. If you adjusted out the complete impact of DVA, net income in the quarter would be about $500 million. For those that adjust DVA and CVA, net income in the quarter would have been $900 million. And others are going to make different adjustments as you go through your analysis.</p>
          <p>The final comment I'd make on the fourth quarter for the IB is given current markets, it's not unreasonable to expect that the fourth quarter is going to look very similar to the third quarter.</p>
          <p>With that, if we turn to page four, just a quick note here; this is consolidated RFS, circled net income of $1.2 billion on $7.5 billion worth of revenues, and I want to dive into each of the businesses.</p>
          <p>So if you turn to page five, our Consumer and Business Banking business, that's the retail branch and business banking business. It recorded $1 billion in net income. That's up 22% year on year. Revenues are up 6% year on year. And if you want to focus on the highlights, deposit growth up 7%; business banking loan growth up 28% year on year. Actually, the pipeline there remains very solid. And all of that in revenues was offset by lower deposit spreads we saw year on year. Expenses in the quarter up 2% year on year, and that really is the continuing investment spend. We opened 60 branches, 123 Chase Private Client branches this quarter, and we're going to continue that investment.</p>
          <p>And then the final comment is the impact of Durbin, which as you know took effect October 1. We continue to expect revenues on an annualized basis from Durbin to be $1 billion plus or minus. We expect $300 million in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter run rate. And that's an elevated amount due to the timing of when we ended some of our debit reward programs.</p>
          <p>Page six, Mortgage Production and Servicing, you see net income of $200 million. That compares to $25 million the prior year. Production revenues, we've broken out production and servicing. So if you go to the top production revenues excluding repurchases were $1.3 billion. It's down year over year but up quarter on quarter largely on the back of $37 billion of originations and improved margins sequentially.</p>
          <p>Repurchase losses in the quarter, you see $314 million. That was below our expected run rate, but we do expect losses to remain at $350 million plus or minus a quarter. But they are going to vary due to timing differences around settlements and the like.</p>
          <p>Servicing revenue of $1.2 billion, down 10% year over year, and that's being driven by the decline in third-party loans serviced. And that has been partially offset by reduced amortization year on year, and that reflects the revaluation of the MSR asset we took in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Servicing expense, $866 million this quarter, up almost $300 million year on year; approximately two-thirds of that expense is default related. And we expect that number to continue to remain elevated, likely to be up actually slightly in the next several quarters.</p>
          <p>Page seven, the real estate portfolios, a loss of 70 million on lower revenues of $1.2 billion; that is a function of the decline in NII, and that's a function of our portfolio runoff. We talked about that, $27 billion loan declines year over year, $6 billion quarter on quarter. The expenses are also down 7% year on year, and you'll see the note. That's due to a temporary delay in foreclosure activity. We do expect FAE [Foreclosed Asset Expense] expense to increase $20 million to $30 million per quarter as that activity resumes.</p>
          <p>Page eight, the Mortgage Banking portfolio is just a little deeper dive on credit. You see circled net charge-offs for the quarter of $900 million, and that's a modest decline versus the prior quarter. But delinquency trends really flattened at the end of the third quarter. We've got, as you know, the additional detail on delinquencies on page 19 in the appendix.</p>
          <p>And given that flattening and the ongoing uncertainty in the environment relative to HPI and other items, you'll see we made no changes in our allowances either for our non-credit impaired portfolio, which remains at $9.7 billion, or our PCI. You'll also see our guidance remains unchanged at $1.2 billion plus or minus. But it's fair to say that if the current environment remains stable, those losses could clearly be modestly better next quarter.</p>
          <p>And then just a quick update on sensitivity for the portfolio; so if you had a 10% decline in housing prices from today, for the NCI portfolio that would imply a modeled loss of $700 million over the next year. For PCI, given that's a life of loan, it could add $1.5 billion to existing reserves. And you should know that the current mark on that portfolio already assumes a 4% decline, so that would be an additional 6% decline beyond that. Obviously given where current conditions are, we feel our reserve levels are appropriate.</p>
          <p>Page nine, Card Services and Auto, this now reflects the combination of auto and student lending that we transferred from RFS, and you'll see in the supplement the restatement of all of that information. Circled net income of $850 million, that's on revenues of $4.8 billion. Credit costs in the quarter were again the story, $1.3 billion. That included a $500 million reserve release in Card. That was offset by a $130 million build in student lending. At the end of the quarter, total allowances for Card are $7.5 billion.</p>
          <p>So if you focus in on the Card Services number and you look at Chase portfolio drivers of performance, I'd start with credit. You see the circled number at the bottom of the page, a 4.34% charge-off rate in the Chase portfolio. That's an improvement of almost 100 basis points over the last quarter. We also think net charge-offs could modestly improve again next quarter from the current quarter. But after that, you shouldn't expect much additional improvement.</p>
          <p>Sales volume you see is up 10% in the portfolio year over year, 2% quarter on quarter. Outstandings, while they declined 6% year over year, actually leveled off quarter on quarter, and that's a positive trend. But I will caution that payment rates for the portfolio still remain very high. And if you add all that up on Card, pre-tax pre-reserve is up almost $1 billion year over year, $700 million for this quarter, and that includes significant growth in our marketing expenses that you see running through the expense line this quarter.</p>
          <p>Auto, the performance of auto again was solid this quarter. We had almost $6 billion of originations. And we do believe we're going to continue to grow and invest and manage this business for what are very attractive returns.</p>
          <p>Page 10, Commercial Bank, circled net income of $570 million; that's on revenues of a little under $1.6 billion. Revenues are up 4% year on year. That's the same story we've been talking about on the Commercial Bank, which is growth in loan balances, growth in liability balances. In fact, $180 billion in liability balances is a record this quarter. And that growth is offset by the spread compression we continue to see in our liability products.</p>
          <p>On the loan balance side, you see $107 billion circled. That's up $5 billion quarter on quarter, $9 billion year on year. It's our fifth consecutive quarter of loan growth. Middle market balances, which I said were up 18%, that's our sixth consecutive quarter of loan growth in the middle market. And that has been a combination we think of modest demand increases as well as market share gains. Just I will note that utilization rates still do remain reasonably constant and low relative to history. Part of that is that those cash balances reflect very healthy balance sheets on the part of those customers.</p>
          <p>Expenses are up slightly this quarter. That reflects the build-out of our WaMu footprint states. Just as a measure of performance, loan balances and liability balances are each at about $2 billion, up almost 100% year on year, respectively. And then you see credit trends continue to be favorable, declining net charge-offs this quarter and declining non-accrual loans.</p>
          <p>Page 11, Treasury and Security Services; you see circled net income of $300 million. That's up 22% year on year but down quarter on quarter. Revenue growth of 4% year on year, that was 7% growth if you exclude the impact of the transfer of the commercial card business to Credit Card we did. And the quarter-on-quarter decrease in revenue is a function of the seasonality we see in our dividend seasons in 2Q and 4Q.</p>
          <p>If you drill into the revenue growth, really it's driven by a number of factors. You see the circled liability balances. Those are up 40% year on year, almost $100 billion. Very solid non-U.S. revenue growth in this business, up 16% year on year; we continue as a function of that growth to build out our GCB [Global Corporate Bank] anchor footprint and our product capabilities. Trade loan balances are up almost 70% year on year to $30 billion. And all of that continues to be offset by the same spread compression I talked about in the Commercial Bank.</p>
          <p>Expenses here are up 4% year on year, and that's driven primarily by non-comp related expenses as well as the expansion I talked about before.</p>
          <p>Asset Management, Page 12; this is a business that was clearly also affected by volatile markets this quarter. You see circled net income of $385 million. That's down 8% year on year, 12% quarter on quarter. Revenues of $2.3 billion, while up 7% year on year, are down 9% quarter on quarter related to those market conditions. And again, this is a business that we expect to see continued pressure on revenue in the fourth quarter if the current market conditions persist.</p>
          <p>Long-term flows here also slowed materially this quarter, and that reduced the benefit of that mix shift we've experienced over the last several quarters. We also continued to see outflows in liquidity products as well this quarter.</p>
          <p>Expenses were up 21% year on year, and that's due to a non-client related litigation matter as well as the continued investments we've talked about before. And you see that impacting our pre-tax margin, reported 21% in the quarter. If you excluded the impact of litigation, margins would be 26% this quarter, but still down quarter on quarter and year on year.</p>
          <p>Page 13, Corporate and Private Equity; these results were also affected by market volatility. Private Equity, you see a loss in the quarter of $350 million. The majority of that is driven by mark-to-market losses in portfolio positions. But we also reduced valuations for companies that were experiencing operating performance weakness, and that contributed to the results as well. Remember, going forward these results are going to continue to be lumpy, and they are also going to continue to be impacted by markets and market levels.</p>
          <p>Corporate, there was a loss of $300 million. It was a function of three things. The challenging trading environment impacted our mark-to-market positions, and that was partially offset by higher security gains. We had lower NII and that's really a result of the repositioning of the portfolio. We've talked about that for a number of quarters, but the security gains we took last quarter lowered NII this quarter. And then we also took $1 billion in litigation expense, predominantly related to mortgage matters, and you see that in Corporate for the quarter.</p>
          <p>The other comment I'd make here is that given the current environment and given our positioning and given reinvestment opportunities, we do expect Corporate excluding Private Equity to basically be zero plus or minus in the fourth quarter. And I think Jamie will talk a little bit about '12 guidance later.</p>
          <p>I think I've covered much of page 14, in fact, all of 14, all of 15; so with that, maybe Jamie, I could turn it over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Doug; hello, everybody. Let me just cover a couple quick things and we'll open it up to questions and comments.</p>
          <p>Page 16 has a page called comments on 2012. I just want to point out to you, as usual, we focus on the negatives and the issues and not the positives. We have great franchises. Doug mentioned some really astounding numbers: small business loans up 71%; middle market loans up 18%; trade finance up 71%; deposits retail up 7%; deposits in the Commercial Bank up something like 30% or 40%. I won't include TSS because some of that may be a little a flight to quality, but up $100 billion, unbelievable liquidity, and so we feel very good about all the things.</p>
          <p>But having said that, just a couple quick comments; Investment Bank, it's hard not to be cautious. I'd say that right now, nobody, nobody knows what's going to happen tomorrow, so I've seen markets like this where things stabilize. Europe does something big and things take off. There are fairly large backlogs, and we pointed that out to you before. Backlogs are very deceptive. But you can't look at these things and not expect maybe this will go a little bit longer.</p>
          <p>We have no major layoff programs. Obviously, the Investment Bank will be trimming its sails a little bit, getting tight. And there are some benefits of getting &#x2013; rolling in some new productive systems, so we expect to see the head count going down, but no major layoff programs.</p>
          <p>Asset Management, obviously depending on market levels, but we continue to build the business and even this quarter had net inflow. We don't know about other people yet, but I think that's probably pretty good.</p>
          <p>Consumer/Business Banking, Doug already mentioned Durbin. This $600 million is the same as the other $1 billion you saw. This is just after-tax. This is the actual revenue effect minus what we've already done, but not including what we might do, so we're looking at products, services, how we want to do it, how are we going to price it, try to be a little creative and smart and do something really neat. So we're just saying that one thing in loan is that there may be other sides to that one.</p>
          <p>And there's a little bit of spread compression given low interest rates that if all things adjusted for now, we just reinvest it at the same duration, et cetera, it would impact net income $400 million. I just want to point out, that's purely up to us. We can do that or not do that. It's really longer term rates that this is the effect of. We can wait or not wait, and so it will probably be our decision.</p>
          <p>Commercial Banking and Treasury and Security Services, their margins are going to be low as long as rates stay low, so they're positioned to benefit from raising rates if and when that happens. Quarterly net income, Doug already mentioned as Private Equity, if things stay like this, you shouldn't expect any profit this quarter. So just to point out, we really haven't spoken of this before. Part of Private Equity is marked to market. Part of it is marked to model, which means marked to PEs and stuff, so you can think of it as several billion dollars are in effect marked to market pretty much.</p>
          <p>And then, obviously, in Corporate, also these are firm decisions. Depending on how long we go in duration, depending on how much risk we take, depending on what happens to the rest of the balance sheet, we will decide when and how to use some of our firepower to create more income. We're just talking about the negative part right now.</p>
          <p>Reserve release, I think it has been pointed out by several people already that we didn't take reserves down. We're fighting not to take them down. We may not be able not to take them down because, obviously, we operate under a bunch of accounting rules. Our preferred election right now is with delinquencies flattening out, there are some good signs. There are some bad signs. It's all over the place. We'd rather leave them up until we have to take them down. So don't read anything into that other than we're just trying to be conservative here.</p>
          <p>We are going to spend a lot of time really in the next six or nine months dealing with our budgets and dealing with regulatory issues. So what we want to do is build in at the product level, the legal level, liquidity, capital, G-SIFI, whatever we have to deal with so we can properly price and manage our businesses going forward. I do think we'll have effects on a whole bunch of areas. And we haven't calculated it yet now. But if I have to guess, it's going to add $0.5 billion to overhead over time as we put all these systems and reporting in. I want to point out that I think some of that is a waste of money, but that's life. I guess we have to do it.</p>
          <p>And the last point on Other, I gave one issue on business issues about branch build. I think we have already built about 250 branches this year. We indicated we might do more. It's possible we won't now. We're going to be looking at a lot of business issues. Take branches for example. With NSF/OD changing, with Durbin changing, with FDIC charges changing, some branches at the margin are no longer great, so we will probably reduce a little bit the branch build strategy. We still need to build branches in certain cities in particularly California and Florida to build out our footprint, but we will modify that and we'll report back to you when we have that. But I would say the same thing about lots of products and services and issues. We're going to be taking a look at them. I'm not expecting anything dramatic, but obviously there are a lot of issues there. We're making so many changes all at once.</p>
          <p>On capital generation, dividend, obviously a Board decision; we'll probably take it up at the turn of the year. I'd like to just see us do it steady every year but not much more than that. We're going to continue to invest in organic growth. But there are a lot of issues, and a lot of analysts have raised which ones might you rethink. We'll get back to you on that. So there are areas that we know we're going to finish building out. One of the areas maybe we're going to look at, how aggressive, what the price will be, and whether it still makes as much sense as before. But organic growth is an important thing that you can't stop/start; i.e., hiring private bankers, training people, building systems, so we're still going to be doing some of that.</p>
          <p>And the last box which is boxed there, which says meeting regulatory requirements and stock buyback, we still will have enormous capital generation, but we are trying to figure out &#x2013; I call it capital confusion. It's hard to tell what we're supposed to do and how we're supposed to do it. We'll be figuring it out, having conversations with regulators. At one point, the capital generation will be used clearly to do what makes sense for shareholders. The question is how quickly do we want to get to where we need to be. And there are other things like there are new rules coming, risk-weighted asset models, models versus European companies.</p>
          <p>Some mitigation will take place. We'll write it up. Some we can do more actively, but it would cost a little bit of money. Why do it quickly if it would cost you money? So we're going to be talking more about this as we go forward. And obviously, if you want to make the point, we spent a whole $8 billion buying back stock. And yes, it would have been wiser to wait. We're sorry.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will open the floor to questions or comments. I'm sorry, Page 17.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Page 17, we tried to make this simple, but Cramer, if you're on, Jim, I gather we didn't do a great job at it. So I'm going to take you through the top.</p>
          <p>AFS securities, these are held by treasury or by CIO, often to offset deposits or other things we need to do with asset/liability management. That $3.7 billion if you marked it would be about $3.4 billion. It's mostly sovereign exposure into five countries, mostly obviously Italy and Spain.</p>
          <p>And let me go back to potential losses a second. Trading, $8.7 billion; it includes $14 billion of gross long derivative with offsets on the other side. We've got collateral which is mostly cash, $6.7 billion against that. Sovereigns do not post collateral, so a lot of the remaining exposure is sovereign exposure. So think of it as 65% to sovereigns.</p>
          <p>Lending, the $7.9 billion is almost all corporate or bank. It's 75% corporate and probably about &#x2013; or a little more than &#x2013; maybe 80% corporate and 20% bank. Some of those banks, by the way, are very good banks, so we're not that worried about it.</p>
          <p>So if we actually look &#x2013; and a lot of this plays in the corporates is large global multinationals. And these numbers obviously bounce around. The derivative values change and mark-to-markets change and collateral changes, but the $15 billion is what we've been managing to kind of. And in my &#x2013; if you said if everything goes terribly and these countries default and the loss given default is 10%, 20%, 30%, that's where we came up with $3 billion after tax, which is $5 billion pre-tax. So you can do it yourself and go across the top. How much would you lose in a government security if they defaulted and got restructured? And by the way, there are other offsets and other positives not exactly on this page, and we can manage these exposures.</p>
          <p>So the reason we're doing this is because we do business with these countries. And again, you know I mentioned capital confusion, I'll mention banking confusion. Do we &#x2013; obviously, we've been doing business with these countries for 100 years. A lot of these clients, you can't say you're going to be your bank one day, and the second things get tough go away the next day. So we think we're earning some points. We're helping some companies. We're helping a few of the banks. And we hope the countries appreciate it. And so we've decided to take this risk. Obviously, we can try to &#x2013; we change that in a pretty quick way if we wanted to, and we still think it's the right thing to do. I don't expect the worst case in terms of our charge-offs in any event.</p>
          <p>So I will stop there and open the floor to &#x2013; we'll open the floor to questions and comments for Doug or myself.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jamie, I was hoping you can just flesh out some of the buyback and capital commentary you made. You mentioned confusion. You obviously exhausted the buyback that you set for this year. Is there ability for you to do more, or now are you going to wait and wait until early next year, or do you have to wait beyond that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the way the Fed has set it up is that you can request as we go through our budget and start to decide what to do, but we used what we already had permission for. And like I said, we have a lot of capital generation. The only question is when and how you use it and how quickly you want to get up to the higher Basel III numbers and do you want to get up there just by retaining capital and waiting for mitigation and things like that. So we'll get back to you on that. There are a lot of issues around that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess on last quarter's earnings call, it seemed like you were going to ease &#x2013; leg right into these new capital requirements and continue with the buyback, and now it seems like a change in tone. I'm just curious if there was anything in particular driving that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that you are picking up a real change in tone. I think the fact is we don't know what the rest of the world is going to do. It's a little confusing about it. And I think the regulators need to give, not just JPMorgan but the banking industry, a little bit more guidance. Do they really mean you can leg into this over seven years, or do they really mean they want you to do it right away? We can probably do it very quickly if we wanted to. I'm not sure it's the right thing to insist on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just turning to Volcker, we got some more guidance late last week and this week. I guess your initial interpretation of what they put out, the overall impact either in dollars or direction in terms of your businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so let me give you the most important thing. The United States has the best, deepest, widest, and the most transparent capital markets in the world, which give you, the investor, the ability to buy and sell large amounts at very cheap prices. That's a good thing. I wish Paul Volcker understood that. Now we understand why Volcker banned proprietary trading, and that was fine. I haven't read them all yet, like 178 rules or 48 in compliance around what's proper market making. We have to be in a position to do proper market making for our clients. Most of our business is market making.</p>
          <p>And so there's going be commentary. I think the commentary is going to come from the public, which includes you. I hope all of you on the call understand how important this is not just for your own business, but for the future of the United States. And we hope at the end of the day we'll be able to make markets freely. If American companies are put at a huge disadvantage, the foreign companies &#x2013; we were told everyone was going to adopt this, which we know is not true, then that would be an even bigger deal. So to me, we've got to keep all these things in mind and make sure it ends up in the right place. And we'll be giving our comments to regulators and I assume a lot of you will too at one point.</p>

          <p>Any chance to put a stab in terms of dollars or range in terms of what the impact would be go forward if you implemented it today?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's impossible to tell because these are just comments and rules and requirements. And it cuts across all of our parts of our company, so they seem to be more proscriptive. I would have preferred to keep it simple. High capital, high &#x2013; remember, they already doubled and tripled capital and liquidity on trading. And proper reporting and disclosure, but this is a little bit more proscriptive. It may make it a little bit harder. Let's let it work through the process before we have too many comments about it.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. So Jamie, on your commentary around the Euro-5 is helpful. But lately, whether it be valid or not, there have been some massive concerns around some of the other parts of the continent. What's the key message that we should come away with? A), your exposure to some of the other big areas such as France was a level of concern for people. And then more importantly, how do we move forward here? What needs to happen in your view to gain confidence back that the banks there have enough capital that we're not in a never-ending spiral here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so when you talk about the big European countries, obviously, the exposure to France, Germany, and the UK are bigger than the ones we have in the ones in Italy and Spain. Large parts of those are also large corporates, so keep that in mind. Plus the sovereign credits are fine; that's a whole different issue. The real issue you're talking about is how we separate to go to the banks &#x2013; obviously, we do business with banks and the larger global market counterparties, which we track and monitor very carefully those exposures. Most of our exposures, not all, but most of our exposures to global market counterparties are collateralized, sometimes with the bucket. And sometimes we have other tertiary exposures, something like that.</p>
          <p>So a couple of them are rather large. But not one of them would make me lose my &#x2013; because of a derivative related would we lose sleep. Most of them are well &#x2013; most of them are in the couple hundred million dollars net-net-net. Remember, those bounce around. Derivative exposures bounce around. We also think most of those banks are actually quite sound. They have capital. They've got liquidity. We think they'll get some kind of, if they need it, some kind of support. And what's needed in Europe, or are you talking about the United States?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Greece eventually has to be ring fenced and restructured. But you don't want to do that disorderly so you don't cause a problem elsewhere. Eventually, you got to by using ECB [European Central Bank] and ESFS [European System of Financial Supervisors] and statements that Italy and Spain are solvent. They just need a little liquidity help, which by the way is true.</p>
          <p>We believe they're quite solvent. And if they have their own central bank and they could print euros, we wouldn't be having this conversation at all. As you know, they can't print euros, so they have &#x2013; and they have central banks but they can't print in the euro currency. So in effect, ECB or someone else has to stand in as the central bank to provide liquidity. I think to do that, you want other countries, France and Germany, to be very comfortable about &#x2013; I guess the final point is that some kind of restructuring of the treaty so people feel that they're not continuing &#x2013; that no one is continuing to take advantage of a system that is flawed. I think it's all reasonable.</p>
          <p>And finally, I think some kind of national programs for TARP to support banks that need help, that's kind of belt and suspenders if you do other stuff. But you obviously might see that too. If you do all those things, this crisis would be over. It's complex. You've got 17 nations involved in it.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, understood; and then maybe, Doug, one for you, a more technical one. On page 42 of the supplement, we've seen a big jump up this quarter in some of the repurchase demand buckets by certain vintages in 2005. And what was surprising was even the post-2008 stuff. And I guess my question there is, is that the same GSE monoline stuff that we've seen, or is a new player in town with the FHA? Any color around that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the same that we've seen. But remember, Glenn, it's just going to be lumpy, and that's in part what you're seeing. But you did see both demand as well as unresolved demands go up quarter on quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is the FHA going with the GSE playbook, and do they have the same rep and warranty?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The FHA issue is a different issue. And that really relates only to our Chase activity because that was really the only &#x2013; Chase was the only real counterparty with FHA on that. And that issue is one we're going to continue to watch. We don't think we have issues there. But you don't see that reflected in these numbers here.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thanks, okay. Sorry about that, I apologize. So my question has to do with your Trust Preferred Securities. I think you have nearly $20 billion of callable TruPS, and just wondered what your thoughts are about calling them and the timing of calling them.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there are a number of those that would make economic sense for us to call. They are callable as a function of a regulatory event, and we would expect to see that regulatory event clarified. And to the extent that it makes economic sense for us to do so, we'd then call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the ones that make economic sense for us. There are some that are very attractive financing over the long run for those that make sense for us to call. Because they're not attractive, we expect to have the ability to do so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi; Doug, a question on the net interest income and spread compression. Could you remind us of that repositioning you've been doing that you talked about in last several quarters in the investment portfolio; and just at the top of the house, your outlook for net interest income and maybe the margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so on margin, and we saw it again this quarter, there are three factors hitting NIM. You've got the increase in deposits and a lot of that is being kept short term, and so that lowers NIM but it does increase NII. You've got a switch in our loan portfolio. We've got more corporate client loans, and that changes the mix and as a result the yield. And then the third and the most important is this repositioning. And that's &#x2013; we have taken security gains. That lowers our NII on a go-forward basis and that has really repositioned ourselves, as Jamie talked about, for reinvestment when and if there's a rising rate environment. In the interim, those reinvestment opportunities are short term and low yielding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What about any offsets on the cost of funding side in terms of lowering your deposit rates, your CDs, paying off longer-term debt; is that embedded into your outlook? And just a reminder, when you net all of that together, how are you thinking about NII the next couple quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, you will have offsets that you've seen from that. Let's start with how we're thinking about NIM. We continue to expect those things I just talked about to continue to play through, so you'll see more pressure on NIM. NII is in part a function of what balances do, what loan growth does. And generally speaking, there are some pieces of the portfolio that we've told you all along continue to run off. And so it's a function of what happens next to NII.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then a follow-up on Glenn's question on the mortgage put-backs. It seems like you slightly tweaked your outlook to maybe $350 million per quarter from $300 million on the put-backs. Just a broader &#x2013; are you seeing a change in behavior from the GSEs in terms of their requests where they're increasingly looking to put back loans they've been paying for one, two, or three years and then go bad? Is there a noticeable change in their behavior there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we really changed the forecast. It's about $300 million, $350 million. There hasn't been a huge change in how they're doing it. But obviously we're paying attention just like you are, a little bit. We've modeled into our numbers some of these factors anyway. So you've really got to look at the difference in what we modeled in. We still have $3.6 billion in reserves. At one point, those reserves end up being excess and we'll have to start taking those down too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of the WaMu GSE exposure, do you feel like you're substantially done or covered in terms of put-backs for WaMu GSE claims?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, last thing on the AG settlement talks. I understand this isn't done. But have you been taking reserves for the potential financial penalties that might come out of that? And then on the other side in terms of changes to servicing, have you been trying to get ahead of that in terms of adding costs to your servicing base and reflecting that in the valuation of the MSR, even though that's not done on the AG side yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me give you a broad spin. First of all, we would love to have some kind of settlement. We think it's actually good for everybody to get some of that and move on if it's reasonable. But there are 50 state AGs. It looks like it's getting bogged down, so we'll see. We're here. We're available. I'd like to work it out. Last quarter we did take higher servicing costs in the MSR. So go back to last quarter's numbers; we talked about it. We're willing to a consent order and some of the default loss. And what was the other question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in terms of financial penalty, you're building a lot of litigation reserves. We're just wondering. What are the &#x2013; are you getting some of that in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last quarter we put $1 billion for a bunch of various items relating to a bunch of various items which we didn't disclose separate from the litigation reserves.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Good morning; just, Doug, an administrative question in terms of the CVA. When you're referencing the spreads that have doubled or slightly more than doubled over the quarter, is it correct to say that those are five-year CDS spreads?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait; not really. DVA and CVA are done by trade, so some are one-year, two-year, five-year, ten-year, so they're all different. You may be using averages of &#x2013; it's whatever the maturity of the derivative is, the loan or whatever.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then, Jamie, you made a comment about branch growth. And looking at the branch numbers in RFS, it looks like those are up about 128 year to date. You've talked about maybe not quite getting to the 225 number that you laid out in the Investor Day earlier this year. Is that really being driven not only by just the reduced fees that you mentioned but also a somewhat more cautious view of the retail banking environment? And does that mean that you might reduce your overall branch growth going into 2012 and 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what I was referring to because, obviously, we can't stop the fourth quarter. But if you look at the business and you say okay, Durbin, NSF, that certain accounts no longer are profitable, you might modify where you build branches, how you build branches. We're still going to build them in certain parts of the country because there's a lot of value in having market share in certain parts of the country. But going forward, we're going to modify that branch build once we've got a chance to look at the effect of all those things on new branch profitability.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Doug, a final question. You mentioned the payment rates on the Card business is up. It looks like at least from the Trust data that that's up about 200 basis points year over year in September. Are you expecting continued increases of that type in terms of the payment rates going forward, or just what's your expectation for payment rates going forward in the Card portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect it to go up. We think you've seen some &#x2013; some of it we added mix. If you look at the other people that added, it will go up a little bit too. We don't expect it to go up from here. Then again, you've got to do it by product. For some product, it's 90%. For some product it's quite a bit less.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. One of the questions that investors have been asking a lot is with respect to the sovereign or European exposures. How can we get comfortable with the management of counterparty risk when a big part of the reduction in risk that you've got is by having essentially purchased protection from other parties, especially in light of what happened during the subprime crisis to a lot of people? So maybe you can refresh us a little bit on how you manage your counterparty risk in terms of diversification, developing information, more information on the creditworthiness of your counterparties. And maybe you can also tie that into the CVA charge that you had this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So related to the five nations, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, the 6.7 &#x2013; whatever the counterparty risk is, that is financial institutions for the most part out &#x2013; not in those five countries, so it is other counterparts. And we do it name by name and person by person. Yes, it's diversified, and it's already in the numbers I gave you about the other banks. So if we said that we have about $100 million net exposure to X bank in Germany, it would include that as a counterparty exposure, and for the most part collateralized. So we feel pretty good about that. But obviously, in a financial crisis, these things could filter down, so you've got to look at your primary risk, your secondary and tertiary and all that. But it's done name by name, day by day. And the CVA is just a mark-to-market on the receivable.</p>
          <p>So if we did a CDS with someone and they owed us $50 million, they're supposed to post collateral the next day. When we take the $50 million receivable, we mark it. If the spreads go up to $55 million or something like that and you get more collateral, but it's every day. And a lot of the counterparts are names you know. They are global market counterparties. Some, obviously, reside in France and Germany, but plenty don't. And I said, reside in France and Germany, they're already in the exposures of those banks we're getting pretty much marking-to-market collateral every day. We do have some exposure with those banks that aren't that way. But that particular thing, we do have mark-to-market every day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you give us a sense for how much of that CVA this quarter came from European issues as opposed to monoline stuff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The CVA is every single derivative credit exposure we have in the United States, overseas, Europe, Asia, of any type of derivative. I would guess 30% is Europe, and you can go country by country. And so much is Asia, so much is the U.S. And if you go by ratings, a lot of those are highly-rated counterparties. So we have this &#x2013; we also look at derivative exposure no different than credit exposure. We go to you and say we're going to give Bank of America Merrill Lynch a $100 million revolver; that's $100 million. We may give you a trade finance line of $100 million, which you use or don't use. And we may give you a derivative line which is not just what you owe us, it's also a stressed amount of what you owe us. Now all these things will be going to central clearing houses soon or some of them will be over time.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. Thanks. Let me ask a &#x2013; sorry, go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The world went through this huge crisis with these counterparties, and it was really a very select few where you had failures. Most of the major broker-dealers were able to manage their counterparty exposures rather well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's fair. Let me ask you just a question on cards. Obviously, we've seen solid growth across a lot of your metrics, sales and balances, but the marketing spend is up quite a lot both quarter on quarter and year over year. And obviously we're seeing more competition in that space emerging, and everybody seems to want the same affluent client base. Do you think you're going to have to sustain this level of spending in order to sustain the level of growth you're seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, and you have to remember, first of all, marketing is &#x2013; think of it as an investment. So there's a lot of analysis that takes place, you can get a return on it. And it's not all &#x2013; don't think of it as all direct mail. That's online marketing. We have a lot of partners like United, Continental, Southwest Airlines, Hyatt. And so they have requirements. So you see our ads in the paper all the time and stuff like that. So it really is a wide variety of stuff and it's obviously a lumpy number. If you look at year over year, it will probably go up 10%, not like you've seen the 20% or 30% that it was this quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. Hey, Jamie, I think you've talked about regulatory confusion. I think you guys are confused and we're confused. And moving back to the Volcker rule, there's a huge political process that has to take place relative to before we get the final rule. But we keep on hearing that some companies, including yourself, are starting to implement some of these rules. Can you address when you think you have to implement it? Are they going to accelerate this stuff like they're accelerating some of the capital rules?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if they're accelerating things. We want to be prepared for whatever the rules are, and we're going to do the best job we can in meeting all those regulatory requirements. So we're getting prepared because like, certain things like LCR [Liquidity Coverage Ratio] you know will be implemented. The calibrations may change over time. But the detail by type of deposit, by type of counterparty, we're still going to have to do. So some we're starting to build just to get ahead of it. Volcker rules, we're not starting to build because it just came out, but some of the requirements we already do.</p>
          <p>We may not do it exactly the way they want, but we already do it. We've looked at trading desks and all the Greeks and VaRs and aged inventory and stuff like that. But they may have reporting requirements. Compliance requirements will be heavier, so we'll start to build some of that that we know is going to happen. And I think the Volcker rules are meant to be done by January or something. Comments are in by January. And then I guess there will be some time after that. I think by the end of this year, we're going to have a lot more guidance on a lot of these various rules and regulations and the coordination among them. We want to try to embed it in how we run the business. So it's not a &#x2013; we're not chasing our tails. We know exactly what these things mean for our clients, our profitability, our trading desk, and our loans, et cetera.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the mortgage balancing side, your MSR dropped drastically. Now rates dropped almost 100 basis points. And it looks like you had a net hedging gain to offset all that MSR loss. Can you just address that a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the MSR &#x2013; when rates go down and things refi, it's like an IO [Interest Only]. It drops dramatically in value, so there's no surprise there. And so all it says is we hedged it well. But the drop in value was offset by the hedging we did. And the other thing is that the total values ran off because of the higher amortization and that $1 billion write-down from last quarter that was really related to higher servicing cost dropped the value of the MSR too. So if rates went up 100 basis points, the MSR gross value will go back from seven to 10. And hopefully the hedge would &#x2013; actually we're going to hedge it at that point and take the gain. But that's all that is. There are constant adjustments to those models.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. When you look at your net interest margin, your cost of deposits are about 63 basis points, and you've been having outstanding deposit growth. Your loan-to-deposit ratio continues to fall. How low do you think you can take those deposit rates down to, especially in light of the fact that Bernanke has said that he's going to keep short-end rates low until sometime in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've got to look at it by business because some businesses you have competitive results like you've got to price certain deposits around the country retail competitively. Some of the large TSS deposits are already getting zero. We're not begging for them. They're coming to us. And then we've got to pay the FDIC 10 basis points on some of this too. So it's really a little of everything, but it's hard to go below zero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's where you get a little bit of this margin compression here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And shifting over now to the loan loss provision, your credit metrics obviously improved in the quarter. The net charge-off ratio declined. Non-performing assets declined. But the loan loss reserve release, or the provision being less than charge-offs, wasn't as large as it was in the prior three or four quarters. Is it more due to either loan growth, or do you guys have a more cautious outlook now on credit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've already said, I put this in the more cautious outlook category.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it was both. If you go through the details in the fiscal supplement, there are loans to NPLs and loans to charge off. Delinquencies are very strong. I think it might be harder to keep them up here if it stays here. It's hard &#x2013; I guess we said it's hard not to be cautious now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on two things. One is the capital usage where you're discussing after say increasing dividends. If we're thinking about the dividend payout ratio, you've been hovering somewhere between 20% and 30% for the last couple quarters. And 30% seems to be what the regular reserve is allowing at this stage. So are we talking about having an expectation where dividends are going to be going up in line with what you think your earnings growth is going be able to generate? Is that how we should be thinking about the dividends?</p>
          <p>And then on the timing, do you think you're going to be able to make a change in dividend before the CCAR [Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review] process, which is January through March?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Betsy, honestly, we've asked that question too because the way the regulatory thing got upset, that was a GAAP issue, so we're waiting for guidance on that one. I'll just wait until we find out. The Board will take it up. I think we're going to be consistent. I don't know if it's going to be 30% to 40%. It will be 30% with consistent growth...</p>

At the same time, you're running through each of the business lines with regard to what they can generate over time. Are you trying to &#x2013; I'm asking the question as to how you thread the needle because you've been increasing expenses to take share, which you've been doing.

And there are always your expenses come before your revenues. But like in the GCB, for example, we think it's working, and we'll probably want to spend there. Other things I said, we have to modify. And there are whole products that we may not be in anymore if we look at exactly how they function with capital and liquidity charges.</p>
          <p>But we're going be pretty tight in expenses. We're not being lax. We're just adding where we need to add. And then we always expect to get improvements in certain expense ratios as systems come on board, efficiencies, operational efficiencies. Doug mentioned a big one. We're spending I think it was $800 million a quarter on servicing now, which 65% is default servicing. That number is not going be up there forever. Eventually, that default number is going to be &#x2013; it may take a couple years, but close to zero. And we also expect to make the front-end mortgage far more efficient too. We're always working on more efficiency to help pay for some of these other things.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the top line side, you talked about pricing, pricing for liquidity, for G-SIFI buffer, et cetera. Can you talk through how you think you need to reposition the business in order to do that, if any, because some of your competitors will say you're carrying a higher G-SIFI charge that you're not charging for today? But when you do you're going to become under-competitive. So how do you deal with that challenge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Here's the problem with G-SIFI. There are certain things. We're not going to be uncompetitive because we're going to price it in the market and get the business. And if you're going to leave your money with us or them or processing business, you're going to leave it with us and then you're going to call us unfair. We hold more capital. We're going to win the business because we're more sound. And of course, I agree with them. I'm not arguing their point.</p>
          <p>In other businesses yes, we'll probably want to shed the asset because someone else can hold it &#x2013; like take consumer assets. If you can hold it with 7% and I have to hold for 9.5%, I still might service, originate, hold the skin in the game strip, but syndicate the rest. So it will be product by product. It will be certain things, and certain of these things that they want to &#x2013; one of the things in G-SIFI is to reduce interconnectedness. So they don't like interbank lending. I think interbank lending is going to go away. But unlike certain types of &#x2013; it doesn't distinguish between secured and unsecured. But I think they have much higher charges for exposures to financial companies and non-financial companies. So that's not a terrible objective. It might not happen in a productive way. But you'll see that people price lines of credit to finance companies much higher than lines that go to non-financial companies. I can go on and on and really relate to the specific rules. That's the kind of work we're doing now.</p>

          <p>Some will cause unintended consequences that help JPMorgan, and some may very well cause an entire one that hurt us.

Whatever competitor told you that, they're not thinking clearly.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning; a couple quick questions, one just another follow-up on expenses strictly in Investment Banking. It looked like if I net out the DVA and CVA, the comp ratio was around 36%, which is in line with your guidance. But non-comp expense is up a couple hundred million despite lower revenue. So I just wondered if there's litigation expense in the Investment Banking number as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then also maybe, Doug, the tax rate came in I think around 27%. You're usually around the low-30%s. How should we think about that this quarter, and then a run rate over the next couple quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the run rate will be in the low-30%s, and we had some benefits this quarter, nothing more than that.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'd like to flesh out your comment that it's not unreasonable to expect trading &#x2013; expect markets to be in the fourth quarter like they were in the third quarter. And just when Jefferies reported earlier this month or last month, and I realize it's a much smaller, different platform from you; but their commentary was like June, July, and September were all slow and eh, but the real damage all occurred in August when the spreads blew out, and it was the movement in spreads that really did the damage to their P&amp;L. I was wondering. Was that your experience as well? I guess let me leave the question there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not going bring up monthly numbers for you. But my experience from Wall Street is as those spreads gap out, credit products including mortgage and stuff like that get hurt. So yes, I believe it happened in August.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But every business is different. And we have a very broad business. We've got rates, credit, commodity, currency, equity. You name it, and a lot of flow business and derivative businesses. So you've really got to look at what the mix is and not just one company. I don't know Jefferies' business that well.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then looking at the Basel III risk-weighted assets on page 14, I guess I think it's interesting that the Basel III risk-weighted assets keep on ticking down when loans and Basel I risk-weighted assets are ticking up, and I wonder. Is that the mitigation, and can we expect to see that kind of decrease in the Basel III risk-weighted assets continue over the next year or two?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That benefit is going be model driven, and you're going to expect to see model applications and improvement in RWA as a result of that. And that's what happened this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There will be write-off and there will be decisions we make about what we want to do. The way Basel III is set up, certain products have much higher capital charges than others, and so we have choices of options to make. Over the next couple years, certain things run off, or we can just sell things or hedge them differently and that could make a big difference. So yes, we're going to manage the hell out of RWA.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. What was the $500 million of additional overhead cost for? You said it's regulatory related.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was my guess, Mike. And I just think that when you look at G-SIFI, LCR &#x2013; I'm not even including the consent order mortgages here. I think we're going to have to build a lot of additional systems by legal entity around the world to accommodate hundreds of new rules, regulations, reporting. I'm just telling you that that would be my guess right now, that's all. We have real professional teams working today on 75 projects, and these are pretty large projects. They've got risk, credit, legal systems, HR, sales traders globally by legal entity sometimes trying to do it. There's liquidity reporting, credit reporting, new model building, and we're going to do it all well. This is a new world. We're going to live with it, but it's hard to say it's not going to money.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And by the way, I think it's going to be, again, a small unintended benefit for JPMorgan because whatever it costs us, it may be harder for smaller people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you said some of that regulatory cost you wish you didn't have to do. You don't see the benefit, but that's life.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Yes, that's exactly right. That's what I said.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And perhaps the root cause &#x2013; you can disagree with my premise, but perhaps the root cause is the perception of the industry. And a negative perception leads to all sorts of things, protests and everything else, which in turn to leads to regulation, which leads to some of these higher costs. So the question is, what can you do or should you do to help change the image of the industry? And a related question, you've been out there defending the industry a lot. But don't you want to disassociate yourself from some of the bad actors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, I think a lot of bad actors are gone, so let's be fair here. If you talked to most clients of the &#x2013; I'm talking about generic, not JPMorgan. Most of our clients like us. Our middle market clients like us. We do a lot of small business, our consumer clients, even our mortgage clients. But we have issues, and obviously I think they get way over &#x2013; we should be responsive to them. I'm not <mark type="ph" /> making light (68:10) of them. But if you travel around and spoke to clients everywhere, you'll hear we try to do the best we can, like any other business. It's hard to make up for &#x2013; when you say change the image, if you have any great ideas on the phone and you guys can write them up and send them to me, we'll take them into consideration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just follow up. I mean, twelve of the thirteen largest banks that would have failed, I think you would be the one bank that wouldn't have failed during the crisis. Is that correct? And if that's the case &#x2013; what's that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if that statement is completely true. So, I don't want to comment on something I'm not sure about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then where is &#x2013; this is all leading to just revenue growth versus expense growth. Revenues are down $3 billion. Linked-quarter expenses were only down $1 billion, and it sounds like you're just tweaking around the edges. Then you have this extra $0.5 billion of expenses coming at you. Are you going to be able to grow revenues faster than expenses? And if not, at what point do you say hey, we need to be more aggressive with expenses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But Mike, if you're going to back DVA out of earnings, which I think you should do, I completely understand that you normalize, you should back it out of revenues, too. So $2 billion of that is DVA. So what we look at, and again it's not &#x2013; I think it's pretty good. Look at the underlying numbers: number of accounts, number of deposits, number of branches, number of clients, number of bankers, keeping some kind of good trading flow in what seems to be a terrible environment, market shares. That's what I look at in terms of growing the business. The revenues themselves are prone to be lumpy. You and I have been in this business a long time. We know that. And obviously, when we're tight, we'll trim our sails where we think there are products or areas or branches that we can't make any money at all. So obviously, we'll adjust to that, and a lot of that's going on right now. We acknowledge that.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys; just a few more questions. One, looking at the real estate portfolio, the portfolio continues to decline. Loan loss reserve stays where it was. Can you talk a little bit about how much of that maintaining reserves is just macro caution, versus is there actually something you're seeing in the numbers to give you concern? We see the delinquency chart that shows delinquencies 30 to 150 days flat-lining. But are you seeing other things in that portfolio giving you concern?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really is macro conservatism. If you look at delinquencies, roll rates, first-time delinquent, that kind of stuff, they're mixed. It could very well start to improve again, but it has flattened out, which is an abundance of caution on our part. And the fact that the world questions them anyway about how these &#x2013; are the reserves sufficient. Obviously, there are multiple years' covered charge-offs today. They can cover pretty adverse scenarios at this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Within mortgage origination, up 35% sequentially, it is a big revenue number. Were there pipeline hedging benefits to that? Is there a delay?

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>Okay, fair enough. Just one more technical and then I have a broader question. On home price values, have you altered your home price expectation in any of your models this quarter? And can you remind us what that is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In general, we've got &#x2013; it's by product, by area, by everything. But in general, what's modeled into our reserves and our purchase credit impaired is another drop of 1% to 4%, depending what it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it still seems that may actually be what ends up happening. But as you know as well as we know, we don't know that exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So my last question is, there's a lot that's coming on the market in terms of assets for sale. I would call it an asset flush. What would be your ideal product type of assets to look at, given the fact that you almost have an unprecedented opportunity to pick up a lot?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's a very good question. I should have put at that bottom of that capital thing when I talked about capital confusion, that's another one. So there are some wonderful things you can buy now that we can probably get a 10% or 11% cash-on-cash return for probably with a duration of three or four years as being dumped by other people, but it's got this very, very high RWA, not like 100%, like 1,200% type charges, but it's mouth-watering. And so we're trying &#x2013; that's why I'm saying. When we reinvest our portfolio, we do have options, but it all comes down to how we want to make those decisions, and we're making them right now as we go along. We want to think it through a little bit better, but there will be opportunities and we are ready to use our capital to do that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>But you would ask the next question which you'd want to ask, which is okay, would you rather buy 11% RWA &#x2013; an 11% cash-on-cash asset with such a large RWA to get back, or buy your stock back much cheaper?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the answer is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to tell you, but I'll just tell you there is a little bit of a dilemma, and then it relates to whether you can or not. We know we can buy the assets. We're not sure we can buy back the stock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we know we can buy the asset and also have a huge lift in Basel III when we want it because it will disappear by that point. That's why I'm saying it's a little bit around this capital confusion.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Ron Mandle with GIC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. But just on the reserve, the reserve versus charge option, last year there was about a 100 basis point gap between the reserve and annualized charge-offs, and now it's like 250 basis points. And as you say, you're being cautious. But I'm just wondering what the discussion is that you're having with your accountants that they are comfortable with having such a large gap and whether this may be signs that the accountants are more comfortable with less pro-cyclical reserving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think you're going too far there. First of all, I would simply state that obviously we do these things. We trust the accountants. And there are judgment calls and analyses, in fact, always updating when we do these things. For example, I pointed out before, on seconds behind a delinquent first, we are much different in how we look at that than a second that is not behind a delinquent first. So we do much more sophisticated reserving than that. But I made it very clear, we're going to be as conservative as possible. Maybe next quarter I'm going be saying we had to take this down because we were forced to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, that's the point I'm getting at. The accountants don't seem to be forcing you now, so is that a change on their part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. I think it's just the facts are constantly changing, and you've got to talk to the accountants and get their opinion on it. I think you're stretching to say it would be that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for squeezing me in here, two questions. One, how sensitive is net interest income to changes in long-term rates? So for example, rates have popped about 50 basis points here. If Europe gets resolved and we go up another 50 basis points, how meaningful would that be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hang on because Doug may know the number because we disclosed the number last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so a 100 basis point shift in the curve would add a couple of billion dollars to net income &#x2013; to pre-tax. That's a 100 basis point shift in the curve. A short-term move in the long end and no move in the short end, you won't see this short-term move materially affect NIM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If the curve went up today 100 basis points, I remember the last time I looked at it, it's about 50/50 that's short and long. They both would benefit the company.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And obviously if long rates go up, then you might extend out your securities or things like that?</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If long rates go up enough, that would make you change your strategy in your securities portfolio that could be additive as well?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just separately as you talk about reviewing some of the businesses, trimming some, you mentioned exiting some. The mortgage business is one that has obviously been very frustrating because of some of the legacy issues. But one can make the argument that you've gotten a capital hit, a political hit. During most times, it's only so-so in terms of profitability. We don't know what the GSE and the mortgage finance model is going to look like. Another big competitor I think is getting out about 40% or 50% of their production channels as closing down. How do you think about the mortgage business going forward in terms of the various channels and just the business overall as part of the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first of all, the correspondent issue is not a big deal. Put that to the side. It's actually basically buying servicing, which to me is a pure economic decision. Are you buy at a good return or not? And some of them are clients. We treat correspondent clients like banks who also have broad relationships with very differently, regional banks, et cetera. We're going to be obviously going through that again too. I think in a couple years we're going to cut the correspondent thing literally a third of what it was.</p>
          <p>I'd look at it the other way around. I think that we will have going forward one of the best mortgage businesses in the country because we tend to build the best front end, middle office, back office systems. Eventually, the legacy problems will be gone. We know we made a lot of mistakes here, so we're not denying that. We've made them in other businesses, too, every now and then. We have real competitive distribution, 5,300 branches, salespeople, a mortgage sales force.</p>
          <p>So we think it will still be a really important product, which whatever happens to GSEs, it will have an embedded profit built into it, and all the legacy stuff will be sunk costs. In fact, all the underlying for the last three years is back to where it was 30 years ago. In fact, going forward it's going to be a much better business, cleaner. You won't have all these problems from the past. So we're in favor of cleaning up the mortgage product, disclosures, national regulation. So that will make it a better. But I think it would be a mistake to say okay, we're going to get out of it because of legacy problems. Believe me; there's the temptation.</p>
          <p>We're still making $10 billion, $12 billion, $13 billion of mortgages a month. A lot of the mistakes will be attacked by AGs. And we know we made mistakes. We want to resolve the mistakes, and we're ready to be punished for the mistakes. But I think that's the wrong reason to get out of the business for. It's too important. It's still the most important financial product for the majority of Americans and it will be for the rest of our lives.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, a couple of quick just cleanup questions. On the $400 million net income impact of spread compression next year in terms of an estimate, obviously I appreciate your comments about how you can move things around on the balance sheet. But does that also build in some expectation for deposit and loan growth, or should we look at that as additive if that were to occur?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's additive. This is like a static analysis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay, great. On the student loan reserves, you increased those. What's driving that? I'm just curious.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we just extended the coverage from 12 to 15 months, and performance net charge-offs are going up there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so somewhat of a catch-up, but also not great trends. And then lastly, any comment on the thought of the Fed taking away the 25 basis points on excess reserves, how that might impact you or the markets? It's hard to get a sense of how much you have parked there. And if you had to go into the short-term treasury markets and buy up six-month, one- year, five to ten basis points versus 25, is that a material impact or not? And how do you think that affects the curve overall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've been very clear about the policy and why they have a policy and all that. It's a real tool for them. We do have a lot of money parked there because there's a lot of money swishing around the world that has no place to go. We would have other alternatives that my guess we'd get a lot of that back anyway, but you have to take some risk to do it. Some things would be 10 basis points. The Fed is 25, some 10, some would be 15. There are options around the world at other central banks at higher rates.</p>

          <p>We're trying to accommodate our clients more than &#x2013; the reason we're taking those is to be accommodative, not to make a spread. Remember, our spread mostly &#x2013; even if the Fed is not 25 basis points, it's 15 basis points.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys; first, a quick question on credit. I know, Jamie, that you had indicated you're cautious, and you said that you're seeing both good things and bad things as far as trends when you commented before. But I was just curious whether &#x2013; I'm sure given the size of your credit card portfolio, you have a great amount of data. I'm curious whether or not you're seeing behaviors in that portfolio that usually lead to an uptick in delinquencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. First of all, wholesale credit is exceptionally good. It's better than &#x2013; it's almost back to where &#x2013; I'm not talking about large corporate, middle market, so we're talking about consumer. We said delinquencies trends flattened out. In credit cards, there's a little bit of flattening there in the 30-day, 60-day, 90-day delinquencies, but no other major thing. So what we said about charge-offs, they'll probably tick down a little bit next quarter. It's very hard to tell what it will be next year. We always have a lot of visibility into next quarter. But I think with 9% unemployment, it will be silly to assume dramatic improvement at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair. And then on the peripheral European exposure, I know you provided the $3 billion after-tax figure for impacts from losses, from defaults there. But it seems as though from the comments out of Europe that Greek default and potentially triggering of CDS are no longer taboo issues. Could you walk us through how to think about maybe Greece specifically?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then as far as the impact on the system, could you have any comments about what you think would happen there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I already commented on that, so I'm not going to do it again. We talked about that extensively. Actually, there's some great research about it. So if you want, you can call Lauren and she can send it down to you.</p>
