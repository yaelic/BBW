          <p>Good morning. This is Sarla welcoming you to ING's 4Q 2010 Conference Call. Before handing this conference call over to Jan Hommen, Chief Executive Officer of ING Group; Patrick Flynn, Chief Financial Officer; and Koos Timmermans, Chief Risk Officer, let me first say that any forward-looking statements in today's comments are subject to a number of current views, assumptions and variables; including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates, movement in security markets, including equity markets, and underlying economic conditions and changes. These are set out in greater detail in our public filings, which we would urge you to read. The realization of forward-looking statements could be materially altered by unexpected movement in any or all of these other variables.</p>
          <p>Good morning, Jan, Patrick, and Koos. Jan, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Welcome, everyone, to the fourth quarter ING result conference call. I'm happy to report that ING is continuing to make good progress as we prepare the bank and the insurance companies for their future as standalone companies. The Bank posted another strong quarter and the Insurance Company is showing a solid improvement in operating profits.</p>
          <p>Although, on an underlying basis, results were impacted by the measures we announced last quarter to address the U.S. Closed Block Variable Annuity Block. The good news is that markets improved in Q4 and the total impact of the VA measures we announced last quarter was lower than we originally anticipated.</p>
          <p>I will talk you through the presentation now, and afterwards, Koos Timmermans, Patrick Flynn and also Matt Rider, our CFO of the Insurance Company, are here with me, and we are all able to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>Let me go to Slide Two. ING Group reported an underlying net profit of &#x20AC;644 million; that was up from &#x20AC;90 million a year ago. The Bank had another strong quarter and underlying profits of &#x20AC;1.5 billon before tax. Operating result in Insurance increased to &#x20AC;438 million compared to &#x20AC;303 million in the fourth quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Underlying result impacted by the announcement we made already last quarter on the DAC write-down; that had an impact of &#x20AC;975 million before tax. Operational separation of the bank and the insurance was complete, and the two companies are now operating arm's length as of the 1st of January this year.</p>
          <p>The separation now enters phase number two, as we are now working through legal and operational separation within the Insurance organization, and the focus for 2011 will be to prepare the Insurance Company for two IPOs. And then at the same time that we want to work towards the repurchase of the remaining outstanding Core Tier 1 securities from the Dutch state.</p>
          <p>On Slide Three, you can see that the Bank had another strong quarter, certainly compared to Q4 last year and almost on par with the third quarter. Insurance Company operating profits improved significantly from a year ago, mainly because of investment spreads as cash balances were reinvested. Underlying results, as I mentioned earlier, impacted by the DAC write-down on the U.S. Closed Block.</p>
          <p>For the Group, that had an impact that the underlying net profit was &#x20AC;644 million. Compared with Q4, that was significantly up last year, but down compared with the third quarter this year. And that was due entirely to the DAC write-down. Net profits, &#x20AC;433 million. We had special items impacting on that of about &#x20AC;229 million, primarily as a result of the separation process we are in and some restructuring programs.</p>
          <p>Page Four. You see the full-year results and you can see that the Bank really had a good year. In fact, earnings are now up to levels that were pre-crisis. Insurance operating profit improved in 2010. And underlying result for the Group was &#x20AC;3.9 billion; up fourfold compared to last year, with a net profit of &#x20AC;3.2 billion compared to a loss of &#x20AC;935 million.</p>
          <p>On Slide Five, you see that we, compared with the Ambition we issued last year, that we're making good progress, strong income generation by the Bank, healthy margins and lower market impacts really had a significant impact on our numbers and, excluding market impacts, income rose by 7.4%.</p>
          <p>Cost/income ratio, stable at 54.2, if we exclude the impact of markets. Risk costs are trending towards the more normalized levels. Return on equity, if we calculate that based on the 7.5% Core Tier 1 we assumed when we made our plan for the Ambition 2013, was 17.6%; and if we calculate that based on IFRS equity, then the return is 13.1%.</p>
          <p>The same for Insurance; good progress on the Ambition, healthy growth in the general accounts. Investment margins were up to 93 basis points compared with 83. That's on a four-quarter trailing trend line.</p>
          <p>Administrative expense, slightly down, despite some accrual adjustments we made last year to our bonus deferral, which benefited the numbers in Q4 in 2009.</p>
          <p>Sales growth continued to exceed our target, which was 10%. We were up here 17.3%, but we are maintaining very strict pricing discipline. And the return on equity is still lagging our objectives, but it was mainly impacted by the DAC write-down.</p>
          <p>When you look at our separation process in Slide Number Seven, the operational separation is completed now, as of the 1st of January this year. So we are working together on an arm's length basis where we share infrastructure and where we do activities together. The separation costs were &#x20AC;85 million after tax and the focus for the year 2011 is to make the interim solutions more permanent, mainly related to IT. We expect that we will spend this year about &#x20AC;200 million after tax in order to get us there, and that we will focus also internally within Insurance on separating the U.S. operations from the other activities and to make sure that we align our investment management activities correctly with our two-IPO structure.</p>
          <p>We will align the Insurance structure to the new IPO. That means that we will take a look at our legal structure in the first half of 2011, and we also will be looking at getting our regulatory approval process in place so that we can do IPOs by the time that we are ready for that.</p>
          <p>Investment management will continue to cooperate across all the regions to ensure that we have our customers really provided with continuity in terms of product distribution and investment expertise.</p>
          <p>Looking in particular at the Bank, you see on the left side that the commercial results of the Bank rose compared to Q4 last year but declined somewhat compared with the third quarter, reflecting the seasonality in financial markets, also combined with some higher expenses here.</p>
          <p>Risk cost increased slightly in Q4 after three quarters of decline. However, the market impacts also included a gain on the sale of the stake in Fubon, which was about &#x20AC;189 million, which was reported in the corporate line. And then underlying result before tax was up strongly compared with Q4, due to lower market impacts, and almost at the same level as Q3.</p>
          <p>The net interest margin on Slide Number 10 rose to 147 basis points; that is six basis points higher than both the third quarter of 2010 and the fourth quarter of 2009. And we expect the net interest margin to remain stable at around 140 basis points for the quarters to come.</p>
          <p>Margins in particular benefited from Structured Finance, where we saw continued increase. Margins for mortgages and savings remained healthy in all businesses, but we see a little bit more competition for these &#x2013; for a number of areas; in particular, the mid corporate and the SME markets, and especially here in the Benelux. While at the same time, we see that demand for loans is still subdued in those areas.</p>
          <p>On the right hand, you see also the interest results held well, and they rose by 11.6%, mainly driven by client balances and higher interest margins.</p>
          <p>Looking at costs on Page 11. On a reported basis, the cost increase was 1.4% compared with the year ago, but if we exclude currency and a number of exceptional items, then expenses were up 9.2%.</p>
          <p>We have some special items in here. We had a new deposit guarantee system in Belgium, and we had higher marketing expense at the end of the year in support of the brand, some special campaigns we had. And we had increased expenses for staff, also external staff, in particular related to IT projects that we are undertaking to replace old infrastructure as well as building on new activities.</p>
          <p>On a full year basis, adjusted expenses are up 3.1%, and I can assure that we will be very vigilant on cost control in the year 2011.</p>
          <p>Risk cost continued to trend down in 2010, but in Q4, we saw a small increase; a small increase to 51 basis points on average risk-weighted assets. And that was mainly visible in the retail banking driven by model changes on the mortgage portfolio. For the coming year, we see risk cost as a percent of risk-weighted assets to be slightly below the level of 2010.</p>
          <p>The next slide, you see the non-performing loans; a slight increase to 2.2%. And the increase in risk cost was mainly driven by the model adjustments we made on the Dutch mortgage portfolio, which still has an NPL that remained stable at about 1%.</p>
          <p>On Page 14, you see the results of the Retail Banks. Well, Retail Banks had an underlying result before tax increase compared to last year's first quarter, but had a decline, basically due to higher expense and higher risk costs.</p>
          <p>Looking at the Commercial Bank, you see here that the commercial bank, excluding Real Estate, had a strong increase in results compared with last year; up about 39%. And you see also there that it was impacted by mainly Structured Finance, doing very well, and core lending activities compensated by low results, which is normal seasonally in financial markets. And good news also on our Real Estate division; that turned positive and made a contribution of &#x20AC;80 million, helped by stabilized property prices.</p>
          <p>When you look at our Real Estate exposure, then it is coming down; a decrease from &#x20AC;3.3 billion to &#x20AC;2 billion at the end of Q4, largely explained by the sale we did in Summit in Q4.</p>
          <p>Yesterday, you saw that we announced that we have reached an agreement to sell the majority of our Real Estate Investment Management business for US$1 billion, and we have sold another US$100 million of equity interest in our REIM funds. Altogether, that will be delivering a gain of approximately &#x20AC;500 million by the time that we close this transaction.</p>
          <p>Investments in real estate development projects continued to decline. There were &#x20AC;2.3 billion in Q4 last, and now they are &#x20AC;1.8 billion. So we continue to work on reducing our exposure in the Real Estate area.</p>
          <p>Core Tier 1 up significantly to 9.6%; a strong generation of profit of course that contributed &#x20AC;4.4 billion, and the reminder as a result of a reduction of risk-weighted assets. Very important, because this will allow us to continue our discussions with the Dutch state on how we can at least begin with the repayment of the remaining outstandings that we have with the Dutch state. And at the same time, I think we will continue to look at maintaining a strong capital position, in particular with respect to the upcoming regulatory changes that we expect in the Basel III.</p>
          <p>Moving to Insurance. Operating result held up well in Q4 and has improved significantly compared with the year ago, mainly as a result of investment margin and higher fees due to new sales and the growth that we had in assets under management. Underlying result before tax, as noted before, impacted heavily by the &#x20AC;975 million write-off of our DAC accounts in the U.S. Closed Block VA business.</p>
          <p>Investment spreads, up to 93 basis points. And if you look at it standalone in Q4, even to 97 basis points, I think our Investment Management people have really made a good contribution to our earnings here. And I believe that, that is all I can say at this slide here.</p>
          <p>Looking at the next one, Slide 21, we see that operating results improved as a result of higher fees and premium-based revenues. They were up by 15.2% compared with the year ago, primarily due from Asia, INGIM and Latin America.</p>
          <p>In the next slide, the administrative expense, that the year-on-year increase in expense is largely due to &#x2013; on the one hand, to depreciation of the euro, and on the other hand, the accrual adjustments we made in Q4 last year when we did a further substantial portion of the bonus payments. So the comparison with Q4 last year is a little disadvantageous at this moment. But at constant currencies and excluding these adjustments, the administrative expenses were up 0.5%, so well-contained.</p>
          <p>Operating results are resilient in most businesses, as you can see on Slide 23. And the lower year-on-year result in the Central and Eastern Europe area can be explained by releases of provisions we made in Q4 last year and the financial institutions tax that we endured in Hungary in Q4 of this year. And the year-on-year decline in IM is mainly as a result of the accrual adjustments that were made in Q4 of last year.</p>
          <p>Sales continued to do strong, and they generate profitable sales as well, while we are maintaining the hurdle rates for margins and returns. As measured in APE, they were healthy this quarter by almost &#x20AC;1.2 billion; in particular, strong in the U.S., which were driven by Retirement Services and Individual Life sales.</p>
          <p>Also, Asia. Asia had a decline which was due to seasonality, but still the COLI sales in Japan were doing strong.</p>
          <p>Slide 25, you see the impact of the DAC write-down on the U.S. Closed Block. I don't think I need to explain that; that's quite explanatory by itself.</p>
          <p>On Slide 26, you see that the accounting has been brought in line with our U.S. peers. The VA Block is now reported as a separate business line, and that triggered by itself the DAC write-down of &#x20AC;975 million in Q4.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have moved towards fair value accounting on reserves for the Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit as of the 1st of January. And the impact on equity, related to the accounting change, was significantly less than the estimate we made earlier because of markets that were moving in the right direction and interest rates that went up. So the charge now is only &#x20AC;700 million, compared to an earlier indication of &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>The benefits of taking these measures are really important for us. The DAC balance has been significantly reduced, which is bringing the K factor to less than 50%. The reserve adequacy has been strengthened, and there's a substantial buffer on top of the 50% confidence level. And then also, we have now hedged approximately 45% of the interest rate risk. And all of this, I think, will have a big impact on the volatility of earnings going forward and will have a positive impact on our run rate on an operating basis.</p>
          <p>When you look at our capital position and insurance, we continued to do, I think, very well, at 255 for insurance solvency and regulatory capital in the U.S. at 432; I think all respectable numbers.</p>
          <p>What we did do in this quarter was we swapped &#x20AC;1.5 billion of hybrids for equity. So you see that coming back on the debt equity ratio in the Group. But it lowered the interest expense for the Group going forward by about &#x20AC;200 million a year. I am sorry; not for the Group. It will reduce the interest expense for Insurance by &#x20AC;200 million.</p>
          <p>Looking at the balance sheets, you can see that insurance equity now is at &#x20AC;20 billion at the 1st of January this year, and that total equity of the insurance subsidiaries is &#x20AC;31 billion on an unleveraged basis. And that's important, when if you calculate the return on equity per business line, then normally I think people will assume a leverage of about 25% to 35%, if you want to make that comparable with what other peers are doing.</p>
          <p>So let me wrap up the presentation. Solid results for ING. Good, strong recovery on the Banking side. Good progress shown by Insurance on an operating performance. Charges taken on the U.S. Closed Block will help to reduce volatility and will ease the concern that the market has on our business. And I believe that the focus for 2011 will continue to be &#x2013; to prepare the Insurance company for two IPOs, and at the same time, to work towards a reduction of the outstanding Core Tier 1 securities versus expense.</p>
          <p>And let's now open it up for your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Spencer Horgan. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Morning, everyone. Two balance sheet questions, please. The first one is, if we look at the Core Tier 1 ratio in the bank, obviously that's improved quite nicely to 9.6 in the quarter, but have you sort of updated your view as to what the right number for that is prospectively in terms of the target capital strength of the Bank? And maybe you could just update us as to what the pro-forma Basel III number might be on spot implementation?</p>
          <p>And then the second one is, in terms of the debt-for-equity swap in Insurance, I mean, obviously &#x2013; I understand that's effectively just shuffling debt around the Group, but could you sort of expand a bit on why you've done that? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Prospectively, yes, I think if you look at the pro-forma Basel III results, I mean, that is something we will give later; again, we will update at the end of the first quarter. It will be a little bit lower as it was &#x2013; we indicated 70 basis points before. But that all has to do with the revaluation reserve. That is the biggest driving factor behind there. Because please note that revaluation reserve, if negative, would be a deductible from your Core Tier 1 in the future. Somewhere, that result over time, I think, will disappear if we move more to IFRS 9. But overall, I would say it's a slightly lower number than the 70 basis points we have seen before.</p>
          <p>And if you look at the Core Tier 1 ratio, then what we have given is internally, we work &#x2013; at the moment we say, like, we want to be in line with peers and we feel comfortable if that number is above the 8% at the moment, so that is clearly what we are working on. But we have not made that number definite, and that will become more definite once the Basel III numbers are more clarified.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But it is fair to say broadly the Bank is somewhat better capitalized than it needs to be at the movement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; well, we do feel comfortable with the capital position, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then equity swap, Matt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, maybe I take the debt/equity swap. I think a couple of reasons for this: first of all, it basically mitigates the impact of the DAC write-off that we saw in the fourth quarter, together with the impact of moving to market value that we'll see in the first quarter, that &#x20AC;700 million number. The other thing is that it basically reduces financial leverage in the Insurance companies, which is very important in rating agencies. And it reduces the fixed charge coverage ratio, which is also important. And it also basically reduces the entanglements that we're going to &#x2013; that we have with the overall Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Farooq Hanif. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Two areas I'd like to explore. Firstly, just want to understand your point about the run rate in Insurance earnings. You seem to be sort of positive about that, given the clean-up. So firstly, with the write-off of DAC in VAs and with this reduced K factor, can you explain kind of the expense line going forward? And also, the investment margin has gone up. You've got a target of increasing it further. Can you explain how quickly you get there, given current yield curve?</p>
          <p>And the second question area is just on the risk-weighted assets. You had a pretty big reduction, which has been good for your Core Tier 1 capital ratio generation. I was just wondering what further you have to do, because you seem to be talking about repaying the Dutch state this year. I was wondering what your plans were for the risk-weighted assets. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Matt, I think you take the first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Farooq, so maybe I take the first one. On the Insurance run rate, I think you've seen some very good improvement over the course of the year. If you recall from the Investor Day last April, on the investment margin in particular, I think at that point we were sitting at something like 83 basis points. Now we're up to 93, with a target of 105. So I think we're making some probably a little bit faster progress than we had anticipated on that line. So that's a good thing.</p>
          <p>With respect to the DAC write-offs, obviously there's going to be less DAC to amortize going forward. I think we'll be able to give a little bit more description when we rework the financials to take into account all these changes. But I think you'll see some modest positive operating results coming through the VA business. And I think we leave it there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Investment margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I picked that one up first, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. RWA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the RWAs, Farooq, yes, you have seen some declines. What you can see is that in fact we have now almost 90% covered with the Basel II internal model, so that means that has an implication for the RWAs. Can we go much further there in declining it? I don't think so. What you will see over the next year is the Basel 2.5 implementation, which will &#x2013; so you expect a little bit of upward effects rather than downward effects on this. I mean, we're not talking about large numbers, but in the end, I mean, I don't expect a lot of further decreases coming through this year. And in fact, you will see a slight upward effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on that point, I mean, the other drivers, obviously growth in your balances. I mean, you seem to be saying that there are areas where there's some pretty good demand, particularly in the Commercial Bank.

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the total amount, what you have seen is in a decent amount of increases in our mortgages. Commercial Banking, relatively modest. Some segments like the Structured Finance have increased a lot, and overall we expect that volume growth around the 5%, which is a bit in line with our long-term guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have two &#x2013; well, three questions, please. Firstly, could you just elaborate on your aim to repay the majority of the remaining state capital aid this year? So what you're thinking in terms of timeframe there; how will you go about it, i.e. in one go or multiple repayments; and also your thoughts on the repayment premium of 50%, and any ability to negotiate there.</p>
          <p>My second question is just on the net interest margin. You've obviously increased again to 147 basis points. Just your thoughts in terms of how sustainable you believe that could be, or whether it could revert back to 140 or even below during 2011?</p>
          <p>And then finally, with regard to costs, can you just please give us some idea of how much of the cost increase in the Netherlands, and also in ING Direct, with both the seasonal marketing campaigns, and probably won't reappear in the first quarter of 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me take the first one related to the repayment of the Dutch state. We had made a deal originally with the Dutch state that we could repay at a discount. And once we have done that, we heard from the European Commission -- or the state also heard from the European Commission, that they do not agree with that, and that it would mean that we had additional restructuring requirements because it would count as state support again. That has given us some pause on what to do next with the repayment of the Dutch state. We are, at this moment, if you repay at this moment, then I think the only thing we can do is repay with the 50% premium.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we still have a court case that is still open. We have not heard anything yet, what that could do. One of the issues in the court case is specifically this topic, and yes, we need to wait what the answer will be before we can see whether we will either win or not win this case. I have no indications at this moment when the resolution of that case will be. They still need to have hearings, oral hearings, which we thought were scheduled for sometime this year. And the anticipation was that we would get an answer this year.</p>
          <p>But in the meantime, we still would like to pay back the Dutch government and we are in discussions with them. How can we do this and what amount can we afford to pay; also looking at the requirements we have under Basel III, upcoming requirements. So we like to do it, but at the same time, we like to do it in a smart way.</p>
          <p>Net interest margin, Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I give you a few minutes just to run through the drivers of the interest margin, so you can get a sense of where it might go to going forward. And as Jan said, it's been robust at about 140 basis points throughout the year. And the drivers behind that, the positive drivers, have been we've seen some good mortgage growth in the Netherlands; approximately &#x20AC;1.5 billion of production in the fourth quarter. We've also seen an improvement to the margin as a number of our customers have retained mortgages and the duration has lengthened, which has enabled us to fund that extended duration at lower rates, which has been a positive.</p>
          <p>ING Direct as well, we've seen good volume growth throughout. The margins there are stable. There was a one-time increase of approximately &#x20AC;21 million from the technical accounting change, but eliminating that, it's pretty stable. A strong part in supporting margin is our Structured Finance business where we've seen good margins and good production both in trade and export finance.</p>
          <p>Financial markets. I think as we mentioned before, it's up in the fourth quarter two basis points, but it's inherently a volatile number. In fact, the aggregate for financial markets, both net interest income and other income, was down, which you normally see as a seasonal effect. So I wouldn't rely on the financial markets as an indicator of the future. It's inherently volatile.</p>
          <p>SMEs volume, as Jan said, is low. Sorry, demand is low in this area. And there's some pressure on margins as a consequence. If you talk about the investment book, &#x20AC;144 billion. Average duration is short and there could be some pressure on margins and this low interest rates of these are replaced.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, there's the liability side. It's been positive in the Netherlands. We reduced rates in September, which has benefited the interest margin. However, we're seeing some of our peers pushing rates up, so there's some emerging pressure there. Also, in ING Direct in Spain and in France, there is a stronger pressure on interest rates applied by competitors.</p>
          <p>That said, if you look at &#x2013; in the round, notwithstanding those pressure points, we have still managed to increase the interest margin to 147. And that's primarily driven by the two strong points which stand out, which are mortgages and our Structured Finance business. Therefore, the average we've seen for the full year of 140 is a solid number and we think we can continue at about this level in the coming quarters.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the cost increase, the seasonal impacts, we did invest in marketing, just under &#x20AC;40 million in the fourth quarter. You can call that a discretionary increase. We also are investing in the business. We've invested in our &#x2013; a variety of IT-related investments to improve the Internet platform, call centers and ATMs, which again are broadly about the same level of &#x20AC;40 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you will see us being very vigilant on costs in 2011. We have already taken a few steps, but not all the IT activities can be done in one year, despite the improvements that that could create. So we'll be very vigilant on making sure that our costs stay in line and that we continue to work towards our objectives, which are 50% cost/income ratio for the Bank long term, and 35% for the Insurance company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Just again on the cost side as well, I mean, you're targeting this cost/income of 50%. Clearly, you're saying that the net interest margin is probably higher than is sustainable at the moment. And just in terms of the cost then, are we going to see a step change in the costs? Like, obviously, the Belgium increase in cost there in terms of the deposit scheme is going to cost you more. So how are you going to get possibly to the 50% cost/income ratio? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>Number two is just on the risk cost of 51 bps. You're saying that going forward, it's going to be lower than that. Is that a function of the risk-weighted assets moving up, or actually the absolute level of risk cost going down? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean, on costs, if you look at &#x2013; there was an increase in the fourth quarter, but if you look at the cost/income ratio for the full year, excluding market effect, it's 54%. So it's flat, and the target is to 2013. So we are maintaining our drive to get that 54% down to 50% in that time period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and with regards to the risk cost, well, mathematically, you are right that you have both the effects. I think overall what we expect of it is that the risk cost level will &#x2013; that the overall amount of risk cost will go down slightly. I think in fact if you look at the uptick which we had in Q4, a number of them were sort of one-off calculations of LGD adjustments in some other areas, but overall, the trend is still a bit down. And that is why we set an overall risk cost number in terms of monetary amounts. We expect that to be at around or slightly below the level of what we had last year. And therefore, with your RWAs, it would move up a little bit. I mean, both effects contribute to a lower risk cost number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. So many questions and so little time. The &#x2013; can I focus on the interest rate hedges that you've got in place on the VA business and what impact they may have going forward, given that interest rates are going up, i.e. what did they have in fourth quarter, what might they have &#x2013; effect they have then? And I'm looking really at the sources of the &#x2013; that were the ongoing profit in the Closed VA Block.</p>
          <p>I'm also looking at these model improvements, model updates, on your mortgage book. Can you give us some handle behind what is going on there? Are these ongoing, et cetera? And also, should we be worried about the rise in non-performing loans in Real Estate, particularly given that your LLCs there seem to have gone down?</p>
          <p>I also just &#x2013; a technical thing. When you have sold REIM, would it be that component of profits that will disappear from your P&amp;L account going forward or are there other impacts? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The interest rate hedge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Chris. On the interest rate hedges, just to recap a bit, what we had announced last quarter was that we would move the VA, or part of the VA business, to Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefits, more into line with U.S. peers and to put it more on a market value approach.</p>
          <p>So during basically the last several weeks of 2010, we put on a little bit &#x2013; about &#x20AC;3.7 billion notional of interest rate hedges. Now, we actually ended up doing this at a very good time because the interest rates had already increased. So we actually made some small profit, I think, on the transactions; something like &#x20AC;20 million for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So at this point, for that block of business, we've locked out about 45% of the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. So the idea is that as interest rates go up, if they do go up, then we will benefit for about 55% of the block; if they go down, then we'll head for about 45%. So all in all, I think that worked out exceptionally well, and we managed to catch the market at a very good time to put those hedges on the books.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, maybe on the model update, on the mortgages, what you see is past experience on recoveries in cases of defaults. You use them in updating your model. So therefore, you get an LGD, a Loss Given Default, increase, and that is the part what caused the risk cost in the Netherlands to go up.</p>
          <p>In fact, you could argue, does it mean we have more defaults? The answer is no. In fact, what you find is our total amount of arrears has gone down. The only thing &#x2013; the effect is if you have an arrear, then your costs are going up. So maybe a slightly confusing answer, but in the end, it's more past experience driving through in models. Nevertheless, NPLs down there.</p>
          <p>If you then move to the Real Estate part, on the Real Estate side, you see that we have a little bit more NPLs. I give you a bit of background on those non-performing loans, and that is that all of them are related to covenant breaches. So we are not talking about arrears or non-paying. I mean, we have a relatively prudent approach in terms of putting loans in non-performing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. I have two or three questions, actually. The first one is on the total capital to be released through the sale of ING Real Estate Investment Management. You mentioned a &#x20AC;500 million net capital gain. What is the amount of risk-weighted asset decrease there? And therefore, what's the overall amount of capital relief, thanks to the transaction?</p>
          <p>And second question, on WestlandUtrecht; I just wanted to know where you were on that, what you plan to do with &#x2013; can we expect something in 2011?</p>
          <p>And maybe just finally on ING Direct, the margin you mentioned, trends in Spain and France, what about Germany, the U.S. and the U.K., please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If you look at the capital relief, I mean, please note that the biggest gain comes from the fact that you sell the company at a higher-than-book value; that gives it the capital relief. In terms of capital relief from lower assets, that is not so much the case because we are selling an investment management company. And yes, we have a little bit of lower seed capital, but it's a relatively small amount in terms of RWA releases.</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>Yes. In terms of the U.S., there was an uptick in the fourth quarter in the margin in the U.S., so as I said, that was an accounting one-off effect. So margins would be relatively stable from where they currently are, and broadly the same in Germany.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions, if I may. Firstly, just on the interest margin, I wondered if you could give an update of the sensitivity of that to a 100 basis point increase in the yield curve. I think previously you'd guided to seven basis points on that kind of metric.</p>
          <p>And additionally, what are your expectations for positioning for ECB rate rises? And is any of that captured in the 140 basis points guidance you've given for the next coming quarters?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just on the RWA development, I wondered if you could actually break down the &#x20AC;10 billion change Q-on-Q, just between the model changes, underlying growth and kind of the exchange rate component which we know is &#x20AC;3 billion? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Farquhar, on the interest rate sensitivity, indeed we have given initially &#x2013; we have given some guidance there on how interest-sensitive are we. And indeed, you are talking about five to seven basis points of NIM margin per 100 basis point. Now, if we look at a forward curve, then we are expecting less than a 100 basis point increase for this year. So yes, this is all sort of part of our medium-term plan in terms of what our guidance, which we are giving. Because in general, what we are doing is we try to make sure that we invest our savings money where interest rates we &#x2013; our cost of savings money will go up. But we make sure that our investments are short enough that we do get additional yield out of repricing as well.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the &#x20AC;10 billion in total, what you have is volume growth that one part &#x20AC;1.5 billion; foreign exchange, &#x20AC;3 billion; and then we have some model changes, approximately a little over &#x20AC;10 billion. So that's the negative number. And then we have others, and that is risk migration divestment, minus &#x20AC;6 billion, so that gives you sort of the complete mix.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just on the model changes, how comfortably you &#x2013; that those are captured within the 70 basis points transition to Basel III that you've got, or that you've just given?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you talk about the 70 basis point Basel III, so conversion from Basel II to Basel III, we initially guided 70 basis points. And again there, the thing you have to realize as well is revaluation reserve, a negative revaluation reserve. That will have an effect on that. So that makes that 70 basis point deduction a bit more than it was in the past. And again, that is a little bit the sort of the moving part. And there's a few other ones, but this is a bit &#x2013; the bigger moving part there which plays a role. But that is not yet in the capital numbers under Basel II, but under Basel III, that will be the case.</p>

          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I've got two questions. First of all, could you give a bit more details on your expense guidance for the Bank? And when you say low single-digit increase, is it over staff and other costs, or is it over total expenses which included about &#x20AC;40 million in property development impairments in 2010? So if you take those out, the underlying guidance would be significantly higher than low single digits?</p>

          <p>Yes, in respect of the cost increase, the low single digit is operation expenses. So it excludes &#x2013; we're not assuming there's any marketing impacts in there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Yes. On the DAC and trail commissions, this is a bit of a funny number, but because the amortization patterns on DAC, in particular, vary between whether it's an investment type of product versus whether it's a traditional insurance type of product. But in broad terms, what you're seeing is that the DAC and the trail commissions are up in &#x2013; again, in broad terms, relative to the amount of operating income that we're getting in.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from William Elderkin. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. It's William Elderkin from Soc Gen. I've got three questions, please. First of all, is the Insurance company capital structure where you want it be on a standalone basis, both in respect to the mix of debt and equity and also in terms of overall capita or adequacy from a commercial perspective?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of your comments on the Latin American Insurance business, can I take it that you've had sort of material expressions in interests from trade buyers and so on? And that could be a route that we see you going down?</p>
          <p>And then finally, in terms of the payments &#x2013; repayments of the government capital, would it be fair to see that process as delinked and separate from the sale and divestments of the Insurance operations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think, importantly, on the Insurance company capital structure, as we go for two IPOs, remember the way that we portray the financial leverage is really held at a Group level. So we know that we will need to do some restructuring between a holding company in the United States for U.S. IPO and a holding company for Asia and Eurasian IPO. I think from a commercial standpoint, the most important companies where capital really matters with respect to rating agencies and so on, we're well-capitalized and no problem on that extent. But I think there will be some certain capital restructuring in particularly this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then on LatAm, what we have said on LatAm is that we are pursuing other strategic options. That means that in addition to looking at does it fit the IPO in the U.S. or Asia, that we're also looking at other options as well. And you are correct; we have had numerous expressions of interest for this type of business.</p>
          <p>With respect to the repayment of the government, we are looking at that separate from the Insurance IPO. We would like to repay this year a significant amount, if we could, if we can make an agreement with the Dutch government. And then I believe that the IPO, the work that needs to be done, and the preparation that we need, plus the timing, that it will be much better to look for an IPO, or either two of them, some time next year more so than this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Holmes [Nomura]. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello there. A couple of questions, please, on the U.S. Variable Annuity Block. First one is, can you tell us what the confidence level above 50% is? You say that it's significant, but just wondered what it is. And then also, why don't you take it to the 90% confidence level, which is, I think, the level that you apply for the rest of your reserves? And then also, if you were to do that, what would it cost?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just sort of a general question; what sort of appetite are you seeing for the low-cost Variable Annuities that you're starting to sell? I mean, is it a product basically that you think is going to be successful? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So in respect of the reserve adequacy level, let's think about it in terms of where we will be as of January 1, right. So there's &#x2013; we have a number as of December 31, but we also make our equity adjustments as of the 1st of January. So as of the 1st of January, it would put us about &#x20AC;1.1 billion over the 50th percentile level, and I think it works out to be about 73%, something like that, on a confidence level basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, why don't we go to 90%? Because I think as we disclosed last time, we really want to run the U.S. business as the U.S. business, and that 90 percentile just simply does not exist in a U.S. GAAP or U.S. competitor situation. So we don't disclose the number and we don't intend to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the appetite for low-cost VA. I would say right now, it's very limited.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you see that changing? I mean, do you see consumer demand for these lower-cost Variable Annuities becoming greater? And is your product approach actually starting to work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Potentially, but I think right now, other competitors in the U.S. have continued with the more traditional rich-featured, high-commissioned products, and those sort of overtake the low-cost of versions that we're attempting to sell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that doesn't bother you? Your thrust really isn't predicated upon VA expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not material at all. Because we would intend to grow the U.S. business really largely based on the Retirement Services business, where we have a terrific franchise, and also the Life Insurance business is fantastic. So those would be the two cores where we would expect to grow there.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael van Wegen. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Mike van Wegen for Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Three questions, please. First of all, on the capital position within the Insurance business, can you update us on your AFR/EC ratio for the end of 2010?</p>
          <p>And secondly, can you just confirm that there &#x2013; whether there has been any capital being injected in the U.S. business?</p>
          <p>And finally, going back to the cost management within the Bank, could you indicate to us what has been the impact from, let's say, restructuring within the Bank P&amp;L? So without &#x2013; not the special items? And how much of the cost savings that you have been targeting are realized today and how much is still to come? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the AFR/EC information. So what we will do &#x2013; we didn't have it in any of the disclosure that we've done for this earnings release, but we will publish AFR and EC figures in our annual accounts. But just to give a bit of preview of those figures, we will give the numbers separately for the Eurasia businesses, including Latin America and the U.S. So the AFR/EC numbers I'm about to give are for the total Insurance businesses, excluding the U.S.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we will run the U.S. as a U.S. Insurance company and more focus on RBC ratios, which is traditional for the U.S. So, for AFR/EC for non-U.S. businesses, we have a total AFR of &#x20AC;19.7 billion and an EC of &#x20AC;10.4 billion. But what we will intend to do is we will increase the EC by about &#x20AC;1.5 billion in order to bring us more into line with where we think that Solvency II is going.</p>
          <p>Similarly, on the AFR number, we changed that from a 99 or that &#x2013; I'm sorry, the EC number, we changed from a 99.95 percentile confidence level to a 99.5% confidence level. Again, this is more to align ourselves with Solvency II. When you work the math out for those businesses, excluding the U.S., you come to an AFR/EC number of 166%. But there'll be more disclosure on that in the annual accounts.</p>
          <p>For the U.S. businesses, again, we tend to manage that on an RBC basis. We've seen, on a preliminary basis, some increases in the RBC ratio up to about 432%, and if there were any capital movements, they were de minimis in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, could you repeat the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the cost basis for the Bank, could you update us or help clarify to what extent the operating expenses in 2010 will be impacted by restructuring charges in that line rather than in special items?</p>
          <p>And secondly, how much of your targeted cost savings have already been achieved, and therefore in the 2010 numbers, and how much can we see going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect of restructuring charges of special items, we will have special items in &#x2013; coming forward in 2011. The biggest components there are likely to include the separation costs that Jan alluded to earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. They're outside the Bank P&amp;L? They're in the special item? I mean, outside the special items, are there any restructuring charges booked within the Bank for 2010 which will disappear? And how much of the cost savings that you target have already been achieved today and how much do you expect going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's an element &#x2013; there is a number of one-off special restructuring charges in special items in 2010 which will not necessarily recur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the question is what we did we realize already? Is that your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. How much of your cost savings that you target have you achieved so far and how much you expect going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think we have realized about 2% of what we &#x2013; a 2% reduction in our cost numbers relate to reduction of costs that we have included in the 2010. And we still have plans for further cost reductions. I don't think we have ever disclosed exactly what these plans are, but there still are significant opportunities in IT, in purchasing, and still in a number of other areas where we can significantly reduce our costs. So our plans are there, but I don't think we have officially mentioned them so far what they are. But you can be assured we are still working on a number of them.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Jan Willem Weidema, ABN AMRO. I have a question on the comment you just made on economic capital, the increase of &#x20AC;1.5 billion at the insurer. How are you going to realize that? And that's related to the remaining hybrids in ING Insurance? And do you expect more conversion there? That is the first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, can you say anything about the longevity impact on the Dutch Insurance operations? And finally, how comfortable are you with the 5% CAGR for the Bank's underlying income, given that you guide for similar 5% volume growth but lower interest margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think that the transaction has already been done in the &#x2013; in December. So it's accomplished and reflected in the balance sheet that you see. Not on that one, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And do you expect more to come there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Sorry, I apologize; I missed your question on longevity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Could you comment on what the impact of the updated life expectancy is &#x2013; has been on your Insurance results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So there's no P&amp;L impact. It does have an impact on the test of reserve adequacy, but that's already baked into our &#x2013; it was baked into our capital planning for the year. So it has no P&amp;L impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What has been the impact on shareholders' equity then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No impact on shareholders' equity either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If you talk about the 5% CAGR, so that is the underlying volume growth, I mean, given the fact that we guide that the margins will stay approximately where they are right now, I mean, then the question is, by definition, that you expect a bit &#x2013; a positive number on your underlying income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, let me just look at the slides. Because on Slide Five, you said you target &#x2013; still target a CAGR of 5% in your underlying income, but if you expect volumes to be up and you expect some pressure on your net interest margin, can you guide us through how you expect to still come to the 5% CAGR and underlying income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's another element there what you need to take into consideration; that's your commission income as well. And I think overall, what we have given with that long &#x2013; it's the long-term guidance there, where we say we have that volume increase. And please note that when we two years ago gave that long-term guidance, well, then our net interest margin was even lower than it was right now, because we are still at this north of 140 basis points. And I think what we just mentioned as well is that our total interest margin is still something which we feel like &#x2013; it can stay at these levels where it is right now, approximately. We have some further balance sheet optimization what we can still do, so that is to try to compress that further with lower income type of business. And we have our Fee business, so we feel comfortable with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Hans Pluijgers. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning gentlemen. Two questions, if I may. You would have given some update or indication on the U.S business in respect to Solvency II to bring it in line; that's why you've taken some measures. Could you give some indication, what do you expect to the impact for Solvency II on the capital base for the other Insurance operations? So the Eurasia, LatAm operations.</p>
          <p>And secondly, more detailed question; there were some model changes in the loan loss provisions, and it had some impact. You gave some number of the &#x20AC;21 million for the U.S. Could you give an indication, what's the impacts on the model change in the Dutch and German mortgage book on the loan loss provisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe on the first one, on the &#x2013; if I understand your question well, it's alignment of U.S. with Solvency II, but we're not doing that. We're actually trying to align it more with the U.S.-based principles. So that's a bit &#x2013; take that one off the table. And that'll be in line with our risk disclosure and so on in the annual accounts. So we don't really consider the U.S. to be a part of Solvency II going forward. With respect to Solvency II impact on the Eurasian businesses, we're satisfied with our QIS 5 results, but we're not disclosing any specific information on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and I think if you look at the loan losses, I mean, there were a few elements indeed. If you look at the U.S., it is more the interest accrual on modified loans which are part of the interest rate line, rather than a deduction from your loan losses. And then you're talking about it's somewhere in the &#x2013; it's a one-off correction or something like &#x20AC;15 million. And if you talk about the German, and in the Dutch portfolio, where we updated our loss given default with some of the experiences, then you are also talking about low-teens type of numbers, or &#x20AC;20 million. So it is &#x2013; net-net, I think, it is a bit more another illustration that you have to update your models from time to time, but if you correct for these, then you still see an underlying trend, which is actually slightly moving down.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Couple of questions, please. Relating more to Slide 28 in the presentation, you were talking about reducing debt leverage or debt within the Insurance business going forward for rating agency purposes. And yet, I see the core debt figure at 1st of January is up to &#x20AC;7 billion versus, I think was around &#x20AC;3 billion on the same slide you posted last year.</p>
          <p>Secondly, could you explain or give a bit more color, please, about the book value increases for Asia Pacific and Benelux over the same period?</p>
          <p>And then finally, just on legal restructuring, your group structure, maybe at a very high level, seems to be well set up for the sort of two IPO and, separate maybe, LatAm disposal already. So could you just give some flavor about what legal restructuring needs to be done and when you'd give the full detail of that as well, please? Thank you.</p>

          <p>I'm just looking at Insurance, ING Insurance section of that presentation; the debt is at &#x20AC;7 billion versus &#x20AC;3 billion on the disclosure at 31st December '09.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I take this one. Going forward, we look at the total amount of financial average in the Insurance companies and we see that our definition of core debt had some shortcoming. So what we do is we more align with the way the rating agencies are looking at our total financial leverage. So this is information that you can get right off the balance sheet, basically. The core debt involves quite a lot of calculation. So this was &#x2013; this is, I think, a better figure to use. Going forward on the capital structure, I think the increases that you saw in the Benelux, in particular for IFRS equity, largely related to declines in interest rates over the period. And I think you can say about the same thing for Asia-Pacific.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I'm Lemer Salah  from SNS Securities. I have two questions left. My first question regards the IPO. You have mentioned previously that you need like eight months for conducting an IPO. Why are you planning to &#x2013; still planning to conduct your IPO in 2012? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>My second question regards the Eastern Europe issues. As you have noticed, there are a lot of stuff going on like banks imposing bank taxes and centralization of pension and asset managements, towards the government. What are the success ratio or chances of ING in Eastern Europe? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With respect to the IPO, if the markets would be very attractive in 2011 and if we can accelerate our program, we would certainly take a look at doing it in 2011. But I've given you a more likely scenario. With all the things that we have to do, it is more likely that it will happen in 2012. And that's why I think by doing the Dutch government first, or ideally to do most of that first, we also create additional flexibility in the way that we can execute the IPOs.</p>
          <p>With respect to Eastern Europe, Matt, is that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I apologize. I missed the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can repeat the question for you. What are the chances of ING in Eastern Europe, taking into account that bank taxes are imposed in Eastern Europe, for example Hungary, Poland, and going forward, that other countries will conduct similar actions? And also their centralization of pension wealth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It may be a tale of two cities here. I think clearly, we're facing challenges in the regulatory environment in Hungary and Poland, but by the same token, the question is to what extent will normal people want more access to more private pension funds? So a bit, we lose out on the mandatory side, but there is at least a glimmer of hope that we could capitalize on the opportunity for more private funds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, maybe to add on the bank side, if you follow our Eastern European activities there, in essence what we are doing is collecting savings, supplying mortgages and supplying money to the economy. We're not into a very speculative or financial market type of business over there. So somewhere, we feel that despite the fact that you get an occasional bank tax, that it does not change your structural plans to move forward in these markets. So no, we are still quite positive about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Federico Salerno. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Two things on the Insurance side. A, I was wondering if you plan to carry out re-risking of the Insurance balance sheet in the coming months?</p>
          <p>And number two, can you give us the sensitivity of the Variable Annuity book to equity markets like you used to previously? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the first one, I think what you've seen in the overall Insurance book is the increase in the investment margin that we have is partly due to some moderate re-risking. We really want to take this slowly. You saw that we've made some good progress from the overall investment margin, moving from 83 basis points to 93. Our overall target by 2013 is 105. So in this one, I think we want to do this in very much of a moderated approach.</p>
          <p>With respect to earning sensitivities on the VA business, I think what you're going to see is basically not a lot of impact relative to equity market movements within a band of about plus-or-minus 5%. What you will see though is that as you get into more extremes, and let's say plus or minus 10%, you'll see probably like a negative &#x20AC;50 billion sort of sensitivity around that number.</p>
          <p>The reason on the &#x2013; when equity markets go up, we still have some hedge asymmetry; when equity markets go down, we lose out on fees. So what you'll see is within that, within a 5% range, not a lot of impact; once you get out into the extremes, let's say about &#x20AC;50 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Tony Silverman. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. It's Tony Silverman from Standard and Poor's Equity Research. Just had a couple of questions left, please. In general terms, the IPOs that you're contemplating, do you contemplate for the Insurance IPOs that they will, in effect, be a complete sale? Or do you contemplate being left with some stake? If so, perhaps you could elaborate on that.</p>
          <p>And in connection with that, in answer to an earlier question, you mentioned that there may be some further capital restructuring for the Insurance companies in Asia and the U.S. Can you sort of tell us whether that would involve less than &#x20AC;5 billion going into them? Or would it be an immaterial amount anyway?</p>
          <p>And the second question was around the Closed Block again. The markets and other impacts, the narrative, I think, that's on Page 34 of the report, refers to a &#x20AC;150 million charge to do with interest rates going up in Q4. I wonder if you could talk a bit about that. You've mentioned the sensitivity to equities in a previous question, but the charge for interest rates going up for &#x2013; in respect of guarantees seems to be slightly counterintuitive to me. I'd be interested to hear more. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me do the first one that has the question related to the IPO. Well, we &#x2013; let's first take a look what the markets are at the time that we do the IPO, and then we can decide what exactly our strategy will be. At the end, I think, we want to have a 100% sale, but most of the time, you don't do that in an IPO; you have a more moderate position that you sell first, let's say 25% to 40%, and then later you come back with additional tranches. But let's wait until we know exactly what it is, where we are, and what markets we are in before we make any predictions here.</p>
          <p>The second question will be answered by Matt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first on the capital structure, we're not really anticipating any injection of capital into these companies; it's more a restructuring of debt and hybrids. And that'll begin to take place over the first half of the year. But it mainly has to do with rejiggering a bit debt and hybrids in a U.S. holding company versus a Eurasian holding company. So that's really what we intend to do.</p>
          <p>With respect to the &#x20AC;150 million number that you see on page 34 of our quarterly report, it doesn't relate to the VA Closed book; it relates to a certain business. It's basically Separate Account Pension business within the Netherlands where we have an imperfect hedge on. And what you see with this thing is when there are &#x2013; the hedge works within a reasonably narrow band of interest rates and equity movements. But when you have big &#x2013; particularly big increases in interest rates, then you start to see this volatility come through. You've actually seen it in prior quarters, and it's described a bit better when you get into the Benelux section. So if you &#x2013; we know that this number is quite volatile, but if you look at that figure over the course of the year, it ended up being, I think, positive &#x20AC;25 million. But there is some volatility in that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much. Can you just come back on the restructuring of debt and hybrids that you mentioned? Is that basically substituting equity for those debt and hybrids, or something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's just &#x2013; again, where we have &#x2013; we're holding certain instruments within the U.S. holding company; we're holding certain instruments within ING Verzekeringen, which is the holding company for overall Insurance. And there probably needs to be some movement between the two, but we're not talking about additional capital or anything of that nature.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think we need to be a little careful here, because we have not done a complete evaluation analysis yet. And I think we will be extremely cautious and careful in how that will be accomplished. So this is still work to be done, still work to come. We'll &#x2013; can we put it better? I think when we get closer to that, than we can at this moment.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Manish Bakhda from Citigroup. My question is just on CoCos. And I noticed that back in December, there were some comments from ING suggesting that you were looking at developments in the CoCos market. Just wanted to know if you had any updates on that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Manish, we are always looking, but we are certainly very carefully looking at &#x2013; I recognize CoCos, I recognize high coupons of 9.5% which you see in the market as well, but you do want to be sure, like what is it that you get from this. So it's a market which we are following, but at the same time, there's no concrete plans yet that we start to issue something like it.</p>
          <p>I mean, you want some more clarification on regulation, you want some more clarification on where does it help you in terms of buffers, and at the same time, we still have the old grandfathering of the old hybrid. So we are not in a hurry to do something there. But of course, if there is a new market, there is new opportunity. So from that angle, we will certainly look at this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I &#x2013; I'm just coming back because I think one of my last questions actually wasn't &#x2013; I was cut off before you could answer it. It's about the legal restructuring you're talking about. Again, your Group structure seems to be pretty well set up already for the disposals that you've been talking about. Could you just give us some color about what you're actually going to be doing there in terms of restructuring it, and when we'll get the concrete decisions around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's very simple. What we plan to do is we need to make sure that if we take the U.S. operations and want to go public with them, that we have properly structured it under our legal structure. And that is the main thing that I think we need to be doing at this moment as part of our redesign of doing two IPOs. That is the main, let's say, legal issue that is there. For the Latin American business, whatever we do, we can either put it with the U.S. or we can put it with Europe or we can, let's say, have other options. It's already positioned to do that. So there will not be too much work on that side.</p>

          <p>Hi, there. Thanks for taking a follow-up question. I just wanted to ask about your capacity to repay the Dutch government this year from internal resources, leaving aside the question of the amount of penalty you may or may not have to pay. Can you comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really that much. I can only say that we have an intention to repay at least a significant amount. We also need to be mindful of the higher requirements of Basel III. We need to be mindful of &#x2013; there are other things still happening in the world. And of course, we are generating income, and all that together, I think, will determine at some point how much we have available from internally generated activities.</p>
          <p>Plus, we are maybe still planning to do some transactions in the meantime as well, some sales, divestments, that can also generate capital and funds. So all that together will determine to what extent we have the ability to pay back and the amount we can pay back. But everything is taken into account. The one thing we are not counting on and we are not &#x2013; and excluding, is that we will go back to the market for more capital. We don't want to do that. We want to do it with internally generated funds.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, everyone, a follow-up question following also what Farooq just asked. What kind of Core Tier 1 level will you be looking for in the Bank after you've repaid the state? Is it the 7.5% which is sort of the old guidance, or will you be looking more towards 8% or higher with a view to Basel III?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have already answered that earlier. I think Koos answered that we would not like to see it go down below the 8% level, and we need to be comfortable as well. So this is a moving number. Over time, it might even go higher than that. We don't know yet. There's still too many issues we need to determine, but it's higher than the 7.5% and certainly higher than 8%.</p>
