          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Petr&#xF3;leo Conference Call to discuss the Second Quarter 2010 Results. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>Today, with us, we have Mr. Almir Guilherme Barbassa, Petr&#xF3;leo' CFO and Investor Relations Officer, and his staff. At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Theodore Helms, Investor Relations Executive Manager of Petr&#xF3;leo, who has some additional comments.</p>
          <p>Please go ahead, Mr. Theodore.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference call to discuss second quarter 2010 results. We have a simultaneous webcast on the Internet that could be accessed at the site, www.Petr&#xF3;leo.com.br/ri/english.</p>
          <p>Before proceeding I would like to draw your attention to the slide two. We may make forward-looking statements which are identified by use of the words, will, expect and similar that are based on the beliefs and assumptions that Petr&#xF3;leo management and our information currently available to the Company.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me mention that this conference call will discuss Petr&#xF3;leo' results prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS, and Brazilian legislation. At this moment, we are unable to discuss any issues relating to U.S. GAAP results.</p>
          <p>I also have to inform you that unfortunately our CFO, Almir Barbassa, is stuck in transit between Brasilia and Rio, and will not be able to join us on the call. So what we have done, of course, is I will go through our results, and then of course for the Q&amp;A, we have a very well-qualified staff people from accounting and from each of the segments.</p>
          <p>I should also add that this call may not be as interesting as some would like, because we cannot make any update whatsoever on the capitalization, except to reiterate that we continue to work towards a transaction in September. We are fully confident that we will be able to do so. And I refer you to all our previous communications on the topic which may be found on our website.</p>
          <p>This quarter's financial results were characterized by stable domestic realization prices, stable oil export prices and a stable exchange rate. Operating expenses were relatively flat, and there were fewer extraordinary items. Production of oil and gas was up 2%. And as a result of these factors, our second quarter earnings and cash flow showed a modest, but solid improvement. As compared to the prior quarter, net income and EBITDA increased 7% and 6%, respectively.</p>
          <p>Highlights for the last three months include additional discoveries in the pre-salt of the Campos Basin, totaling some 500 million barrels of oil, and the startup of FPSO Capixaba, which is producing oil from both the pre and post-salt layers in the Espirito Santo. In June, we released our 2010-2014 business plan, in which we project total investment spending of 224 billion.</p>
          <p>Finally, since our last conference call, we have held two extraordinary general assemblies. The first assembly approved an increase in capital and authorized our Board to take the necessary steps to execute the capital increase. And the second approval was for the method for evaluating the utilization of Brazilian Treasury Notes in the capitalization. Both these measures were widely supported by the minority shareholders of the ON shares.</p>
          <p>On the next slide you'll see that in the first semester of this year, total oil and gas production was 2,568,000 BOE per day, up 3% year-over-year. Brazilian oil production was up 2% despite the shut-in of 85,000 BOE of daily gas capacity due to limited domestic demand. Production from Nigeria and new systems in Brazil accounted for the growth. In April, we set a monthly record for Brazilian oil of 2,033,000 barrels per day and a single day record of 2,084,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>The next slide is a review of units that have or will be installed in 2010 and 2011. As you can see, our units installed in 2010 had been ramping up. Production from FPSO Capixaba, which is fully owned by Petr&#xF3;leo, will make the greatest contribution to production growth for the remainder of the year. Still to come in 2010 and 2011 are another 380,000 barrels per day of capacity now under development.</p>
          <p>The next unit to begin production will be the FPSO Cidade de Angra dos Reis, better known as the Tupi Pilot. The FPSO has left the Chinese shipyard where it was converted and it is currently on its way to Brazil.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to highlight that this year we will be installing two major non-associated gas platforms this year in Mexilh&#xE3;o and Urugu&#xE1;-Tamba&#xFA;. Their combined capacity of 25 million cubic meters per day will increase existing Brazilian gas production capacity by more than 50%.</p>
          <p>In the next slide, you'll see that in the pre-salt, we continue with activities we previously announced and results continue to meet or exceed our expectations. As mentioned earlier, we began pre-salt production in the Whales Park in Esp&#xED;rito Santo with the start-up of FPSO Cap&#xED;xaba. And first oil from the Tupi Pilot is expected later this year.</p>
          <p>Right now six new wells are being drilled; six new wells are still to be drilled in 2010, which would bring to 16 the total wells this year. Three new rigs that have been previously contracted years ago are expected to arrive this year in addition to the 10 that are already in operation. We have contracted for the third pilot FPSO and have signed letters of intent for the 8 replicant hulls that will be the first definitive systems in the Santos Basin. Finally, we expect to declare commerciality for Tupi before year end, which will allow us to start booking reserves in the area.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, let me turn now to volumes and prices, which really are the key determinants of our results. As one can see from the graph on the left, the average price of Brent and for our own oil was virtually flat quarter-to-quarter.</p>
          <p>From the gas on the right, one can see that the average realization price for products continues to be essentially unchanged during the past year. You can also see that the difference between our average realization price and the international price continues to converge; although we still benefit from higher refining margins in Brazil as has been the case since November of 2008.</p>
          <p>In the next slide, you'll see that lifting cost remained stable despite the increase in our oil price of $20 per barrel in the past year. Lifting cost increased by only $1 even this smaller increase is largely attributed &#x2013; explained by the strengthening of the real against the dollar. As you can see when expressed in reais, lifting costs have been flat year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Next slide, you will see about our sales volumes and accelerating Brazilian GDP growth is reflected in higher product sales, diesel has increased in line with GDP growth and an exceptional higher risk.</p>
          <p>Jet fuel is up 15% as a result of increased air traffic within Brazil. Gasoline consumption increased 19% year-over-year as the higher price of sugar reduced ethanol supply shifting the flex fuel fleet to consume more gasoline, this effect was most noticeable on the first quarter but also impacted gasoline sales in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Natural gas consumption by the industrial sector has recovered in line with the GDP and with the start of the dry season there has been an increase in demand for gas-fired thermoelectric generation.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you will see that net exports decreased year-over-year as the recovery in domestic demand in Brazil has exceeded production growth. During the first half of 2010 planned refinery shutdowns lead to higher export volumes and lower import volumes of crude oil.</p>
          <p>The decline in refinery output and the growing demand for diesel, gasoline, jet fuel and LPG was met by increasing imports. Year-over-year our trade balances swung despite the lower net volumes as the differential between light and heavy crude oil and the crack spreads between the products we export and the products we import have diminished.</p>
          <p>If you see on the next slide, turning to financial results, as we mentioned earlier, the quarter was characterized by the absent volatility. Average realization price, the market value of Brazilian crude and the real-dollar exchange rate, each increased by only 1% from the prior quarter. Net revenues were higher principally because of growing demand in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Revenue increase from the sales was largely offset by the cost of imported products that still added to our gross income. Operating expenses declined by 8% due to lower provisioning than in the prior quarter. The combined result of these factors led to an increase in operating income of 6% from the prior quarter, EBITDA of R$16 billion or 6% higher than the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Next slide, you'll see that the stability of exchange rate substantially reduced fluctuations in financial expense, minority interest and equity participation. Thus, the increase in net income of 7% was driven almost exclusively by the higher operating income.</p>
          <p>On the next slide a quick review of Brazilian E&amp;P. Production increased 2%, while the value of its oil increased 1%. Lifting costs were stable, and there were no extraordinary items that reduced income in the first quarter. Because some of the production of E&amp;P was held in inventory, it shows a negative effect on the volume effect on revenues, but that was because of inventory accumulation within E&amp;P, but actually the &#x2013; say production did increase. The result of all this was a 5% gain in operating income.</p>
          <p>The next slide, operating income for our Brazilian downstream segment was reduced as realization prices in Brazil moved closer to the international levels, which reduced our refining margins. Also, and this is important to really emphasize, is that our margin was reduced by the narrowing of the light/heavy differential. Really historically the differential now of 3 to $4 is quite low. And we have a complex refinery system growing in complexity that is much less profitable when we have such a small differential between the two. Now this hurts our refining segment earnings, even as it improves the margins for our domestic E&amp;P.</p>
          <p>Finally, the quarter &#x2013; the first quarter benefited from a lower cost of inventory due to stocks acquired at year-end 2009. And this was not repeated in the second quarter, which also brought down the quarter-over-quarter results.</p>
          <p>Revenues increased largely because of growing demand, but this was offset largely by higher imports, leading to a small but positive operating margin. And operating expenses increased primarily due to higher freight and sales costs related to the increased volumes.</p>
          <p>On the next slide you see that our remaining businesses segments continue contributing positively to earnings. Gas and power continues to grow primarily due to higher sales volumes in natural gas and electricity generation partially offset by higher acquisition cost.</p>
          <p>The international segments earnings increased, primarily because of higher prices during the period. The period results are characterized by the absence of impairments, interestingly first oil from Cascade and Chinook is still scheduled for later this year with the first two development wells already drilled and therefore not affected by the current moratorium. Our current distribution segment continues to generate reliable earnings and margins, although this quarter was characterized by an extraordinary tax provision of R$110 million.</p>
          <p>The next slide, you'll see that capital spending increased to R$38 billion during the first half of 2010, a 17% increase from the same period a year earlier, most of the increase was concentrated in refining, spending for upgrades and spending for regulatory requirements accelerate and the construction of the Abreu e Lima refinery in Pernambuco has begun.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we also completed the 2.5 billion acquisition of a minority stake in Braskem, essentially completing our consolidation of the petrochemical sector. Investments in Plang&#xE1;s infrastructure, health, safety environment, maintenance and other explained the remaining 25%.</p>
          <p>This growing demand in Brazil underlines the importance of increasing our refining capacity, as well as configuring our existing refineries to process Brazilian crudes for market demand. By doing so over time, we can substantially improve our margins when compared to meeting &#x2013; to importing products to meet demand.</p>
          <p>The next slide, as a result of our increased capital spending, net debt to net book capital increased to 34% while net debt to EBITDA annualized was 1.52 times. Both these ratios are within the financial target set by our Board at 25 to 35% net debt to net book cap and 2.5 times EBITDA.</p>
          <p>I think it's important because there is a lot of talk in the press and among analysts about our rating and our net debt to net book cap. I think it's important to mention that we've continuous dialog with each of the three rating agencies who rate our debt; all of them are comfortable with our financial strategy and recognize our long-term commitment to maintaining an investment grade rating. Each of them has a stable outlook on our rating. The 35% net debt to net book cap is a ceiling we impose upon ourselves to keep our balance sheet strong as a measure of prudent financial management; exceeding that ratio on a short-term basis will not trigger a lower rating, since we first received our base investment grade, baseline investment grade rating some 10 years ago.</p>
          <p>Our net debt to net book cap has been as high as 54% and as low as 15%. So both Petr&#xF3;leo and the rating agencies maintained a long-term outlook regarding our capital structure and fully recognized our commitment to investment grade ratio and also have a whole number of factors when they look and when they determine our rating and it's not simply this net debt to net book cap which sometimes I think receives too much attention.</p>
          <p>Finally, turning &#x2013; if we look at our cash flow, our operating cash flow during the quarter was R$13.2 billion versus 9.7 billion in the prior quarter. The prior quarter was adversely affected by increases in net working capital as a result of increase in accounts receivable, inventory, credit to suppliers, reductions in short-term tax liabilities.</p>
          <p>Quarterly earnings as reflected in EBITDA has been much more constant even as Brent price and the exchange rate fluctuated during the year. As you'll see actually in the second quarter of '09, EBITDA was higher but much of that is explainable by the higher exchange rate when you see we have not disclosed EBITDA and U.S. GAAP for the second quarter of 2010, but if you will look at the comparison between 2Q '09 and 1Q '010, you'll see that the numbers are actually quite constant when expressed in dollars.</p>
          <p>And despite the increase in CapEx and the payment of dividends in this quarter, we've maintained our comfortable liquidity position with R$24 billion in cash and equivalent at quarter end, due to the increase in net long-term borrowings.</p>
          <p>With that overview, our team here assembled in Brazil will be happy to answer any questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The floor is now open for questions from investors and analysts. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ted. Just a follow-up question on the refining spending. I think you mentioned you had started spending on the Abreu e Lima refinery. What is the timing of developing a cost estimate and starting spending on &#x2013; I think you call it Premium I and Premium II &#x2013; the additional 900,000 barrels a day of refining capacity you'd mentioned in your business plan? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I guess, as &#x2013; because we're monitoring on behalf of Almir, what I'm going to do is just pass these questions immediately to our relevant segments. So, <mark type="inaudible" /> Roberto, would you like to respond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We are spending a little bit high with that money in Abreu e Lima refinery. That's because we are on the construction phase. We are in this at the beginning. And this is the main reason why we spend more money this year in comparison with the last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, just to try to clarify a bit more, I think, most &#x2013; if you'll see, most of the new refinery spend is related to Abreu e Lima relatively little to compares and virtually nothing in the Premium I or II.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know and again we don't typically go beyond this year. Anything else &#x2013; I don't know, Arjun, if that answers your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I guess, you have a five-year plan, which includes the building of Premium I and Premium II, and so I was wondering the cost estimates for the Abreu e Lima refinery are quite high, presumably the natural refinery in part benefit from that infrastructure, so really just curious when the timeframe would be when you can give a cost estimate for the next round of refining spending, and when you plan on actually starting with that construction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really, the Premium I or II are really happening, especially Premium I, really, Premium II is not really within the next five years. And so what you'd say is that Premium I spending really only happens in starts beginning, assuming the project is approved in 2013, '014 and I think we're still, correct me if I'm wrong, Roberto, at a stage where saying, any &#x2013; it's still in very development phase and saying anything about cost and prices would just be a pure guess. We're just not even &#x2013; haven't even &#x2013; we're not close to being there yet. Is that correct, Roberto?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Ricardo Cavanagh from Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. This is Ricardo Cavanagh. I have two questions. Hi, Ted. The first one being, how do you perceive or how advanced are the 35 firms, if you can comment on that on the works on the area that would be subject to a transfer of rights? I understand that they would be having some &#x2013; the works concluded some time in August, if that would still be the case?</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding the supply unit. Looking onto the third quarter the dynamics that have explained the low margins in the second quarter will still be there or there is room to perceive that they could improve? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ricardo, just to clarify, the first question is about the transfer rights to <mark type="inaudible" /> and when that evaluation will be completed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, not the valuation, but the works on the certifying firms &#x2013; when &#x2013; just before they say, okay, here are the works and then the government of Petr&#xF3;leo will be negotiating on a value. But when those &#x2013; will those works -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think the best way to answer this question is to say that we are still fully committed to doing a transaction in September, and we must disclose the valuation and how that evaluation was reached before we start the capitalization. But saying more than that is just &#x2013; I wouldn't &#x2013; I just don't want to. Then the second question really is, Roberto, given where operating earnings were in the second quarter in the downstream segment, what &#x2013; well, how could &#x2013; I know you don't make projections, but any comments about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, we always expect better margin, but you know, the crude oil prices keeps fluctuating a lot, and it is difficult for us to see to guarantee or to have even &#x2013; how can I say &#x2013; a helpful idea about our margins. Of course, it gives the performance of downstream area, it depends on light/heavy spread and Brent price. Okay. We expect that we have larger light/heavy spread and better Brent price from the second &#x2013; on the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe your point is simply to emphasize that this unusually low light/heavy differential is difficult for our downstream segment. And you can see that in the second quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Ted, the two refineries that are currently under construction, can you tell us again what is the cost estimate, and which one in the startup time, and see if there is any changes from previously what you disclosed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Roberto, so cost estimate, I think we have in the past put out a number is that correct &#x2013; publicly I think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, one, I think they was talking about 12 billion, one is 9 billion. I just wanted to see if that had been changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the best of my recollection, and I might have read in the press &#x2013; I don't know if we ever had an official number, but anyway, but I don't think we have any &#x2013; we haven't made ourselves any disclosure or certainly any change or &#x2013; to the start up. Do we have the dates, Roberto, these dates on startups of either Comperj or refineries in the Northeast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're expanding our investments. We're expand our investment money mainly in conversion units inside of the existing refineries and quality, to improve the color quality, 83 millimeters, and to expand our capacity. Also, we have Northeast refinery. We have a Comperj also. And this is &#x2013; we can say that this is our most important expenditure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But again, for this year, I think, it's largely &#x2013; the expansion is largely refinery in the Abreu e Lima than the refinery in the Northeast and really it's next year when Comperj.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Ted. Hello, everybody. I have a couple of questions regarding the intended acquisition of rights to develop the Franca field. And one is if you could clarify for us, just I assume &#x2013; let's assume we have the two valuations today, and can you just clarify for us whether they are binding, whether the seller and the buyer should bind by those two appraisals, or whether the seller can set the price unilaterally? That is my first question.</p>
          <p>And the second one is how &#x2013; there were some comments quoting Gabrielli yesterday on Bloomberg as him saying that Petr&#xF3;leo would try to develop the Franca field as soon as possible. I was just wanted to get more specific on what that as soon as possible mean. If you could have &#x2013; what's the earliest first oil scenario? And what is the distance &#x2013; what would be the time between first oil and peak, if you could share that with us? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sergio, I saw in your sort of preliminary report that those are the questions you would ask, and the first thing I was thinking is, gosh, doesn't this guy know that we really can't talk about this? And again, there is a discussion &#x2013; I think that maybe I will answer both questions simultaneously to say that there is a negotiation going on between two parties, in which combined with that are two official certifiers of reservoir engineers, plus our Board that will get a fairness opinion on the transaction.</p>
          <p>So I think all of that, and within Petr&#xF3;leo we understand very well the business of oil and development and what things are worth. And so that process is ongoing, and the only thing and what we know for certain is that when we go to the market you should be able to see in a sense the conclusions that have been reached in that whole process.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon. Two questions; one, just in terms of your production targets and looking out in the future, you give pretty specific indications of the large production units, but my understanding is that there are a lot of smaller projects that are part of that, as well as a fairly important, I think, secondary recovery program. And I was just wondering on the secondary recovery program, if you could just say what &#x2013; give us an update or provide more color on that program, and the effects that you expect or the contributions you expect that to have over the next couple of years, particularly offshore?</p>
          <p>And then just following up on the P-33 there has been some news reports that there may be other platforms that might be involved in this effort. I was just wondering what the risk is there that we get any additional shutdowns? And if you had any quantification on the platforms that are being specifically targeted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, regarding the first question, it is we are working to increase the recovering factor of the fields in several fields &#x2013; mature fields in the Campos Basin that will give us increased production in this period until 2011 and 2013. And I don't have numbers here to present regarding the production from those efforts now for secondary recovery, but it's important program because we have the facilities there already installed. So we are injecting more water, injecting gas and all the secondary recovery methods to increase production and reduce the &#x2013; increase the recovery factor of those areas.</p>
          <p>Regarding the &#x2013; your second question, yeah, we have this shut-in, in the P-33 platform. Now we do maintenance on every two years in the platforms. So we stopped all the platform. It was planned for October, as I mentioned. So we are doing earlier due to this ANP requirement. So all the platforms will have the same stoppage for maintenance, again, which is due. We do all this maintenance; we don't expect any other platforms to stop production, not planned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to confirm that to the best of our knowledge, there is no other platforms where stoppage in the form that P-33 was, we are not expecting that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just follow-up maybe on the first one, is that do you have any kind of average estimate on &#x2013; what &#x2013; how much you can increase the recovery factor from your secondary recovery work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the recovery factor can be increased from say let's 30% to 33, 35%. So it can be a significant increase. It depends on the field; we have to study field by field, but can be a significant increase.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ted. I have two questions; one on ANP, the other one on refining. First one, just wanted to understand, how you guys want us to think about crack spreads that being domestic fuel prices versus Brent. If we look at the five year plan that you guys put out, there is an implicit assumption there that you're going to be able to capture something like $11.5 of crack spreads, which is more or less the number that you guys had in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And in the second quarter, we saw that dropped to $9 more or less, what could be argued to be a R$400 million short &#x2013; $400 million shortfall on your cash generation because of that. Should we think about the company, I would say, enacting more or less a pricing policy to get 11.5 or should we just think about that target as a loose target for now? That would be my first question, just trying to understand how to think about the longer term cash generation potential.</p>
          <p>The second question that I have is a much more simplistic one. With regards to the Golfinho field and looking at the presentation, I saw that Golfinho was producing in the second quarter something like 61,000 barrels a day. And ultimately I was looking back at the data from before Capixaba was removed and the production wasn't really more than 50 back then. What I just wanted to understand is do you guys think that Golfinho can sustainably produce 60,000 for a while or was that just a one-off spurt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You want to answer the first question and I'll do the second one. You can answer second question first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Golfinho, so you are right that in the second quarter, it was 60,000.9 barrels per day. It has a capacity of 100,000, and we believe it will be a sustainable production in this level or higher if we can increase more &#x2013; put more wells on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, and then regarding your first question, Gustavo, as you are making this assumption that we control prices in Brazil. But no, in all seriousness. No, and I will let actually &#x2013; I will let Roberto to see if he confirms or respond further. But I think the way that we, when we do our planning, make assumptions about long-term light-heavy differentials and a whole range of crack spreads based upon the value of our crude and what we think we can extract from that, and given volumes within the Brazilian market, and again, I would say that we think right now that the light-heavy differential is unusually low and it obviously affecting this quarter's earnings. But that doesn't change our long-term thinking, because all of these projects take a long term.</p>
          <p>So, Roberto, do you want to add upon but I guess, the important thing is, no, I don't think we make an assumption that we can charge whatever it takes to generate a return in Brazil to compensate capital, but rather that we think that over time the way spreads will work and crack spreads work in the international markets, which ultimately translate to Brazil, will be adequate to compensate our investment.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just to make a follow-up on that then. Should I think that if you guys operate below that for a while you will be more willing to raise domestic fuel prices, or is it really going to be international oil prices and fuel prices are going to drive us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just clarify, is there a minimum 20 business day CVM review requirement for the offer document, and when would that start? In other words, can you have an offer document without the oil price used known lodged with the CVM?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My understanding is that when we receive final approval from the CVM that that would include the valuation. And that really &#x2013; and Alexandre help me &#x2013; I think right after it is filed we could begin initiate the marketing effort, is that correct? So what you should assume is that when we have the final offering memorandum approved by the CVM that would include the value and that we can then immediately begin marketing. And there will be some marketing period which will give people sufficient time to analyze that value and make a determination whether they want to participate or not.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, really immediately after that we would begin marketing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, exactly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So what you should expect, again, is that &#x2013; I guess that we have not filed a public document yet &#x2013; a document that is made available to you with the CVM yet. And when we do so, it will be the document that we then market, which would include the valuation. Is that correct?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That we know. Yeah. No, I think the way to look at it is just when there will be a public filing with the CVM that it will be available to you. It will include the valuation, but also that would be around the time we begin marketing.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. A quick question. Do you guys expect any impact from this stoppage in the downstream business going forward or the impact is over? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry, the stoppage in what? The downstream business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In downstream business, right, you had some refineries &#x2013; refineries...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Programmed. Do you want to make comments, Roberto, about &#x2013; we don't generally &#x2013; I guess from what I understand is that in the first half of the year when demand is generally weaker is when we do most of our programmed refinery maintenance. But &#x2013; so do you have any other comments Roberto &#x2013; I mean we can disclose when we close down our refineries, but I don't know if you want to say anything more, Roberto?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have four turnaround; RECAP refinery, REPLAN refinery, REDUC and REVAP refinery. It's better to do this on the first semester because the market is a little bit lower than the second. Our market increased a lot at the same time. And to give you an idea, considering diesel imports, we can say that we import, around 35% of our diesel imports comes from market increase and 55% of diesel imports comes from turnaround, okay. That's way, okay, you can balance the impact of turnarounds in our Downstream business on the first semester.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to understand so you cannot provide any view going forward, right, for the next quarter if there would be any impact similar to the first quarter or not? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The market increase &#x2013; in Brazil the market increased on the second semester. We will have other turnarounds, okay, but the most important refinery as always done is REPLAN refinery, okay, on this semester.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ted, just a, two quick ones. One, it seems now in your presentation, the page 13 suggests there is an under lift in your sales volume in second quarter. What is the volume, how many barrels has been under lift? And also at the end of the second quarter, inventory wise that are you balanced or that you are still under lift or over lift?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't know if anybody really asked this question, and I'm not sure if anybody with an accounting or <mark type="inaudible" /> if you know the answer to the question again, we know the production increased by 2%. But we see that the effect on the volume is actually a negative number. So the assumption is that there was some production that wasn't sold. And so, I don't know if you know the number of barrels or you have that or not. No, we'll see if we can come up with that number, but we don't have that number here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then when you email me or call me, can you also let me know at the end of the second quarter, whether we &#x2013; inventory wise that are we balanced or under lift or over lift and by what amount?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll do our best.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second question is that on, based on so far for the last seven months of the production volume, is there any change in your production outlook for 2010 and 2011 for the Brazilian oil production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We really haven't made any change to our target.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from Frank McGann from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe just to switch over to electricity, the results have improved sharply over the last couple of years. And I was just wondering if you could speak to the potential for increasing amounts of contracted energy over the next two to three years or beyond and how you see profitability as a result of that going forward compared to what we're seeing currently and what we've seen in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. I'll leave that question to <mark type="inaudible" />...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Frank. Basically, we have a huge improvement in energy sales because we recomposed our ability to save energy if the &#x2013; what we call, the agreement with the operational system, that, how can I say that. With new gas logistics and new gas supply and GNL, we could prove to the system that we are able to fire the power plants.</p>
          <p>So we have a schedule with the governments that basically six and six months, we'll have more energy capability to sell with the same assets, okay. So that was a huge improvement in the ability to sell, basically in the forms of contracts or sales agreement, okay.</p>
          <p>In the long term, we see that the Brazilian market is going to have increase in energy price and to have tried to position ourselves in order to take advantage of that. So we expect that in the long run our profitability and also revenues in the energy segment is going to improve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So from here we could expect that gradually we would see both a greater percentage of the energy contracted at a higher price. So the profitability &#x2013; the risk of a major decline in profitability in the segment has diminished, and if anything, we could see even greater profitability going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, What we tried to do now is a conscious to move our results in order to being protected from the volatility of the spot price. And how we do that? We have basically three kinds of options to market our energy assets. We have the option of capacity that you say is for the pool of the local distribution companies. We have the direct sales that the Power Share agreements with the big consuming industry. And we can wait and have some kind of opportunities like merchant kind of operating and when we capture a huge difference in the spot price.</p>
          <p>So we try to balance our assets in these three kinds of selling in order to protect ourselves with huge moving of the spot price in the logical situation of the country.</p>
          <p>So what we would expect to see in our results is a kind of smooth and slow-growing of our profitability. And we have tried to &#x2013; we expect not see any kind of volatility in the long run.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the call. I just want &#x2013; clarify one thing for us &#x2013; maybe you can give us some light on this. When we estimate your EBITDA earnings division by division, we notice that for each single then the numbers came out to be slightly lower than what we projected. But still when we do the consolidation final, your consolidated number are consolidated estimate numbers.</p>
          <p>And this is pretty much because I notice that the inter-subsidiary, inter-company transactions or the cost of goods was actually higher this quarter versus the prior maybe four quarters. Any light on how we could see where we are erring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me see if I understand the question is that somehow in the intersegment earnings and maybe then in the overall there is a differential, and certainly the consolidated does come out, but somehow it's the I'm sorry &#x2013; it's the inter-company calculations that are somehow &#x2013; you're not able to predict them. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes, exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am wondering if that is &#x2013; I don't know if we can answer that right now. It sounds to me that is like a question you have got to spend some time sitting over. Maybe we would be happy to do is try to sit and help you understand and reconcile. And if anybody here in accounting at this stage wants to try to make an attempt &#x2013; have a simple solution or not? Anybody? I think there is probably &#x2013; we'll try to put something together and need to put it on the side and give you a call.</p>

          <p>Hello, good afternoon. Just a quick question on the ANP. I understand that the regulator ANP has not approved the development plan presented by Petr&#xF3;leo for the Wales Park, the recent ruling from ANP. Can you give clarity on what is going on there, and what sort of changes they have required in terms of the overall development plan or evolution plan to get it approved? Thank you.</p>
