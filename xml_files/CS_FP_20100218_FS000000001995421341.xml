          <p>Good afternoon to all of you. Thank you for coming to AXA's Presentation on Full Year '09 results. It is a special day for Investor Relation, because today it's the first presentation for my successor Mattieu Rouot. And I guess, consequently the last one for me.</p>
          <p>I will hope you will be more bullish with him than you have been with me. Unlike me, you have to know that Mattieu loves difficult tricky questions, and this at any time.</p>

          <p>More seriously, presenting today will be Henri de Castries, Chairman of the Management Board, Denis Duverne, Member of the Management Board and G&#xE9;rald Harlin, Chief Financial Officer. A Q&amp;A session will as usual follow the presentation. Henri, the floor is yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everybody. I'd like to thank Etienne, in front of you, despite the fact that he has not managed you, managed to convince you to buy the stock. We are now going to see if he is able to sell product to the clients, which is probably as difficult as what he has been doing over the last years.</p>
          <p>More seriously, our earnings, how would I characterize them? I would say, solid earnings after a contrasted year, a contrasted year because it ended better than it started. Not only for the economy, but also for us. Contrasted year, because we have seen as you will see a good resilience in the revenues and the operating earnings, but with some movements in different directions. A solid year because where you look at where we end. We end with solid earnings, a very strong balance sheet and a reasonably confident view into the future.</p>
          <p>Where do we stand? Revenues down 3%, it's coming mainly from the Life and Savings activities and the Asset Management, Property Casualty was still up. If you look at the reasons for which Life and Savings were down, clearly the year has been contrasted because the momentum was way better in the second half, and especially in the last quarter than in the first half.</p>
          <p>I think what we've seen at the heart of the turmoil is a very significant level of risk aversion among our clients who have progressively come back to a higher risk appetite. Another important thing to note nevertheless, is the fact that redemptions have been going down very significantly, which leads to very significant net inflows, despite the fact that revenues are down in Life, cash flows are up. I think it's a sign of the strength of the brand.</p>
          <p>Increased new business value, Denis will comment that in more &#x2013; into more the details, but I think this is also a good sign of the resilience of the Life activities. Underlying earnings, slightly down when compared with last year. Two different movements, one of them which I think is an answer to those of you who were fearful about the intrinsic quality of our Life operations, a very strong rebound in the earnings capacity of the Life operations, especially in the U.S., where I think we have managed the issues we had in variable annuities. This is partly offset by the decline of the earnings in Property Casualty, where we've had exceptional natural events and some impact of the recession on the claims. This is going to we think improve in the years to come.</p>
          <p>The net income is moving &#x2013; sorry, I'm moving to the next charts because Etienne wants me to move to page, is it the good one, yeah, page 7. I was trying to be disciplined, but the &#x2013; so on the Property Casualty side, the combined ratio is deteriorating, but we have a feeling, and Denis will elaborate on that, that the corrective actions we have been taking are going to bring it back to lower levels.</p>
          <p>But remember, what we had said was that, we would operate in Property Casualty between 95 and 100. We are within the range and we are pretty confident that it's going to stay like that and move into the other direction. The net income is multiplied by four, coming to I would say a sort of &#x2013; coming back to a sort of more normal situation, even if we are far from the peak earnings we had in 2007. This is, I would say the reflection of the strong asset quality following the very exceptional things we had seen in 2008.</p>
          <p>The next point, which is an important one, is the solvency situation of the group and the quality of the balance sheet. Solvency is back to pre-crisis levels. Due to what? Due to the quality of the earnings, nearly 20 points in terms of solvency, due to the impact of the markets and also of course slightly helped by the rights issue we did to finance the acquisitions at the end of last year. But even without that, you can see that the solvency ratio is a very, very strong one under Solvency I. If you look at it under the Solvency II QIS4, you'll see that it's even stronger.</p>
          <p>The debt gearing is down significantly, also slightly helped by the rights issue, but even without the rights issue, it's significantly down, which is showing you what we have always said, but what not all of you were believing, which is that the balance sheet is a very strong and safe one.</p>
          <p>This is leading us to propose an increase in the dividend. We are going to propose at the shareholders' meeting to pay &#x20AC;0.55 a share, it's a nearly 40% increase. It's the bottom of the, I would say, payout range we have from 40 to 50%. It's 40, what we intend to do is to pay out 40% of the normal adjusted earnings, that's where we are. This leaves us a capacity to, I would say, finance small acquisitions if needed, and this thing is a sign of confidence into the future.</p>
          <p>Last but not least of course, the group embedded value has increased by nearly 15% &#x2013; 50% sorry, driven by the earnings and driven also by improved market conditions. So as you see, in the numbers both on the earnings side and on the balance sheet side, after a very contrasted year, a solid situation, which is we think offering a good basis for the future, and I will ask Denis now to comment on the details of the earnings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Henri. I'm going to talk about the activity in the earnings, and I will let G&#xE9;rald comment on the balance sheet and the embedded value.</p>
          <p>So first, what we call resilient business activity. You see on slide 12 that our revenues for the year were down 3% and 1% on a reported basis. The decline came from Life and Savings and Asset Management. On the Life and Savings side, you see that our earnings went down 4%, which shows some acceleration in the fourth quarter, because after nine months we had a decline of 6%. P&amp;C declined just under 1%, which is a reflection of the beginning of a pickup in prices. We &#x2013; in this 1%, where we have a half a point of price effect, which should translate into a higher number in 2010.</p>
          <p>Asset Management down 25%, that's clearly the pure reflection of the decline in the AUM, and it's therefore essentially a market effect, plus the impact of negative flows, but the bulk of it is market effect. When you look at it by region, you see that the Mediterranean and Latin American region has the biggest increase at 13%. This is almost entirely due to the very strong volumes that we had on the Life side in our JV with Monte dei Paschi in Italy. France had the second biggest increase at 11%, showing the resilience of the French Life market and our growth in that market, which was higher than the market's, especially on the Group Life side.</p>
          <p>And finally, North America was down 32%, this is essentially the decline in our VA sales &#x2013; I mean VA and Life sales in the U.S., which I will comment further on later.</p>
          <p>Net inflows on the Life side, 8.6 billion, an increase over 2008. What is striking here is that, in spite of declining revenues, we have increasing net inflows, and this is a reflection of lower surrender rates during the course of 2009 in the U.S., but also in many other territories.</p>
          <p>On the P&amp;C side, more than one million new contracts, essentially new contracts in retail. So roughly one million in motor and a little over 100 million &#x2013; 100,000 sorry in households. I mean this is good news and bad news, because in motor our prices for the year were flat, and therefore clearly insufficient, and this is something we are going to address in 2010.</p>
          <p>On the Asset Management side, we had negative inflows of 71 billion. More than 50 billion of that is at AllianceBernstein, mostly on the institutional side, and this is clearly the lag effect of the investment performance issues that we had in 2007 and 2008. 2009 at AllianceBernstein saw very strong investment performance, especially in value and fixed income, and as time goes on, we should have some pickup there. We saw almost flat flows on the retail and private clients sides in the last two quarters of the year. We should see some pickup during 2010.</p>
          <p>New business value was up 5%, in spite of a declining AP minus 11%, Again on the AP side you see that the second half was much better than the first half, minus three versus minus 16%. The improvement in new business value is a combination of a better business mix with the impact of the repricing in the U.S. and higher protection sales in the U.K., slightly offset by &#x2013; partly offset by lower unit-linked in France and Belgium. This, we have a two-points favorable market impact, and this is offset by negative expense leverage as reduced sales volume were not fully mitigated by reduced expenses.</p>
          <p>Moving to the earnings now, underlying earnings as Henri indicated were down 6%. And you see that this is a combination of lower earnings in P&amp;C and asset management, largely compensated by higher earnings in Life and Savings. And I will comment on these each of those elements, you'll see also good earnings on the international insurance side, with a <mark type="inaudible" /> of 54%, largely due to good performance in our P&amp;C run-off portfolios.</p>
          <p>Under Life and Savings, the pickup in earnings is largely due to the improved variable annuity-hedging margin, which I will comment further later. On the margin and assets, we show a decline of &#x20AC;0.5 billion. Basically we had a lower investment income of roughly 40 basis points. We don't believe that this is going to carry on in 2010, but clearly our investment rates in '09 were lower, and we also had some, I mean we couldn't fully translate that into lower crediting rates on the &#x2013; on our policyholders.</p>
          <p>On the expense side, there is a small pickup in administrative expenses of 2%, but the bigger impact is the acceleration of DAC amortization as higher technical margins in the U.S. lead to higher DAC amortization. To put &#x2013; to just put the spotlight on the U.S., you see that the U.S. underlying earnings went from a minus &#x20AC;225 million to plus 545. We had a better situation on the hedge margin, which is at the bottom left of the slide, where we almost eliminated the basis losses.</p>
          <p>We still have significant volatility losses, because volatility in '09 remains at a fairly high level. We are going to address that in '10 by implementing what we call the volatility tool, where we basically take the clients out of equities when volatility goes above a certain level. Having been able to show over the past several decades that when volatility is above a certain level, the investment performance is generally bad. We've backtested that for quite for a long period and the investment experience with the, for the policyholders would have been much better that way.</p>
          <p>We saw also a turn in the credit spreads. We are &#x2013; I mean credit spreads is another flavor of basis risks, because basically the policyholders were invested in credit portfolios which were hedged from an interest rate standpoint, but not hedged from a credit standpoint. The spreads compression that took place in '09 made that a positive number versus negative number last year. So basically, our hedge margin was close to zero against 455 million negative last year.</p>
          <p>We took a number of actions in '09 as you know, repricing and restructuring our VA product range, but also eliminating an important feature in our Life products, the no lapse protection rider, which was responsible for part of our declining sales in 2009, because this is a feature that is considered important by some of our advisors and policyholders. This led to an improvement in our new business margin in 2009. This new business margin would have been much improved if we had had higher sales, but as you know, our competitors were not as quick as we were to reprice the products, and therefore that has put us in a slightly more difficult market position.</p>
          <p>We have launched in December, and are going to launch in Q2, a new VA called Retirement Cornerstone, which is a product where we have rollup rates which varies according to the ten-year treasuries, and we believe that this product is good for the policyholders, because it protects them against inflation. It's also good from a hedging standpoint. We also have in the Retirement Cornerstone another feature, which is that the customer can choose between the protected part of his portfolio and the unprotected part of the portfolio with different fee structures. And we are also going to launch a new Universal Life product in more competitive in 2010.</p>
          <p>That's all for the U.S. So lower sales, but better risk-adjusted margins going forward. On the P&amp;C side, our earnings declined by 30%.I would say this is the, perhaps the negative piece of news in this earnings release. Our P&amp;C combined ratio stayed at an acceptable level of 99% in '09, but our loss ratio shot up by 3.7 points to 70.9. Part of it is due to weather events, the cloud storm in France and Spain, hail in Switzerland, floods and frost in the U.K., and you should expect to have natural events in a P&amp;C insurance company, but we had more than our &#x2013; I would say more than our share in natural events in 2009, and significantly more clearly than in 2008.</p>
          <p>The current year ratio excluding natural events was up 1.7 points, this is something that we need to address through pricing and segmentation actions, and we <mark type="inaudible" /> of development which were still quite positive in '09, fairly comparable to '08. In spite of those positive reserve development, our reserve ratio, so reserve premiums to &#x2013; reserves to premium ratio remained flat at 187%, which means that we are &#x2013; we remain conservatively reserved overall. We also saw a decline of our investment income, same I think as what we saw on the Life side, where our yields suffered by roughly 40 basis points, and we had positive tax run-offs.</p>
          <p>I was talking about prices. We are increasing average premiums, in 2010, more in commercial lines than in personal lines, but clearly we have to do it to bring back our current year loss ratio in line with I would say a value creating position for the company. You can see on the &#x2013; at the bottom part of the slide that price increases are the highest in the U.K. and Ireland and the lowest in Germany. But everywhere we are increasing prices quite substantially. And in a number of cases, slightly ahead of our competitors.</p>
          <p>On the Asset Management side, we saw declined earnings of 41% as our revenues declined by 25% and expenses only by 14%. Having said that, we have going forward a positive expense leverage, because our year-end expenses are geared to our year end assets and any pickup in assets during 2010 should translate into significantly more positive earnings.</p>
          <p>The average AUM have stabilized. In fact at the end of '09, we have AUM which are higher than the average AUM of the year, which is the opposite of what we had at the beginning of last year. 2010 priorities are to address our client outflows, confirming our strong investment performance at AllianceBernstein, and managing performance at XIM, where we have some investment expertise, where we had not a good investment experience in '09.</p>
          <p>We need to continue to build our client base, and AllianceBernstein plans to leverage other sources of revenue, starting new investment expertises as Peter Kraus has indicated recently in his conference call.</p>
          <p>Moving to adjusted earnings. Adjusted earnings were down 8%. There are two moving parts or three moving parts in this move from underlying to adjusted. The realized capital gains were roughly the same, around &#x20AC;700 million. Impairments were much lower in '09 than '08, at minus 1 billion versus minus 2.7 billion. You could be surprised to see such a big number in impairments in 09, most of that was taken in the first half, I mean, close to 700 million in the first half. And the improvement in the equity markets in the second-half lead to higher annualized capital gains on equities. But not to lower impairments, as you know, because once impaired always impaired. We had an increase of unrealized capital gains of 4.2 billion, and we continue to have some impairment of fixed income assets in the second half.</p>
          <p>Net income almost quadrupled. This is essentially a function of the tightening of the credit spread. The widening of the credit spread lead to minus 1.5 billion last year. The tightening lead to plus &#x20AC;1.1 billion this year. I don't think I need to comment a lot of the other lines, other than the negative impact of equity derivatives for minus 400 million, the bulk of that is the hedge that we put in place in '09 to protect our U.S. Statutory balance sheet. This protection was costly, but we didn't want to be in a position to have to reinject money in the U.S., and we didn't have to.</p>
          <p>And last, the other line that I want to comment is exceptional and discontinued operation, minus 200 million. 142 million of that is a deferred tax liability on the potential sale of our Australian business. Where even though the sale of the Australian business is not certain, it's more likely than not, and therefore we had to book reserve for the difference between the tax book value and the accounting net asset value.</p>
          <p>I will hand over now to G&#xE9;rald for the balance sheet, and I want to thank you for listening to me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Let's start with the Solvency I ratio, which is back to pre-crisis levels. We are at 171% compared to 127 one year ago. When we exclude, and that's what is in dark blue, when you exclude the unrealized capital gains on the fixed income, we are back at a level which is close from the one at the end of '06. We are excluding gains, unrealized gains on fixed income at 154%, compared to 161% in '06, which was the highest ratio ever for Solvency I ratio at AXA. So on the right side, you have the key drivers of changes, starting first with the underlying earnings plus 18 points. Then the financial market impacts and plus 21%, mostly equities and fixed income with a slight negative contribution from real estate and other derivatives.</p>
          <p>Capital increased plus 11 points, nine points corresponding to the rights issue, and two to our share plan, and we have a negative contribution to this change in Solvency I, from '09 dividend $0.55 of share minus six points. On the bottom right, you have the Solvency II ratio, which is calculated based on QIS4 methodology, and last year we were at 150% roughly, and we are close, we are around at 185 at the end of '09.</p>
          <p>When moving to the shareholders' equity, this &#x2013; the shareholders equity moved up by 8.8 billion, and on the right hand side, you have the main changes, starting first with the valuation of unrealized capital gains, and on the bottom left you have the change, the illustration of the net unrealized capital gains broken down between equities and fixed income. And you can notice that we were at minus four in '08, moving up to plus 4.7 in '09, with roughly 2 billion in equities and 2.7 billion in fixed income.</p>
          <p>So as a whole, it's a variation of plus 5 billion, and we have the net income for the period, 3.6 billion. We have the capital increase, including share plan, plus 2.4 billion, then the '08 dividend minus 0.8, $0.40 per share. And the pension deficit minus one billion, mostly roughly 0.6 coming from the U.K. and 0.2 from Switzerland, and it's due to the decrease in the discount rate as you know end of the <mark type="inaudible" />. We are using a AA corporate spread and the tightening of this spread explains that the pension deficit widened.</p>
          <p>The net financial debt went down by 4.1 billion, from 17.7 to 13.5 billion, and the debt ratio explained mostly by the 2.4 rights issue, the positive effect of the 2.4 rights issue <mark type="inaudible" /> plan and the 2.1 cash proceeds from the equity <mark type="inaudible" /> that we mentioned already at the end of June.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, the debt ratio is going down quite significantly. We are 26% at the end of '09 compared with 35% at the end of 08. We are back, we are even below end of '07 level, and you remember that at the end of June, we were at 31%.</p>
          <p>Interest cover went slightly down from 8.5 times to 7.9. This is explained by our EBITDA, which went down by 7% in line with our underlying earnings, while the consolidated financial charges remain roughly flat.</p>
          <p>The invested assets, you can notice that there is &#x2013; there are no major changes since end of '08. Fixed income of slightly higher at 81% and cash is down from 8 to 5%, this is explained by two reasons, mainly. First, we have lower collateral coming from the VAs due to the improvement in the markets. And second, we have a loan, we have invested part of our cash in longer duration bonds. You can notice that govies and related went up from 34 to 38% and corporate bond from 35 to 36 points.</p>
          <p>So we can say that we benefit from a resilient asset valuation. In second half, most of the asset classes went up except real estate and private equity, which stabilized. Starting first with ABS, with Asset Backed Securities, asset value slightly improved from 69% at the end of '08 to 70 at the end of 09. Then as far as real estate is concerned, we had a negative 6% mark-to-market in the first half, and we stabilized over the second half of the year. As far as alternative investments are concerned, private equity went down by minus 15% for the whole year, and it was minus 13 mark-to-market in the first half, so the second half of the year &#x2013; in the second half of the year we had a decline of 2% only. Hedge funds, positive performance, roughly plus 5% for the whole year.</p>
          <p>At the bottom of the slide you can notice that we mention here the recent market concerns on govies, on government bonds from Portugal, Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain. We have the figures here. You can notice that these &#x2013; the percentage of our assets invested in these countries is small. Focusing on Portugal, Greece and Ireland, it's 1.4% of only, of our invested assets.</p>
          <p>On the EV, so we &#x2013; let's be clear, we are speaking here from traditional EV, and no more from the CFO <mark type="inaudible" /> methodology. So that's the traditional methodology, let's be clear. So we are moving up from 18.6 to 30.4 billion plus 11.8. The operating return is explains plus 5 billion, i.e. plus 27%, 27% operating return. The investment experience is plus 4.4 billion, mostly explained by equities plus 2.8 and lower spreads, tighter spreads, 1.7. Capital increase plus share plan plus 2.4 billion. So dividend, minus 0.8, and ForEx and others 0.9.</p>
          <p>It should be mentioned that our Group EV benefited from 2.6 billion liquidity premium, i.e. 30 basis points for most, for the euro, versus 50 basis points one year ago, and one year ago the contribution to EV was 4.4 billion. So the contribution of the liquidity premium went down from 4.4 to 2.6 billion. I would like to mention also that the equity volatility assumption are at spot value.</p>
          <p>Okay. I should be more precise on the fact that what I call traditionally EV is exactly, it's a methodology is the one that we have been using in '07, but I believe that you recognize our figures. So it's absolutely consistent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rald. And you see that Etienne, despite being already concentrated in this new job has not lost his reactivity. So what's the outlook? 2010 environment, what are the broad elements? First, I mean the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain. Where are the equity markets going to be? What's the yield curve going to be? Where is the volatility going to be?</p>
          <p>Overall, I'd say we are reasonably confident there. The regulatory framework is going to move, you know what's going on with Solvency II. What I want to say again here is that we think that broadly speaking, the system is a good system. The issue is the quality of the tuning. The parliament has defined the framework, we think that the supervisors and the commission have to stay within this framework. It's like a medicine, I mean you have very good medicines, but if you don't respect the prescriptions, they can be bad. So we think Solvency II is a good prescription provided it's respected, which is 99.5 one year horizon, not more, not less.</p>
          <p>And we think that the good quality players should benefit from that. We think that trends for the insurance industry are not bad overall. Savings rates are high in Europe, going up in the U.S. and in the emerging world. The risk appetite is progressively coming back, and the clients are looking for guarantees. This should be good in the long run for our business.</p>
          <p>On the P&amp;C side, we have really the feeling that the P&amp;C cycle is bottoming <mark type="inaudible" /> starting to come back. It's clear in this market in the U.K., we think it's starting to be visible in the French market. So we think the Property Casualty should move. Another point to, I would say counterbalance what I said on solvency, it's clear also that insurers are not banks.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; if you look at the pure insurers, they've gone through this turmoil with no significant liquidity or balance sheet issues. So we don't see why the sector would need additional capital. You may need &#x2013; I mean you might need some additional capital in some branches for some very specific risks, but overall, why would you inject more capital in the sector which didn't need additional capital in the turmoil?</p>
          <p>Where are we AXA starting from, given this background? Well, we think if you look at what's going to I would say drive the most important thing at the end of the day, which is clients and revenues, we start from a strong position. We are now the leading brand in insurance by all measures. This is a strength, and I think you'll start to see the impact of that on redemptions as an example, but also on possible, let's say, deals with people who are looking for privileged partners. When &#x2013; I mean some institutions are looking for partners to be their providers, we are I think one of the names showing up quite high on the list.</p>
          <p>I would add to that that the quality of service as perceived by the customers, and despite the crisis, has been going up. So it's a strong basis, you can add to that the fact that, from a financial standpoint, it's now absolutely clear that the balance sheet is strong, we have not asked for money coming from the state, which puts us in a situation where we have all the flexibility we need to I would say drive our strategy fully independently, which I think is a good thing. It's not the case for everybody, I mean, the ones who have to deal with the commission or whoever do not have the same flexibility, so it's a good basis, even if the landscape remains slightly uncertain.</p>
          <p>What are our priorities? Priority number one is to optimize further the margins in the various business lines. We want to continue to improve the new business margin on the Life and Savings side. We think that the progress is a gradual return of risk appetite should lead our clients to go for more unit linked products with better margins. We hope it's going to start to happen in 2010, the &#x2013; that's clear.</p>
          <p>On the &#x2013; sorry, on the property-casualty side, all the efforts are going to be put on the improvement of the combined ratio, and especially on the improvement of the current year combined ratio. As Denis told you, we have a recurring capability of extracting <mark type="inaudible" /> because we are opening the years in a very conservative way. But if you look at the current year combined ratio, it was too high. We want to drive it down as quickly as possible, and as you've seen, we have already started to implement the measures both on pricing increase and claims management which should help us to do that.</p>
          <p>On asset management, priority number one is investment performance. Priority number two is cost income ratio. Strategically, how do we want to have the business mix evolve? Of course the major markets are still going to be the bulk of the business, because most of the accumulated growth in the world is still there. But if you look at where the growth is accumulating now, where are the places where you find both growth and profitability? It's clear that we need to improve the exposure to emerging markets.</p>
          <p>What we had started to do before the crisis, what we will continue to do. If we manage to implement the Australian deal, the contribution of the high-growth markets will significantly increase, it will represent on the Life side 10% of the <mark type="inaudible" /> and a quarter of the value of the new business, which is really not insignificant.</p>
          <p>On the property-casualty side, it will represent 12% of the revenues, which is also significant with the combined ratio, which is improving steadily. We will continue, I mean to do what we have said we would do. We are buying out, or we have bought out the minorities in Central and Eastern Europe. We are entering the Romanian market, which is one of the large markets in Central Europe. So you see we are continuing what we had said we would do.</p>
          <p>The next point, which is an important one for me, we want to continue to adapt the organization to support the growth and to extract the, what I would call the efficiencies of scale, which you can see in a group like us, which you can see happening. We have now created the two new jobs, Group Life, Group P&amp;C, respectively held by Kip Condron and Fran&#xE7;ois Pierson. Because it's a way for us to streamline the operations in these two business lines. To accelerate the reuse of the best practices to simplify the organization to avoid having to invest two or three times differently to achieve the same goals. Technically, on the P&amp;C side, we think it's going to help too. It's a way for us to increase the competencies of the teams. That's one thing.</p>
          <p>The other thing is the change in governance, where with a unified board, we think also that the decision structure is going to be leaner, with the right counterbalances of course. I mean we will have a vast majority of independence on the board, and they will all, I mean all the committees will be shared by independence.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, we want to continue to attract talents, and we want to use very, very openly this crisis to attract the, I would say the very top talents from competitors who I would say did not exactly go through the storm the way we did it. We have been, two clear examples are the fact that <mark type="inaudible" /> has been joining us from ING, and that we have taken on board the Japanese executive was the head for ALICO, the head of distribution for ALICO in Japan. This is very interesting because it shows, it's also a reflection I think of the strength of the brand, but internally for executives it showed that we are able to attract very, very strong people from other firms. Sometimes it's less expensive and as efficient as M&amp;A.</p>
          <p>As a conclusion, we think the business model is strong, we think the activity is resilient, the earnings are solid, the dividend and the EV are showing the, are showing that. So the financial performance is a good basis to look at the future. We think we have the means to make a difference in this environment. Of course it remains an uncertain environment, of course we are not back to the glorious years of 2007, but we are quite confident that with the efforts we've been doing, we will see the group succeeding in the years to come, and especially in 2010. This is what we wanted to share with you this afternoon.</p>
          <p>And now I think we can answer the questions. Thank you very much.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have a few questions if I may. First of all, I think the key point is could we have more visibility on 2010 on several elements? First of all with regard to volumes of the business, it's clear that there was an acceleration on the pace of growth especially on Life on Q4, what do you see on Q1 '010, at least for January where you must have &#x2013; you must start to have some visibility?</p>
          <p>Visibility also on yield on assets, what do you see going forward on 2010 compared with 2009? And given the maturation of the bond portfolio, I would say both in Life and non-life, and visibility in terms of pricing, and I would say combined ratio, I see that especially in the cost segment that you are implementing some increasing tariffs of 1.5%, if I'm correct on your chart. And at the bottom of the presentation we see deterioration of the loss ratio of three points. So how can it manage on 2010?</p>
          <p>I had another question with regard to hedging. What have you implemented for 2010, what are the related costs? And last but not at least, maybe what's your view on the change of business model? So I would say a higher integration like as Zurich has done at European level or where Aviva wants to go at a European level, is it something that you're looking at? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's five questions in one question, but we'll try to manage that. On the Life and Savings side, I will answer &#x2013; I'll ask maybe Gerald to answer on yield, Denis to answer on P&amp;C and on hedging, and I'll take the very last one.</p>
          <p>On the Life side, I think two of the key drivers in 2010 are going to be the return of risk appetite among the clients. Are we going to, I would say the first half of 2009 as we said was difficult, because the clients, even if we had less redemptions, we are looking more for I would say cash or banking deposits. We have started to see that going into the other direction in the second half. Is this going to be confirmed or not? That's one of the key points.</p>
          <p>We are reasonably confident that, I would say, along the years should be progressively confirmed. Because the cost of remaining cash for investors is a high cost, as you know.</p>
          <p>The second element is the U.S. sales. As you know, as you have seen, our market share has been going down in the U.S., the sales have been decelerating because of the repricing. We are expecting to see the sales in the U.S. progressively going up with the progressive launch of Retirement Cornerstone in the various networks. So these should be the two drivers. Plus the fact that what we are doing in the emerging markets, NPS and a couple of other things, should in our view, continue to perform. So this is the framework, we will see how the economy goes, but I think the very critical factor is the return of the risk appetite. G&#xE9;rald, do you want to the take the yield question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. During '09, the debt yields, the debt securities yield dropped down by 30 basis points roughly. And on average, in Life we had an accounting return of 4.5% and on P&amp;C, 4.8%. The question is at which rate we will invest?</p>
          <p>So taking into account roughly, treasury bond level today at 3.5%, as you &#x2013; as I've shown you, we have a significant part of corporate bonds. Assuming that we would invest 50% in corporate bonds, with a spread, let's take AA or single-A of 120 basis points completely. That means that we will re-invest at 4.1. And you should compare, so for sure, it will be at lower rates, but we have a duration in P&amp;C of five years, in Life of six years. So that means that at the extreme, I can guess that the impact will be 10 basis points, something around this.</p>
          <p>So, for sure we have the impact of the new cash flow, but as a whole it's 10 basis points. So it shouldn't be quite significant and material for next year. I should mention also, just to complete my answer, that we should benefit from higher dividends on equities. Last year we had a drop of, say a significant drop of 1.2, yes, 1.2%. So as a whole, it shouldn't be very material.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the combined ratio we have started to implement, as I indicated earlier, pricing actions during the course of 2009. The full effect of that will be, will manifest itself during 2010. We continue to have pricing actions in 2010. In France as an example, where usually we on the retail side, we increase prices in April, we did increase prices on the 1st of January this year. So all in all we expect that pricing actions should give us between two and three points of improvement in the combined ratio. We are likely to have less favorable developments than the previous two years, so that should probably reduce debt by close to two points.</p>
          <p>We should expect to have one point from claims management, because our claims management program continues to add some benefits each year. And we are, hopefully we'd have a less difficult year on the natural events. So we could expect one point coming from that. So all in all, we expect that the current year combined ratio will improve substantially, we expect that all year combined ratio should be close to what we've had in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the integration, the first comment I would make is that, more than one model can be successful. I mean, there is no magic recipe there. We do not want to go through a sort of full business line integration, I mean it's our choice, we have not waited for starting to, I would say implement more rationalization and more, sometimes more transversality.</p>
          <p>If you look at the organization, we have <mark type="inaudible" /> risks with AXA corporate solutions, has been working very effectively since now a significant number of years. What we are doing with the P&amp;C and the Life function is to try to have a matricial structure. It's not necessarily always easy to manage, but we think if you are a really sophisticated organization, it's what you should try to achieve, because it's giving more leverage to the person who is in charge of P&amp;C or Life at the Group level. But it does not disenfranchise the local CEOs and the local distribution heads who have to stay very close to the local market practices.</p>
          <p>So we are not going to go as far as Zurich in the full integration, but we think that the model we have, given the market exposure we have and given the strengths of our market shares in a significant number of countries is the best possible organization for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We probably skipped the question on our hedging. So is it a question on the VA hedging or other kinds of hedging? What was the question related to? So both, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Six questions in one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on VA hedging, as you saw we had no losses in 2009, &#x20AC;12 million of losses in 2009, we have a budget of &#x2013; a small budget of losses for 2010 because we are still exposed to some potential volatility losses and some potential basis losses even though it's a, we believe it's going to be inconsequential. And as I indicated, we have put in place a volatility management tool which would limit the scale of those potential losses.</p>
          <p>As far as other hedging on the balance sheet, it's almost down to close to zero, which we have a little bit of statutory balance sheet hedge in the U.S., which wears off in March of this year I believe. And we have still a little bit of asset, I mean, equity asset hedges on the balance sheet of two of our insurance entities, and it's for a fairly small amount. So all in all, hedging has disappeared as far as either a statutory balance sheet hedging or equity &#x2013; asset equity hedging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you may see in your appendix as we have a gearing in equity, a net gearing of 8 billion after-tax after <mark type="inaudible" />. So that's the real exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick Holmes at Nomura. I'll restrict myself to just two questions. Sorry, <mark type="inaudible" />. Which &#x2013; firstly on realized gains, I wondered what your policy is going forward. I mean this is obviously a big item in the past and you reduced your equity exposure. I wondered if you could talk us through your equity policy, and whether it is to further de-emphasize equities and reduce realized gains going forward?</p>
          <p>And then second question is on Solvency II, I'm afraid, which is I mean, you set out very clearly, what you think of Solvency II. But I wanted to ask when do you expect some clarification on these interesting proposals that we have from CEIOPS. Will it be for example before QIS5 that we finally get clarification on this? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nick. Two very consequential questions. So the first one for G&#xE9;rald.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one, for equities you remember that before when we had much larger exposure in equities, we said that we should be between 0.8 and 1 billion contribution. Now, with capital &#x2013; with much lower exposure in equities, partly explained also by the economic conditions and the fact that we have a lot of value under corporate bonds. Our unrealized capital gains on equities is back to &#x2013; is only 2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>So we can expect to make some capital gains going forward, but let's say that the contribution of capital gains to adjusted earnings should be between 0.3, 0.5 billion, something like this. So much smaller than what we had before for quite obvious reasons, which are that we have far lower exposure in equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Solvency II, I'm afraid that it will take some <mark type="inaudible" /> to get total clarification, because we will have some level of classification in June with the instructions for QIS5. So we'll know what parameters will be used for QIS5. Then between, in October, November the insurance companies of Europe will implement QIS5, and the CEIOPS will collect the results and provide an analysis to the European Commission. And on the basis of the results of that analysis, the parameters might change again to be set finally in the fall of 2011. So there will be a little bit more clarity hopefully in June, but final clarification only during 2011.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Okay thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe one point that that we could add on the available financial resources side, we had some clarifications. That means that we had some confirmations that most probably the value of <mark type="inaudible" />should be in part should be considered as Tier-1, so that's what <mark type="inaudible" /> So we've got some clarification on the resources side, but as Denis said, it's open and we are still waiting for the SCR <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Sorry, hi there it's Farooq Hanif from Morgan Stanley. When I look at the technical margin that you made which is a very, very positive help by the U.S., it still looks like quite a big number when you compare it to balances. Am I getting that wrong? I mean, are there any sort of one off elements in the total technical margin that we need to take into account in our forecast going forward? That's question one.</p>
          <p>Question two, I mean, ING yesterday talked about being more conservative on lapse assumptions in its GMIB VAs because of the lower lapses coming through. Can you talk about what you've done there and what risks you see? And the final question is when you talk about two to three percentage points improvement from pricing in the combined ratio, I mean that's quite a big number to have in a year, when your sort of average increases are sort of between zero and 5% in pricing. Can you sort of elaborate on that a little bit more? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on technical margin, yes we have &#x2013; we had a big increase this year of roughly 1.5 billion coming from the U.S. Except this, we don't have any specific run off in our technical margin. Don't <mark type="inaudible" /> that we have a significant part of our business, which is protection, pure protection, or protection with some savings elements, which makes this contribution to technical margin.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the ING question. We &#x2013; I mean we are reviewing lapse assumptions on a regular basis. We have dynamic lapse assumptions built-in our reserves. We did take a hit in the U.S. in the last quarter on lapse assumptions for a portion of our VA portfolio called ALIC, which had a five-year &#x2013; surrender charges stopped after five years.</p>
          <p>And we did see smaller lapses than expected in '09. And we did strengthen our reserves by roughly $140 million. So &#x20AC;100 million, so we did have that, but for the bulk of the portfolio, we were pretty much in line with our &#x2013; I mean well within our expectations in terms of dynamic lapse assumptions, and didn't need to do any that kind of reserve <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>And for P&amp;C pricing, I don't think it's <mark type="inaudible" /> because in terms of assumptions, we do believe that the price increases that we've started to put in in '08 in Islands, in the beginning of '09 in the U.K. mid '09 in Italy, and the second half of the year in most other countries, and first of January in French retail are sufficient to give us those two or three points.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, thanks very much. It's Blair Stewart from BoA Merrill Lynch. Three questions please. The first one is the simple one. Could you give us the Solvency I and the gearing figures, assuming that you do complete the deal in Australia.</p>
          <p>The second question is related to the last one on VA. Clearly, there's a bigger business that was sold around 2000, 2001, 2002 that's coming to the end of its 10-year period that would be significantly in the money. So what you're thinking on not the lapse experience necessarily but election rates on that book.</p>
          <p>And the third question is on Solvency II. We can talk about QIS4, QIS5 and whether they are even in same ballpark, but my question is on slightly a different angle, and that's the shape of your balance sheet. Do you feel that the balance sheet is too debt heavy, and even if there's grandfathering, presumably that, some of that debt may well need to be replaced. I just wondered what you thought about that, and how that's shaping the way that you run the business, with a view to financing acquisitions as well? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Solvency I with the Australian deal completed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, roughly that would mean minus 3% in the Solvency I</p>
          <p>ratio. And as far as debt is concerned, it would be roughly at least 2% in terms of debt ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the VA, I mean, maybe Kevin wants to take that question, but we are, I mean, we are not worried about the VA election rights. Kevin, do you want to take that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at the election rates on the GMIB all the time and the experience for the whole block is much, much lower than we've used on both pricing and on assumptions for reserve. So we're well within the bands and the elections rates assumptions for GMIB. We don't see any need to change any of the assumptions now.</p>

          <p>No, we've had, we have some older product, actually, Blair, that's originally had seven-year waiting period going back to the late 90s. So that's been in the election period for a number of years now. So if you take all of that into consideration, plus what's coming in now, we're well within the expectations. We've seen a little tick up, like 1% tick up in election rates for deep in the money, but otherwise &#x2013; which is still well within our expectations.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's not as if, it's not as if we were starting to experience of annuitization. We &#x2013; our first generation of VAs were sold in 96, so since 2004 basically we, we are now in our sixth or seventh year of experience of potential annuitization, we have fall deep in the money policies and assumptions of 15% of election rate. We've never been anywhere close to that.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a very heavy choice for the consumer to do that, because once I mean, once the election has been made, you don't come back. So -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, they're much &#x2013; the consumer is much better waiting each year to take the election and set up trigger in a given year because he looses a death benefit if he takes the election. And then secondly, he starts triggering an annuity at the point in time that they elect. And so it's much more logical for them to roll it to the next year, the next year and next year to assume the election.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I will give you my view on this. It's extremely premature to give a precise and definitive answers about this, but keep in mind that our existing debt there is of high quality. So as mentioned, on slide, go back to slide 28 of your presentation. On slide 28, you can notice that we have 7.4 billion of debt &#x2013; of <mark type="inaudible" /> debt and 6 billion of sub-annuity debt, which means that we can consider, and you mentioned the fact that there would be a grandfathering, that's quite obvious. And the perpetual debt at 7.4% would roughly correspond to the 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>7.4 billion.</p>
          <p>&lt; A &#x2013; G&#xE9;rald Harlin&gt;: 7.4 billion, sorry, would roughly correspond to the 20% limit. So the discussion and the way and where the discussion is today, is that Tier-1 would be Tier-1 debt aggregate would be limited to 20% of Tier 1. So that, roughly speaking, that means that our <mark type="inaudible" /> debt would correspond, 7.4 billion is roughly the equivalent.</p>
          <p>Don't miss also that for most of the remaining part of our debt is 6 billion, it would be considered as Tier 2. We are not in the banking industry where the only objective would be to be to cover the SCR, with strictly and only with Tier 1. So that's the two remarks that I could make relative to your question, but again it's still known today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, we have in our debts out of the 13.5 billion of debts we have almost 6 billion of TSAs. So that's <mark type="inaudible" /> notes which are considered by the banks and maybe in the appendix you have some on which page. I know that we have an appendix on 42. Okay. So these debts are perpetual so that's really corresponds to the present qualification of Tier 1 debts, that's why I consider that most probably, but it's not sure of course. This category i.e., 6 billion, out of the 13.5 would be grandfathered and considered as Tier 1, but again it's premature.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Charles Graham from ING. Just a quick question. In the past a bit, a long time ago now you actually gave some more color on the component parts of your Solvency II capital, albeit in times of the defined capital requirement. Are you able to put sort of any ratios or guidance behind the numbers that you've given today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean behind the Solvency II number, which is 185?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that time that you gave for the 1987 year end, you actually gave the sort of numbers that you could come to some ideas about how much was value <mark type="inaudible" />, how much was debt and hybrids, and so on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Maybe that's, what we can say that going back to my &#x2013; yes, to slide number 26. On the bottom right, I mentioned that Solvency II ratio would move from 150% to 185%. And again, the difference what I can tell you is that we have the numerator and the denominator for sure. Numerator corresponding, we are under QIS4 methodology, I'm not speaking at all from QIS5, we don't do yet.</p>
          <p>But as far as the denominator is concerned, that's the requirement, and the requirement are not extremely volatile. They moved maybe around 10%, 10% a year between '08 and '09. But what is moving is the numerator. Why? Because the numerator is the most important part is the VIF, because here we are under QIS4 methodology, and QIS4 includes the VIF. And if you look at the evolution of our VIF, of the Group EV between '08 and '09, roughly speaking, this explains the move from 150 to 185. That's what I can tell you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just to come back to Blair's question, I believe that you shouldn't lose sight of the purpose of insurance capital regulation. The purpose of insurance capital regulation is to protect policyholders, and the reason for which we need to have capital in the insurance company is to pay the last policyholder. So the availability of capital is not a question of is this capital cash now, it's is this capital going to be available over time to pay the last policyholders. That's why it makes a lot of sense to have VIF as part of that Tier 1 capital.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Once more I mean, don't confuse the insurance and the banking business model, because I think this is at the core of this issue. The banks have a liquidity issue because the deposits can be exigible next morning. That's not our case.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, sorry, Farooq Hanif from Morgan Stanley again. I guess part of the confusion is that under Solvency II your liabilities will change, so part of the current VIF is obviously representing the fact that you are not using best estimate liabilities as some of that would automatically &#x2013; and so your VIF may be smaller anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if I may. You are right, but at the same time, don't miss that we have MVM. The market value margin for both Life and non-Life business will be significant, and it will represent a buffer above the best estimate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's a good question, but when you look at what we've done in 2009 in the U.S., you have a good precursor to that, a good illustration of that. Because what we did is we repriced to a level that was consistent with the Solvency II framework, which is not something that our U.S. competitors were doing, and we consciously lost market share. We believe that is the right way to measure the risk, but we took a risk in doing that. And I think you &#x2013; clearly one of the issues going forward is going to be the capital allocated to, I would say traditional general account products in Continental Europe. And that's a thinking that we will &#x2013; thinking process that we will be going through, and I hope our competitors will be going through in the next several years.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Johnny Vona from Goldman Sachs. Just a couple of quick questions with regards to the technical margin again. I mean, if I look at your technical margin in 2007 and 2008, the morbidity, mortality and morbidity margin was quite significantly lower than where it is today. And why have we stepped up so dramatically and why is it going to continue at that pace?</p>
          <p>The second question is just in regards to the embedded value. It looks like you took a charge for lapse assumptions. Why have you not taken the charge through your IFRS accounts? And also at the half year stage, in terms of your debt going down by 2 billion, you said it was seasonality effects, and that there was a tax receivable that would be readjusted back. Have you paid back that tax receivable and what's going on there? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. About the technical margin, the one-off gain of the U.S. is booked in the technical margin, as we said. So it's &#x2013; so that's the mortality margin, which went up so dramatically between '08 and '09. But what's the second part of your &#x2013; did I misunderstood your question, could you be more precise please, Johnny?</p>

          <p>Duncan Russell from J.P. Morgan. Could you &#x2013; slide 21 in the appendix where you give the cash flows for the company. And if you look at what happened with the n-1 cash flows which is last year's earnings, effectively your cash generated -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Slide 21, I think it is of the appendix. Where you've given the cash flows for the overall AXA Group. If you look at what happened last year, where the earnings n-1, broadly, the earnings on a statutory basis, 3.7 minus 1.8 minus the increase in the consolidated capital requirement of 2 billion was broadly zero. And I guess that's why the dividend was cut.</p>
          <p>This year, for full year 2010 adjusted earnings, n-1 will also be about 3.7 billion, basically flat. And I was just wondering we know that the increase in the consolidated solvency requirements is broadly flat. And was there much difference in terms of moving from adjusted earnings to statutory earnings, i.e., the dividend being declared this year, is that covered by your statutory earnings less capital requirement?

Then we have the increase in the consolidated solvency requirement it's exactly same phenomenons the one we described at the end of June, is that in the U.S. we'll move from 1% to &#x2013; we moved from 1% to 4% requirement in terms of Solvency I, which is, and this explains 1.5 billion out of the 2 billion, and then the capital optimization, it's mostly coming from the hedges.</p>

We can expect from 2010 that the dividends from the entities should be slightly higher, and then that's the only thing that I can mention, because adjusted earnings will be &#x2013; adjusted earnings minus the difference, corresponding to the dividend should be slightly higher.</p>

          <p>So the minus 1.8 should be smaller in '10 than in '09?</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> because of the minus points, 1.8 include -</p>

          <p>Yeah, especially because in the minus 1.8 of this year, which is a difference between adjusted and statutory results, you have the elimination of the hedging gain accounting wise, which you get back in cash in the capital optimization. So next year you should, in theory, have a negative amount, which should be lower than minus 1.8.</p>

          <p>Since we're all here, and I hope I'm not delaying things, but I just wondered whether Kevin might perhaps talk us through a little bit more about the competitive landscape of variable annuities that he sees in 2010, and whether he would be very disappointed if the market share remains at the level that it is, or whether he would think that that would be the right decision if the competitive landscape was not favorable? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Kevin, I'm keen to hear what you are going to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick, the best I can do on that question is you saw in 2009 that many companies changed their variable annuity pricing or benefits. We started early on that and then many companies followed to change products throughout the year. And so by the end of the year, you saw this sort of rolling wave of let's call it firesales. And so the market shares changed dramatically during the course of the year, with some gaining a lot of market share in one quarter, and then falling off a bit.</p>
          <p>I don't feel that I can really comment on market share, who's going to be in what place next year. I expect that we'll be, have a reasonable market share. We don't feel we have to be number one, we have a very strong distribution in all of our channels, and we expect to maintain that.</p>
          <p>We have some momentum building on our new Retirement Cornerstones product, which is a whole series of discussions which would be longer than this meeting. But I think we will see and we have seen a number of product changes, a number of different types of annuities as opposed to just the same thing coming across. And because that the clients are looking for not just the same thing, they're looking for, some are looking for more savings oriented, some are looking more guarantee oriented, and I think that's going to provide some differentiation.</p>
          <p>The other thing we're seeing is that certain market players have considerably dropped off market share over the last year. And we would expect that they'll be rationalizing the market share, and maybe not playing at the same top-tier level. So it's a very confusing, moving market, but the demand is still there. Sales are lower than for the industry, and for us, we're lower than they were in 2008. By the industry it's down probably, we haven't seen the industry results yet, but down probably 30%.</p>
          <p>And we would expect that, in 2009, with as Henri said, that in 2010, as the risk aversion seems to have alleviated a bit, that people are now looking to get back into products that have guarantees and products that have more of a savings component rather than sitting in cash. So I don't know, Nick, is that a reasonable approach?</p>
