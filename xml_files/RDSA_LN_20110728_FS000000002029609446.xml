          <p>Welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell Q2 Results Announcement Call. There will be a presentation followed by a Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would like to introduce our first speaker, Mr. Peter Voser. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Operator, and good afternoon and welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell Second Quarter 2011 Results Presentation. Simon and I will take you through the results and update you on where we are with strategies. And there will be plenty of time for your questions.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at the cautionary statement first.</p>
          <p>The world is in an era of important geopolitical transition, strong volatility, and intensified economic cycles. Emerging nations like China and India are going through rapid development and OECD economies have financing challenges. All of this comes at a time when access to low cost oil and gas is more difficult and there are questions in society around environmental impact. This is a complex and volatile landscape for the energy industry and an opportunity for Shell.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we mapped out a three-year plan for Shell, to 2012. The focus is on three strategic priorities: improving our near-term performance, growing the company by bringing new projects on stream, and generating new options for future growth. I am pleased to say that we are making good progress on all of these themes.</p>
          <p>Our Q2, 2011 CCS earnings, excluding identified items, were $6.6 billion, an earnings per share increase of 52% year-on-year. This improvement comes despite pressure on refining margins and low North American natural gas prices. Underlying Upstream volumes were good, up 2% and we are continuing to work on our costs.</p>
          <p>We sold $1.3 billion of non-core assets in the quarter; $4.4 billion so far this year, as we improve Shell's capital efficiency and upgrade the portfolio.</p>
          <p>2011 is an important year for Shell's growth program, and I'm very pleased that we have started up three large projects &#x2013; two in Qatar and one in Canada. These projects underpin Shell's targets for cash flow and production growth to 2012.</p>
          <p>Looking into the medium-term, we have launched some exciting new projects this year, with 9 new FIDs final investment decisions, and we have finalized the Ra&#xED;zen downstream joint venture in Brazil, which is a leading biofuels player.</p>
          <p>So, overall good progress on our plans in 2011. Let me give you more details on it. Continuous improvement is embedded in our operations and activities here at Shell. This is all about smaller, incremental initiatives to enhance our performance and commerciality. It is things like simpler structures and standardization, for example, in contracting and procurement. The opportunities in total run to billions of dollars of potential.</p>
          <p>Again, let me give you an example here. Shell drilled over 200 tight gas and CBM wells worldwide in 2010. So how do we work on costs there? We are establishing a 50-50% joint venture with CNPC, China's Natural Petroleum Company, which we expect to substantially improve our competitive cost position in onshore gas drilling. The JV is intended to develop and own, standardized and automated drilling equipment, sourced from low cost suppliers, for drilling and completing new onshore wells. This is intended to be used for high density drilling projects, both in Canada and in other countries in the future.</p>
          <p>Continuing with performance focus let me update you on capital efficiency. Disposal of non-core assets is an important element of Shell's capital efficiency and portfolio enhancements program. We've sold $32 billion of assets in the last five years, which is a rollover of nearly 20% of our capital employed. We completed $1.3 billion of asset sales in the quarter; that's over $4 billion so far this year and there is more to come in the second half of 2011, as we reallocate capital to new growth positions.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to the second leg of the strategy, which is growth delivery. We have some 20 new project start-ups planned for 2011 to '14, some 800,000 BOEs per day of new production. These are the new projects which will underpin our cash flow and production growth targets.</p>
          <p>Three of these new projects, oil sands in Canada, LNG, liquefied natural gas, and GTL, gas to liquids in Qatar, are now on stream. These three projects alone, at peak, should reach over 400,000 BOEs per day for Shell or over 10% of 2010 production.</p>
          <p>Pearl, Qatargas 4 and AOSP-1, contributed some 170,000 BOE per day in the second quarter 2011, so good progress, and just under halfway there ramping them up.</p>
          <p>These start-ups reflect some of Shell's unique strengths in the energy industry today: innovative technology, integration across value chains, and creating long-life returns for shareholders. So these are exciting times on the growth side.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to the third strategic theme, generating new options for future growth, and this is really about 2013 and beyond. So far this year, we have taken final investment decisions on nine new projects.</p>
          <p>Prelude Floating LNG is the largest of these new developments. This is an innovative development solution for smaller-sized, stranded gas fields and a first in our industry. Taken with our other interests in Australia, we now have some 8.3 million tonnes per annum of LNG under construction there. Another 40% step on top of our worldwide capacity of 20.5 million tonnes per annum on stream today.</p>
          <p>So when you combine our 2011 progress on new projects with the five investment decisions we took in 2010: Mars B, BC-10 phase 2, North American tight gas, we've matured over 400,000 BOE per day of new production in the last 18 months.</p>
          <p>So, 400,000 barrels per day of new capacity coming on stream in 2011 and another 400,000 barrels per day going into construction. This is all about sustained investment for growth and shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to Downstream growth. In Downstream, let me highlight that our Brazil joint venture with Cosan, which is called Ra&#xED;zen, went live in June this year. We have merged our Brazil marketing operations with Cosan's portfolio and the JV will have about 4,500 retail sites combined, a top three player in Brazil.</p>
          <p>All of these will be branded as Shell sites and offer Shell's distinctive suite of fuels products for customers. To give you some perspective, Brazil on a 100% basis is now about 10% of our retail network worldwide and one of our top three retail countries.</p>
          <p>Ra&#xED;zen also marks Shell's first move into substantial biofuels production. The company is the number one bioethanol player in Brazil and it could more than double in scale in the next five years.</p>
          <p>To give you an idea about size, Ra&#xED;zen's EBITDA would currently be around $2 billion on an annualized 100% basis. Now we will equity account this JV.</p>
          <p>So again here, good progress on strategy development, asset sales on track, new project start-ups, new investment decisions in Upstream and Downstream.</p>
          <p>Now over to Simon to talk about Q2 results and update you on the financial side. Simon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. I'll start with the macro environment. If you look at the macro picture compared with the second quarter of 2010, oil and gas market prices have increased from year-ago levels, with broadly similar Henry Hub.</p>
          <p>The discount of WTI to Brent widened to $15 in the second quarter, and that compared with less than $1 in the second quarter 2010. And this, of course, impacts our oil realizations.</p>
          <p>The industry refining margins diverged in the quarter with improved margins in the U.S., partly as a result of that WTI, but sharp declines in Europe and Asia where we have some 60% of our refining capacity. Chemicals margins increased from a year-ago level, although the margins were weaker in Asia.</p>
          <p>Turning now to earnings. Our CCS earnings for the quarter, included identified items, were $8 billion. Excluding those identified items, the CC earnings were $6.6 billion, and earnings per share increased by 52%, and that's compared with the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>On a Q2-versus-Q2 basis, the quarter was characterized by higher earnings in Upstream and similar levels in Downstream.</p>
          <p>The cash flow from operations was $10 billion; the dividend for the quarter remains at US$0.42 per share. The Scrip dividend take-up was equivalent to $800 million for the first quarter and we're offering a Scrip dividend again for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let me move on to the business performance in a little more detail. Firstly, the Upstream. Excluding the identified items, Upstream earnings were $5.4 billion in the second quarter, and that's an increase of 66% against the same quarter in 2010. The earnings were driven by higher prices and higher oil and LNG volumes, and they were partly offset by lower natural gas demand, higher taxes and increased operating expenses, these largely reflecting the start-up of new projects.</p>
          <p>Headline oil and gas production for the second quarter was 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's an increase of 2% when we exclude the impact of asset sales. Looking at the first half of 2011 production, we had a positive impact from growth barrels; they more than offset the natural field decline. There were also negative impacts from asset sales, maintenance and demand. However, the underlying performance is good here.</p>
          <p>LNG sales volumes grew by 14% in the first half of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. It's probably worth reflecting that the comparative figure against 2009 first half is 55% growth, just showing what the portfolio can do. And that, in this particular quarter, does reflect the successful ramp-up of Qatargas 4 as well as higher volumes from Nigeria LNG.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the Downstream. The underlying Downstream earnings were broadly similar to the year-ago at $1.1 billion for the quarter. Now lower results from Oil Products were partly offset by stronger figures from Chemicals. Our Oil Products earnings, though, were supported by very resilient marketing and trading earnings. Now that's a strong performance in a difficult environment. However, Refining was impacted by sharply lower industry margins in Europe and Asia compared to a quarter-ago &#x2013; a year-ago and these, of course, are important refining regions for Shell.</p>
          <p>But we clearly saw the effects of a lower operating performance in the quarter, with both planned and unplanned downtime eroding the results. With two-thirds of the 2011 planned turnarounds now completed, we expect to see improved availability for Refining and Chemicals in the third quarter and should be at similar levels for the third quarter in 2010.</p>
          <p>Our restructuring program in Oil Products continues with plans to improve our operating performance, take out $1 billion of cost, reduce our refining capacity and refocus our marketing portfolio. So those are the earnings.</p>
          <p>And now turning to cash flow. Cash generation on a rolling 12-month basis was $50 billion, including $10 billion of divestment proceeds and the average oil price over that 12 months has been $96 for Brent.</p>
          <p>Both the Upstream and the Downstream segments are generating surface cash flow, after investment. We're watching the cash position very carefully and I'm pleased to see our inflows and outflows are now moving to a free cash flow position, albeit, of course, assisted by higher oil prices and the asset sales.</p>
          <p>Turning now to capital spending and the balance sheet. The improving free cash flow position, combined with our capital spending and dividend program has resulted in a decline in balance sheet gearing. At the end of the quarter, the gearing sat at 12%. That's compared with 14% at the end of the first quarter, continuing to move lower in our 0% to 30% range. Now, you would expect that is in strong oil price conditions, of course.</p>
          <p>We've made good progress on asset sales with some $4.4 billion of proceeds booked in the first half of this year. And this combined with the ongoing asset sales, means we're comfortably on track for the $5 billion divestment target that we set for this year. The final figure for the year will, of course, be driven by the timings at which we close these deals.</p>
          <p>The net capital investment for the first half of the year was $8 billion, compared with a full-year plan of $25 billion to $27 billion. Our organic spending for the first half of the year is below the run rate we had planned for this year, but it should accelerate in the second half ,following all of those recent FIDs that Peter mentioned.</p>
          <p>The second quarter acquisition figures include the Ra&#xED;zen joint venture, but exclude the $400 million acquisition of UK retail sites that we've announced recently. We would expect to complete around the year-end.</p>
          <p>So those are the comments on the quarter. And with that, Peter, I'll hand over back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Simon. So let me summarize, before we go for your questions. Our performance in the quarter underlines that we are delivering on our strategy. We are making good progress with our three strategic themes. That's, performance focus, growth delivery and maturing new growth options.</p>
          <p>And then start-ups this year lay out good foundations for financial performance in the quarters to come. Investments, such as Perm, Prelude and Ra&#xED;zen are unique in our industry. They are a great testament to our staff and our stakeholders and this reflects Shell's core strengths.</p>
          <p>Shell adds value through innovative technology, sustainable growth, integration across value chains and by creating long-life returns for shareholders. This is a competitive and innovative strategy.</p>
          <p>So with that, let's take your questions. Now, please, could you &#x2013; could we have just one or two each so that everyone has the opportunity to ask a question. So, operator, please poll for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. Our first question comes from Lucy Haskins from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I'd like to ask on the integrated gas contributions for the quarter, was very strong. Could you give some <mark type="ph" /> theory (19:00) in terms of how much of that was coming from &#x2013; we're seeing the volume improvements; we're seeing in margin improvements. How much of the margin improvement was just the lags in sort of oil price effect coming through? How much of it was arbitrage opportunities you were able to exploit during the quarter? and how much of those arbitrage opportunities do you think could be sustainable now you're building perhaps a little bit more flexibility into your LNG portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Lucy. I think I give this one to Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. Thanks for the question. Very strong contribution indeed reflects, of course, that our volumes are up very significantly, largely driven by Qatar and Nigeria, both of which have some optionality in them. So, proportionally, our ability to take the gas to a more attractive market has indeed increased. I wouldn't necessarily call them arbitrage; it implies that they're nonstructural. We are able to take the cargos in over quite long periods of time and, particularly, divert some of those volumes in from both plants that were initially targeted at the United States into more attractive markets.</p>
          <p>I don't have a breakdown specifically from arbitrage price and volume because all of them actually interact, almost by definition, and in fact the rapid start of the Qatargas proved particularly advantageous, because we had more volume than we expected, on which we were able to effectively take advantage.</p>
          <p>The number of diversions was roughly double year-on-year around 30 cargos, so pretty significant and as you can imagine primarily into Asia and the Middle East. So strong performance, quite a bit is replicable. Of course, the arbitrage between Henry Hub and group related pricing is particularly attractive at the moment, but I would highlight that in Europe the actual spot length prices in Europe, the MVP was at least double Henry Hub, typically trading $9 to $10, so generally, an attractive environment for LNG.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Simon. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Kim Fustier from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. Just a couple of questions, please. Firstly on Iraq, could you please comment on the Basra gas deal that was initialed a couple of weeks ago? What are the next steps from here? And when can you start thinking about LNG? My second question is on China Gas. Could you maybe give us an update on your Shell Gas drilling activities, especially in the Sichuan Basin? Have you fractured the wells and tested them for flow rates? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for the question. I take Iraq and then Simon can do China. Yes, we are very pleased of having signed the contract on South Iraq gas, there's still more hurdles to go. I think the prime objective in the near-term is, clearly, to actually capture <mark type="ph" /> flare  (22:07) gas and make it available domestically and then over time as production ramps up, obviously, you go into potential export schemes. I would say they are a few years down the road and I think that planning would still take place a little bit later.</p>
          <p>So I think we will concentrate first on getting the deal over the line and once we have it then we will capture that gas and as it ramps up, I'm sure we will talk soon about exporting gas then as well. With that, over to Simon on China gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. China overall, just to reiterate the overall program there, we actually have, of course, the one operating concession, Changbei. We have two large or one type, one shale gas concession 4,000 square kilometer reach in Sichuan province and we have two CBM activities further north in Shaanxi Province. So over that, that whole portfolio, the plan was to effectively spend over $400 million drilling this year 15 to 17 wells.</p>
          <p>We are drilling in both of the Sichuan provinces at the moment. It's great to be able to get up so quickly, less than 12 months after we made the first agreements on the activity with our partners, PetroChina, their excellent safety and reliability performance to-date through their contractors gives us great confidence for the joint venture that we've just announced.</p>
          <p>Yes, we've fractured the wells. Yes, all of the basins that we're looking at are looking like their original prognosis. What I can't do is really give you any figures, partly because it's a joint venture and partly because it's still very early in the activity.</p>
          <p>So our aim is to complete that, what is truly an exploration program during this year and define the next phase of appraisal for next year. But, hopefully, we'll be able to lift the level of spending there next year. Thanks, again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Good. Thanks, Simon, and next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Iain Reid [Jefferies]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon, gentlemen. Couple of questions on the Gulf of Mexico. Could you update us on exactly how many permits you now have, and what you expect to be drilling this year and next year, on the basis of your exploration and development program? And when do you think you're going to be able to recover the 50,000 barrels a day, which you've lost due to the moratorium?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Iain. I think we have now &#x2013; so I share this answer with Simon. I give you a little bit the bigger picture and then he can go into the barrels, et cetera. We're very pleased with the progress we have made so far, albeit, I have to say it's still somewhat slow in the way we get permit, so that needs to accelerate. We have the five rigs now operating again, so I would say from an operational point of view, we are back to operate normally but, obviously, we're still down in terms of barrels and then Simon can take you through that.</p>
          <p>So I think, all in all, pleased with the progress, could be faster. And we're hoping, obviously, to develop things back to where we would like to be as we have outlined to you in our strategy presentation last year, but earlier this year. So we are still in a catch-up mode on that side. So to the barrels, over to Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Peter. And in total, we've currently received, what, three exploration plans, a development plan, a couple of additional well permits. The exploration plans typically include some drilling permits as well. We are, or we said we'd be, up to 50,000 barrels a day short on production relative to what we otherwise would have been for this year. That level of permitting and drilling means that we can basically confirm that; that we were 50,000 short of where we might have been.</p>
          <p>What we're likely to produce in the Gulf, subject to hurricane activity of course, is around 200,000 barrels a day this year, so it should have been 250,000. And that's quite a significant impact on all of our earnings, the way that you do the analysis. And that's down from 2010 and 2009. 2009, the last year pre-hurricane was 270,000. So you can see quite some impact.</p>
          <p>As we go forward, we expect to make up some of the gap. The comparison against what we would otherwise have achieved becomes rather like meaningless as we go forward. As we adjust our drilling plan to the opportunities that are currently available to us. But we should certainly make up in areas like the <mark type="ph" /> Dido (26:51) and ensuring we're working over wells on the operating platforms. So we should see some narrowing of that gap in 2012 built-in already to the projections that we've been making, even though we made the original projections before the moratorium.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Our next question comes from Jon Rigby [UBS]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. A couple questions. The first is on the mega projects you brought on this year. Obviously, the volumes are starting to come through, but if the upgrader, for instance, on Athabasca was just starting up, and presumably not all the products are being made in Pearl yet, even on the first train, indeed I guess you'd still making them and put them into storage, was there any real meaningful contribution from either of those two projects to earnings and cash flow in the second quarter? I'm thinking, is there actually quite a latent positivity on earnings and cash flows into 3Q and 4Q?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just on Chemicals, which seems to be having a remarkable renaissance over the last couple of years. And I just wondered how much of that was down to the U.S. business? And is there something sort of structural around profitability in the U.S. Chemicals business that will stick around until <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:16), until U.S. gas prices close on sort of international oil prices? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. Thanks Jon for the two questions. Let me start with the first one. I just repeated on but still we had 170,000 barrels in from the three that includes Qatargas 4, which has ramped up fully now and then the other two is coming into the quarter, total capacity more than 400,000, so there is quite a bit to go in the quarters to come.</p>
          <p>Now, I give you kind of a summary of the three and the impacts in the quarter, so that will be Pearl, Qatargas 4, and then you have AOSP. Apart from the production, we had roughly 0.5 billion <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:56) in it. And cash flow-wise as you are ramping up, as you rightly say, the stocks, we are obviously ramping up working capital. So cash flow-wise there was roughly $100 million in there from all of those. Some with a very late start-up; they were clearly negative on the cash side because we were just building up the working capital.</p>
          <p>I think on the Chemical side I'm very pleased with how the Chemical business has turned around, specifically in the United States for us, because they're really moving us away from a competitive disadvantage of being liquids-driven in the <mark type="ph" /> crackets (29:34) to actually being ethane-driven, has really made a big turnaround for us.</p>
          <p>We also have improved clearly the cost base, not just in the United States, but across the world. So I think we are structurally much greater positioned now. And given where the gas prices are, et cetera, et cetera, I think you can expect a good performance and a strong continuous performance out of the U.S., obviously, depending on pricing structures in the market, but the underlying operating performance is very strong.</p>
          <p>Now, based on that, I just take a little bit of wider view on this. As we said previously, we also are looking now at how we can actually use the chemicals stream and linking that back to our tight gas and unconventional gas positions, which we have in the United States. So we're also looking into that and how we can add further value further down the road. But I'm talking about a few years down, really down the road. So very pleased about the strategic and the operational shift, which we have made in the U.S. in chemicals.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from <mark type="ph" /> Peter Hudson (30:49). Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Yes. Two questions, if I may, first, on the acquisition of the 30% of the Abadi Floating LNG. Can I just check how that fits into the portfolio of other LNG profits you've got in Australia heading in the same direction? 2018, does that sort of jump up ahead of some of the others that you've got? And, for example, is it likely to come ahead of Arrow? And does it use Shell generic technology?</p>
          <p>The second one is on share buybacks. So I'm not arguing for aggressive share buybacks when you're making a very strong point about reinvestment for future growth, but the Scrip dividends was to give balance sheet flexibility, and the balance sheet is extremely strong.</p>
          <p>And I noticed that you're not going into the market to buy back the shares to cover the shares that people are not taking or they're taking Scrip. Are you expecting to be more aggressive in that, i.e., that the Scrip dividend element should be neutral in the future and quite quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I think I'm turning the second one to Simon. Why don't you start with number two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. And thanks, Peter, for the question. The dividend policy about the overall financial framework does indeed require us to buy back Scrips or shares issued under the Scrip Program to offset the dilution.</p>
          <p>We will meet that commitment. Clearly, in cash terms, we're in a better position to do that. But I don't want to be signaling too much ahead of the market, but we will meet that commitment. There are no current plans to go beyond that commitment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Peter. And then your first question, I think first of all, we are very pleased with our progress in Indonesia together with Inpex to buy into that LNG project. So very pleased about that and they are the operator but I think we can bring some help and some advice and skills to that.</p>
          <p>We have &#x2013; on your Australian question then, I think we are concentrating on Prelude as we have taken <mark type="ph" /> a five-year. (33:00) This is our strong, strong kind of focus on. Now as you know we have many of other &#x2013; of the other projects there like Sunrise where we have already agreed with a list of partners that we will use our technology. And we are also, obviously, working on Arrow where we have said that we will actually target LNG fee in 2011. And I think we are talking there around the first phase which should be two trains and 8 million tonnes per year LNG.</p>
          <p>Now we haven't been forthcoming with exact dates on that. Further down the road, so we will talk to you once we are further down and then have taken at five-year et cetera. So we will develop these things as a separate and single projects, I think that's the way you should look at that and not link them into other areas. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I was just &#x2013; a couple questions for you, really. The guidance you've given previously on cash flow from operations of $60 and $80 a barrel, are you going to see any change in that? And the second question was just on the capital employed at work at the moment. Are you able to give an indication of what capital employed is not working? And where you might see it normalizing out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks for the questions. On your first one, no, there's really no change to that. We have said in $60 and in the $80 where they 50% up or at least 80% up between '09 and 2012. That really means that we are aiming at the $43 billion at the higher end and $36 billion on the other side, if you'll take a lower &#x2013; the lower amount, so no change to that. It's also reflecting the production targets which we have given, which is 3.5 million barrels per day. And this is all what we are working for in &#x2013; at the moment and then into 2012. So on the capital employed, I give that to Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Peter. The capital employed is just over $200 billion. Typically, we've had over $60 billion of that not yet employed, either work in progress or effectively signature bonus, acquisition premiums, et cetera. The coming on-stream in Qatar and Canada will have reduced that amount unemployed by close to $20 billion. And at the end of Q2 and, of course, it wasn't actually in service for very much of Q2, in fact, weeks literally.</p>
          <p>So we're effectively more productive, but not yet producing at the full whack. And exactly, as Peter said earlier, the production we've only got 170,000 barrels to add to the 400,000 barrels on the three big projects and on the earnings. Very little cash flow and these projects together in Qatar alone were projected at close to $4 billion at $70 a barrel and another $1 billion in Athabasca at $70 a barrel. So there's still quite a lot to come there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Next question. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Fred Lucas. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Hi. It's Fred Lucas at JPMorgan. Good afternoon, guys. Couple questions. Recently visited Rumaila in Basra Province, Iraq and there seems to be some confusion there as to what actual rights the Basra gas deal might give you with respect to the gas that's currently being <mark type="ph" /> fled by Rumaila, (36:40) which is very significant. I wonder if you could clarify that point.</p>
          <p>And the second question relates to the LNG projects, especially Prelude. I think Malcolm Brinded has indicated cost there of around $3,500 a tonne which would point to total CapEx north of $12 million to recover just over 0.5 billion barrels. So it looks quite expensive reserve recovery at over $20 a barrel. Should we expect projects like that to make a return on the first project? Or does it need the boat to move on to a second project to make an adequate return?</p>
          <p>And then finally, on your coalbed methane to LNG project in Australia, today, we saw &#x2013; the FID saw AP LNG so that leaves you fourth in the queue. Don't you think that's quite a precarious position to be in, given emerging inflationary pressures in Australia, more generally upstream?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think on the first one I think I have heard the same kind of description from what you just more or less quoted. I think I will not go into that discussion at this stage. We have initialed a deal or signed one, which is now subject to two further approvals. I think once we are through there, then we will inform what it exactly includes. And then I think it becomes clear to you as well.</p>
          <p>I think I leave the Floating LNG to Simon. I'll deal with Arrow, which was your third question. I think we said from the beginning that we are not in a rush here. We will develop this. We see the rush into quite a few FIDs by others. That is our opinion will drive costs up, and I think we are quite happy to go later into feed and then FID and be already behind some of the others because we think that gives us a cost advantage.</p>
          <p>And as you know, this is a joint venture with CNPC, which also gives us access to a cheaper China sourcing, so we take it from that side. But you can see us progressing steadily towards the FID on this one.</p>
          <p>Let's also remember, we have floating LNG. We are working on it to divert other projects in Australia at the same time. So our annual spend will most will be in the $3 billion to $4 billion in Australia alone, over the years to come. And I think let's work carefully our way into that.</p>
          <p>And then I'll pass on to the financial performance, et cetera, questions on FLNG to Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Peter. On Floating LNG, Prelude's 3.6 million tonne per annum project. What we said, Malcolm said was $3,000 to $3,500 per tonne of capacity. What we have not done is given any specific CapEx for this project. What we have indicated is its economics are similar to other large LNG projects, greenfield ones, in Western Australia, for example, Gorgon, or in fact, the CBM projects, prior to the inflation that you just mentioned, of course, Fred. And the returns, therefore, are good.</p>
          <p>We will use this particular vessel to produce the Prelude field and likely two other fields close by. Thereafter, we will have probably a couple of decades of useful life left, after which we will already have got a very attractive return. Also $20 of barrel, I'd just point out, isn't such a bad cost and they're relatively attractive. Fiscal environments and $115 oil; it's pretty good at $70, as well.</p>
          <p>And so overall you have to look at the commercial turns, the quality of the customer contracts to get the economics. And lastly, I would say, yeah, the first one does cost a bit more, but you can be fairly sure of the second, and the third, and the fourth, they'll be a bit cheaper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Could I just clarify on the Arrow project? You're saying that into an inflationary cycle that you've commented on yourself is underway, that the last of four such projects could be cheaper than the first three?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's, I think once then certain things come on stream you can actually benefit from, let's say, service industries or other industries who have actually ramped up their capacity and their capabilities, then you then can contract in there. And we can always &#x2013; we have got the possibility through our Chinese partner overseas to just source things in a slightly different way, which also will help. And we are building up these global <mark type="ph" /> wells, JV, VC and PC (41:36) et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So I think we are doing all what we need to do in order to have an attractive profitable project there, which is another action to something which is new, pretty new for us as well. So this is our style of doing it and we take our time, we learn it and then we move slowly, and then ramp it up.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Irene Himona, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. I have two questions, please. First of all, in Oil Products, obviously, a sizable refining loss in Q2. Is it possible to split the impact on earnings from low margins versus low volume for maintenance, please?</p>
          <p>And my second question on cash flows. I think Simon mentioned the rolling four quarter $50 billion operating cash flow on an oil branch of $96, so obviously, the oil price is well above your planning range. I don't know if it's possible to adjust, but can you give an indication of what the gap is at your planning range versus the target, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Irene. I think I'll give both to Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. The first one's fairly easy. No, I can't really give you a split between margins and the volume loss; $600 million was the overall loss. The actual volume loss was probably the larger contributor but &#x2013; in terms of relative to previous years.</p>
          <p>On the cash generation, what I said was $50 billion including the divestment proceeds, so that was around $10 billion. So it was about $40 billion in terms of CFFO, so we're on track, but we're not yet there. And the key factor over the next 12 months will be the ramp-up performance of the main projects, as I noted almost no cash flow so far, but $5 billion between them capability at $70. So that's the biggest swing factor.</p>
          <p>The other thing, of course, is we had said the 2012 target, expected I think a better refining environment than we've seen in the past 12 months, and they were originally premised at a $6 North American gas prices, which is, of course, higher than today. And you can take your own view of what that's like for next year. We are, however, committed to meeting the cash flow generation targets next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Simon. And I think actually indirectly absorbed quite a bit of barrels, which we have filled and still achieved the $3.5 million barrels also gives us another additional challenge. But as Simon says, we are well on track to achieve it. Thanks, Irene. Next question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Could I just carry on the theme of refining and try and better understand why it is that we seem to be or the business seems to be suffering such a degree over so many quarters of unplanned downtime. The losses, again, this quarter is so surprisingly large. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And secondly, I just wonder if you could just talk around North American gas production and the seeming lack of progress in terms of growth there. I'm not sure to what extent it's influenced by the divestment of the <mark type="ph" /> big spherical (45:09) of Texas assets, but Canadian production doesn't seem to be moving north either. Is it just, again, what's actually happening in terms of drilling spend and intention at the present time relative to the targets that you set out in November last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Lucas. On the first one, we are really working on three key issues in Downstream and, therefore, in manufacturing, which is really &#x2013; your first one was portfolio, which are quite far down the road. We just announced another one a few days ago where we are switching the client refinery into terminal. So that's clearly making good progress, and I think we are getting there.</p>
          <p>The second one is about cost in the system and the simplification of our processes in order to actually get a lower cost base and, therefore, also a more agile refining system. I think we are on track there, obviously, not yet done because quite clearly that is not a one or a two-quarter project; that's a little bit longer.</p>
          <p>And the third one is then, clearly, it's on the operating side, so actually constantly achieve our internal targets, which we have on op time, on utilization, on total capacity, but also on planned downtime. I think that the system has performed okay in some quarters and hasn't performed in some others, and that is part of our improvement program.</p>
          <p>If you ask me, for this quarter, did we leave money on the table in some areas? Yes, we did, and that's part of our real focus on getting the manufacturing side up to speed. But I will have to say, having 60% of our assets in Europe and also in Asia has clearly given us a big disadvantage.</p>
          <p>Not being in the WTI area, to benefit on that, has also given us a disadvantage, and one needs to take that into account. So I think I would say, we are on track, there is more to come here and more to do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The capital employed has gone up by $10 billion as well over the last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, clearly, I'm investing, for example, in Port Arthur, et cetera, et cetera. That's correct, yes, while we stick to what we have set as a target. Let me also say that looking at manufacturing in isolation or refining in isolation in the Downstream business is not always the only way to look at the business.</p>
          <p>Yes, we do run it that way and we put the pressure on it, but you need to take the trading and the marketing integrated value chain into account as well when you optimize your margin streams and your value to chain streams. This comes into full flow when you start to actually cut your utilization rates of refining and once you don't always look at that in an isolated way.</p>
          <p>I know this is difficult for you guys to do because we don't give you those numbers, but just be assured that we are actually taking a full integrated look at all of this and we see our supply and trading and the refining business like that. With that then over to North American gas I give that to Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. The actual onshore gas volumes there are then, yes, from about 1.2 Bcf to 1.3 Bcf a day; this is basically the reductions driven by the divestment of the <mark type="ph" /> Taft (49:09), Texas volumes. The program this year is pretty much on track, although, we're in the lower end of the intended investment range, simply because the price is in the $4 range at the moment.</p>
          <p>We are there investing to produce in the Haynesville, in the Groundbirch. We're doing a fair bit of appraisal work in Marcellus and Eagle Ford. In both Groundbirch and Haynesville, there's quite a bit of drilling leaving gas behind pipe as we have not yet brought the infrastructure online.</p>
          <p>So drilling is running a bit ahead of the production in the year-to-date, so we're overall still very much on track for that medium-term target across the Americas, building up, in effect, a much better understanding of what is required to mostly economically develop Groundbirch and Marcellus, in particular, because they're the big drivers.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. A couple of questions. The first one is, you went into detail in terms of the 50,000 barrels that you are leaving in the Gulf of Mexico. Maybe you can give us an indication of what's the cost of leaving those barrels, not just the barrels not producing but also the cost of the turn back of the rigs and so on?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on Ra&#xED;zen. You have indicated around $2 billion of EBITDA there. Maybe you can give us some kind of indication of what the growth profile of that business going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I take the second question and Simon will then deal with the first one. Right then, we have given you an indication of EBITDA number, which we normally wouldn't do in that side because it's one part of one country's business and it is rather small. But our partner has also published out on its website; I think I'm not going to go further into any growth projections on that. We will update on the growth of Ra&#xED;zen in our strategy presentations. I suggest you have a look at the website of our partner, you may find a little bit more there. With that, over to Simon.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Peter. I'm not sure I fully understood the question but I think if it's about what's the cost of the 50,000 barrels a day been, we've stopped highlighting a unique or an identified cost on a quarterly basis. And the actual foregone margin at the moment, relatively easy to calculate, I don't actually have a calculator but it's 50,000 barrels a day, you're probably talking $40 a barrel plus or minus a bit in terms of potential earnings at $117 a barrel and that's the opportunity cost. In practice last year the margin or the profit lost was something over $200 million. So, it's quite a significant reduction in our ongoing earnings potential.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The question was more about that cash cost of not having those barrels. The idleness of the rigs and so on because that's for sure going into your P&amp;L isn't it?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Guys, good afternoon. I had a couple of things. Yeah, Simon, can you give me a rough idea of how your entitlement over time is going to change on Pearl, assuming constant price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So shoot all the questions, Mark, then we know what we have in front of us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The others relate to portfolio. I guess I'm a bit puzzled by the intent to go forward with a 10,000 barrel a day debottleneck at AOSP. It seems very small and I guess I just don't quite understand how the economics can be favorable on that. Similarly, I'm puzzled a little bit by the UK. retail acquisition, which at least in terms of per station is at about $1.5 million a station, which seem to be expensive. A little bit of color on both those would be appreciated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I think Simon takes number one, and I take number two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Entitlement over time, Mark, we've given in the past reasonably clear projections at different oil prices about entitlement to production and entitlement to cash flow. They were actually at $50 and $70. And basically, we have quite a significant cash flow, while we are in full cost recovery phase. That takes about seven to eight years. That's at $70, obviously, a lot less if we were to stay at $117.</p>
          <p>There has been a step down, and there is a further step down just as typical basically revenue-to-cost ratio trigger factors. But the ongoing availability of production and cash flow has remained pretty significant throughout the life of the contract. So it's about seven to eight years before the first trigger at the $70 barrel, slightly longer at $50, a lot less at the $120.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I take the two portfolio things. Let me start with the retail one, Mark. I think these are stations which are predominantly in the midlands and the southeast of England. They fit very well into our network, which we have. We get to 1,150 stations in total. We see great potential with our differentiated fuels offering, which we have in our lubricants offering. I think these are all stations in prime markets, filling gas which we have, and therefore it does really fit well into the UK and the overall retail strategy on a global basis.</p>
          <p>And have met all the normal, rather stringent profitability criterias, which we have in Downstream, specifically for marketing assets. So I'm pleased with the deal. On the AOSP side, I think you need to look at this in a wider sense, that we are going for developments or debottlenecking of various, let's say tranches of the 30,000 to 40,000 barrels, 30,000, 35,000 barrels.</p>
          <p>But within that we will have phases. And I think we do the phases in accordance to where we get the highest bucks out of the phase early on. So I think you need to see this really in the context of the total and should not focus on the 10,000. You should focus on the 30,000, 35,000. But we will do it in steps and there are smaller and bigger steps to come. But this is really optimized around the next margin you get out of it, but also the optimization of the capital intensity, which we have in the various steps of the debottlenecking.</p>
          <p>So I do agree that the number is rather small, but it makes all the sense for future part of the debottlenecking that we build this one first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, if I could just follow up a little. Do you have a cost number on either the tranches as you describe them or on the 10,000? And then just one other on Brazil, I guess I don't quite understand the divestments that you're undertaking in terms of Brazil, the intent to divest your 20% interest in BMS-8 follows on recent farm down in one of your other Brazilian blocks. Talk to me a little bit about the strategy there with respect to your portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first one, I think the 30K, we reckon it will be around on the &#x2013; on the oil sands will be around $2 billion. It will be offset, which gives you a breakeven below 50K, and if you take some of the tranches within that package, they will be quite below the 50K, but on average it will be 50K.</p>
          <p>On the second one, this is an optimization of our overall global portfolio, including the Brazilian portfolio. And we are optimizing that and we will not keep everything in our pipeline, which we can do, in some we farm down to get some cash contributions, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So I think you should see this as a total complete program, which we are optimizing. We have a rather rich pipeline at the moment for exploration and we will not do everything on totally on our own. So I think that's the way I look at the strategy and it's not the only one which we do in Brazil, there are other pieces as well.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Oswald Clint. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Thank you. I guess is this sort of net income or the earnings per barrel was a bit &#x2013; was higher than I was expecting, also higher than your long-term trend relative to the commodity, just for the Upstream business. Is that primarily, do you think the LNG businesses, Nigeria, that the Qatar volumes coming on that could be pushing that up? Or is there anything else going on there?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, it's just the divestment, I understand you may have exited the Swedish Alum shale that you were testing. I just wanted to know if you could give us any rationale behind that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think I give &#x2013; Simon starts with the first one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're &#x2013; as well, you're right that the LNG volumes and strong performance there realized prices is an effect. There is a tax mix as well. If you think &#x2013; and we've been saying for sometime it's beginning to start to come through. We've been shifting fundamentally the portfolio towards countries with more attractive fiscal regimes. So once you start to get Australia, Canada and Qatar and the United States contributing and maybe less for higher tax countries, such as Europe, you might see a better income per barrel going forward as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our final question comes from Sergio Molisani [UniCredit Bank AG Milan Branch]. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon to everybody. Two questions on the potential gas re-export from North America, if I may. The first one is can you give us an update on your re-export LNG project at Prince Rupert in Canada in terms of authorization status and an investment at different timetable? And what are the main factors currently under scrutiny, such as pipelines, location, competition, contract agreement and so on?</p>
          <p>And the second question is potential GPL in North America. You have related in the past that the car rental oil and gas price differential justified such decision. But what could make you actually and definitely confident on the long-term economics of these initiatives?</p>
          <p>And the last question is that the Pearl GTL is a wet gas project. I suppose that the potential GTL in North America is likely to be a dry gas project. How this difference could affect the cost per barrel of the new project in North America, compared to the $6 per barrel we saw at Pearl GTL? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sergio, thanks for the three questions. I think they're all a little bit in the box of future strategy, which we are, obviously, pursuing in terms of looking at our very strong gas position, which we have across North America, and how we can actually monetize the molecules with, let's say, the lowest element of Henry Hub exposure and the highest element of maybe liquids or other market exposures or LNG exposures.</p>
          <p>So I think I most probably give you a really one answer to the three. So we are working on all the issues you have said like LNG exports in China, gas to liquids in the United States, also potentially gas to chemicals. So there are more things which can come in here.</p>
          <p>I think what you need clearly on the LNG side is an export into the Asian markets, which gives you a different pricing exposure. Therefore, it is also for Canada differentiated in terms of not having only one market close to them, which is the U.S. It gives them a market opener somewhere else. So that's one driver. And I think we are progressing there. You have mentioned all the elements you are working on, but I'm not going to go into details at this stage.</p>
          <p>On the gas-to-liquid side, I think what you need is gas abundantly available, you need gas which has a reasonable low breakeven &#x2013; cash breakeven costs and you need to have a big liquids market. And I think in that sense, the U.S. obviously has all these elements and that could make a GTL possibility.</p>
          <p>Now we are through Pearl, through our early investments into being tooled in Malaysia. We are the company with the best and the divided experience in this field, so I would just say, we are looking at it and we'll update whilst we are going forward. Any specifics on the economics, like gas quality and what that means I think is for later on.</p>
          <p>Thank you, Sergio, for the future strategic questions. So that brings the Q&amp;A to an end today.</p>
