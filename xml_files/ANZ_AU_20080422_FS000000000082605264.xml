          <p>Good morning everybody, and welcome to our 2008 Interim results, special welcome also to those of you at our offices in Sydney, and those joining on the phone and watching the webcast.</p>
          <p>This morning, Michael will give you a run through of the result and how we are tracking in line with the strategy that he announced last December. Peter will then give a more detailed overview of the result and also some of the things that happened in the past, such as the implementation of Basel II, which I'm sure you all be very interested in. Mike.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, a very good morning to everybody. And if I can just add my personal welcome to you all as well. For sometime now, we've been saying that credit costs would rise, and this half we have seen that happen. This is has obviously impacted on our results, but I think it is very important to see that we don't loose sight of what was actually a very, very good performance at a pre-provision level. In fact, around two-thirds of business units had profit before provisions growth around 15%.</p>
          <p>You'll find a list of the growth rates on page 21 of your pack. And I'm sure you'll agree that there really are some exceptional performances, in particular from the likes of Asia, markets, and banking products.</p>
          <p>For those of you who are focused on longer term value creation, as I am, we are also making some very good progress with our strategic agenda. And there is a lot, I think, to be positive about in this set of results. I'll talk about that a bit more in a moment. But first let's look at the first half results.</p>
          <p>As you can see, despite the higher funding costs in the first half, we actually had pretty good growth in profit before provision, which was up 11.4%. Result was of the back off record revenue growth, which, when adjusting for exchange rate, was up 13%, so that's another real positive. However, the higher credit costs which we have been warning you about meant that cash profit fell 14%, EPS was down 16%. As a consequence we have kept the dividend flat.</p>
          <p>As on the previous half we have decided to underwrite the DRP and can I be very clear on this. We are not underwriting the DRP because of any concerns with the balance sheet. It is about ensuring that we have, and are able to, operate from a position of strength as we go into the market of a volatile nature and continuing uncertainty. And I am really sure -- I am sure that you would agree that this is a sensible and responsible thing to do.</p>
          <p>Looking at the divisional performance. I think this slide really sums up what has happened during the half. Personal continues to deliver good, consistent performance with growth in profit before provision and net profit after tax around with 10% mark. That is despite the mortgage and credit card businesses really wearing the brunt of the higher funding cost during the half.</p>
          <p>In New Zealand, better than expected profit before provision performance was offset a little by credit costs increasing from what I think were unsustainably low levels. So, net profit after tax growth was a little slower at 6%. In Asia Pacific, the result was very, very good with earnings growth of around 50%. This really will be a key differentiator for ANZ going forward.</p>
          <p>Then we get to Institutional. What is pleasing is that business has done actually a very good job in turning around the momentum in this division with profit before provision growth of 18%. And I think you would have to go back many years to find a better performance. Yet, unfortunately, there have been, or this has been, overshadowed by higher credit costs and some legacy issues, which are well-known.</p>
          <p>But, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that we are turning this business around and it does have very good momentum. Now, part of the higher credit costs in Institutional reflects a higher collective provision charge for changes in the economic cycle. This has been to get ahead of the curve. And let me just cover off from the environment that we are seeing.</p>
          <p>I think there is no doubt that the credit cycle is changing. I've said this to you before. While consumer rears are holding up remarkably well, and Corporate Australia is still predominantly healthy, I think we have to expect that they will soften a little moving forward. Apart from some of the secondary impact that have hit Australia from the global sub-prime problem, retail sales have come off a lot in the last two months, interest rates are much higher and with oil now over a $115 a barrel, I think that some stress is going to emerge in the market.</p>
          <p>This isn't showing up in our risk grade profiles yet, particularly in the personal side. But it does make sense that we prepare for it. So I think the move we have made this half to bolster our collective provision makes a lot of sense, and it allows us to play from a position of strength. In fact, our collective provision balance is now far higher than any of our peers. Before I finish on credit quality, I think it's important that we don't lose perspective here. Australia's banks are fundamentally well placed. Compared to what is happening in other banks around the world, the additionally credit costs for ANZ this half including the provision we took on a U.S. monoline barely register.</p>
          <p>More importantly, quite a few of those other banks are facing fundamental changes in their business models which will really hit their future earnings. We do not have that problem. For ANZ, the withdrawal of certain players and the flight to quality we are seeing is actually strengthening our franchise, and we'll stand as in good stead for some years to come.</p>
          <p>Just a few words on some of the other things we are seeing at the moment. In terms of funding, we have seen conditions ease slightly in the last few weeks. The cost to buy insurance on ANZ five year paper peaked in mid-March to a little over a 140 basis points. It's now back to about 60 to 70 basis points, which is a big improvement, but still well above the 20 to 30 basis points of six months ago.</p>
          <p>However, at the short end of the curve, as you can see from the chart, we're still paying a lot more, and we're still wearing some pain on that. But despite this higher cost we have continued to issue term debt in line with our existing plans, and we believe that is a sensible and conservative thing to do. Peter will talk to you a little more about funding and liquidity in a minute, but I remain convinced that the only long-term solution here is to build up our retail deposit base, and we're doing that.</p>
          <p>In terms of liquidity, we continue to operate with a liquidity portfolio which is much higher then normal. This is also sensible and a conservative thing to do. It's about ensuring again, we operate from a position of strengths. At the same time as we are managing the short-term issues, including the review that I've announced into the securities lending business, more importantly, we have to stay focused on building the business for the longer-term, and the underlying results show that this is happening. I am pleased to say that we are making good progress on the agenda that I set out for you in December.</p>
          <p>Institutional now has good momentum in revenues, notwithstanding some of the legacy issues that have emerged in that business during the half. We started to restore the JAWS half-on-half and we expect them to improve further in the second half. In Asia, we've really started to ramp up performance, and you will see that reflected in the 50% profit growth that we have achieved.</p>
          <p>One area you will not have seen much visible sign of progress is strategic cost management, but I can assure you, there has been a lot of work going on behind the scenes in developing our plans and you'll see more happening here in the second half, as we utilize the Visa IPO proceeds to undertake some very important changes. So while the result, the bottom line result, isn't what we'd like, basically due to the higher provision charge, we are still delivering against the long-term plan that I set out for you. We're achieving very strong revenue growth, and we strengthened our balance sheet. In a nutshell, we are well positioned.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Peter to go through the results in a little bit more detail and then we'll open up for questions after that. Many thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mike, and good morning to everyone. First of all, looking at chart number eight, I think I'll focus here on the scorecard down the right hand side. And clearly, I think, what has stood out in this result has been the very strong lending growth that we have had with our loans up 18% across the 12 month period, and it's obviously been a key driver of income, which we'll talk about in a moment.</p>
          <p>For the same time, our deposits have been up about 17% as well, reflecting good growth in our core funding capability there also. So volume growth has been a key driver and I think it's been, on balance, positive. Interest margin, obviously, has been something, which I think is probably going to take everyone a little bit by surprise. I need to explain that because most of it is more statistical and mix oriented rather than underlying change and we'll go through that in a moment with a 25 basis point fall.</p>
          <p>Non-interest income has been extremely strong. You'll see, even adjusting for some accounting noise, it's up 20% and we'll talk a little bit more about what's happened there. And expenses are in line with what we're expecting, perhaps a little bit more than what the market had, but certainly in line with -- remember there was a very large increase in costs in the second half of last year and that cost -- rate of growth of cost in the first half has been a little slower, but reflects a lot of legacy initiatives coming through. So all of that added up to, as Mike was saying, a very strong PBP outcome, and overall very strong revenue outcome.</p>
          <p>I was looking earlier on this morning to see that when we stood here 12 months ago, we only had 9.1% PCP revenue growth. Here we've got 11.4% PCP revenue growth, so indicative of the growing momentum within the business. Clearly, the provisions have been a big hit and as a clear reason obviously why we've had negative cash earnings per share growth. And of that $740 million increase, 95% relates to the institutional business, with the rest of the portfolio showing very little signs of stress. And again we'll talk about that in more detail. Finally, when you look at it on a half-on-half basis our PBP growth for the half was 6.9%, so indicative of good underlying momentum continuing.</p>
          <p>As I said, lending growth and deposit growth was a key driver of the result and you see on the chart nine that's set out. And the one obviously that jumps out at you there is the 20% growth in the institutional in this half. And that really reflects the common theme across the industry of re-intermediation and been very strong growth.</p>
          <p>If you look at it, the growth there peaked in November. And since then it's trailed off, it's now running at more sort of 1% per month, whereas in the month of November it grew by something like 9%. So that was when the real height of the growth that was occurring and things are returning to more normal rates of growth now.</p>
          <p>But you also see, as well as the strong lending growth, there's been very good deposit growth across all of the businesses. But off the back of that volume growth we'll then come on to what's happened with the margin and why has the margin dropped by 25 basis points over the 12 month period? And we've set that out in this chart.</p>
          <p>And first of all, I would like to put one side this component on the left hand side of 6 basis points which we described there as accounting noise. And this is something that we have in the results quite regularly, where it's a swap between what amount of our income in our trading activities appears in net interest income or in other income. And I'll show you a chart in a minute that shows that markets had a major turnaround on their interest income but a very strong trading income outcome. And they're interrelated but they appear on different accounting lines, and so that list creates noise in the NII because some of the income is actually appearing in trading securities that's related to the costs that's emerged in the interest income.  And it really relates to the structure of the derivatives portfolio in that most of our customer and funding transactions tend to be longer term and they hedge by shorter term transactions or transactions that require collateral to be put up across the term with inter-bank counterparties.</p>
          <p>So you get this mismatch in the cash flows and that results in this either positive or negative benefit on the derivatives portfolio that then goes through into trading income. I know that's something that causes people some concern but let me assure you there is no loss here. There is a direct offset on the trading income side.</p>
          <p>We then get into the core changes in the margin and you can see it's dominated really by this funding mix and asset mix, which is really recognizing that the balance sheet has grown very strongly and the new business, which has come on has typically been skewed towards institutional top end, which is by definition lower margin type business and the new funding that you are bringing on is by definition higher cost type funding and you don't get your current accounts not bearing interest and some of those low margin deposit accounts growing as rapidly as what the assets or the balance sheet has.</p>
          <p>So this is mix driven by the fact that our liabilities has skewed -- the new liabilities have skewed towards higher rate transactions compared to the average and the balance sheet growth has been skewed towards institutional. Then some questions around how much of that is due to building up the liquidity portfolios and there's probably, if you look across the markets business and the treasury balance sheets, there may be about one basis point of that. It's not a large component, the rest of it is recognized in the change in the funding mix, and recognizing this very strong growth at the top end of the institutional balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Then we come to some of the rate impacts, and a common question that gets asked us, of course, is what has been the funding impact, what's been the impact at least, of the higher funding cost and the basis risk, how has this flowed through, how has it affected your overall income. And it's actually a very complex question, you have to try and unpick the higher funding cost, you have to try to unpick the extent to which assets have been repriced in response to that, you have to make a judgment call around, to what extent are your mismatch outcomes influenced -- being influenced by that as well.</p>
          <p>And when we've looked at that we think there's probably in the order of 40 to $70 million depending on how you attribute various items, which is due to the turmoil, the widening of basis risk, the increasing in some of the wholesale borrowing costs, and the impact that's had on some of the mismatch outcomes. So it's between 2.3 and 3.8 basis points. And that's broadly included in those next two categories.</p>
          <p>Then we come to competition, and the interesting thing on the competition line, is that the contribution to competition, this drag that we normally expect to have every half, is actually a little bit less this half, and to extent that it's there, its primarily deposit related, and particularly out of New Zealand interestingly.</p>
          <p>So there's been very little impact from asset based competition. There is a little bit of evidence of competition on deposit side, which is what you would expect to occur in the current environment. But in the current half, competition was only 2.1 basis points compared to the 3.8 basis points for the first half of this 12 month period.</p>
          <p>Then on the right hand side, you can see what's been happening to our monthly margin. And not surprisingly as there was initially this increase intermediation taking place, a lot of low margin business being written, the margin was falling quite rapidly. But than as mortgages has been repriced, institutional business, new business being written has been repriced, that trend has now more stabilized and creates a better platform for moving forward from here.</p>
          <p>So, in summary here, the change in our margin is principally driven by the mix effects.  There's rapid balance sheet growth affecting both the liability and the asset composition. And they overall market turmoil impacts relatively modest, so it's around the 3 basis points and then competition at order of magnitude, similar levels to normal maybe slightly lower. That then] moves us across into the other income, which was a very strong outcome. Overall 26% growth and but we say on the top of that chart 20% adjusted for this issue we just spoke about, the switch between what markets income appears in NII and what markets income appears in trading securities.</p>
          <p>So the flipside of that then means that the other income growth adjusted for that's about 20. And you can see why that's the case when you look at the chart on the right hand side, you can see what happens within the markets income, that the NII number can move around depending on the pattern of the cash flows coming f the derivatives portfolio and if its negative cash flows then that creates a funding cost, if it's positive cash flows of credit funding benefit, but the flipside will be in actually revaluation of the trading portfolio itself.</p>
          <p>And so that's why you've seen in the current half, for example, the trading income jump significantly and interest income went negative. So it's really, just said earlier, just accounting noise. The key thing is, that's not because of speculation.  If you look at the chart in the top of this page, you'll see that trading income actually went down slightly. Recognizing the market turmoil, the broadening of credit spreads, the impact that has on credit assets held in the trading portfolios, there was actually a slight reduction in trading income. And all of the very strong growth of 21% in revenue was off sales, leveraging off the Institutional franchise and all of our other corporate customers to sell products in a period of volatility and uncertainty.</p>
          <p>Looking at the rest of the other income, you can see very strong fee growth, continuing growth in our other income recognized in the likes of the E*TRADE and their associates' investments, et cetera. But good markets income and very good growth in fees.</p>
          <p>Looking at the overall portfolio, we very much run the business based on trying to maintain positive JAWS, to have our revenue growth greater than our cost growth, and to have the investment aligned to the rate of return that can be derived from that, i.e., the higher the revenue growth, the more expense growth you're likely to allocate to that business.</p>
          <p>And you can see that from this chart here, where the vast majority of our businesses have positive JAWS, and indeed those that had had negative or neutral JAWS were ones that were being affected on the income side by the recent funding issues rather than fundamental question around how they managed their costs. Their costs were managed well, but their revenue was impacted by the blowout in funding costs.</p>
          <p>So, a good balanced portfolio, we can see a very good correlation between the rate of revenue growth and the rate of cost growth.</p>
          <p>When we look at our cost growth, as I said before, the cost growth in the second half of '07 was very high. It was something approaching 8%, and so that's what has driven most of that 12% growth PCP. The growth in the half was only 4%. And if you analyze that $100 million growth in costs, you'll find that $41 million of it relates to Asia and the Pacific. So, really reflecting the strong focus of our investment in that region and seeking the strong growth out of that platform. And of course, on the back of 25% revenue growth there was also -- sorry its 25% cost growth there was also 26% revenue growth. So, very strong growth coming out of that business in general. Then the next major component was out of the Personal business, there was $38 million of growth reflecting in particular the branch investment program and the ongoing growth initiatives within that business. Institutionally, say for Asia was actually flat and New Zealand was actually down. So you can see that the costs were controlled and allocated principally towards Asia.</p>
          <p>The collective provision charge; recognize first of all that the collective provision charge tends to be a lead &#x2013; in the losses which we're ultimately expecting to be emerging in individual provisions. So, that's why we put the collective provision charge first. It reflects an estimate of the impairment that's in your portfolio, that you've not yet been able to specifically identify. And as Mike was talking about earlier, we've taken the opportunity in this half to recognize that the market turmoil is having an effect on our customer portfolios. It's affecting a relatively small number customers, but there are probably going to be some customers out there that are yet to be identified. Or at least yet to have their customer ratings impacted by the turmoil and the ripple effects coming through from that.</p>
          <p>And that's $125 million which really is modeled on the basis of expecting there to be some further portfolio deterioration that's out there at the moment, but we've not actually seen it come through in to customer ratings. It's not actually been visible as yet. Although, we expect that it is out there.</p>
          <p>Then we have the risk component which is the modeled outcome from specifically modeling the actual re-rating of customers in the portfolio, and obviously in that the $172 million we've spoken previously about, the one large property component, there is also components in there from the broking industry and some other smaller property exposures. But I'll stress again, as we've said at the trading update, it's a relatively small number of customers that have been impacting that. Then finally, of course when Institutional has such strong lending growth there is a much larger collective provision charge recognizing that growth to maintain the level of coverage in your collective provision.</p>
          <p>On the individual provision side, I think we've presented a chart, like the one at the bottom left hand corner, on many occasions to you. Earlier to make the point that provisions were unusually low, and you can see that certainly in the second half of '06, first half of '07 and even the second half of '07, well below the expected losses across the cycle. And even if you back out the $226 million relating to the U.S. monoline, you still have an individual provision charge on that commercial portfolio that is slightly below the average across the cycle. So there's no evidence of credit cost here blowing out to above average; they're still actually slightly below average and clearly dominated by the need to raise a provision on that monoline. Also, you can see from the pie chart, there is actually a very small number of customers; to the extent there is stress in the portfolio it's very isolated to a few segments and notably selected customers and the property segment, broking and so forth, is where the stress seems to be. And as a consequence in that individual provision profile, there is only eight customers which are more than $5 million.</p>
          <p>On the consumer front, you can see that the consumer loss has actually being remarkably stable for as much as we have to anticipate the higher losses emerging in this portfolio, as interest rates and some of the economic impacts flow through, it's yet to show up and a very little signs of any stress emerging in that portfolio. Perhaps a little in New Zealand, but certainly a very little here in Australia but that's probably a good leading to next chart which looks at arrears.</p>
          <p>And you can see that certainly the mortgages portfolio and the cards portfolio has either been at or slightly above -- sorry, slightly below I should say, the levels of 2007. A bit of kick up in the month of March and that's obviously got everyone's attention. And when it's been analyzed, it appears to principally be due to the effect of having Easter in the month of March, which means there are less days for collectors, and people being away and having their own &#x2013; spending over Easter, and perhaps not spending towards repaying their credit card.</p>
          <p>And interestingly from the chart on the right hand side, which is a chart of all accounts in arrears, even if they're in arrears one day, so if someone's just been one day late in paying, it's all arrears.  You see it did peak in March and subsequently intra-month they actually come back down again. So we feel that this is principally just simply due to the timing of Easter and the effect that that has had. But nonetheless have to &#x2013; hence the comment about being alert &#x2013; have to expect that a little of arrears in the consumer portfolios must climb and there must be some impact of this in due course, recognizing the higher interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>In New Zealand, for example ,a little bit more evidence of that the economy is little slower in New Zealand and I'm sure some of you would have noticed that 90-day arrears in New Zealand jumped from 106 to $196 million. Spread across, particularly, the mortgage portfolios. It's principally secured type lending.</p>
          <p>Basel II: obviously this has been a topic that we've touched on at each result's announcement for quite some time, and this is a chart which is derivative of one that we showed you at the end of last financial year. And really, the outcomes have come out to be pretty well in line with what we were expecting. I think we've consistently said a relatively modest benefit from Basel II. And you can see clearly what's happened here has been that a 13.5% reduction in risk-weighed assets has been largely offset by higher deductions under Basel II, so risk-weighed assets go down, but the capital base as measured under Basel II is slightly smaller. So that overall, there's about a -- when you have all the roundings in the numbers, a little over 30 basis points improvement in the Tier 1 ratio and about 46 basis points in the H ratio.</p>
          <p>Now this requires a little bit more explanation and perhaps first of all, starting with the risk weighed assets at the bottom. You will have seen in the back of the packet around page 48 onwards, we give you quite a bit of information in there about the way that the calculations work, just trying to show you how dynamic they are now under Basel II. You have to recognize now that as portfolios change, not only may your collective provision be going up, but also your risk weighted assets are probably going to be going up as the portfolio deteriorates, for example. So say a far more dynamic calculation. But the principal benefits behind a 13% reduction in risk weighted assets have come out of mortgages that have gone from a Basel I risk weighted of around 50% down to 21% average across the portfolio.</p>
          <p>And the corporate book, which has gone from a 100% risk weight to 64%. But the interesting side issue though in the corporate book was the risk weight asset -- sorry, was the risk weighting, the average risk weighting has gone down substantially. The volume of exposures has gone up significantly because Basel II now requires you to carry capital against undrawn lines, where previously under Basel I you didn't have to.</p>
          <p>So the actual reduction in corporate risk weighted assets is only about 5 billion. There's -- even though the heavy weighting drops from 100 to 64%. A little bit more detail of that in the chart at the back that I'm sure you all be interested in.</p>
          <p>On the Tier 1 front, I think the number there that probably attracts everyone's attention is this CP compared to Basel EL and that one requires a bit of explanation.  It's a rather technical concept under the Basel rules, but here you're required to compare your level of collective provision measured on after tax basis to the Basel expected loss.</p>
          <p>The Basel expected loss is an expected loss calculated effectively in stress-type conditions. So rather than being a through-the-cycle expected loss, its an expected loss assuming stress levels of loss given default, very conservative approaches to the property portfolios and some flaws around probability of default; a number of conservative adjustments that have been used to calculate capital, those same conservative adjustments were then applied to Basel EL.</p>
          <p>And for example, our average loss experienced on mortgages is somewhere between 4 and 5 basis points, loss given default, but the floor in the Basel rules by APRA is 20%. So you can see on the mortgage portfolio alone, you get something like 4 or 5 times the level of expected loss. And you find similar effects across other parts of the portfolio, and that's why we end up with this deduction here, that the Basel expected loss workout at something like 75 basis points compared to an ELP of about close to 30 basis points, because of all these very conservative assumptions. And that's explained in a little bit more detailed at the back, and that will be something which will be new to you.</p>
          <p>Then moving onto funding and the overall structure of the balance sheet. We went into this period of tighter funding conditions with by far the lowest reliance upon short-term funding of our peer group, and that was something which we've been deliberately skewing ourselves towards, term funding and short-term funding, and that's put us on a very good base.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, our level of short-term borrowings, you see that short-term wholesale there of 17%, that's grown up from what was about 12.7% 12 months ago, but still we think we're running levels of short-term borrowings that are lower than our peer group. Across the last six months we've been actively accessing the term funding markets, we're done about two-thirds of our annual program for our term funding and confident with the outlook, we complete our term funding program for the rest of the year, and have had no difficulties reaching our targets there that we've done so far.</p>
          <p>In terms of the effect of that term funding, you can see that the cost on our first half '08 is about an extra $15 million, and the second half '08 is a further an extra 70. This builds up, of course, as your portfolio adjusts.</p>
          <p>Lot of questions have been around what does this mean for 2009? And we present a little table there on the bottom right hand corner there around the customer funding growth versus the asset growth, because obviously the level of term funding will need to raise to maintain our normal proportions of term funding. This is going to be a function of what happens with customer funding growth, and what happens with asset growth.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, we believe that those scenarios are all manageable. And the estimated additional funding cost in 2009 is around $200 million based on current market spreads, at least. And obviously, that's something that we've looked to the past through into the pricing of our loans. So we wouldn't expect that would actually flow through to the bottom line net interest margin.</p>
          <p>Finally then, summarizing up some of the key takeaways from the result. Clearly, very good revenue growth. As I mentioned earlier when we stood here 12 months ago, we were talking 9% revenue growth, and this is revenue growth of over 11 including the -- absorbing some of the effects of the turmoil and tougher -- and adverse foreign exchange movements.</p>
          <p>Bottom line obviously been impacted by that $740 million growth in provisions. When you look at the income dynamics, the vast majority of our businesses had very good revenue growth and good positive JAWS, and we continue to invest in areas where we expect high growth.</p>
          <p>Individual Provisions have been impacted by that $226 million for the U.S. monoline. And aside from that, actually they continue to be below what we would expect on the average across the cycle, and to the extent that there have been provisions they have been relatively small number and relatively isolated areas.</p>
          <p>For the Collective Provision, again the impact has been from a relatively small number of customers and us making this allowance for the expectations that there must be further ripple effects out there in the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Finally on the Basel and overall balance sheet, we believe that our funding and liquidity position remain strong. We have the balance sheet well-positioned for these types of eventualities, and believe we've been able to maintain that and mange ourselves through this well. We want to continue to have a capital position -- management position of strength as Mike was saying and that's why we've look to underwrite the DRP to add around 30 basis points to our capital ratio -- Tier 1 capital ratio, and keep a strong overall position to give us a robust platform to move forward. So, very strong revenue growth and a robust balance sheet. Fine.</p>

          <p>Thank you. It's Craig Williams from Citi here. It would seem you've called out today that, we're perhaps entering the early part of a credit cycle. If you perhaps can say that in round one being first half '08 ANZ has performed worse than its peers on this issue. How do you think the group will perform relative to peers over, say, a six round bout. So why should we have confidence that ANZ should perform better than its peers on credit quality through this cycle.</p>

          <p>I think that the credit book overall is pretty good quality. We've seen a number of high profile casualties and indeed you'd expect that, with the cycle to change. When shake a tree, stuff falls out. I mean, frankly a bit more fell out than I thought. But -- and I'm not terribly pleased about that, but we're fixing this up and we're going to sort it out. But again, I come back to the underlying business performance, which is extremely good and I feel that we have been incredibly open about this. We've taken it upfront. As soon as we've seen a problem, we've dealt with it and informed the market. You know as much as I know right now.</p>

          <p>You mentioned you're annoyed about the things that have fallen out. I wonder if you could talk a bit more about this.

        <plist>
          <p>Well, I know and I have said, I think that the reputational issue is what it's all about. I mean in terms of the actual size of the problem, it's very small of course, but in terms of reputation, it is huge. Now we are dealing with a bunch of sophisticated day traders who are clients of this organization.  The reason that the organization is in problems is because we &#x2013; well, they and we, discovered irregularities, so had it not been for that fact, we'd have been working it out.  And the position is very unpleasant and I have to say I am somewhat pissed off about the whole thing; however, you have seen that we are conducting a review, that I am actually running that, and I will make it public. The question to ask is should ANZ have been in this type of business? Quite clearly, not.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Cameron. Jeff Emmanuel from UBS. Mike, I had a question on -- it's probably for Peter actually, on the APRA expected loss add-on, if you like Peter, against Tier 1, the 350 mill? I guess the question is the auditors seem to be keen for you to keep provisions as low &#x2013; lower than probably the market would like. You guys have made some moves to cover for that. But APRA is suggesting that the right number is, putting in some more stressed outcomes, Peter, probably 350 to 360 mill higher. Who do you think ends up right? And why is it that the three don't meet more closely?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that the reason is we're looking at it from two different perspectives. APRA is thinking about this from the perspective of protecting depositors and ensuring that there is adequate capital to ensure the solvency of an institution in an extreme event. So they are talking about what could be lost in a one-in-a-thousand event, is the basic requirement under Basel II. So that is making sure that you have capital and thinking about expected losses in something which will only happen very rarely, very, very rarely. In contrast, the accounting approach is around what is the most likely outcome, what is expected, not &#x2013; you can't provide for the unexpected, you can only provide for circumstances that exist today, for facts that have occurred up until today and whereas APRA, by definition, is trying to make sure that you have capital to take yourself through an extreme event situation which is not in existence today. So the two positions are reconcilable because they are actually &#x2013; the two outcomes, I should say, are reconcilable because one's talking about stress and one's talking about current conditions and current expectations.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod Martin, ABN Amro. No surprise, question regarding credit quality and provisions again, and if I can just refer to slide eight and the $740 million increase in provisions that you've got there. I am just interested in how you've calculated the additional 125 million that you've put through and whether really that is enough, because in simple terms, from the 740 if I back out the 220 odd from the monoline exposure, then the 125 extra that you put through the increase is $400 million. And you're flagging a deteriorating environment and you've put through an extra $125 million, is that ultimately enough and what basis is that being calculated on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well I think this question flows nicely actually from the last question, which is if you can only provide for events that currently exist and circumstances that currently exist. So if economic conditions were to continue to deteriorate, yes, we could end up with higher levels of charges here. If economic conditions were to improve, you could end up with lower levels of charges. What we have done in the $125 million is it's been modeled in a variety of ways, but fundamentally we are assuming a certain proportion of the book is going to deteriorate and so what would be the impact of that. So, you can either assume something like 25% of the portfolio deteriorates by one notch in our earnings scale, or you could assume something like 5% of the portfolio deteriorates two or three notches. You're just assuming that out there, there are some customers that yet to have been actually formally recognized, i.e., hasn't gone through into the ratings yet. And when that does flow through into their ratings, when the current circumstances do flow through into the ratings, you will get a higher charge. Now, we think this has put ourselves in a very solid position because we have allowed for not only the current portfolio, but also allowed for some as yet undetected deterioration in that portfolio based on current conditions. But obviously the ultimate charge will be a function of what the economic scenario will be over the future and we can't provide for future economic scenarios.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ross Brown from Deutsche Bank. Just on the DRP underwrite, because if you look at your earned capital position you had a Tier 1 of 6.9 which was up, a Basel II ace of 4.8, which is above your sort of old range, you've just told us that the institutional loan growth slowed back to 1% per month. Is this extra capital to fund further unexpected loan growth or is it again building up some sort of war chest for acquisition opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not a war chest. As I said earlier, it's basically to position us for the environment. I feel that we need to be strong in terms of our capital position and our liquidity position to anticipate any bumps along the way. And, I think, this is a sensible and responsible reaction and I'm quite comfortable with where we sit. Peter, you want to add.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the only thing I would add as well is the mere change to Basel II doesn't alter your capital position, it's a statistical measure, so in extent your reported capital ratio appears to go up, that's more just a statistical change. If you look at what our H ratio would have been under Basel I, it's around the 4.4, which was sort of towards the middle of our range and we always like to operate more towards the upper end of the range. So this gets us back up to the position we normally like to operate in. So you have that position of strength.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. Mike, I have a question on capital? Australian banks have the lowest Tier 1 ratios of any banks in Asia. In fact if you look at Indonesia, Malaysia and China, most banks here are operating with Tier 1 ratios of 10% or more. So what I'm interested in is given your views on where we're positioned in the cycle, but also your ambition to have more of your earnings, and therefore more of your assets, coming out of Asia, will you need to increase your target Tier 1 ratios overtime as your presence in Asia increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's right to say that as you move into emerging market economies, you require stronger capital ratios than perhaps if you were entirely a domestic bank in an OECD country. I mean that is -- that sort of logic flows. However, at the moment, we are governed -- our capital ratios are governed by our prime regulator, which is APRA. We are consistent with that, and indeed we have to, of course, operate in a competitive environment in this market, too. So I am comfortable at present. But would we like to slowly increase some of our Tier 1 capital? Yes, I think that's a sensible move.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, also to add to that Rich. Under Basel II the risk-weighted assets will automatically adjust for relative risk. So to the extent that any of the business you're doing in Asia is risky or less risky, that will automatically be reflected in risk-weighted -- in your risk-weighed assets. You won't necessarily need to have a higher Tier 1 ratio per se, because it's now a dynamic process. So the old days of saying a higher risk required higher Tier 1 ratios are gone, because that is reflected in the risk-weighed assets in the first place now.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just comment on that, Brett. That line actually excludes the markets impact because to exclude the volatility from what was going on in the markets business. So, that's the reason for that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Now, I was interested in the price of the new institutional business that you were writing.  It seems to me that it's about a 1% margin less than the in force, because Peter what you were talking about was the asset mix impact largely related to institutional top end. If you apply that logic through you get that outcome. Is that what you intended to communicate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, the mix is going to be different as we take higher -- the higher quality asset on the book. But Peter, would you like to comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay. Clearly, the six months of the lower yielding conduits other standbys that came back on to balance sheet in September. So that's part of the impact on the margin. But as a general comment on margin, we instituted very clear pricing guidelines for all three customer segments last year.  Those pricing guidelines have progressively increased as our cost of funds have increased through the last six months. They're well communicated, they're well understood and indeed now perhaps also well understood by our customers. Not always do we see our competitors pricing with similar discipline, so there is some volatility or variability in the market. But the pricing disciplines that &#x2013; in the customer businesses are strong, adhered to and ones that I watch very, very carefully. So as a general comment you will see price very much reflect our cost of funding.</p>

          <p>And one other comment that I'd add on that Brett, if you look at page 31 of the pack, there is a pie chart there that shows the risk grade portfolio of new lending in the half. And the three quarters was actually in that AAA to BBB space (this is for the larger lines) whereas it actually only comprises about 40% of the overall portfolio. So that just shows there was a big shift towards this high quality lending.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Brian Johnson, JPMorgan. A question for Peter, if I may, and I apologize if this is overly long and complicated. But if I have a look at page 19 of the result, the expected loss, you used to love talking about this particular page. But it doesn't figure very prominently today. But when you have a look at it, I suppose, what puzzles me is: in an environment where things are arguably slightly worse and interest rates are higher, why does the personal loss -- why does the expected loss on the personal portfolio decline?</p>
          <p>And the second one, is if I go to your recent five-year term funding, the -- and look, it's a great result to actually borrow money at all at the moment. But that was a 130 basis points above swap, which is a lot higher than you would have seen even three and four months ago. Could you give us a feeling about the vulnerability of these expected loss numbers, both with regards to the probability of default across those various portfolios but also the loss in the event of default?  Because if we head into some kind of cyclical downturn, you don't have to be Einstein, for example, to work out there are a lot of pubs for sale in Australia at the moment, a lot of shopping centers for sale. Could you talk to us about the potential risk that these economic loss factors could actually gap up materially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, first of all, Brian, I'll take your expected loss question and then we'll come back on to the funding question. The expected loss numbers are literally point in time expected losses, i.e. they're saying based on the current profile of the book, what would you on the average expect to lose across the cycle? So to the extent that the portfolio deteriorates or improves, the level of expected loss will change. So if you would expect to see some movement over time in the expected losses, just like you've seen these improving and they would actually start to deteriorate as well, should the economy slow down significantly. But they won't be as volatile as what the actual losses will be, because this is -- given this portfolio, what would you expect on the average across the cycle. So given a new high risk portfolio, what would you expect on the average across the cycle. In terms of your question on the personal losses you're saying why they're trending down, well that just reflects that in general the behavioral scores, the levels of arrears and so forth in the portfolio, and actually being good. So its not been -- there's been no evidence emerging so far of changes in the quality of the portfolio, the cards portfolio in particular has been seasoning. You remember that there was a very strong level of growth in the low rate MasterCards and customer acquisition, 18 months, two years ago. And that seasoning effect is now coming through, meaning that those customers are now more stable if you like, the bad ones have fallen out, and so you see the overall average expected loss come back a little bit and that's why you're seeing that trend.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the funding issue, yes, it's correct that the cost of term funding has increased significantly. And the Australian banks of course, all of them are dependant on wholesale funding for both -- well, through all maturities.  And as the market has got more difficult, we've seen less and less banks accessing the market. So you've had the . .banks really using the Fed to access their term funding, you're seeing the European and the UK banks accessing ECB facilities. And we have not been able to do that here, which is actually a good thing because we have -- the Australian banks have been the only players in the term funding market, in a global term funding market. And the fact that we've been able to access funds I think is a reflection on the strength of the banking market overall. Yes, you're right, the price has gone up. And as we said earlier, we have of course had to pass that price on. We are seeing an improvement in pricing in some maturities. But again, we felt it was absolutely critical to maintain that &#x2013; the maturity profile, and to access the term funding when we saw the opportunity. And I would have to say that appetite for the ANZ paper has been extremely good and we have had no problem placing, it's purely been a pricing issue.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi Mike. It's James Ellis here from Credit Suisse. My question is on Wing Lung Bank. Acknowledging at this juncture you can't really say very much but can you sort of elaborate on newswire comments that ANZ sees Wing Lung Bank as consistent with the Asia strategy and just more broadly how do you see the role of sizable acquisitions in fulfilling your Asia aspirations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look the issue -- obviously I can't talk about specific transactions, but all I can say is that it is very clear what our strategy is, what our Asian growth strategy is. That has to be done on an opportunistic basis. These things only come into the market now and again but I would also add that the price has to be right and it has to add value to the overall business and we will not do a deal unless that makes sense.</p>

          <p>We'll take one more question in Sydney and then we'll go to the phones.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Matt Davidson from Merrill Lynch. My question was on institutional margins and, in light of Peter Hodgson's comments earlier, if we have a look at the half-on-half trends on page 46, my question is around why are we still seeing competition affecting the institutional business, and why are we still seeing pressure on the asset wholesale rate effect, and do you see much of the funding cost you expect to occur next year, really being put to the institutional customers as opposed to the personal customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the answer to the last part is obviously yes; however, I think Peter will answer in a bit more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wasn't planning to.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no.  Peter Hodgson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is my second question in several years. I must be in the right place at the right time. We'll get our share -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know the answer, Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll get our share of additional funding costs for next year, as you say Mike. And in respect of the competition, that's I think competition is around both deposits and lending. So, clearly the competition for customer deposits in institutional is strong as we look to increase our customer funding index.  A word about competition. I commented earlier that it's interesting to see the variability in pricing, and it's a variability in pricing particularly in the middle- and lower-middle market range, where we still are seeing some banks price at levels which we would be -- which we remain surprised at. So there is still some competition down there, and clearly when we are transaction or house bank, it's business we want to keep because of the cross sell. So, we will from time to time match that, but as I commented earlier the pricing disciplines across the business are very strong and thus we see movement upward in margin on the lending side, deposits, of course, is much more competitive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, sorry, I think it's fair to say, Peter that we've also let business go where we have been -- we have not been competitive. Although they have been existing customers and we have let business go to other banks because of that pricing discipline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.  We like, particularly in a period of constraints, if you like, around balance sheet, we like to satisfy existing customers first. But if existing customers can get a better deal elsewhere and choose then so be it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do we have any questions on the phones?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>There are no questions on the telephone at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have another question here in Melbourne.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, <mark type="inaudible" /> again. Just on New Zealand, obviously, you said previously that you've got a bit more on New Zealand than what you'd perhaps like. And the asset quality issue is probably greater there relative to Australia in terms of the Reserve Bank's appetite for increasing interest rates being a bit more aggressive than here. So I wonder if you'd comment on those risks going forward. And also update us on your thinking on the potential for a New Zealand listing, which would of course automatically reduce your exposure to that market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if I could answer the second part first, Mike. Basically, this is not the best time of the market to list off a business. I think we would need market conditions to look a little bit more buoyant before we would consider something like that. However, I think the idea is still not a bad one to put maybe 30% back into the market, I think it would be well received within New Zealand nationally, but the time is obviously not right and it will probably take a couple of years for that to eventuate.</p>
          <p>The issue over the credit quality is an observation, which is a good one. You have seen the uptick in provision levels that we've got there. We are watching it closely. We have actually adjusted our underwriting criteria for a number of the businesses, for example, reducing the loan-to-value ratios on mortgages. And we're managing the situation. But the economy does look a little soft if you take out dairy prices, the rest of it is not looking too good, and we anticipate we will have to manage that forward. But at the moment it's not giving as unfounded problems.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Craig Williams from Citi. The Group has being investing at a level higher than peers.  You've flagged today that you're expecting a cessation at the rate of investment that you've been making at the Group level. Do you feel that the Group is actually receiving adequate return on its investment in certain divisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All investment takes time to recoup, and I think that the all the indications are very positive. I am comfortable with what we're doing. The investments we've made in Asia I think are moving well. Things like the investment in E*Trade I think is placed us very competitively &#x2013; very well in that market. Yes, I'm comfortable and I think that the one that we're going to have to watch now is the transformation and the strategic cost management, which is something I have got. I will watch very closely, and the management know what they have to do. And I think we'll start to see some benefit from that in the shorter-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We might take a couple more questions from Sydney and then we'll wrap it up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We've got a couple more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's <mark type="inaudible" /> from Macquarie. Peter, do you have an estimate of the Pillar III deductions that will come through in the coming period relative to the 7.1% pro forma Tier 1 you financed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess what -- the broader question you're asking there is, all the Australian banks have been required to submit their internal capital adequacy assessment program plans to APRA. And so -- and the next step is what APRA comes back with in terms of whether there's any adjustments to required capital ratios etcetera, from that. So that will obviously have an influence upon the way in which we manage capital and I think both APRA and ourselves are on a bit of a learning curve here, that's sort of the next step along the way. There is also of course &#x2013; in &#x2013; and it's effective in the first of July, we have the additional risk weighed assets that we're required to carry for the interest rate risk in the banking book something that is required in part of pillar one in Basel here in Australia as part of the pillar two I think in other jurisdictions. So they are two factors which are coming down the line.  We'll wait to see what APRA thinks of all our capital plans that we've submitted and we'll be able to update the market accordingly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One more question up in Sydney?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike it's Jeff Emmanuel again. Just a question on your slide six. Mike you commented on legacy issues and institutional but progress with strategy. I guess, I was just trying to understand whether &#x2013; what you believe the legacy issues are, with particular question being credit quality. I guess the question is do you see ANZ institutional's credit quality as any better or worse than its peers? And do you see the provisions you've had to take as being driven by one-offs rather than a systemic gap in that quality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean my reaction to that, Jeff, at the moment, is that these are one-offs.  They're generally in small business lines, which have grown I think without proper management, or indeed proper process. However we can all be terribly smart in retrospect &#x2013; at the time when some of these deals were done, for example the credit intermediation trades, you know every bank in the world was doing this sort of stuff. And so, overall I would say it's one-off.  There have been a number issues, the other issue of course is the OFAC sanctions piece. So these are one-off type of issues.</p>
          <p>The actual, what I would call normal banking stuff, are we any worse? In a couple of occasions, I think that the &#x2013; I didn't particularly like the structure or where we were lending into, in terms of the hierarchy of the corporate. In the others, I think it was just the business model was no longer viable and that really was a reaction to the global crisis and investor appetite in things like securitized assets. And that was not an ANZ specific thing. So it was mixture of both.  The banking as usual things I think we can accept and we just have to work them through. The specific to ANZ things are more irritating and will be fixed and &#x2013; but I don't want them to be a distraction to management because the important thing here is that we have remain &#x2013; maintain the momentum that we're building up, and that's quite clearly what is happening there so that's good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There are no further questions up in Sydney Mike, did you want to say a few words to wrap it up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Steve. Well, this is Steve's last appearance before us at one of these events. And I know you've come to love him very much, but we wish him the very best in Cambodia.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And you never know; we can link you in from there possibly in the future. Now, I'd like to thank you all for being here today. And again, the takeaway from this is that the underlying business is actually going well. We've really got some traction, we've got momentum, and the business is moving very well.</p>
          <p>Yes, there are a number of bumps along the way. We have got into an environment which -- where the cycle has changed. We will have to manage those bumps as we hit them, but I don't think that that is an insurmountable problem. We outlined to you the strategy, the five-year strategy in December, and we're on track and are very pleased with the progress we've made.</p>
          <p>So, thank you very much for coming today. Many thanks.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mike. That now brings the briefing to a close. As Mike said, this is my last before I go up to run Cambodia. I have had a wonderful time doing this role and working with all of you, so a special thanks from me. And look forward to those of you who are coming on the Asia tour in a couple of months time. So, thank you very much.</p>
