          <p>Good morning, Caroline. Is everyone back from coffee? Not quite. Jean R&#xE9;gis is in charge. We're going to manage. Don't move Jean R&#xE9;gis. We are going to start off. It is 08:30. We're going to start. Good morning, everyone. We're very happy to welcome you to this meeting for the presentation of our First-Half Results for 2008. We are going to do it as we do every year.</p>
          <p>First of all, I'll ask Christian Mulliez to give you a full and detailed presentation of our results for the first half after which I will be commenting personally, as I always do, these results and what should be kept in mind. And I will indicate our outlook for the year 2008 and we will be at your disposal with Christian to answer your questions as best as we can.</p>
          <p>As usual, we are going to ask Jean R&#xE9;gis to give us a few housekeeping instructions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The presentation of the L'Or&#xE9;al results for the first half of 2008 will start with a quick reminder of the elements included in the half-yearly sales communicated to you on the 17th of July. We will continue with the presentation of the P&amp;L, the flows, and the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The sales for the first half of 2008 reached &#x20AC;8.646 billion, up at constant exchange rate by 7.1%. External growth impact was positive by 1.8%, corresponding to the acquisitions in the United States in the area of hair salons, of distributors of professional products, Beauty Alliance, Maly's West, and Columbia Beauty Systems (sic) [Columbia Beauty Supply], and of the PureOlogy brand.</p>
          <p>In Turkey, there was the acquisition of the Canan Company, and in Dermatology, the purchase of the CollaGenex Company in the United States by our joint venture, Galderma.</p>
          <p>In order to help you in your projections for 2008, we can indicate that the external growth impact for the whole year of 2008, including the acquisition of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9;, consolidated since the first of July 2008, and excluding any new acquisition should be in the order of plus 3.5%.</p>
          <p>As regards the exchange rate impact, there was a negative impact of minus 5.5% on the 30th of June. Here again, for the entire year 2008, by extrapolating the current exchange rates for the rest of the year, we work on the basis of an exchange rate between the euro and the dollar of 1.49. This negative impact should reach a bit less than 5%.</p>
          <p>Exchange rate, on this table, we are communicating, in a decreasing order, the weight in our sales of currencies other than the euro. We see, of course, the prevailing impact of the dollar in the negative exchange rate impact, which is very significant in the first half of 2008. We should also note that since 2007, there are four currencies of what we call the BRICM countries that are included among the eight major currencies of the L'Or&#xE9;al Group, the Russian Ruble, the Chinese Yuan, the Brazilian Real, and Mexican Peso.</p>
          <p>Another useful element, the weight of the Eurozone accounted for 37.2% of our consolidated sales in the first half of 2008, which is stable compared to the first half of 2007. 2008, unfortunately, is a record year when it comes to negative exchange rate impact and this is the case for the last 20 years, excepting 2003, and this is the reason why you have seen this in the press release and you would see it in the presentation. We will insist this year on presenting these different businesses and operations at constant exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Talking now about the consolidated profit and loss account, the sales was established at 8.646 billion, up 70 &#x2013; up 7.1% at constant exchange rate, and 1.6% on a reported basis. Gross margin reached 6.141 billion, 71% of the sales. The gross margin is stable as the percentage of the sales compared to 2007 and slightly down compared to the first half of 2007.</p>
          <p>There are several factors that impact the evolution of the gross margin from half-year to half-year that need to be identified to analyze the underlying performance of the Group, and that's what we are going to do with the following table.</p>
          <p>As we keep reminding you since the presentation of the annual results in 2006, the development of the gross margin every year is impacted by the changes in exchange rates. We thus calculated that in a constant manner, there are about three quarters of all exchange gains and losses reflected in the P&amp;L. Roughly three-quarters of these exchange gains and losses are attributable to the gross margin, to be precise 80% in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>By restating these items, by reallocating to the gross margin, its share of exchange gains as included in the P&amp;L, it appears that its evolution or development in the first half of 2008 &#x2013; and the first half of 2008 is established as minus 20 basis points. It is the first factor that you can see reflected in this table.</p>
          <p>The second factor is the outcome of the integration of the acquisitions in the United States of distributors of professional products, the operating structure of which is very different from that of the rest of the Group. We consider that the negative impact due to the integration of these distributors on our gross margin is about 10 basis points for the first half, by integrating all of the other elements including the impact of stocks step-ups during the acquisition. By adding these two factors, in other words, the allocation of exchange gains, and excluding the integration of distributors of professional products, the gross margin would have been only very slightly down, to the order of about 10 basis points of our sales.</p>
          <p>The third factor, which is not exchange gains and losses but the level of hedging. Let's take the dollar situation, for example. This impact is &#x20AC;0.11 because the average hedging levels were taken in 2008 at 1.36, whereas the hedging level in 2007 was 1.25. The market was different then. So 1.36 now against 1.25 in 2007, &#x20AC;0.11, that's the impact. We consider that for all the currencies, the differences in the levels of hedging cost us a loss of gross margin to the tune of 30 basis points.</p>
          <p>The third factor &#x2013; this third adverse factor was compensated by the improvement of the sales cost, resulting from the efforts we made in terms of productivity, and this was combined to the value effect on the sales. With these decisions on the gross margin, we can now continue with the examination of the other items on the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>The R&amp;D costs, it's at &#x20AC;272 million, are stable in absolute value, slightly down as a percentage of the sales compared to the first half of 2007. Advertising and promotional costs was very variable over one half year. They come out at 2.570 billion, slightly down compared to the sales at 29% &#x2013; 29.7% against 30% in 2007 and 30.5% in the first half of 2007.</p>
          <p>This decrease is even lower if we take into account the negative growth impact of the integration of distributors of professional products in the United States. It would then be only 30 basis points. It is important to also specify that including here in this item, there are productivity efforts that are being made, but when it comes to immediate buying, because what we do is centralize and outsource, and we also continue with these productivity improvement efforts for the advertising on the point of sales.</p>
          <p>A bit lower down, SG&amp;A reached &#x20AC;1.829 billion and represent 21.2% of the sales, stable compared to 2007 and up 30 basis points compared to the first half of 2007. This level would be stable by excluding from half-year-to-half-year once again the impact of the integration of distributors of American products. Again, they're really very happy because of their operating profit and the increase of the IFRS charge on discretion.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you that 2008 is the last year since 2004 where we can see an increase in this expanding on this IFRS charge because it is being accounted for progressively over five years since 2004. We are keeping here &#x2013; we are sticking here to the IFRS rules. This impact to which almost 10 basis points will disappear as of 2009 which is good news.</p>
          <p>Exchange gains now. We've already mentioned them. We had to look at them when we looked at the gross margin as established at plus &#x20AC;28.1 million. This is in fact may have come as the difference between 11 million as the time value and a gain of 39 million as intrinsic value, and over 2008 at the current exchange rates, this is the assumption, the exchange gain should be established at 65 to &#x20AC;70 million in total.</p>
          <p>The profit and loss account at &#x20AC;1.498 billion is up by 8.5% at constant exchange rates and 3.9% on a reported basis. It reached 17.3% of the sales, up 40 basis points compared to the first-half 2007.</p>
          <p>Now the history of half years, once again, we would like to insist on the fact that there is a great deal of variability in half-yearly profitability levels at the L'Or&#xE9;al Company and we would like to remind you here of the history over the last few years. You can see first of all in this table that a first half is rarely indicative of what the whole year will be. We see on this table since 2008, one, that there is a very strong increase in the profitability levels of L'Or&#xE9;al, both on a half-yearly basis on the first line and on a full-year basis on the last line of this table at 17.3% of the sales, this first half-year is a record half-year in terms of the half-yearly profitability of the L'Or&#xE9;al Group. Let's talk now about the different branches and divisions.</p>
          <p>Once again, the figures cannot be extrapolated as you predict the profitability of the different divisions for the whole year.</p>
          <p>Cosmetic division, first of all, the profitability increased by 20 &#x2013; from 20.6% of the sales in the first half of 2007 to 21.1% of the sales in the first half of 2008. Professional Products division, 21.1% compared to 21.3% in the first half of 2007. Here again, there is a negative external growth impact of the integration of American distributors because if we were to exclude that, then profitability would have increased from 22.3% in the first half of 2007 to 22.6% in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Consumer Products division, 21.4%, at historically high level to be compared to 20.6% in the first half of 2007. The Luxury Products division, profitability is always higher in the second half for this division. This division reached 19.6% to be compared to 19.1% in the first half of 2007. Conversely, in the Active Cosmetics division, we have 24.8% of the sales, which is at very high level. Its profitability decreased slightly compared to the first half of 2007 because now the figure is 24.3%, here again the seasonality effect is very strong.</p>
          <p>Few words about The Body Shop that remained practically stable at a level close to zero. You now know the very strong seasonality of this business and its profitability. All of its profitability in fact is achieved during the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Last point the dermatology branch, Galderma, profitability increased in the first half of 2008, profitability will increase in the course of the second half, because of very strong seasonality in this business, in particular, the acme franchise.</p>
          <p>Comparability to P&amp;L, from the P&amp;L to the net income excluding non-recurring items, you know that this is in fact the basis for the calculation of our earning per share. Cost of the financial debt is down at &#x20AC;66.7 million and this is despite the increase in the interest rate and the continuation of the share buyback scheme. This positive effect is the consequent of the divestment of &#x20AC;1.5 billion of Sanofi shares in November 2007. For the entire year, we can anticipate, all things being equal, a financial cost to the tune of &#x20AC;180 million. This cost includes, of course, the interest paid on the loan for the acquisition of Yves Saint Laurent and this is not something that impacted the first year results.</p>
          <p>The Sanofi-Aventis dividend remained practically stable at &#x20AC;245 million. Sanofi increased its dividend significantly. This stability is the result of the divestment of Sanofi shares that we completed in November 2007.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax profit grew by 7.6% at constant exchange rates and 3.7% on reported basis. Total taxes reached to &#x20AC;414 million. The tax rate decreased from 26.7% in the first half of 2007 to 24.7% in the first half of 2008. This is the outcome both of the lower taxation levels in a number of countries Spain, Italy, Germany, Canada, and Great Britain. Secondly, a decrease in the research tax credit in France and is also the result of the favorable outcome of some tax disputes.</p>
          <p>You know that the tax rate for the first half is hardly relevant to the annual tax rate because it includes a mix effect so that is advocated to the dividend paid by Sanofi, which are completely cashed in during the first half on the one hand, and secondly they are taxed at a level of about 2%.</p>
          <p>In order to help you in your projections for the entire year, we can indicate that for 2008 we can expect a tax rate to the tune of 28% down compared to the 29.5% tax rate that we had in 2007. In total, after minority interests the net income excluding non-recurring elements reached &#x20AC;1,256 million, up 10.1% at constant exchange rate and 6.4% on a reported basis.</p>
          <p>By integrating the positive impact of sale buybacks of plus 2.1%, the NEPS reached &#x20AC;2.11 per share and this is a two-digit growth of 12.3% at a constant exchange rate, and plus 8.5% on a reported basis. For the entire year 2008, we can consider today that the accretive impact of share buybacks should be close to 2.5%.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the cash flow situation. Cash flow reached &#x20AC;1,534 million, up 5.4% which is consistent with the growth of our income on a reported basis. The &#x2013; we always have this question, so let me answer the question straight away.</p>
          <p>The depreciation and provisions line at &#x20AC;243 million is stable compared to the first half of 2007. This situation is the result of a slight increase in the depreciation line of &#x20AC;308 million in the first half of 2007 to &#x20AC;319 million in the first half of 2008. And on the other hand, there is an increase in the provisions of &#x20AC;58 million to &#x20AC;76 million. And this is the result of the policy to progressively fund a pension scheme commitment.</p>
          <p>Working capital requirement as of the year &#x2013; the end of June, the working capital requirement is much higher than what will be, it's the increase over the entire year. It has increased this year compared to 2007, &#x20AC;630 million against &#x20AC;453 million. It's not due to the inventories, trade debtors and supplies line, but to other current assets and liabilities, for example, the payment of partial tax payments, financial cost on the acquisition of Yves Saint Laurent, different discounts with anticipated payments because there will be a outsourcing of this type of purchases. Also we can see on this table, regarding inventories and trade debtors a very slight improvement in the percentage of the sales.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side you can see that inventories established 9% of sales, compared to, if you look at the left hand side &#x2013; compared to 9.4% on the 30th of June 2007, with the same global consolidation and trade debtors themselves account for 17.4% of the sales compared to 18.2% on the 30th of June 2007. Ending now with the flows over the entire yea, as I was saying the working capital requirement should increase much less than in the first half, as it's not something that can be accessed very precisely, but it should be to the tune of about &#x20AC;100 million.</p>
          <p>Investments at &#x20AC;339 million established a 2.9% of our sales down compared to first half of 2007 for the whole year, this should be close to the percentage of the sales to the 2007 level, a bit lower maybe at 4.5%. After payment of dividends for &#x20AC;829 million entirely done in the first half after the acquisitions to the tune of &#x20AC;1,298 million including the acquisition of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9;, share buyback for &#x20AC;553 million the residual flow is established at minus &#x20AC;2,108 million.</p>
          <p>Three more tables before we finish. First of all, let's take stock of the acquisition of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9;, which was completed on the 30th of June 2008. It has no consequence or no impact on the P&amp;L for the first half of 2008. The balance sheet is impacted as follows; we're currently waiting on the final allocation to the balance sheet and this will be final on 31st of December 2008. So we have a net acquired situation of &#x20AC;64.4 million, in the assets &#x20AC;79 million for the inventories of &#x20AC;97 million for the trade debtors, a paid price of 1,107 million, and that's part of the additional debt and goodwill of &#x20AC;1.043 billion.</p>
          <p>You will see this in your papers. These are absolute values, they are not restated, cannot be compared at all. And I would also like to remind you and this is an important point that we indicated that this acquisition should have a slightly dilutive effect on our 2008 P&amp;L to the tune of about 1% bit more &#x2013; slightly more or less than 1%, coming for half from the non-cash effect and the stock step-up impact.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet now; structure of the balance sheet is robust. Share capital represents about 50% of all assets, the lower level compared to the 31st of December 2007 is because of the lower share value of Sanofi, but also the combined effect of the payment of dividend, which is done as one-off at L'Or&#xE9;al, the share buybacks, and the negative conversion effect, and the net situation of the subsidiaries.</p>
          <p>And this is due also to a significant exchange rate impact. And the last table is about the debt. Net debt is established at &#x20AC;4.520 billion on 30th of June 2008 compared to pretty much the same amount, &#x20AC;4,462 million on the 30th of June 2007, on the 31st of December 2008 should slightly higher than &#x20AC;3.700 billion, all things being equal. Thank you very much for you attention.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Christian. I would now also like share with you my vision of our results for this first half. These results are according to me very positive and encouraging, given the fact that they were obtained in a monetary and economic context, which as you know was extremely difficult and adverse.</p>
          <p>I would like to seize this opportunity to highlight the elements, which, I believe, are particularly important to note concerning our activity and our performance and finally I will give you an outlook for the year 2008, which as you know, and as Christian indicated at L'Or&#xE9;al, a half year is not necessarily representive of the full year.</p>
          <p>To begin with and as with the case in previous years a focus on the cosmetics markets for the first half of 2008. The first element to note in a very troubled economic context during the first half, the cosmetics markets on the whole have registered very well. According to our estimates, which must be used with some caution because they are still approximate, the growth of the global cosmetics market should be at plus 4% for the first six months of the year, i.e. a size slowing down compared with the plus 5% of last year.</p>
          <p>The distribution of this growth, however, is different from what it was in 2007. The rest of the world region which I'd like to remind you is now the number one global cosmetic market with 30% of global markets concerned &#x2013; kept a high pace at plus 9.4% compared with 10% in 2007, so practically no slowing down in that region. This region represents close to 35% of the global market. In North America 20%, and this region represents three quarters of the growth of the global market. As you may see on this table the dynamics of the market was very strong on all continents.</p>
          <p>In Asia, we are speeded up. In Latin America and in Eastern Europe, where growth remained at plus 10 &#x2013; at above 10%. All this indications lead us to believe that this dynamic trend should continue at a very strong level during the second half.</p>
          <p>In Japan, the market is again flat and the share of the Japanese market continues to shrink overall globally. In Western Europe, in total, the markets resisted rather well with a growth, which remained at plus 2.5%.</p>
          <p>The distribution of this growth around the countries has indeed changed, but the global rhythm hasn't dropped much. Spain, Great Britain, France and Italy have slowed down, but Germany and the Northern European countries have accelerated or maintained a high growth rate.</p>
          <p>The market, which significantly slowed down and this was &#x2013; this could be expected was of course the North American market where growth was down from 2.9% last year to 0.7% for this first half. It is quite a slowing down, but on the opposite the market remained positive in an economic environment, which was, particularly, adverse to consumption, which is rather good news. The other good news is that, generally speaking, we did not see during this first half a market trend for trading down on the part of consumers on the contrary whether it's in skincare or makeup or hair care, the trend is more towards trading up and this is the case in all of the circuits.</p>
          <p>And on the other hand, there has not been a mass transfer towards private labels, whose share in cosmetics as you know is the lowest in all the categories in consumer products, even though it has been slightly increasing in Europe. In summary, cosmetics market resisted very well during the first half growth wise and value wise, and we believe that this good resistance should continue.</p>
          <p>Then to the positive effects of innovation, which is important in our trade and which constantly renews the interest on the part of consumers and geographically thanks to the appetite for consumption of the new middle classes in emerging countries, which stimulates the global market.</p>
          <p>As regards the growth of our sales during this first half, like-for-like, it was at 5.3% &#x2013; 5.1% excluding Galderma, clearly above the estimated growth of the market. Also if you think in terms of constant exchange rate to estimate the real growth of the penetration of the L'Or&#xE9;al Group on the global cosmetics market, growth was plus 6.8% and reflects a significant increase of the share of the global market for the Group which increased from 15.4% at the end of 2007 to 15.7% at the end of June 2008 and which should finish the year clearly above 16% taking into consideration the consolidation of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9;.</p>
          <p>Coming back to our growth like-for-like during the first half was achieved in a very differentiated way depending on the geographic results. For the rest of the world, which is the number one global market, it continued at a very high pace, 15.7%. In Asia excluding Japan growth reached a four-year record high with 23.5%, driven by China at plus 32% and also with several neighboring countries, which are close to this rhythm such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, Philippines, and even Korea, which is backed on a strong growth path at plus 20%.</p>
          <p>Our Group is probably the one, which process the most. The fact is on this very strategic market for the future. In Japan, business achieved a 4% growth, which is a very honorable performance on a market, which is fast and more competitive than ever.</p>
          <p>In Eastern Europe another very strategic region, which is catching up with the Western Europe, standards of living, our growth continued at a very high pace at plus 25.9%. Our growth was also very strong in Russia, but also in Ukraine, Poland, and practically all of the other countries in the region.</p>
          <p>Our performance, however, was more contrasted in Latin America with a nice growth in Chile, Argentina, Venezuela, but on the contrary, with two major countries this year indicates during this first half, Brazil and Mexico, which saw no growth.</p>
          <p>The good news is that this pause in growth is temporary and these two countries will be back on a growth pattern during the second half and will be again contributing positively to our growth in the country and the region, as they should.</p>
          <p>And in India, there was also a slowdown, which would not be a lasting trend and other countries such as Dubai or South Africa also saw nice growth. In total our growth rhythm remains very strong above plus 15% for the rest of the world and the acceleration of certain countries have been compensated for this temporary slowing down of others.</p>
          <p>We are very confident in our ability to maintain this growth pace during the second half, especially since some of the countries, which were lagging during the first half, should again be contributing positively.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, our growth in sales during the first half was at plus 1.3%. The indications we have from our panel leaders to believe that our sales was rather higher during this period. So that's a rhythm, which is close or identical to the market.</p>
          <p>In consumer products, we have been able to achieve market shares to gain market shares and the growth was higher than that rhythm with very high scores in skincare and makeup.</p>
          <p>In luxury products and professional products, the growth of our sales Group was also higher or equal to the market, which is not the case in active cosmetics were due to an insufficiently strong launch plan and due to the impact of seasonal products, the division did not grow.</p>
          <p>The dynamics of our business on the whole continued to be good in sales Group, in Europe, during the first half, but our order income did not reach the same level, due to a launch plan and store availability, which retrospectively appear to have been too light, and due to tight inventory management by distributors.</p>
          <p>Given our very busy upcoming launch plan, especially during the fourth quarter, we hope to be able to increase our sales Group, and our order income between now and at the end of the year. Our launch plan is very busy and very strong for the end of the year in Europe as elsewhere around the world to give you a few examples, in the Consumer Products division for L'Or&#xE9;al Paris Excel10 and volume Collagen, a great mascara innovation and Elvive Re-Nutrition franchised from L'Or&#xE9;al Paris.</p>
          <p>In the Luxury Products division, it will be a great year for end of the year for Lanc&#xF4;me with the launch of a great new fragrance, Magnifique, which is being launched in Paris and in Europe. A great new lipstick, Le Rouge Absolu, a great innovation in mascara, the first electric mascara oscillation, and a great skin care product launch, R&#xE9;nergie Microlift Night.</p>
          <p>From Armani, the launch of Emporio Armani Diamonds for Men, from Ralph Lauren, there had been no launch for three years in women's fragrances, and there is a very great launch for women, Notorious, which seems to be off to a great start. From Diesel Attacherelle, Fuel for Life unlimited and Amor Amor Tentation. And of course from Yves Saint Laurent, Beaut&#xE9;, which has joined the Luxury division on the 1st of July. See these launches are not due to L'Or&#xE9;al, but there will be a new lipstick, Volupt&#xE9;, from Yves Saint Laurent and the new fragrance B from Boucheron.</p>
          <p>In the Professional Products division, many new initiatives, a new coloring paste, Platinium and the Nature series, and K&#xE9;raskin Esthetics. And finally, in the Active Cosmetics division, a new anti-line product, LiftActiv, a new product, <mark type="inaudible" /> energy from La Roche-Posay, Kerium anti-hair loss, and a powerful anti-age care product, Phloretin Serum from SkinCeuticals. So in total the share of launches in our sales should increase considerably during the second half compared with the first.</p>
          <p>In North America, the market was the hardest hit by the economic recession. Our growth in the first half was of course disappointing at minus 0.5%. Consumer products, our sell-throughs were pretty much on par with market, very slightly positive.</p>
          <p>Our positions are pretty much &#x2013; in keeping the market, our positions remain very strong in hair coloring, makeup and we even saw an improvement in skincare with a confirmation of the success of the new Garnier Nutritionist line, which has gained a 7% market share in the United States, which is a considerably good result.</p>
          <p>Luxury products in the United States, our brand suffered lack of initiatives on the first half of 2008, and that's why we have a very ambitious plan for the rest of the year. We fell behind the market; a very proactive launch plan will help us fight back. We've already heard the first feedback after the launching Notorious by Ralph Lauren and Armani Diamonds for Men and the feedback is extremely positive.</p>
          <p>Professional products, we suffered first time because of our leading position of the shrinking of the market in the hair salon, but that will also mean that we will take full benefit of the upturn of the market when it happens and it will.</p>
          <p>The Body Shop brand in the first half recorded good growth in retail sales of plus 6.1% and sales grew by 7.4% even though like-for-like sales slowed down at 0.9%. The business is currently implementing across all of its point of sales worldwide. Its new image and the new positioning of the brand that refocuses on its central value, natural and ethical values. And Galderma, as you saw, saw an increase in its growth rate on its sales of plus 17.5%. In total as you have gathered our growth for this first half slightly lower than our target of plus 6% outperformed the market nevertheless and has helped us to secure our worldwide positions and even develop them in a very strong way for in these strategic, new strategic markets which are Asia and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>As already said in the press release because of our active launch scheme for the end of the year, all our teams are working hard towards a growth figure that would be higher than in the first half. This growth because of the launch timing should be a lot stronger of the fourth quarter than over the third quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Christian Mulliez's presentation was very clear, in terms of the presentation of the operating profit. I wouldn't want to repeat what you already said. I'd like just to highlight a few points that are significant. First of all, generally speaking, because of the massive exchange rate impact we're suffering this year, which considerably distorts the reading of the operating results, and because of their complete instructions and volatile nature, we decided to present to you our results excluding the currency rate fluctuation which is more representative of the actual profit made by our operations, and this is how we have look at our income from operations for the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>We have an extremely adverse and challenging economic context, nevertheless we are faring very well in this context. And I would like to comment a few items.</p>
          <p>First of all, gross margin, Christian has already explained, ones we re-stage the exchange gains and losses and the impact of the integration of American entities and distributors, the gross margin only dropped by 10 basis points. There would have been an improvement of 20 basis points if the hedging in 2008 had been taken at the same level of 2007. This improvement may seem to be fairly modest, but in fact it's considerable if we look at the exceptional pressure of the increases of cost that we suffered in the first half in terms of the raw material, the packaging items and energy. This is also obtained in all areas because of a number of initiatives. First of all, a maximum level of competition of all our worldwide purchases in four sourcing centers. A total review of our sourcing policy for the raw materials that has been to diversify our sourcing policy, to source our raw materials where we produce and to streamline our raw material catalogue.</p>
          <p>Also another purpose was the total re-engineering of our purchasing processes for packaging items. Considerable progress was made in terms of increased quantities in such purchases, globalization of supplier contracts and a reduction in prices because of lighter weight packaging items.</p>
          <p>Also we want a global deployment of the second phase of our project to renegotiate and reduce cost for all of our indirect purchases and want to continue our efforts to improve productive in all of our factories and the supply chain and this productivity will increase again significantly throughout the year. So a lot of progress will be made that will improve the gross margin, even in an extremely adverse and challenging economic and monetary context. We are firmly convinced that we have to continue making progress in this direction and there will be further areas for improvement and of course the results will be seen in next half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Second point A&amp;Ps, as you can see on this table, like-for-like excluding the integration of American distributors, which is the least we can do to analyze what we've done with our objectives, we can see that the A&amp;Ps established 30.1% of our sales, which is very close to our current level to our normal level, identical to that of the first half of 2006 or the second half of 2007 and slightly higher than the first half of 2007. So it would seem that our sales field is stable.</p>
          <p>In fact, if we look at &#x2013; in terms of the resources deployed, the A&amp;Ps are actually increasing, because as I indicated several times, we are in a period of high productivity gains in the promotional and advertising investment. All our media buying are centralized in buying centers, the latest movement or the latest trend within firms that we outsourced at the beginning of this year are media buying and has led to good streamlining optimization.</p>
          <p>We've been deploying over the last three years across all divisions and across all continents, projects to optimize our purchases and to reduce our costs in terms of merchandising promotion and point of sales advertising, like we do in the industrial area and this is a grateful savings every year. All of this means that with the same level of investment, our A&amp;P costs are in fact increasing and we're doing this because we want a worldwide expansion of our brands and products and this dynamic or this trend should continue throughout 2008.</p>
          <p>Last point the SG&amp;A, as regards to SG&amp;A, Chris Mulliez exclaimed that their weight was stable, including the impact in integration of American distributors and excluding the increase of the IFRS chart on the stock option. Let's not forget that there are currency fluctuations that negatively impact our business in this area because all of our central costs are in euros. We're working more than ever to accelerate our policy for permanent restructuring to optimize our organizations and streamline our cost.</p>
          <p>Just a few examples, we are currently completing, grouping together, all of our subsidiaries in the European countries in common headquarters so as to optimize back office operations. We transferred, at the beginning of this year, to the Directorate for Industrial Purchases, the responsibility for purchasing all of our indirect purchases and this will help get tremendous savings.</p>
          <p>We're also putting resources, we want to adopt to the evolution of distribution in retail and reduce our costs. As you can see, we have stepped up our efforts in these areas and this will produce a number of results and we think that we still have a number of avenues for improvement.</p>
          <p>In total, after all these elements at cost and exchange rate, our P&amp;L has &#x2013; income from operations has increased by 8.5%, our net results have increased by 10.1% because of a reduced tax rate and our NEPS at 12.3% because of the accretive impact of share buybacks.</p>
          <p>So, a lot of progress was made in a quarter that was particularly difficult and challenging, the first half and this really confirms the strength, the efficiency, and the good dynamic of the economic model that we have in the L'Or&#xE9;al Company. Thanks to these projects, since the powerful launch plan for the end of the year. Thanks to the new initiatives taken, as the intensification of our optimization efforts, and the implantation of more stringent cost procedures, we trust that we can safely expect a double-digit growth at constant price of our NEPS for 2008.</p>
          <p>And I'd like to thank you for your kind attention.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>We are ready to move on to questions.</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Emmanuel who's always first. I think he would like a microphone. I'm sorry, someone already has the microphone. Could you turn the lights on up a little more? Guillaume Delmas from Lehman Brothers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Guillaume Delmas from Lehman Brothers. Good morning. First question on advertising and promotion cost. They increased less than your sales during the first half, and others increased their A&amp;P higher. Is that due to a loss in market share as is the case in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd like to interrupt you, says Mr. Agon, we are not losing market shares in the U.S. Our consumer product's market share growth is identical to the market. We have no loss of market share. In the department stores, it's true that our sell through was a little slower than the rest of the markets, for the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question still on advertising and promotion costs. Is it purposely that you're focusing more on margins than organic growth, so &#x2013; or is that due to a policy, which was less intense during the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Answer: well, I think I've answered this already. If you take the example of Lanc&#xF4;me, Lanc&#xF4;me has a very powerful launch plan from the fall season. And it's true that the Lanc&#xF4;me teams are concentrating their sales yield at the time of the launches than at a time when they have no launches. So, for Lanc&#xF4;me, you will see a shifting of expenditure in sales yield during the second half.</p>
          <p>And the other part of the answer is that we always suggest the reading of the half-year results, as we say is not always something that you can extrapolate to the full year, or it's exactly due to that. The phasing if the launches differs from one year to the next, and every year, our investment strategy and our strategy to support our brands may vary from one half to the next. On the substance, our intention is to support our brands and our products more than ever. On the contrary, we are determined to increase our support, but we plan to make it available at the strategic moments, at the time of the launches and not spend money uselessly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question, on raw material. Do you expect a stronger negative impact, due to the cost of the raw materials or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Whoa, says Mr. Agon, I have no crystal ball, but given the evolution of the dollar and oil during these past weeks, and ipso facto, a certain number of other raw materials, I think that we should be getting little good news. But we're crossing fingers, we would like this to be lasting and have a stronger effect. It's been going rather in a better direction during the past three weeks. So we have a few small good news ahead of us, hopefully, and we hope that for next year the situation might be better. Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have three short questions, first of all, what about internal growth in July and August?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what do you mean by that, says Mr. Agon, per week or country per country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, well at the end of August, you should have an indication. There is a lot of optimism for the second half. Have you see this already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the news we have been getting are rather encouraging. Here you talked about sell through, right, so what we see &#x2013; I'll begin with the rest of the world. Everywhere we're getting rather good news regarding good sell-through and brands, which are continuing to increase their market share in all of our divisions. In Europe, the July and August panel are rather good, rather good, whether it's for consumer products or luxury products, and in the U.S. I would say that the situation is more or less the same for consumer products than during the first half, with an improvement which we're beginning to see in luxury products. So in the markets, regarding sell-through, things are going rather in the right direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But does this mean there is always pressure on destocking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, you are asking me a question on the market and the sell-through, I had answered your question. What's your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You are talking more about sell-through. My question was on your internal growth. Is there a discrepancy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Agon. Well, there was &#x2013; I think I was fairly clear. The three or four elements &#x2013; clear elements of information that we have are, number one the markets are rather positive and we're not feeling a major fragility, which is important, because I've read in a lot of papers some concerns &#x2013; okay, this is probably the job of lot of people to be concerned, to be worried. But there are a lot of papers saying there will be a slowing down in consumption of cosmetic products.</p>
          <p>Frankly, we didn't see it during the first half. And if the question is have we been seeing this during the past two months. We haven't been seeing it either. The second answer, which is important, is that when the markets are growing what is important is that your market share should be good too. So, as far as market shares are concerned, my answers are rather positive and encouraging. Thirdly, in terms of sales, since I see that in fact your question is sales for the third quarter, all that to get to that point, I think I answered in my short presentation, where I said that the sales for the first quarter &#x2013; the fourth quarter would be much higher than the sales for the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question is on Brazil and Mexico. What is making you more optimistic? What enables you to expect a reversal of the trend of the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, says is Mr. Agon. I am very happy that you should give me this question, because a lot of people say that the growth model in developing countries is jeopardized, not at all. For those who know the past history of the Group, and obviously in the past we gave out less information. We did not perhaps communicate everything on the background of the countries. But countries like Brazil, over the past 30 years, have been more or less on a roller coaster. It's a sinusoid trend, which is going up with ups and downs. And it's not the first time that this has happened. We're not worried, it's an adjustment in terms of commercial pressure, commercial organization. And we're very confident that after close to nine months of selling down, the selling down began in the second half of 2007. We're already seeing a picking up. I was there a few weeks ago, and things are picking up in the right direction. But you have to accept this.</p>
          <p>The conquest of the world, if you want to conquer all the markets in the world, be present on all the continents, in Eastern Europe, in Asia, in Africa, in Latin America, you can't ask us to be &#x2013; to have a growth rate in each country, in each division that functions like a Swiss clock. I don't have anything against Swiss clocks; on the contrary. But in growth in emerging countries this is not possible for each country. What is important is the concept of clearing house, or compensation. In total, for the dynamics of the rest of the world countries our growth has remained above 15%, and this is strategic, and this is what we've been able to achieve, and I'm very confident that we will be able to continue to achieve this.</p>
          <p>Brazil and Mexico will be accelerating again progressively, and perhaps another country, which I won't mention, may be coughing a bit, and see if growth slowdown, but this is absolutely not a problem. What is for sure &#x2013; is that is what you are looking for, it's not a difficulty for our brands to conquer global markets. What I see around the world is that we have the best brand portfolio to conquer all the global markets, and this goes through highs and lows, and ups and downs, but in total, the pace is sustained at at least 15% a year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're going to have more sustained commercial operations in those countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Sometimes it's reorganization, sometimes it's a change in team, sometimes it's a product launch, sometimes it's a better initiative, sometime it's a change in the sales organization, it's a complicated business. It may seem simple to you, from where you are sitting, but it is complicated business. And for things to work well, and to be able to conquer markets in this way, you have to get everything right, and sometimes there is a little thing that is less fine-tuned, and so you fine tune it again, and you are off to a new start.</p>
          <p>And it's the same thing for India. India saw 10 years of very strong growth at one point; this is an interesting discussion. In those countries, you have steps in development. Emmanuel I remember this is a question you asked me six months ago. You said how come at one point there was a little hiccup in growth in China. Well, it's a same thing in China, China is a wonderful success. We are part of the company that succeeded the best in China, but we had years at plus 50% and years at plus five or plus 10% and then we are off again. And so if you allow me &#x2013; there is no snake in the grass, there is no problem. We're off to growth on all of these markets. And another question we've seen that the market has slowed down a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There was something in your statement that was missing. You talked &#x2013; you didn't talk about price increase. The shift, I think, was more for volume &#x2013; more price and volume and for your competitors, we've seen, I think, an acceleration in the price increase for the second half. What about L'Or&#xE9;al?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our value effect for the first half of 2008 was approximately the same as last year and two years ago, approximately 3% price increase. So the value effect is continuing. Our strategy is price increases, which are consistent with inflation, where it happens, but the real value effect is &#x2013; value increase through innovation. What seems strategic to us is to achieve trading up through increase in value of the product, and there is no change in our strategy regarding that. Regarding the markets, I did provide part of an answer; I said we saw no down trading on the part of consumers, on the contrary, and things are remaining focused in the same direction. Frankly speaking, we did not see a significant change on the market with more or less value. The rhythm was about the same. As to my competitors who say that they will be increasing their prices, I saw in the past that they made a lot of announcements, but they didn't increase their prices a lot. So we'll see what happens on the market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Frederic Coquelle with Exane. I have two questions. Very different questions. First of all, you told us about the differences, category by category, different market trends in Western Europe. Could we also have a &#x2013; the backup slide with the market trends by category for the world this time, not just for Western Europe, but for the world? Growth by category of products, that's what we need. That's the <mark type="inaudible" /> slide.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, we forgot again, Mr. Coquelle. We know that that's the slide you want to see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question is on the market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer your question, on the market share. We're talking about the evolution of the different market categories. Here again, there is no hidden agenda, there's no snake in the grass. Let me just answer very briefly. They've got a reason, they are doing the best on skin care. If I remember well, still doing very well. Makeup? Makeup was also very buoyant over the first half. We saw this in Europe, great increases in market shares for our makeup categories, which is a very good time by the way, when consumers start using more lipstick and other makeup products. It's a good time, I think, for the future. So, positive figures for makeup, hair coloring, bit flat here. The growth level is lower, anyway, and hair care is not increasing as strongly, so in fact, the leading products are skincare and makeup products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What about fragrances?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The growth has slowed down, hasn't it, yes. Perfumes in the first half, that's never a significant because two thirds of the consumption, of annual consumption, is done in the second half. I am talking about the purchases, it's more towards year-end. You know, that's for fragrances, sales for the last two months accounted for 40% of yearly sales, so it's hardly revealing to look at the half-year sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If we look at the trend &#x2013; the market shares for L'Or&#xE9;al in the first half, by smoothing out the different items where needed. I get the impression that in the United States, additionally you are gaining market shares, and forgetting about the professional aspect. Here you haven't been gaining market shares, even in the consumer circuit. I would like to understand what is going on, and if I look category by category, I think that you are gaining market shares in skin products, but not really in fragrances and perfumes. So this is the only place where you are gaining market shares. That's why you're not gaining as many market shares as you used to, that was my first question, and that's why I needed this slide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me give you a very simple answer. First of all, it is true that we have no fragrances in the mass markets. We have our L'Or&#xE9;al brand, L'Or&#xE9;al, Garnier, and Maybelline are present in the America market as consumer products in makeup, where we are leading in the market with 35% of the market share in hair coloring. We are also leading in the market with 65% of the market share. Hair, care we have roughly 10% of the market, and skincare, I think we have now reached 18% of the total market of something of that order. So I think that we have to be honest, so that this year the growth in sell through, I was reading the panels at the end of July, so very recent data, very recent information, I was reading that this morning. Our growth at the end of July for the different brands is pretty much on par with market, between zero and 1%.</p>
          <p>And you're right, we are gaining market shares in skin care, which is a highly strategic battle that we're fighting, because you know that the latest great launch in the United States was the launch of the Nutritioniste line by Garnier. Against Procter, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and the very good news is that, if we look at our market shares, you could see this on the slide, market share reached 7% in July. So we really have a brand, the Garnier brand, which succeeded in hair coloring, which also succeeded in hair care with the launch of Fructis, and you know this story inside out. We are now succeeding in gaining market share in the United States in hair care.</p>
          <p>It's what we call the "green machine;" we're talking here about the green products that are concurring in the American markets. So we're doing better for skin care. For makeup now, we're faring fairly well; in styling, we're doing pretty well here too. Good progress was achieved. We were attacked by Procter &amp; Gamble at the beginning of the year on the Hair Coloring segment which is not <mark type="inaudible" /> bought over a company five years ago, and they are trying to regain market shares, and they have been trying to regain market shares since then.</p>
          <p>And so they have a lot of number of initiatives to regain some market shares, but we are also preparing some initiatives to regain these market shares. So in &#x2013; overall, it's true that for the last six months, we have not gained anything, we have not lost anything. And look at our favorite competitor, and I can see that we have the exact same sell-through level as our competitor at the end of July, or slightly above. So it's true that we don't have the same market shares as we would like to have. I have the same ambition, Mr. Coquelle, it's always good when we gain market shares and where our growth is slightly &#x2013; is significantly higher than that of the market, which is not the case for the first half. But let me tell you that our determination is intact, and we really want to go that route. And it's through the luxury products.</p>
          <p>The first half was rather weak. And it's true that compared to last year, where we had another launch plan. Our launch plan was weaker. We decided to launch Magnifique now in September, rather than earlier this year. Initially, we wanted to launch the perfume in March or April, but my experience, in particular, of American markets has shown me that it was much better to launch a fragrance in September rather than launch it too early on in the year, because you want to launch it shortly before Christmas. So it's true that our launch plan was slightly less ambitious.</p>
          <p>It is true also, to be quite honest that not all products launched last year were as successful as we would have liked them to be. And that's why we have full trust now in the initiatives that I have presented, which seems to be excellent quality, very powerful initiative, indeed, that will help us and have a lot of impact and sustain our growth throughout 2009. Because you know that the growth of the given year is also associated to the successful launches of the previous year. So that there are one or two products that were not as successful as we would have liked them to be. Never mind, we'll fight back. These are going to be very good launches, and I'm sure that they will sustain our market, our sell through, and our income from invoices for the end of the year; for next year also.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. I have a few questions for you on margins, mainly. Especially in the consumer products in the United States, particularly good margin there for consumer products. I would like to know that there are other items that we need to know apart from the improvement in terms of productivity that really boosted this margin to high levels, and could you also tell us about the different zones? Can we explain this improvement in certain zones? There are some zones that are faring better than others.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think that we can answer your question. You know that you are not getting the results per zone when we present the half yearly results. You see that this division fared very well. We have a good growth in this division, which also explains that margin plus 7.1% growth for the division over the first half. Also has an impact on the margins, if you look at our competitors' practices, 7.1% growth in Consumer division, in the Consumer Products division. That's a very good level of performance, and this accounts, to a large extent, for the increase in the margins.</p>
          <p>Another thing that can account for this increase in the margin, I am going to be <mark type="inaudible" /> last year is that we also have a good growth, or we will experience a good growth of our profitability levels in the rest of the world zone &#x2013; which demonstrates that we have to change names. I mean we shouldn't call this rest of the world anymore. It becomes the number one leading market, it's a very important business, very significant business, which is growing, and becoming very profitable, and we have to change the name. So generally speaking, we have some good growth and good profitability, and that accounts for the increase in the margin.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question on Active cosmetics, I get the feeling, diversely, that for this division, whether we are talking about the sales levels or even the profitability level, we have a situation that is somewhat different from what we had in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Given the change of trend in terms of growth of this business, it was a double-digit growth in the past and now we have something hovering around 5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now in terms of profitability, could that have also an impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe we should look at the previous table to answer your question. In terms of profitability, first of all, profitability of Active Cosmetics in the first half is what... You shouldn't state things that are wrong, otherwise the reasoning is distorted. Profitability of Active cosmetics for the first half is always artificially high. For one reason in particular: Active Cosmetics has a lot of seasonal products. Sun products, slimming products, and so on, and seasonal products have not being selling very well over the last two years. I know that we are being accused of saying that it is because of the bad weather that we have a poor performance, whether this is right or wrong it is true that over the last two years, seasonal products in France is it not selling very well, have not been setting very well. And so growth &#x2013; both growth and profitability of Active Cosmetics are somewhat jeopardized by the fact that these seasonal products have not been selling very well. Conversely, as you can see, the profitability gap is set from one half to the second that this is not indicative of the annual profitability.</p>
          <p>Regarding Active Cosmetics profitability, this business has become more difficult in Europe, and this is for two reasons. The first one, let me be quite honest with you here, is that the market itself has slowed down somewhat. One should note that for five or six years, I think this can be explained in the following way, for further ten years maybe, pharmacy was the first channel reaping benefits for the skin care product boom expansion. For quite a number of years it was a very good channel with a lot of innovations and pharmacy gained a lot of market shares in skin care and achieved growth faster than other channels. Now for the last few years, the other channels, our brands and other channels that have seen that there was a good growth there and accelerated their businesses very quickly. L'Or&#xE9;al Paris, of course, is doing very well for skin care in Europe. It's spectacular in a number of countries we are becoming the leading skin care brand in a spectacular fashion. It's a sort of not some gains sometimes. I mean they have transfers there rebalancing &#x2013; rebalances and so. So the market of cosmetic products and pharmacies &#x2013; this market has been slowing down for quite some years in Europe. And the second point and this is something we should state also, is that there was a proliferation of competing brands in these &#x2013; in this channel.</p>
          <p>I was told yesterday, for example, that there were 20 new small brands that cropped up in French pharmacies for skin care, organic brands, bio brands, green brands etcetera. And of course, they are encroaching on our premises, they are encroaching the premises of the leading brands. I am not all that worried over them in the medium term because I think that these brands are not going to hold up for very long and we will regain, thanks to our strong initiatives, thanks to the leadership, we will regain market shares and growth. But it's true that growth is not as easy as it used to be in the pharmacy channel in Europe as it was a few years back. However, we are still selling very well in new emerging markets, where L'Or&#xE9;al is really the leading company for this category. It's interesting because it is in L'Or&#xE9;al <mark type="inaudible" /> Vichy that invented skin care and pharmacies, that was 50 years ago that was started. And it's really L'Or&#xE9;al that invented &#x2013; came up with this concept of skin care and pharmacies and made it a global trend. We planted it in Brazil, in Russia, in China, and L'Or&#xE9;al is continuing to globalize this business. The growth of active cosmetics in the world is still tremendous. Next year, I think, that China will be the first worldwide Vichy country for face care, which is a milestone, which is an incredible achievement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Concerning like I said &#x2013; last question, concerning YSL Beaut&#xE9;, could you give us few more indications now that the integration has been achieved and what is the first progress for this brand following integration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's still very recent. I can tell probably what I can. Things are going very well. It was very well prepared by the Luxury Products division at 9 'o clock in the morning all the Luxury divisions of L'Or&#xE9;al everywhere where there was YSL subsidiaries met with the Saint Laurent teams to welcome them, to work together they are working very closely together, Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; has joined the Luxury Products division. They are working hard on new projects and operations in all different countries first of all. Number two, the strategy has been confirmed. We considered that Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; &#x2013; Yves Saint Laurent is one of the greatest brands in the world of Luxury. We wanted to make it one of the top brands in the world and we are discovering when working with them that they have true real experience in makeup. And we will probably learn things from them and develop stronger things in the area of makeup. We think we can help them with great successes in fragrances. 20 years ago Yves Saint Laurent had great successes in perfumes, and they have had less successes in the recent years and we believe that with our laboratories and our marketing teams, we can help them and we will help them develop skincare products because they are very weak in that area and it's a key element for the Asian markets in particular. So we will be developing a high quality Yves Saint Laurent skincare line. So the teams are working together. We appointed someone at the head of the Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; who comes from L'Or&#xE9;al Renard Delisceau, who previously was in charge of Giorgio Armani and who had a wonderful success with Giorgio Armani during the past five years and we want to do the same thing for the next five years. And we're very confident, are you happy with this, want anything else?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we gave you the past figures. And we told you what the impact for 2008 would be. Slightly accretive effect and half would be step up et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's too early for figures, says Mr. Agon. What we planed to do for YSL is what we were able to achieve for Armani, speed up growth of sales in a spectacular way both through product innovation and through globalization of the brand in the three categories. And as I indicated, at the time of the acquisition, increased profitability, a lot during the next year, so that it can reach the profitability of the Luxury Products division. Emmanuel is noting down every word that I am saying. And so we're very confident and the integration of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; is complete, it's total; it's not something which remains <mark type="inaudible" />. It's not a business which remains ring fenced it is completely integrated into the division and it will benefit from all the elements of the division, and it will also contribute its contribution to the division. So I think the pattern is very clear. We are very confident, and by the way, this will enable us to soon become the world leaders in Luxury Beauty, which is a great ambition.</p>

          <p>You, sir. Deutsche Bank. I have two short questions. You announced an army of new products for the second half and especially for the fourth quarter. So things are clear. The percentage invested in A&amp;P will increase?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't be clear then what I have said already, says Mr. Agon. I was very clear in what I said already. Okay and then there will be strong support for our launches.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly, says Mr. Agon, I think this is a bad quarter on that point. If you look at the amount of investment, excluding the American distributors because you have to compare what is comparable otherwise you are saying anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am talking about a constant structure &#x2013; says the representative from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When looking at the evolution of the rate, says Mr. Agon. What are we talking about? We have support for our brands, which is high which is strong. It may vary from one division to next based on initiative and I'd like to repeat that we have major launches that will be taking place during this &#x2013; towards the end of the year and they will be strongly supported. And there is no change and I wish to repeat this and insist in case it wasn't clear, there is no change in the L'Or&#xE9;al model. It's a top-line model, it's a growth model and I am very confident in our ability to return to growth above 6%. I consider that that first half was particularly difficult first half for a lot of reasons and it is not the symptom of a structural difficulty of L'Or&#xE9;al in achieving growth above 8%. I'd like to remind you that in this room two years ago in 2006 when we achieved five something or other. I said we would go back to six. There were a lot of people who had doubt. We went back to six. There is no problem in the model. There is no problem in the determination of the team to reach that. And this growth is achieved through support for major innovations. So there is no nuance and no qualification in what we say. I don't want to be the black sheep in the room. But the reason why I insist that is that we've seen in industry that the companies which slightly reduced their advertising and promotion budget in percentage of their sales have seen a slowing down of their growth and those who maintained or increased their advertising and promotion costs, saw their sales increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for this piece of information, says Mr. Agon. This has not escaped my attention, but what I want to say from the bottom of my heart is that the L'Or&#xE9;al model is a market share conquest model, it's a top line growth model, and this conquest is obtained through a support for initiatives. So there is no change in the model. On the contrary, and at plus 5.3% on one half compared with 6%, I don't think that is sufficient to put a model into question.</p>
          <p>And I will be adamant to demonstrate that L'Or&#xE9;al will go back to a strong growth with a model it has always followed, and I believe that we're able to conquest market shares more quickly on developed markets, which were very competitive; we forget to say this.</p>
          <p>Why has our growth been a little more difficult during the first half than in the past in the U.S. or Western Europe? Well, it is because markets have never been more competitive. Everyone is fighting and it's a tough fight. I'm very confident as to our ability to comeback for the same reasons always. Innovation, support to the launches, market share gains and we will complete that with gains in strategic positions and the markets of tomorrow. I don't know whether we will still be here together 10 years from now. But the number one market on the chart behind me will be China. And in your minds China will be as important as the U.S.</p>
          <p>And you will be asking me, have you defended or increased your market shares in China, which will &#x2013; is the number one global market, so this doesn't exclude anything. We are conquering dominant market shares in strategic areas; Asia and Eastern Europe probably the most strategic parts of areas for the future. We are building in the countries for the future and we will be also developing our market shares in the developed countries. There is no qualms about that, and frankly the difference in growth between 5.3 and 6 is not much. The difference between order income and sell-through in Europe on its own privately explains the difference because our sell-through was above our income, okay tough luck; that was life &#x2013; but it's not going to last.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well since 2004, we have progressively been covering the charge, the impact of stock options, why since 2004? We have long stock option plans, five years, so we've taken them one by one, which began with 20% in 2004, 40% in 2005, and this is the last year where we have been powering up. So this explains 10 basis points increase in SG&amp;A for the first half and for the full year and as I indicated that the good news is that in 2009 this will no longer increase. So it will go on living its own life but there will no longer be this methodological increase.</p>

          <p>Christine Ahsita, LSA, could you comment your performance on the French market in retail, and give here the outlook for the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're going down to details. Our market shares, as far as I know, remains stable or have even slightly increased during the first half, and here again our sell-out has been rather good. But the French market has not been doing great and it has not become better during the summer. But we cannot do anything about this. What we can do is try to gain market shares and grow and this I think is what we've been trying to do.</p>
          <p>These are minor gains because we already have a very high market share in France, 56%. We already have 56% of the market, and you're continuing to gain market shares; it means a great effort, but we are determined to do that. And when you have 56% of the market, you already are very much bound to the way your market is going, and the French market has not been easy.</p>
          <p>So here again the market growth is also related to innovation, and I believe that all the launches we are putting out, in coloring for instance, Excel10 is a great innovation. It enables you in 10 minutes to have a great color, a factor of the covering of white hair and it strengthens your hair also.</p>
          <p>Innovations such as that one enables you not only to gain market shares, but give new impetus to the hair coloring market. I think it's the role of manufacturers to put in innovation, which will give you impetus to the market in France.</p>

          <p>Natalie Misterant from Rogers. I would like to know your forecast for the growth of the earnings &#x2013; net earning per share, will it be two-digit on a constant rate and one-digit in reported figures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we will see, says Mr. Agon. By definition, reported is not something we control. So our ambition that we have stated is given a very adverse monetary effect we think in terms of constant rates, which is the only thing we can commit to you. It's impossible to commit to a result in euros when the euro is unpredictable, increased by 5.5% on average during the first half, was changing all the time. And we don't know where it's heading. So it makes no sense to commit to growth in euros in such circumstances. So we are committing to a growth excluding monetary effects. And depending on where the euro is it will fall where it falls. But this concept is very important. You shouldn't get your priorities wrong. The real priority is the performance of the business, of the company, real performance, but not optical performance compared with an extremely volatile monetary situation. I think it's healthier to think in those terms.</p>

          <p>And by the way I have a short comment. I read in one article, perhaps it's the first time that they will not be able to achieve their double-digit growth in euros. What we will see &#x2013; it's not already decided and it's just to be seen in French francs. And if you think about this on the long term, it's probably more difficult to do double-digit growth in euros in constant terms than in French francs. So I have no problem with this.</p>

          <p>The exchange rates are highly volatile. This has to be taken <mark type="inaudible" /> in dollars and the EPS increased by 24.8% in the first half. I think it's highly volatile &#x2013; there is nothing you can say to predict what will happen. Nonetheless, I think I would be very surprised by what will happen currency wise as Warren Buffett says, it's when the sea is drawing back that you can see who is bathing without a bathing suit and when the sea will retire we will see economic realties that will be somewhat different from what we're expecting. So we'll have to wait for the tide. And we have been breaking with very high adverse monthly impacts over the last few years and the trend is going to be reversed some day and we will see what happens then.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two or three additional questions, if I may. The first one is as follows; you made a rather short, too short, presentation we think of our annual results regarding restructuring of the supply chain. Maybe there is a source of hope in this area. Maybe there will be fewer differences between the sellouts and the internal growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Quite frankly this &#x2013; you are mixing up apples and pears. Let me say this quite frankly problems of sellouts and growth are problems of implementation. We have to accept the fact that we are doing a business here. We are in the business, which is a sporadic business. It's not a smooth business. I don't know what I could compare it with. Maybe it's the same with the bottling of milk. Maybe people are consuming the same amount for bottles of milk everyday. But when it comes to cosmetics it's very sporadic. It's very erratic that great mountains, great initiatives that are launched and once the great launch or great initiative is successful, it's a major hit and it's getting a great growth trend; when it's a moderate success then there is a lot in stock and inventories and we have to sell from inventories stage we are on. They are large promotional activities.</p>
          <p>So it's not something happens without a hitch that is very smooth. And you have to understand that the L'Or&#xE9;al Group's result is the amount of accumulation of all of these sporadic events, and there are about 20 events are happening per country, in every country, that's impossible to have a linear growth. So some times you can smooth out some elements and there are competition phenomena, but it's business where there are lots of initiatives, there are different offerings that are made sporadically and it's not necessarily a linear evolution and the supply chain reorganization will not change anything. What we want to do is improve our service rate which is very important to the customers, we want cut out costs, which is important for us and we will manage that and we also want to use our stock, inventory as much as possible, which is also very important. But this will not change much to the actual structure of our business. I'm no expert in this field, but I thought that it would be easier to follow the levels of inventories as the retailers and see exactly what are the sell-through or sell-out levels of the retailers to make sure that we won't have to sell from inventories later on.</p>
          <p>Well, take Wal-Mart, if you work with Wal-Mart or when you work with Wal-Mart, quite frankly you have no impact, you have no influence over its inventories levels. However, I am very familiar with Wal-Mart, I've worked with them for five years. Wal-Mart asked us do not a number of major operations, they will ask you to carry out the major launches to put display racks in all of the centers to maximize the presence of your products and this obviously creates a great effect or impact. There are up and downs, so there is great erratic fluctuation. It is all due to the actual nature of the business that we have. That being said regarding the supply chain or production side of things, we will continue cutting down our costs. We have a very strong serious ambitions to cut down on our cost levels to continue with our permanent restructuring process. We'll do this and apply ourselves to do this. It's not a change of model that we have as an ambition. It's not that we're doing <mark type="inaudible" /> top line. We continue with our objectives as a top line objective and we will do what we need to do, in terms of the bottom line, but we will continue to restructure to improve our productivity.</p>

          <p>Second point, it would seem that the pollution due to the consolidation impact &#x2013; the impact of the consolidation of your distributors in your P&amp;L this effect will be lower, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Then we will give you results like-for-like, but in the second half we will have to take into account this impact. There are three such distributors Maly's West and the other one that were acquired. Maly's West was acquired, one was in April, and the other one was in the 1st July of 2007, which means that we will have the full effect in the first half and second half of 2008. We will be bit more specific and formal in our presentation if it helps you. We can give you more precise data. It's normal that we should give you such data, otherwise why should we engage in an analysis of the situation? It's important to tell what the situation is and to give you the relevant figures, if you compare things with different scopes of consolidation, then it's not very meaningful than the acquisition of American distributors. Of course, this has an impact on the gross margin, but it's a highly strategic acquisition for all the reasons that were explained, to renew direct contacts with hair salons, for example. So of course we have to take that impact into account. One last point on The Body Shop, we have understood that this naivet&#xE9; was very marked, and that profitability was derived especially from sales in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When are you going to try to improve the profitability of The Body Shop, as of when?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I have already told you this, but I'll repeat to you the same thing with great pleasure. We are starting the second phase. We had started with the first phase, which was the phase of integration, soft integration phase of The Body Shop into our Group. It was very strategic choice that we've made. And I'm not sorry we made that choice. You remember that The Body Shop was &#x2013; had a completely different culture from that of the rest of the Group. And we had solved that in order to be able to adopt The Body Shop Company. At L'Or&#xE9;al we had to go about it very smoothly and progressively.</p>
          <p>Hence the idea of keeping the management team, the ring fencing strategy was very much needed. We are very happy to have them. We get on well with them. Now we have to move to the stage two. Stage two, phase II will be a lot more dynamic than phase I. We've already changed our management team. We are not saying that people are better, but they are different. The Head of The Body Shop is Ms. Sophie Gasperment who was the Head of The Body Shop in UK, the Head of Management &#x2013; the top manager was also the one in the UK. Mr. Philip Clough is the Brand Manager, he was the Kiehl's Manager, Human Resources personnel also comes from the L'Or&#xE9;al team.</p>
          <p>So we now have a fully-fledged L'Or&#xE9;al management team and we are now embarked on stage two of this integration to maximize and optimize this business. To be quite honest with you, it's not all that easy. If you look at the consumption patterns or say things in purchase and sales team our competitor pattern better works in United States. It's not the easiest situation or environment to operate in but this doesn't mean that we have not full trust and determination to improve, to make progress in this business. And of course the progress will be gradual in the course of the year as I have already said and always said in the past, has to be gradual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And from Lazard, talking about developed countries and the volume of price evolution that we've said that is trig marked during the first half as the price secured about 3%, volume impact significantly negative in the United States and more slightly so in Europe. I have thought that the women use earlier and earlier and late in later beauty products and that, men were resorting to these products more and more. Now talk &#x2013; maybe you could say something about the different evolution in volumes in your market. If you take your &#x2013; a bit study easy, if you look at volumes that fairly &#x2013; they're probably very stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said earlier that market was improving by 2.5 to 3% the value effect probably identical, if you accumulate the price and increase in value. So the volumes are stable that much is true. But I think you're right, deep down, to say that in the long term men and women are using and will be using more and more cosmetic countries, but this doesn't mean &#x2013; the cosmetic products &#x2013; but this is not something that will be true for every half years. It's true that if you look at the consumer patterns in Europe, in the UK for example, the less enthusiasm than there was last year, for example. And the same is true in France, too. Consumption is not really up. This is a timely hit, probably people are worried about the purchasing power. Everybody is being very careful about what they are buying. This doesn't mean that over the medium and long-term the cosmetics markets will not be buoyant. Because as you were saying, with the aging of the population, with the development of the consumption of some product by men or because of innovation markets will improve and increase. But we can accept the idea that this is not a linear growth. We have to accept that in our business there are ups and downs and it's not smooth. Whatever the moment and the circumstances, things will change. I know you happened to know the American market where I have worked. They are also times where things speed up and other times where they slow down. We are at a time where consumption in the United States is slowing down. I have full trust that it will pick up again. The only question is when would it start picking up again. But there is no doubt that it will pick up eventually. Now, I was also thinking that when things don't go well we find little competition by &#x2013; regarding to purchases over small cosmetics products than buying a new car for example. I think that you are absolutely right. That being said, there are other things that come into play, and people need to buy a lot of things. And they buy mobile phones, for example, another thing that I think is competing with us, when it is a bit tight money wise and you have to careful about what you spend, but we feel that the cosmetics products is also linked to the moods of consumers, it is not just to do with purchasing power. I think that consumers spend about 2 to 3% of their resources on cosmetics products.</p>
          <p>So it's not a strategic decision on the part of the family to buy cosmetic products and it's a harder decision also to say, I am going to cut down on my expenses of &#x2013; on my purchases of cosmetic products. It all depends on how well you feel about spending money on such products, the money you have in your pocket, it all depends on your mood. If you are in a good mood, you will have an eternity to buy this product, if you are in a bad mood or if you feeling slightly down, then you will not buy them. And that's why in the United State we have seen that there was a close link with the trust index of the consumers, but overall in the long term it won't change anything and it won't change anything to the fact that it is up to us to try to convince the consumers by innovation, by better product, more interesting products.</p>
          <p>There is a good example, the new mascara called electric &#xD4;scillation by Lanc&#xF4;me. It's a nice way, I think, of developing consumption or boosting consumption because it's a real technological progress. The result is unheard of and spectacular and it sells for a lot more money than traditional product. Not everybody will buy it. But for all consumers that will be tempted. It's a way of increasing the value of the current products. And we're developing the sales. So we have to develop innovations to boost the market <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You told us that the Chinese market was a strategic market for the next 10 or 15 years. Could you be more precise and tell us about this huge or very large market? What are your position in China? How is the retail structure there, and what is the rate of the local players? Are Chinese players attracted by large international brand or is this market is going to be captured by Chinese players?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just a short answer, I could give you a very lengthy answer, just in a few words, the Chinese market is highly strategic because it is already becoming the leading market. It's not &#x2013; in not in the next 10 or 15 years, the Chinese market is already the leading market for a number of products. I think mobile phones, for example, digital computers, personal computers etcetera. So already we have the situation and Chinese market will become in the next five years the leading market for certain categories, for other categories as well. For us it is definitely becoming the leading market. As of next year it will be the first &#x2013; the leading market for Vichy; next year it would the leading market for L'Or&#xE9;al Body in skincare. So we are not talking about the distant future or we are not talking about the distant dream, we are talking about an immediate intangible reality. That was number one. Number two, competitions in this market are excellent. We have a chart here to show you what our situation is. We've started this business in 1997, so it's not that long ago. We now have, I think, 11% of the market starting from zero in 1997. Procter had moved from 20 to 23 and <mark type="inaudible" /> from 2 to 6 and have very strong positions because we are almost number one across all of the market segments that we attacked. Number one professional products for hair salons, number one for luxury products. Let me look at the first chart, number one for luxury products, with Lanc&#xF4;me is the first luxury brand and the first Luxury division in China. We are number one in pharmacy with <mark type="inaudible" /> Vichy and ... in particular; we are number one in consumer makeup with Maybelline on the most markets. And our next battles or next objective will be to be number one for skincare and I think we are well underway already to achieve this objective. So, things are going extremely well in China for us. And number three local competitors are not very dynamic in our area. I think that the Chinese have chosen a number of strategic areas to develop local Chinese brands that will capture large part of their markets. It's not the case for cosmetics product. There are relatively few Chinese brands. And let me remind you that we've bought over one that was the most promising to us, which is the Yue-Sai brand which is currently developing under Chinese markets. So it is indeed a market that is of high strategic significance, it's not an exotic market, it's a strategic market for us.</p>

          <p>Further questions or is everything clear? If it's clear, that's fine. I would just like to conclude with just a few words and remind you of the main points. Number one, cosmetic markets are resisting well and we have good reason to believe that they will continuing to resist. And our growth, even though it was slightly below, we were able to continue gaining market shares. And I think 2008 will remain a remarkable year for gaining market shares and there will be as far as growth is concerned we are absolutely determined to go back to a 6% growth rate to, why 6% because it's seems logical on a market which grows at about 4%. We will return to that figure progressively. And I told you that for the rest of year, I'm not changing what we said in the press release. All of our teams are mobilized to reach 6%. And we are confident in our ability to come close to that figure and our growth will be significantly better in the first quarter than in the third. And this first half results demonstrate that even with a difficult economic situation, with adverse conditions, this demonstrates the ability of the L'Or&#xE9;al model to develop and generate profit.</p>
          <p>So, thank you all for having come this morning and see you all very soon.</p>
