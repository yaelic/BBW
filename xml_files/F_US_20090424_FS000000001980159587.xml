          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ford Motor Company's Fixed Income Earnings Conference Call. My name is Katina and I'll be your coordinator for today. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. David Dickenson, Fixed Income Investor Relations Manager. Please proceed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Katina, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like thank you for spending time with us this morning.</p>
          <p>With me this morning are Peter Daniel, Ford Senior Vice President and Controller; K.R. Kent, Ford Credit Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Schloss, Ford Vice President and Treasurer. We also have some other members of management who are joining us for the call, including David Brandeis, Assistant Treasurer, Mike Seneski, Assistant Treasurer; and Mark Kosman, Director of Global Accounting.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I'd like to review a couple of quick items. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the slides we will be using today have been posted on Ford Motor Company's Investor and Media websites for your reference. We have one correction to a slide and that's on Slide 14. The date should show as March 31, 2009. Some slides may be showing it as 2008.</p>
          <p>The financial results discussed herein are discussed on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. Additionally, the financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis, and in some cases, on a non-GAAP basis. Any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are reconciled to their GAAP equivalent as part of the Appendix to the slide deck.</p>
          <p>Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here. Additional information about the factors that could affect future results is summarized at the end of the presentation. These risk factors are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual, quarterly, and current reports to the SEC.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn to call over to Ford's Senior Vice President and Controller, Peter Daniel. Peter?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. Turning to Slide One, I'll begin by reviewing the key financial results. As shown at the top of the slide, vehicle wholesales in the first quarter were 973,000 units, down 558,000 from the same period in 2008. First quarter revenue was 24.8 billion, a 14.4 billion decrease from a year ago. The decrease is primarily explained by lower volume and unfavorable exchange, partly offset by higher net pricing.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter pre-tax operating loss excluding special items was about 2 billion over a 2.2 billion decline from a year ago, when we were profitable. This decline included 2.5 billion in Automotive and 126 million in Financial Services. Our first quarter net loss attributable to Ford was 1.4 billion, including a pre-tax special items gain of 362 million. We ended the quarter with 21.3 billion of cash, down about 7.4 billion from a year ago. This will be discussed in more detail later.</p>
          <p>On Slide Two, we cover special items, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of 362 million in the first quarter. In North America, we recorded a charge of 171 million, largely related to personnel reduction programs in the U.S. We recorded a gain for job security benefits of 292 million, which primarily relates to the elimination of the Jobs Bank, which was part of the modified agreement reached with the UAW.</p>
          <p>We recognized a 81 million dealer-related charge, which primarily reflects the investment write-off related to the proposed sale of dealerships in the dealer development program. This initiative provides an opportunity for qualified operators to become private capital owners of the dealership.</p>
          <p>We recorded a charge of 178 million for retiree health care and other related costs, which is primarily related to the UAW retiree health care VEBA agreement. We recognized a 1.3 billion gain primarily associated with the repurchase of 2.2 billion of our term loan debt and 234 million of unsecured notes. This reflected the difference between the book value of the debt and the market price at which the debt was repurchased. During the second quarter, we expect to realize about 3.4 billion gain on the debt restructuring completed in early April. Our debt restructuring actions will be covered in more detail later.</p>
          <p>At the end of the first quarter, based on the status of our strategic review of Volvo, we concluded that the criteria for held for sale status has been met, triggering an impairment test that resulted in an impairment charge of about 700 million. This amount reflects the difference between the book value and estimated fair market of Volvo as held for sale, net of estimated disposal costs. Finally, we recorded an impairment of our equity investment in diversified financial operations partnership of a non-core lease asset.</p>
          <p>Slide Three shows Automotive cash and cash flow. We entered the first quarter with 21.3 billion of gross cash, up 7.9 billion from the fourth quarter 2008. Our Automotive operating-related cash flow was 3.7 billion negative in the first quarter, reflecting an automotive pre-tax loss of 1.9 billion. Capital spending during the quarter was about 300 million higher than depreciation and amortization.</p>
          <p>Changes in working capital resulted in over 1 billion of positive cash flow due to higher payables, lower inventories and lower receivables. This improvement, however, was more than offset by timing differences in marketing, warranty, retiree health care payments and in-transit receivables. Payment of 500 million to Ford Credit reflecting a change to up-front payment of subvention. Excluding the impact of the change to up-front subvention payments, our Automotive operating-related cash flow was 3.2 billion negative.</p>
          <p>This outflow in the first quarter is less than half of the outflow during each of the third and fourth quarters of 2008, despite further decline in volume, in part related to actions taken to reduce dealer stocks. The improvement is due primarily to improved working capital, lower automotive pre-tax losses and lower net spending.</p>
          <p>Other changes in gross cash that in total more than offset the operating-related cash flow included personnel reduction programs of 300 million, pension contributions of 400 million, net impact of two billion related to the conversion of assets in the temporary asset account set aside for the VEBA health care trust into a new Ford note, as discussed in January, and accessing our revolver line of credit of 10.1 billion, also discussed in January. Including all of these impacts, the total increase in gross cash during the first quarter was 7.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Now onto Slide Four, which shows the status of our 2009 first quarter planning assumptions and operational metrics. Total industry volume during the first quarter was equal to a SAAR of 9.8 million units in the US and 14.8 units in the 19 markets we track in Europe. We expect the full year U.S. industry volume to be at the lower end of the range previously defined, based on the present economic environment, with potential upside in the second half of the year from government fiscal stimulus programs, and the potential for a fleet modernization program.</p>
          <p>As a result of the implementation of government stimulus programs focused on replacing older vehicles with more fuel-efficient ones, European industry volume now is expected to be higher than our plan, in the range of 13.5 to 14.5 units.</p>
          <p>On the operational metrics, initial quality of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles improved in the U.S. by 5% as compared to last year, surpassing Honda and essentially tying Toyota for the overall lead, according to the latest global quality research system study of U.S. vehicle quality. International operations show improvement in the latest GQRS initial quality results, with the exception of Europe, where we experienced some near-term issues, which we're working to address. Customer satisfaction with vehicle quality is improving in North America, Europe and Asia, reaching its highest levels ever in North America.</p>
          <p>Automotive structural costs were reduced by 1.9 billion, which is on track to exceed our plan. U.S. market share was 13.9, and retail share of retail market was 12.7, which are both consistent with our plan. European market share was 9.4, on track with our plan. Automotive operating-related cash flow was 3.7 billion negative, again on track with our plan, and our capital expenditures were 1.4 billion, also consistent with our plan.</p>
          <p>Onto Slide Five. As previously announced, we have completed debt restructuring initiatives that have reduced automotive debt by 10.1 billion of par value, and will lower annual interest payments by more than 500 million. Ford and Ford Credit utilized 2.6 billion in cash plus 468 million shares of Ford common stock to complete the debt restructuring. The term line was completed March 27 and will be reflected in our first quarter financial statements. The other major components of the debt restructuring we completed April 8, and will be reflected in our second quarter financial statements. This successful debt restructuring, coupled with previously announced agreements with the auto union, will substantially strength Ford's balance sheet.</p>
          <p>I will now turn it over to K.R.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>Slide Six shows Ford Credit's operating results and key metrics for the first quarter of 2009. We simplified this slide and the credit loss metric slide to focus more towards on balance sheet metrics, due to the liquidation of our off balance sheet receivable portfolio. For example, off balance sheet receivables are now only about $500 million.</p>
          <p>As shown in the left box, our first quarter pre-tax loss was $36 million, compared with a $32 million pre-tax profit in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Shown below the left box, excluding the impact of net losses related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives, the pre-tax loss was $12 million compared with $194 million pre-tax profit in the same period of 2008.</p>
          <p>Net losses related to market valuation adjustments were 24 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared with net losses of 162 million in the same period last year.</p>
          <p>You can see in the box on the right, our March 31 on balance sheet receivables were $104 billion, about $39 billion lower than a year ago. Our managed receivables were $106 billion, about $42 billion lower than a year ago. This decline primarily reflects lower industry volumes, lower dealer stocks, changes in currency exchange rates, and the impact of divestitures and alternative business arrangements.</p>
          <p>At March 31, 2009, both on balance sheet and managed receivables were 12 billion lower than the fourth quarter 2008. This decline primarily reflected lower receivables in North America and Europe, reflecting lower industry volumes, lower dealer stocks, and the transition of Jaguar, Land Rover, and Mazda financing to other financing providers. Our financing share of the U.S. Ford, Lincoln and Mercury retail installment and lease contracts was 31% in the first quarter 2009. This was six points lower than the same period last year, which was more than explained by our reduction in leasing.</p>
          <p>Charge offs for on balance sheet receivables in the first quarter were $332 million and the worldwide loss-to-receivable ratio was 121 basis points, up 57 basis points from last year, and I'll speak more on this in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>On March 31, the allowance for credit losses for on balance sheet receivables was $1.7 billion or 160 basis points of receivables. The allowance was about $45 million higher than fourth quarter of 2008, and up about $500 million from a year ago.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, we completed a cash tender offer for a portion of Ford's senior secured term loan debt for $1.1 billion of cash. This debt was distributed to our parent, Ford Holdings, LLC, whereupon it was forgiven. This distribution of $1.1 billion is consistent with our previously announced plans to pay total distributions of about $2 billion through 2010. We will balance additional returns of capital with the successful execution of our funding plan.</p>
          <p>At March 31, our managed leverage was 10 to 1, compared with 9.5 to 1 at March 31, 2008, and compared at 9.9 at the end of 2008. At the end of the first quarter 2009, our equity was about $9.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide Seven explains the change in Ford's Credit's pre-tax profits for the first quarter of 2009, compared with the first quarter of 2008. As previously mentioned, Ford Credit's pre-tax loss was 36 million in the first quarter, a $68 million decline from a year ago. The decrease in earnings primarily reflected lower volume and a higher provision for credit losses. These factors were offset partially by lower depreciation expense for leased vehicles and lower net losses related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives. Lower operating costs were offset partially by higher other expenses, including restructuring costs.</p>
          <p>Volume was lower compared with a year ago, reflecting the decline in the receivables. The increase in the provision for credit losses was more than explained by higher repossessions, higher severity, lower recoveries, and higher wholesale and dealer loan losses in the U.S., and higher credit losses in Spain and Germany.</p>
          <p>Residual losses declined in the first quarter compared with last year. This decline primarily reflects lower residual losses on vehicles returned in the first quarter of 2009, and lower depreciation expense. Ford Credit's first quarter auction values improved compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, but we expect them to continue to remain volatile.</p>
          <p>Our International segment, which is primarily Europe, was profitable in the first quarter of 2009, although at a lower level than in the same period last year, primarily reflecting a higher provision for credit losses, changes in currency exchange rates, and lower volumes. However, our North American segment was unprofitable in the first quarter of 2009, primarily reflecting lower volume and a higher provision for credit losses, offset partially by lower depreciation expense for leased vehicles.</p>
          <p>Slide Eight shows quarterly trends of charge-offs and loss-to-receivable ratios for our on-balance sheet portfolio. The top box shows loss-to-receivable ratios for the worldwide portfolio and loss-to-receivable ratios for the U.S. Ford Lincoln and Mercury Retail and Lease business. Both worldwide and U.S. Ford Lincoln and Mercury loss-to-receivable ratios are up in the first quarter of 2009 from year ago levels, primarily reflecting higher repossessions, higher severity, lower recoveries, and higher wholesale and dealer loan losses in the U.S. as well as higher credit losses in Spain and Germany.</p>
          <p>The worldwide first quarter 2009 lost to receivable ratio was slightly worse than the fourth quarter of 2008. Ford Lincoln and Mercury U.S. first quarter 2009 loss-to-receivable ratio on the Retail and Lease business improved from the fourth quarter 2008, reflecting lower severity and higher recoveries, offset partially by higher repossessions.</p>
          <p>Charge-offs in the first quarter 2009 were $332 million, which was up $103 million from a year ago, reflecting the same factors mentioned before.</p>
          <p>Slide Nine shows the primary drivers of credit losses in the U.S. Ford Lincoln and Mercury Retail and Lease business. Repossessions in the first quarter were 25,000 units, up 5,000 units from the first quarter of 2008 and up 3,000 units from the fourth quarter of 2008. Severity of $9,300 in the first quarter was $500 higher than last year, primarily due to a higher mix of 72-month contracts for vehicles repossessed in our portfolio. Severity was $1,400 lower than fourth quarter of 2008, more than explained by improvements in auction values in the used vehicle market.</p>
          <p>While averaging $9,300 a unit in the first quarter, we saw steady improvements in each month ending at $8,800 severity in March. This is primarily a reflection of the improvements in the auction market.</p>
          <p>Over 60-day delinquencies totaled 29 basis points in the first quarter; up one basis point from the fourth quarter of 2008. Although still low and within our expectations, delinquencies are up seven basis points from last year.</p>
          <p>Bankruptcy filings total 11,000 in the first quarter, up 1,000 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 3,000 from the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>The credit quality of our contract placements remain very good. We continue to closely monitor all key loss metrics above for any additional deterioration related to broader trends in the overall economy.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 shows the lease residual performance for the Ford and Lincoln Mercury U.S. brands. Lease return volumes total 44,000 units in the first quarter, down 4,000 from the first quarter of 2008. And return rates were up three points to 89%, consistent with auction values that were lower than expected at the time of contract purchase. In the first quarter, auction values for 24- and 36-month leased vehicles at constant mix were down on average about $300 per unit and $400 per unit, respectively, from year ago levels, primarily reflecting the overall auction value deterioration in the used-vehicle market.</p>
          <p>However, compared with the prior quarter, auction values were up dramatically by about $2,100 a unit and $1,500 a unit for 24 and 36-month leased vehicles respectively. Lease placements continue to shift toward cars and crossovers, and away from full-sized trucks and SUVs. In the first quarter, cars and crossovers represented 88% of new placements, up from 58% in the first quarter of 2008, and 74% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our Lease portfolio is presently 55% of cars and crossovers, up from 46% from one year ago.</p>
          <p>Our worldwide net investment in operating leases was $22 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, K.R., and I'd like to begin on Slide 11 by re-emphasizing that we continue to view Ford Credit as a strategic asset, and are committed to funding the business under the present ownership structure, despite the challenges of the credit markets. Ford Credit is maintaining its funding programs and securitization structures. We plan to renew committed capacity consistent with the size of the balance sheet, and we will utilize government-sponsored programs, for which we are eligible.</p>
          <p>In the near term, utilization of government-sponsored programs in the U.S. and around the world will be an important component of our funding plans. We continue to utilize the commercial paper funding facility, and the European Central Bank's facilities, and in March, we completed a term asset-backed loan facility, better known as TALF, eligible three billion auto loan securitization transaction.</p>
          <p>Gaining approval of our application for an industrial loan corporation is also a component of our funding plan. It will provide us access to lower cost, diversified funding from FDIC-insured deposits. We will continue to explore and execute alternative business and funding arrangements in those locations where we lack diverse funding capability, while also ensuring the funding has continued support for these markets.</p>
          <p>We remain concerned about the credit market's access for public and private securitizations, asset-backed commercial paper, unsecured debt, and hedging instruments. As a result, we continue to focus our attention on the funding of our dealer floor plan receivables, as recent credit rating announcements will make future funding more challenging. Ford Credit's funding strategy remains focused on maintaining liquidity to meet short-term funding obligations, including holding substantial cash balances.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 shows the trends of funding of our managed receivables. As K.R. mentioned, at the end of the first quarter, managed receivables were 106 billion, down 12 billion from year-end 2008. We ended the quarter with about 19 billion in cash, including 5.4 billion to support on-balance sheet securitizations. Securitized funding was 61% of managed receivables at the end of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We are projecting further receivable declines in 2009, primarily reflecting lower industry volumes and the transition of Jaguar, Land Rover and Mazda business to other finance providers. We are now projecting 2009 year-end managed receivables in the range of 85 to 95 billion, with securitized funding representing 55 to 60% of managed receivables.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 shows our term funding plans for Ford Credit, which does not include our short-term funding programs or asset sales to our on-balance-sheet, asset-backed commercial paper program. Through April 23, we have completed about 5 billion of term funding. About 4 billion of this funding was public, including our 3 billion TALF eligible U.S. auto loan securitizations completed in March, as well as a German lease securitization that we funded through the ECB's open market operations program. In addition, we completed about 1 billion of funding through our private channels.</p>
          <p>Regarding the TALF program, we are pleased to have participated in the March issuance. We plan to continue to make our public retail and leased issuance TALF eligible. Given present program rules our dealer floor plan assets are not eligible for issuance under TALF; however, we continue to work on gaining TALF eligibility for floor-plan assets.</p>
          <p>For 2009, our public term funding plans are in the range of 10 to 15 billion, consisting of 8 to 13 billion of public securitizations and up to 2 billion of unsecured debt. We continue to have private funding sources in addition to public markets. These are largely asset-backed securitization programs for retail, wholesale, and lease assets in various countries around the world. For 2009, we are forecasting 5 to 10 billion of private funding.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded certain notes of our lease and floor-plan securitizations. This month, Fitch downgraded certain notes of our rated U.S. floor-plan securitizations.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 details our liquidity programs and utilization. The top box shows Ford Credit's committed capacity to our liquidity programs, which include unsecured credit lines, FCAR asset-backed CP lines, a multi-asset facility, and asset-backed conduit capacity. The multi-asset facility is committed to fund various asset classes, including U.S. lease, dealer floor plan, and assets that are more difficult to securitize.</p>
          <p>As of March 31, we had 63 billion of capacity and cash. After excluding securitization cash and adjusting for available assets, liquidity was 47.4 billion, of which 30.2 billion was utilized, leaving about 17 billion available for use, given our present level of eligible receivables.</p>
          <p>Available liquidity as a percent of managed receivables was 16%, down about two percentage points from the fourth quarter of 2008. Our cash that is not related to securitization totaled about 14 billion at quarter end, down about four billion from the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, at quarter end, we had excess capacity of about $10 billion to support securitization transactions, the majority of which are available for U.S. retail auto loan assets.</p>
          <p>As of March 31, and unchanged from year end 2008, 7 billion of the FCAR program was placed with the Federal Reserve's CPFF program. About 30 billion of the 44 billion of committed capacity is up for renewal before year end. During the first quarter of 2009, we extended the renewal dates of about 2 billion of our floor plan conduit commitments, mostly into the second quarter. We plan to renew committed capacity consistent with the size of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In summary, Ford had a pre-tax loss of about 2 billion, excluding special items, and a net loss of 1.4 billion, including special items. First quarter end automotive gross cash was 21.3 billion. We reduced automotive debt obligations by 10.1 billion and lowered annual cash interest expense by more than 500 million.</p>
          <p>For Ford Credit, the pre-tax loss was 36 million and net loss of 13 million. Excluding the net loss related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives, the pre-tax loss was 12 million.</p>
          <p>Ford Credit continues to provide funding to support its dealers and its customers. The external funding environment remains challenging. Ford Credit completed five billion of term funding, including three billion of TALF eligible funding, in the first quarter. Ford Credit's liquidity available for use is about 17 billion, of which 14 billion is in cash</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering on the loss-to-receivables ratios, is that seasonally? I saw if you look at Q4 '07 to Q1 '08, I mean it didn't really move that much, and that was again the case, but was that better than your expectations or is that really just a seasonality &#x2013; trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Monica. When you look at LTRs, there are pieces that are seasonal. You know there is a bit of seasonality that goes with repossessions I'll call it in a normal year, which we often see. The problem that we face right now is nothing seems to be really normal anymore as the economy has deteriorated. And for example, when the economy deteriorated you can see repossessions have increased, but the severity has been up and down dramatically based on what's going on in the auction markets. We saw a huge deterioration in the auction market last year, which really pushed the severity up, and then we've seen an improvement in the first quarter. So it's very hard for me to give you, at this point, any kind of real good comments on seasonality when it ties to the LTRs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But would you have thought that that would've been worse given the trends in the economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very hard to say. What we're seeing, you can see the repossessions have been increasing. I do believe that part of the reason why the auction market has improved dramatically is because the brand new vehicle market has deteriorated so much. So it's kind of hard for me to say. It doesn't surprise me, really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I had a question in terms of the conduits or any of the conduits that are either not renewed. It sounds like you said there were 2 billion of some floor plan that got done in the quarter. Was that &#x2013; in total, that was renewed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. There were 2 billion that we extended predominantly into the second quarter, of the amount that was maturing in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Or coming due.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It just got pushed out three months, you're saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And was there anything else that was coming due that got pushed out or did get renewed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the bulk of what's getting renewed is sort of Q2 and Q3, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We had about 4 billion in capacity that was coming due in the first quarter. We extended 2 billion of it. If you look back at Slide 14, you'll notice that we had about 10.2 billion of excess capacity, and as our balance sheet shrinks, we're going to be shrinking our conduit capacity to come with that. And so that's one of the reasons that we extended it, and also the fact that we've got a decent amount maturing the balance of the year, spread out between second and fourth quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of the discussions, are the discussions revolving more about price, or are they trying to also change kind of the structure of these conduits? Because I know that what's good about the conduits now is, if there was any issue with them, the assets would term out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a combination, Monica, of both price and just right capacity. It's not structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So anything that would get renewed, you would expect that there wouldn't be any foreclosure, right? It would continue to be the kind of thing that it would just term out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Our structures have not been &#x2013; I mean nobody's pushing back on the structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. And then in terms of the &#x2013; updating us on the distributions. I know obviously in the K, you talked about distributions of 2 billion sort of at Ford Credit, and obviously there was the movement of the cash. Can you give us an update for the rest of the year? And if you said it already, I didn't catch it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point in time, Monica, all we've done as far as distributions go is we bought the term loan debt back, and we contributed that to our parent. So that was about $1.1 billion. Our plans at this point in time are still to provide about $2 billion through 2010. So 1.1 is done. But we're going to balance that with our funding plans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, guys. Quick balance sheet question. With the 15 billion of cash on the balance sheet, I guess excluding what's set aside for securitizations, is there some focus on any type of restructuring or exchange on Ford Credit's balance sheet? Right now it seems that the focus has been on Ford's. Given where bonds are trading, is that something maybe you're looking at potentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we're looking at any kind of restructuring of the balance sheet at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And a separate question. The close to 2 billion TALF related asset-backs. I've heard some concerns from investors regarding obtaining funds and partnering with the government, and you're closer to it than us, obviously. What's your opinion on how the program's going, and do you think Ford Credit could continue to use this avenue for funding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think we were very pleased to be a part of the first transaction, I think, since the program was announced. The transactions themselves and the program has evolved. When you think about it, it went back to October when it was announced originally, and it took five to six months to get up and running.</p>
          <p>So there's clearly some things that still have to work their way through the system. The first transaction, getting the pipes set, proved the structure works. We had a decent amount of investors participate in our first transaction that were TALF specific. And we're continuing to work with all the parties to make sure that this becomes a viable funding &#x2013; longer term funding vehicle. But we have a lot of confidence in the program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The results were better than I had expected. It looks like you're running kind of close to break-even at Ford Credit. I'm not sure, have you come out with any guidance as when you think you're going to be profitable? I know Ford Co. is saying they're going to be above break-even by 2011. Do you have any targets, given it looks like things have stabilized here and potentially doing better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Doug. At this point in time, we don't provide any sort of guidance. I'm pleased with the first quarter results. The thing that always worries me in this business right now has been the volatility in the auction market, because it has really had a huge deterioration last year and then a rather large improvement in the first quarter. But in the end, a lot of our business is based on the funding in the credit markets, and as long as we maintain access to the credit markets, get our funding done, appropriately price our business, get our margins right, keep our operating costs under control, as it always has been in the past, it's a good business to be in.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. There's been some quotes in the press from sources saying that you expect to get the same savings from UAW that GM and Chrysler get, regardless of how those situations play out. Does that just apply to operating items like wages, work rules, <mark type="inaudible" /> anything you can give additionally on those retirement obligations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we will clearly monitor the negotiations that the UAW has with GM and Chrysler, and as a practice, we would go back and seek to -remain competitive with both companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think the other piece of the negotiations was the restructuring of the VEBA agreement, which allowed us to put half of the obligation in Ford stock. So there were two pieces to the new negotiations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

          <p>Next question on Slide Nine. This is a little detailed question, I guess, but it looks like there's a very modest increase in delinquencies over 60 days for the pool overall, but if I go through the public trust data, looks like some of the more recent trusts have kind of a significant elevation in the 61 to 90 day delinquencies, but they seem to be cured within 90 or 120 days. I was just wondering if you can kind of or maybe talk to those and what's driving it? Is it just a matter of servicing <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Scott as far the detail question, you might want to get with Dave after the call and talk to him. I'm sorry, Jeff. You might get with him after the call and get into that. But the underlying effort within the credit company is, across the board, fairly stable, from the standpoint of our effort to try to collect money. And it's not like it's based on a vintage or anything. We service all the portfolio the same so there might be some bit of timing that gets into comparing a securitization transaction three years ago versus a securitization transaction in the last six or eight months. But the underlying running of the business &#x2013; when someone becomes delinquent, we chase them down and try to work with them to get it paid up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. One, maybe the update on if you guys are hearing anything on the status of getting industrial loan bank status. And there hasn't been much talk on the DOE loans for anybody. Just the focus seems to be on your other two Detroit competitors, but no talk about DOE loans. Can you give us any color there on those two items? And then I had one other follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian. I'll handle the industrial loan bank. We continue to work with the FDIC on our application. It has been in for awhile. We believe we're making some progress at this point in time, but in the end, we need to make sure that the bank is acceptable to both the FDIC as well as to ourselves, and hopefully we can get something done this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think specifically, on the DOE, we continue to have active discussions with them. Our application has been in. It's been reviewed. They've done their due diligence. So I think we're making lots of progress to get a lot closer, and I think the expectation that we had in our cash flow projections is still solid from a standpoint of what we would expect to get from not only the DOE here in the U.S., but also from some of the international agencies, to support the local affiliates there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then my last question's just more of a housekeeping item, but it's on Appendix 17 of 19, in your &#x2013; actually your earnings slides, where you have this unsecured convert, this Accounting FSP APB 14-1, where it looks like the reduction from 4.9 down to 3.3. What exactly is going on? Is that like a mark-to-market associated with converting it, re-conversion? What exactly is going on there with that &#x2013; the convert note?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This is Mark Kosman. It's splitting into two pieces the conversion premium, and putting it into equity, and amortizing it back to the income statement over time, and that's what you'll see happening there with the standard. And so it's just breaking it into two pieces to have kind of like the regular debt and the conversion into a separate piece. So that standard's been adopted as of January the 1st.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know 2 billion of the cash delta from year end is because of the tender. What is the other 2 billion? What is the explanation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think only 1 billion of the debt restructuring occurred in the first quarter. The rest of it occurred in early April. I think there's a couple things going on in there. One is we had a very large debt maturity in the first quarter, which makes up more than the total amount of change and liquidity. So we ended the year with a lot of liquidity, pre funding in some sense, the maturity in January. And then we also had a receivable reduction in the first quarter that was a partial offset to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then is there anything to read into your further reduction in managed AR guidance? I think it dropped like 5 billion from year end. Is that just basically we're at the low end of your SAAR estimate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly right, Eric. I mean effectively the industry's going to come in a little bit lower than what we expected. I mean we're tied in with the auto company and their projections, and so since it's more toward the lower end, we dropped our projection down to the 85 to 95.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Eric, just as a follow on your other question, I think the other piece that we continue to look at is liquidity as a percent of the balance sheet. And as the balance sheet does shrink, liquidity will go down with it. So the percentage was pretty consistent from the yearend level to now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I think you guys have around 9 billion of FCAR coming due in the second quarter. Can you speak to the ability to renew that going out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. At the end of the quarter, we had about $10 billion of FCAR outstanding, 7 billion of that is with the CPFF program. And so the majority of what we have coming due in the second quarter is with the Fed Pro program, which is extendable into the October time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how far out &#x2013; is that &#x2013; right now that's extended through October. Is there any sign that they're going to extend that? I thought it was extended to a little bit later in the year, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It goes through October 31, which then allows you to issue 90 days, so it gets you into issuance into January. I think the other piece of the renewal part is the fact that we have our 364 day FCAR lines maturing in June, and we're just about to ready to get to our banks with our plans for that renewal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then a couple of housekeeping things. Are you guys sticking to the 11.5 leverage goal for the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh no, Eric. Sorry. The 11.5 was an agreement with the parent company that we would not go above that. We will be substantially below 11.5 by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's good to hear. That's good to hear. And then, just generally, can you guys give us an idea into your outlook on consumer credit, mindful of we got a benefit on delinquencies for the tax refund period, and then also your outlook on the auction market, obviously with the looming potential bankruptcy of a couple of your peers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll do the second one first, on the auction market. We do have protections, but the reality of the auction market is it's extremely volatile. We saw from the end of 2008 to the end of the first quarter, probably about a $2,000 improvement &#x2013; a 15, 16% improvement &#x2013; that we were not expecting. So going forward from here, normally you'd say there's normal seasonality, where the third quarter dips, but it's just too hard for me to predict the auction market at this point in time. We expected a dip last year in the third quarter, which didn't happen. And then we got the dip in the fourth quarter, which was not what our expectations were. And the first question, what's the first part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The consumer credit, just looking at it, going through, I know the tax refund season, people I've talked to, it's been better than expected. And are we going to see a fade in consumer credit post that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I look at it from the standpoint of items like repossession ratios, and typically there is seasonality with the repossession ratios, when you get past the tax time, for example. So there might be a small dip in it. But the overall trend is that the repossessions and the ratio will be climbing a bit because of the overall expectation that unemployment will be increasing. So that has an impact on top of it.</p>
          <p>I do want to point out that there's one thing, and that is, when we get into the consumers, as far as Ford Credit is concerned, we have not changed our underwriting practices. We continue to purchase every &#x2013; what we call every collectible receivable that we can. In the end, our process has not changed. There have been some updates for individual &#x2013; specific elements like projections on credit losses or things like that. But our underwriting standards themselves have not changed at all. We continue to support the dealers, we continue to support the consumer, and we continue to get people into Ford Motor Company's vehicles.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And I'll sneak one in, have you seen any change in banks' predisposition towards underwriting standards? I mean, I know they tightened mid-2007 and remain tight. Are they starting to loosen up as unemployment growth seems to be petering out?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You know, that's an excellent point, Eric, because that in our view or at least my view of the company's view of the credit company, is the beauty of having a captive. The captive is there year in year out. We continue to work to get people into vehicles. As you mentioned, last year, a number of banks tightened their standards. Other banks decided that this business was not for them, so they left the business completely. And so the one thing that the auto company can count on is that Ford Credit is there, and Ford Credit will continue to focus on getting people into vehicles.</p>

          <p>Gentlemen, your final question will come from the line of Josh Lupke representing Eden Bank. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. Given that you expect the receivable balance to be about 5 billion lower at the end of '09 than you did a quarter ago, does that create excess capital at Ford Credit, and potentially money that could be used to upstream to Ford?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the end, the lower the receivable balance, as long as we don't have some loss or something, it does create excess capital. But as I stated earlier, Josh, the key for us running the credit company is to balance returns of capital with our capability to continue to fund the business, and right now our plans are only to return up to $2 billion through 2010. We have already returned $1.1 billion, so the other 900 million would come between now and 2010. But you've got to balance it off with our funding capability and the funding requirement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, the 2 billion we're referring to is a dividend. There's also, if I'm understanding correctly, a tax sharing agreement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us some guidance on what you might expect this year for tax sharing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't give you guidance, but I can clarify something that has come up on occasion. When we did the unsecured debt restructuring, we utilized Ford Credit's cash, and what we did was, essentially Ford Credit paid $1.1 billion to buy back that debt in April, and what effectively happens is we had a payable that we owed the parent company for taxes that had built up over the last year, and we settled the tax payable with those bonds. So that 1.1 billion is not a return of capital, not a dividend, per se. It was more a settling of a tax payable with the parent company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any tax payable still outstanding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there is. And it will continue to be there. We had &#x2013; separate from the settlement for the tax payable with the debt transaction, we had about 300 million that we paid in the first quarter. The reason we are still generating taxes to be paid ties back into our larger lease portfolio in the past, and as the lease portfolio comes down, you had a &#x2013; what's called a like-kind exchange impact, and so our taxes become due. We pay our taxes to the parent company. They effectively, for all intents and purposes, are our IRS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just &#x2013; I don't know if you have this handy or not, but do you know what that balance is, tax receivable balance at the end of the first quarter?</p>
