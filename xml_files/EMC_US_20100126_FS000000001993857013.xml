          <p>Thank you, Teresa . Good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and year 2009. Today we're joined by Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and CEO, and David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and CFO. David will provide a few comments about the results that we released this morning. He will highlight some of the activities that we've had this quarter and discuss our outlook for 2010. Joe will then spend some time discussing his view of what is happening in the market, EMC's execution of the strategy and how EMC is positioned. After the prepared remarks, we'll then open up the lines to take your questions.</p>
          <p>I would like to point out that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation unless otherwise indicated. The reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure today in our press release, supplemental schedules and the slides that accompany our presentation. All of these are available for download within the Investor Relations section of emc.com. As always, we have provided detailed financial tables in our news release and on our corporate web site. These include a lot of financial detail so we do encourage you to take a look at them. And with regard to details of VMware's results, we refer to you their financial release from last night. The call will contain forward-looking statements and information containing factors that could cause actual results to differ can found in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. And lastly I would note that an archive of today's presentation will be available following the call. With that it is now my pleasure to introduce David Goulden. David?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tony. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. There are a lot of positives in today's results and as we start this call I wanted to highlight a few for you. EM showed good</p>
          <p>progress through 2009, and ended the year with very solid growth in Q4 with revenues of $4.1 billion, up 17% from Q3 '09; non-GAAP EPS of $0.33, up 43%; and free cash flow of $793 million, up 6%. These quarterly results provide a good example of the resiliency in our model with revenues up 2% over Q4 '08, demonstrating good profit leverage with non-GAAP EPS of 6% and solid free cash flow generation of 2%.</p>
          <p>Within these results, our EMC information infrastructure business had a good quarter with $3.5 billion in revenue, up 15% sequentially, and $0.28 of non-GAAP EPS, up 40% from Q3. On a year-on-year basis, non-GAAP EPS was up 12% on flat revenue, a result that clearly shows the success of our cost transformation efforts. As previously announced, VMware also had a strong fourth quarter, contributing $607 million of revenue and almost $0.05 of non-GAAP EPS to EMC and showed very good growth from Q3.</p>
          <p>Given the tough global economic conditions and IT spending environment down across the board, EMC performed well as we moved through 2009. Our vision, strategy and most importantly the hard work and sacrifice of the EMC team has enabled our company to come out of the year with business momentum and very well positioned to grow and gain share in 2010 and beyond. It is especially worthy to note that even in this economic climate, the consolidated Q4 revenues, Q4 non-GAAP operating margin, Q4 non-GAAP EPS and Q4 free cash flow results were all records for EMC. In other words, EMC is coming out of the worst global recession we've seen in our best financial shape ever. We think this is truly impressive.</p>
          <p>Beyond the financial metrics, we have accomplished a lot in 2009. We maintained good focus on our goals and opportunities despite numerous economic and market distractions. We stayed close to customers and helped them through a tough time while other vendors cut back. We rolled out new market-leading products with the best quality in our history. We successfully implemented our biggest cost transformation program ever and strengthened our operational and financial position. We used our financial strength wisely to continue to invest in R&amp;D and to make strategic acquisitions, both of which will contribute to our ongoing success. And we improved our customer satisfaction and loyalty metrics at an important time when customers are looking to solidify their true business partners. While 2009 was a tough year, EMC achieved a lot of good things and exited the year in a very strong position.</p>
          <p>So moving to the agenda for today's call, I'll start off by making some comments about the Q4 spending environment, our business outlook for 2010 and then discuss some more specific details from our Q4 results. Overall, the environment in 2009 turned out pretty much as we anticipated and showed reasonable stability at the end of the year. While there is still uncertainty as customers evaluate their own business prospects and plans, we do expect 2010 to be better than 2009. Joe will spend some time discussing the 2010 environment in his comments, but the net is that we currently see IT spending growing between three and 5% in 2010.</p>
          <p>Given the compelling dynamics we see in our target markets, we continue to expect EMC's total addressable market to grow faster than IT overall, probably something near six to 8%. And lastly, given EMC's strategic focus on the shift to private cloud and our leadership position in the most important opportunities such as storage tiering, virtualization security, next-generation back-up, et cetera, we believe that EMC is poised to grow even faster and gain share.</p>
          <p>As a result, we currently anticipate 2010 consolidated revenues of approximately $16 billion, up 14%, and we expect significant leverage with non-GAAP operating margins of 20% and non-GAAP EPS of approximately $1.12, up over 24% from last year. This projected growth demonstrates the strength of our unique strategic positioning, ability to gain share and the earnings leverage inherent in our leaner financial model. Given what we see in the markets and our understanding of customer's spend plans, we currently expect our quarterly revenue contribution in 2010 to follow reasonably normal seasonal patterns.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a closer look at some of the financial highlights from the fourth quarter. EMC information infrastructure revenues were $3.5 billion, up 15% sequentially and flat year-to-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.28, up 40% quarter-on-quarter and up 12% from last year. Very good leverage in a very tough year. Within these overall numbers, information infrastructure product revenues were almost $2.4 billion up 20% quarter-to-quarter and information infrastructure services revenues were a bit over $1.1 billion, up 7% sequentially.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow was $554 million. Looking at the geographic results from our information infrastructure business, our revenues from North America represented about 56% of total, and were up a solid 13% sequentially and down 1% from Q4 2008. EMEA and Latin America both had strong sequential growth up 23% and 17% respectively from Q3 and both were up around 1% year-on-year. APJ also improved from Q3 and was up 6%. The BRIC+13 countries continue to show strength, up 14% quarter-on-quarter and 5% year-on-year. A very positive data point is that these markets were also up 1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and this is encouraging to see.</p>
          <p>Looking at the results from the businesses within information infrastructure, Q4 information storage revenues were $3.1 billion, up 16% sequentially. Overall, we're seeing an increase in net new implementations as customers are looking to put in place infrastructure to support their virtual environments. As part of these investments, we continue to see very strong growth in the adoption of tiered storage, utilizing solid state and SATA drives. In addition, the recent introduction of our fully automated storage tiering software, known as FAST, is a compelling and unique capability that is enabling customers to improve efficiency via storage tiering across more of their environments. Overall we believe that demand will continue to strengthen for our broad and deep storage portfolio as customers look to deploy more efficient, flexible and cost effective technology.</p>
          <p>In the high end, Symmetrix revenues were up 13% sequentially, a very good result as the VMax continues its positive ramp. The introduction of FAST is also driving more rapid adoption of both SSD and SATA drives in Symmetrix as customers look to take advantage of the unique value of VMax-based storage tiering. The ramp for this new product is proceeding very well. It's clearly extending our lead in the high end of the storage market and is very well-positioned as customers invest in their cloud infrastructures.</p>
          <p>Not only is the VMax very successful in the more traditional high-end markets where the Symmetrix has always done well, but its scalable architecture and unique capabilities are receiving a very good response in new use cases such as internet hosting. For example, in Q4 we won a VMax deal to completely replace a competitor at one of their biggest customers, a major telco-based hosting provider.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at the mid tier business including our Celerra and CLARiiON product families. Within this, CLARiiON revenues were up 15% sequentially, a nice acceleration over Q3 growth. Direct and channel business continued to be about 75% of total CLARiiON revenues. Within the CLARiiON results, the Dell EMC co-branded CLARiiON OEM revenues were up 27% sequentially and represented about 16% of total CLARiiON revenues.</p>
          <p>Our Celerra NAS business continues to be a great performer, posting the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year revenue growth in Q4 with revenues up over 50%. Our unified products combine our best-of-breed SAN and NAS capabilities without sacrificing performance in either environment and our success here continues to set pace in the industry. In Q3 we were number one in the market with 46% share according to IDC and given our outstanding performance, it's pretty clear we gained share again in Q4. As an example of our success here, we recently beat NetApp and others for a large deal including 1.4 petabytes of unified storage at a major New York-based stock exchange. This market shift towards unified storage is a very important trend in the mid-tier that I'll talk a little bit more about later on.</p>
          <p>Our newly formed Back-up and Recovery Systems division, which we call BRS, had fantastic results again this quarter. In fact Data Domain and Avamar were each up over 50% year-on-year in Q4. Within BRS, I'm happy to say that Data Domain was ahead of plan in its first full quarter as part of the EMC family. The excellent focus and execution by the teams has led to the continued growth and success in these businesses. As an example of the growth potential and synergy within this business, we added 600 new customers in the quarter with 300 of these being net new to EMC.</p>
          <p>Given the growth, this business is clearly very strategic to customers, and EMC is also the acknowledged leader in this important area. As an indicator of our strength and market leadership, in a forthcoming IDC survey respondents chose either EMC or Data Domain primary branded deduplication solution at nearly double the rate of the next nearest vendor. That means we have almost twice as much mind share as anyone else in this great market and we show the ability to capture it.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at a few other storage-related businesses, our Mozy cloud-based back-up business is managing over 25 petabytes of customer data and launched services this quarter in conjunction with participants Cox, McAfee and Vodafone. This year Mozy will also expand beyond online back-up to a broad set of personal cloud services. In addition, Iomega, our customer and small business-focused operation, is seeing increasing customer demand for back-up and protection and in Q4 shipped over 1 exabyte of storage, more than double the capacity shipped last Q4. Iomega continues to roll out new and compelling products, as highlighted by winning an editors' choice award with the vClone product at CES and by the fact that the Iomega brand is one of the most popular storage solutions at Apple stores.</p>
          <p>In total, the EMC storage business finished 2009 with very good momentum due to great products, compelling solutions and focused execution by the team. Importantly, we believe that we're poised to really extend our lead this year for three additional reasons: the move to virtualized data centers, the implementation of next-gen back-up and recovery, and the evolution of unified storage. Let me spend a few moments to highlight each of these trends with you.</p>
          <p>First of all, the virtualization of the data center is beginning in earnest as customers are looking to move towards the private cloud and EMC is absolutely best positioned to benefit from this. Some recent survey results from Goldman Sachs really highlight this fact. As you can see in the first chart, customers are looking to put a lot of incremental spending towards next-generation technologies this year, and this survey shows that over two-thirds of these customers will move at least 20% of their data centers in this direction by the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>Obviously, a major factor of this next-gen technology is server virtualization. And not only is VMware the leader in this space, but EMC is the clear storage vendor of choice in virtualized server environments. As you can see on the next chart, EMC is preferred by 38% of the survey participants and we've more than twice the mind share of the next closest competitor. And, I might add, over three times as much mind share as a smaller vendor who's been making a lot of noise about this topic lately. I think that puts this rhetoric to rest.</p>
          <p>And finally, as virtualized storage becomes more prevalent with customer environments, EMC is once again at the forefront with 34% of customers surveyed saying they would choose EMC when they implement storage virtualization technology. As you can see, not only does EMC already have 50% more mind share than the next vendor, but you can also expect to us make several announcements throughout 2010 that will extend our lead in this important area.</p>
          <p>The second major trend is the rapid implementation of next-gen back-up and recovery capabilities. The benefits of these solutions are becoming well known including simplicity, efficiency, flexibility, manageability and cost savings. So customer demand is very high. This is also a vastly under-penetrated opportunity. In the same IDC survey I mentioned earlier, the survey also indicated that only 22% of respondents have implemented deduplication for back-up data. Obviously, we're already seeing great success here and with the leading products in both forms of data deduplication with Data Domain and Avamar, with tremendous mind share in the market and a clearly under-penetrated opportunity we should be able to drive a lot of growth here.</p>
          <p>The third trend is the market is moving towards more of a unified storage approach in the mid-tier. this year and into the future. In other words, customer requirements for flexibility and best-of-breed performance are propelling the design for products that truly unify the best capability to manage block, file and object information. As I previously mentioned, our current unified products based upon our leading SAN and NAS technologies continue to set the pace in this market, growing faster than any other company. Unified storage is becoming one of the hottest product areas in the mid-tier markets. EMC is in the lead here and you can expect several more important announcements from us this year and beyond that will expand our capabilities in this area.</p>
          <p>So EMC's information storage sits at the intersection of some of the most important trends in IT. As customers begin their journey towards a private cloud, we're focused on helping them make the transition at their own pace. With our product portfolio, solutions and partnerships, EMC is uniquely able to help solve their problems today whilst at the same time helping customers position themselves to meet their needs of tomorrow. As you can see from our Q4 results, and some of the recent success stories, we're certainly delivering what customers are looking for. We're confident we'll gain share, because EMC has the best, the broadest and the most integrated storage portfolio to meet customers' needs both now and in the future.</p>
          <p>Our RSA security revenues in Q4 were $164 million, up 7% sequentially. This business has executed well this year. Even in a tough environment growth was positive in 2009 and finished the year up 4% overall as information-centric security continues to be a top customer priority.</p>
          <p>RSA strategy to offer built-in information-centric security rather than bolted-on perimeter based security has served us well as the industry's clearly moving in our direction. Not only have we utilized this expertise to augment the security capability of products throughout EMC, this focus has lead to numerous new alliances with partners seeking to seamlessly improve the security of their offerings. A good case in point is the qualification by VMware of SecurID for virtual desktops.</p>
          <p>We also continue to extend the lead in our information security products. For example, we have integrated DLP and adaptive authentication into enVision, our SI/EM product. Now enVision not only monitors security events but can also tell what type of data has been affected by the events. In addition, we've extended this capability across both physical and virtual IT infrastructures and this is a truly unique capability that we've built into a highly differentiated VCE Vblock offering. Finally, the recent acquisition of Archer, a leading company in the enterprise governance risk and compliance market, further extends our strategy to offer complete security solutions.</p>
          <p>Revenues from our Content Management and Archiving division in Q4 were 208 million, up a strong 17% from Q3. This division was recognized as a leader in enterprise content management by several industry firms recently. In Q4, EMC's CMA division was positioned by Gartner in its ECM Market Leader quadrants which recognizes companies demonstrating broad platform support, a presence in multiple regions, strong channel partners and good customer support. And earlier this month, Forrester recognized EMC's Content Management division's market leadership for its broad range of capabilities and strengths in document management, document imaging and capture and records management. The assets in CMA's portfolio should serve us well as customers review spending on applications that will streamline processing and enable efficient access to content.</p>
          <p>In Q4 , EMC's Global Services business continued its solid performance and revenues grew 7% sequentially. Overall, we saw a recovery in our Consulting business which tends to be somewhat of a leading indicator of customers IT plans. It's good news that we're seeing interest in investments for growth, new opportunities and integrations as opposed to what used to be mostly a focus on cost cutting. Our professional and technological consultants are well-positioned and have been effective in helping customers to manage their various initiatives including virtual data center investments.</p>
          <p>Now turning to some highlights from the income statements. Q4 information infrastructure non-GAAP gross margins were 55.3% and operating margins were 21.9%. Both metrics improved sequentially and showing especially strong year-on-year improvement from Q4 2008 non-GAAP gross margin of 52.5% and operating margin of 18.1%. For the year, non-GAAP gross margins were 52.3% and operating margins were 16.3%. This compares quite well with 2008 non-GAAP gross margins of 52.7% and operating margin of 16.6% that was achieved off a much higher revenue base.</p>
          <p>This is an excellent results and highlights our successful cost reduction efforts and is a great example of the new leverage inherent in our financial model. In fact, these 2009 full year operating margins are even more impressive given they include around $55 million of transition investments and about $30 million of incremental investments in our cloud infrastructure and services business. Without these investments, non-GAAP operating margins actually would have been up versus 2008. Clearly our cost transformation efforts this year are paying off and we've certainly exceeded our target of 450 million in savings. We're truly moving our model to a new level of efficiency. I'd like to thank everyone at EMC for the hard work and dedication in achieving this results.</p>
          <p>Now turning to a few highlights from our consolidated results, total Q4 consolidated revenues were approximately $4.1 billion, up about 17% sequentially and up 2% year-on-year. On a constant currency basis revenues were almost flat with last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.33 and free cash flow was $793 million. Free cash flow this quarter is almost $100 million higher than Q4 non-GAAP net income. This year, we generated a record $2.6 billion in free cash flow. This is about two -- sorry this is about $760 million greater than cumulative 2009 non-GAAP net income and over $40 million higher than the free cash flow in 2008. We're very pleased with the strong free cash flow generation we've achieved this year, and we continue to focus on driving free cash flow higher than non-GAAP net income.</p>
          <p>In 2009, the non-GAAP combination of interest income, interest expense and other income was a net $66 billion expense. For 2010, we expect this non-operating expense to be $90 million, due to lower interest rates, higher non-cash interest expense and our share of the stock losses in Acadia.</p>
          <p>The non-GAAP tax rate was 19% for Q4 and for the full year 2009. We currently expect the non-GAAP tax rate in 2010 to be around 20%.</p>
          <p>Q4 consolidated operating cash flow was $1 billion. A few balance sheet items that impacted operating cash flows include deferred revenues, which were $3.6 billion, inventory turns which were 7.7 and DSOs which were 47 days, all very good given the current economic climate.</p>
          <p>We ended Q4 with $9.4 billion in cash and investments. As you may recall, last quarter we announced a plan to reorganize our international operations. While the business benefits of this plan were laid out in our announcement in November, a by-product of this reorganization was the transfer of approximately $1.3 billion from our international businesses to our domestic operations. At quarter-end approximately $4.1 billion of our cash and investments were held domestically, 2.8 billion overseas and additional 2.5 billion was at VMware. Financial flexibility is a critical strength and competitive edge for EMC particularly in this unpredictable economy. Our financial strength allows us to continue to invest in our business during all types of economic cycles and you can expect us to continue this practice in 2010. In addition, we're able to return capital to our shareholders via buybacks. I'm pleased to announce we have board approval for a $1 billion EMC share buyback.</p>
          <p>It is a great accomplishment for EMC to have successfully weathered the worst recession in decades and to be exiting the year in our best operational and financial position ever. The combination of EMC's vision, strategy, leading products and solutions, strong partnerships increasingly efficient business model, great people and solid execution has made EMC stronger, more agile and more profitable.</p>
          <p>As we all know, well-run companies are continually facing the trade-offs among trying to gain share, investing for the future and showing improving profitability. And while the relative focus among these three tends to ebb and flow over time depending upon the environment, the ultimate goal is always show progress along all three metrics. At EMC in particular, we're continually trying to optimize the trade-offs among these three objectives and in 2009 we were successful in putting in place an operational foundation that will enable us to efficiently manage the business along these three important goals.</p>
          <p>As a result, looking to 2010, we're very pleased that we'll be delivering meaningful progress towards all three objectives. To be specific, 14% top line growth in 2010 will certainly result in significant share gains across our business. In 2010, we will invest $50 million in the future of our business as we continue our successful cost transformation program. We'll also accelerate the investments in our product development by increasing R&amp;D investments by approximately 20%. And we'll continue to show profit margin improvements as we reap the benefits of our ongoing cost transformation efforts, disciplined spending and increasingly efficient operating model. As a result, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be 20% in 2010, a 260 basis point increase over 2009.</p>
          <p>And we expect non-GAAP EPS to grow over 24% versus 2009. I think you will agree, serious leverage.</p>
          <p>To sum it all up, we're excited about our opportunities and we're confident in our ability to deliver a solid year including the triple play of market share gains, investment in the future and income leverage. With that I'll turn the call over to Joe.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. I would like to begin by welcoming everyone to today's call. Thank you for joining us, and thank you for your interest in EMC. Looking back to Q4 , I was very pleased with our overall results. Certainly the demand for storage was strong especially in the areas of next generation back-up to disk, with integrated deduplication technologies; for storage systems that support virtualized and cloud environments; for unified storage that effectively features fibre channel SAN. IP SAN and NAS architectures; for storage that supports massive consolidation and business continuity; and for storage that is custom-built for the SOHO market. In other words, storage opportunities in which EMC leads with innovative products, technologies, solutions and services.</p>
          <p>Also you heard from VMware yesterday the demand for virtualization was very strong. As our customers continue to make solid progress in recovering from the effects of the great recession, they are demanding faster and better returns on their IT investment while striving to be more economic --more environmentally conscious. They are turning to VMware and virtualization technologies in record numbers. And Q4 demand for technologies and solutions that help customers assure they are implementing and adhering to good governance principles and policies while minimizing risk was strong. This helped drive our RSA security and our information management businesses. In fact, our RSA business produced year-on-year growth in each and every quarter throughout 2009. Additionally, I was very pleased with the very warm market reception our private cloud vision strategy and product roadmap and partner ecosystem has received. This bodes well for our future and gives us confidence in our ability to grow and take market share going forward.</p>
          <p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the global workforce of EMC and VMware. Our team was selfless, accepting and even volunteering for a 5% pay reduction to help us minimize layoffs keeping us strong not only in 2009 but for the future. They focused on and stayed closer than ever to our customers. They were and are innovative and they executed our strategy and business plan exceedingly well. Again, thank you all very much.</p>
          <p>Looking forward into 2010, we expect the economic recovery to continue and GDP growth to be in the low single digits worldwide. Despite this prediction for continued economic recovery, there is still some caution and potential for choppiness as job recovery lags. As David says, on the back of this recovery we expect overall IT spending to return to growth. Our best estimate is between three and 5%. We expect storage market to grow in the six to 7% range and the market for security and virtualization to be in the mid teens to low 20s. And as our 2010 demonstrates we expect to grow faster than the markets we serve, take share and produce leverage.</p>
          <p>To make it clear, the 2010 forecast David gave you for consolidated EMC, revenue of 16 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.12, is in fact our management plan as approved by our board of directors. At our upcoming February meeting, the board will add a free cash flow metric to our 2010 plan. A question that must be on your minds is what gives us confidence we can achieve our 2010 goals. Well, first and foremost, we have a very strong product line-up and product cycle that is going for us throughout 2010. Also, analyst survey after analyst survey points out that the number one hardware infrastructure spending priority for CIOs in 2010 is storage. And when these CEOs were asked what areas in storage are most important, back-up to disk with data deduplication, storage consolidation, unified storage, thin provisioning, tiering of storage and business continuity showed to be consistently high priorities. Again areas where EMC is the leader.</p>
          <p>And very importantly, these surveys had EMC gaining share. Likewise, software surveys had virtualization as the top IT spending priority for 2010 and CIOs surveyed picked VMware as the number one share gainer here. Also security and governance risk and compliance, GRC, were mentioned as top 10 priorities and again EMC was on the share gainers list.</p>
          <p>And lastly what gives us optimism in 2010 is the deep belief EMC people have worldwide in our ability to help our customers succeed. What gives us optimism for the longer term, not only in 2010 but well beyond, is our focus on several rapidly emerging multibillion dollar markets which we believe present double-digit market growth opportunities for EMC. Our first and largest billion dollar plus opportunity is helping customers transform their current data centers into fully virtualized, fully automated, dynamic flexible centers where application workloads are truly policy and service level driven, while significantly lowering total cost -- as much as 40% lower than today's data center environments. 	We call this initiative helping our customers build their own internal or private cloud.</p>
          <p>Our second mega opportunity is to work with our service provider and telco partners and help them stand up and build out their public clouds using the same technology as our enterprise and commercial customers will use in building out their private clouds. This will allow enterprise customers to federate some of their workload with these external service provider clouds, resulting in even better infrastructure utilization.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we will team with our service provider partners to have greater access to the SMB market. EMC will also run a set of applications as a service on top of our service provider partner public clouds. Applications like DC back-up as a service. Storage as a service. Archive as a service. Elements of content management and security as a service. Desktop as a service and the potential list goes on and on.</p>
          <p>Our third multibillion dollar market opportunity is around virtualizing client devices. This V client initiative benefits customers by allowing them to more efficiently provision users once not for each of their multiple, continuously changing devices. This means not only better, simpler management but better security and protection from viruses and provides a lower TCO. Our fourth massive billion dollar plus opportunity is for EMC to lead customers to the next generation of back-up recovery and archive solutions. We sized this at approximately $10 billion -- this market at about $10 billion in 2009. It is extremely fragmented with EMC being a market leader. The opportunity here stems from the continuing sea of data that customers need to better manage and protect. The attributes of automated tier storage, coupled with the best-of-breed data deduplication technologies are the keys to success here. We are absolutely accelerating the move of back-up and recovery from tape to disk.</p>
          <p>To compete in these four rapidly emerging multibillion dollar opportunities, innovative technologies around virtualization, technologies like a fully functioning data center OS that incorporates a new higher level of automation, management and security; technology for federated information storage; and technology that provides much more efficient and effective back-up and archiving to disk with deduplication. In other words, key innovative technology that EMC and VMware have and lead in today and are investing in heavily for the future. To further assure we capitalize on these four mega opportunities before us, we're rapidly building aggressively with top tier partners. We have and need technology partners, distribution partners, service, system integration and outsourcing partners and service providers. In short, our ecosystem will be second to none.</p>
          <p>In closing, we believe we have a compelling vision and strategy, one that is right for 2010 and well beyond. Leading technology, products, solutions and services and support. World-class partners and we have the leadership and a deep belief throughout our 43,000 people around the world that we can and will win. Thanks again.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I guess two related questions. For Q1 what would normal seasonality be? I know the -- kind of last couple years have not exactly been normal. And then secondly, could you give us some color on the backlog as you enter Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Let me comment on both those, Jason. I'll answer both in the same way. We don't comment on backlog but I did point out to you that we expect the progression, the percentage contribution of revenues from each quarter as a percentage of the total to fall a reasonably normal seasonal pattern. You can go back and look at your own data. We're trying to avoid guiding at all on a quarterly basis. We're giving annual guidance and we're kind of telling you that the progression during the year will be seasonally normal as a percentage of revenue. So I encourage you just to go back and not have me guide you towards Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I wouldn't look at 2009. The whole comment that we made about 2009 and if you look at the contribution in 2009, first half versus second half, we saw a much higher percentage of revenue than normal in the second half of 2009. Now as we expected that to be the case because we saw a much weaker demand in the first half, so I'd go back and look at the three and four years leading up to 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Some very good gross margin numbers there. Maybe the highest in a couple years. Can you give us puts and takes on that and whether you think that's sustainable? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mark, sure. We're very pleased with our gross margin performance this quarter. Couple things really, if you look -- perhaps the best way to look at gross margins is to probably look sequentially; so we saw a nice uptick from Q3. You've seen our margins improving during the year. That has really been the results of some of the cost transformation problems we've been doing and driving efficiencies through our supply chain but also some good work in the field to make sure that whilst it's a very tough pricing environment, we're charging suitably for value. But if you look sequentially, what we saw was a nice improvement in both product margins and services margin. In both cases, principally volume driven as we see additional leverage in the model as volumes start to pick up again. So that's the biggest driver. A little bit of FX impact sequentially but mainly both products and services margins picked up sequentially because of volume.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, guys. Can you discuss your R&amp;D plans for 2010 in a bit more detail? More specifically, help us understand where the target is -- is this somewhat of a snap back from a compressed 2009 plan? And then touching on a more sensitive topic, can you address this target in light of the nagging historical concerns that you will reinvest upside and leverage back into the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me talk about the second one first, Bill. We've, as we've been talking throughout this tough cycle we've really worked hard through our cost transformation to get ourselves in a situation where our cost structure is simply more lean and efficient. You saw the benefits of that happen in Q4 where on the EMC II we saw operating margins close to 22% which is much higher than we've seen for any recent period of time. So we really believe we've put that cost structure in place so we can generate much more leverage on incremental revenues, but also as you said earlier, we can produce that leverage whilst continuing to top our investment. So if you think about revenue growth next year at 14%, R&amp;D growth at 20 points of growth, then obviously we're showing a much higher investment back into R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>And just before I hand over to Joe to talk about what we're going to be investing in, this year you made a comment that R&amp;D looks a little, you know, less robust. I think that when you're looking at the change in year-on-year growth or decline in R&amp;D dollars versus SG&amp;A dollars, that in turn has been impacted by a number of things including software capitalization, transition expense and acquisitions. And if you pull those three out, the year-on-year decline in those lines is actually much closer than they look on the financial statements. So just a few comments upon leverage and R&amp;D mix and I'll hand it back to Joe to talk about the investment areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well obviously the two big investments are around storage and VMware on the virtualization, building that next generation of data center OS. Within storage, you know, what's hot is where the majority of the increase will go. So a lot is going around the federation, which -- and virtualization, which David said we have a number of big announcements and initiatives coming out. Obviously, around the next generation back-up and recovery. Obviously, in unified storage. Obviously, in building out our -- building in security to both our virtualized and physical products. So those are areas that are going to get &#x2013; off the top of my head that are getting big increases or nice increases.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Could you address whether there are any shortages in the quarter and whether they've been alleviated? And I'll sneak another one in there, and what -- of your 14% growth this year, could you talk about the Data Domain and Avamar segment? What is the growth expected of the Data Domain / Avamar segment within the 14%? Thanks.</p>

          <p>We're not going to break out that segment but we will as we go through give you a lot of color around that. But let me put it this way. Throughout the entire company, the segment we expect to grow the fastest will be that VRS group that we talked about, the Data Domain and the Avamar technology by far. So we continue to believe that. David you want to take the other piece?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, on the shortages, obviously you can see that we delivered $4.1 billion of revenue against our internal or our guidance of 4 billion, so we obviously had supply to beat our guidance during the quarter. But just to comment a little bit deeper, you will notice I'm sure as you start to crawl through the financials that we did have a build-up in inventory of Q4. We built up about $100 million of inventory in Q4. And that was designed to protect ourselves going into Q1 against what we knew would be a tight supply environment. So we think we're well-positioned going into Q1. We did invest a little bit ahead of our Q4 needs. We have good relationships with all of our suppliers so we're very confident that we won't see anything that will disrupt our Q1 numbers either. But we have invested a little bit to make sure we have that protection.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well obviously there was a lot more optimism in our customers. A lot more clarity. A lot more normality in the CIOs' ability to spend their budget without all kinds of checks and approvals that they had to get in prior quarters especially 1 and 2 up to and including board levels. So that was for sure. Obviously we saw what I would consider to be a very normal budget flush. I think we also saw even maybe a little of extra in some of that spending that the customers didn't do in Q1 and Q2 as they -- as the companies got more confident in their next year 2010 business plans they did a little bit of catch-up. Because I think they really starved their infrastructures in Q1 and Q2.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks, I was wondering if you could comment on what's baked into your EPS guidance for calendar year 2010 non-GAAP with regards to minority interest. Looks like, based on my calculations, that might be doubling year-over-year to roughly 120 million and then also the 20% R&amp;D growth, can you talk about if any M &amp; A or inorganic growth is baked in there as well? Thanks so much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take those in reverse order, Brian. No that is an organic growth in R&amp;D spend. And in terms of minority interest, I think you are talking about the minority interest in VMware. Obviously you can run the math based upon the guidance that VMware gave you last night about their revenue and their operating margins. You know, as their equity programs roll out we do expect our minority increase to -- the minority investment to increase slightly during the course of the year and because it's more profitable or more contribution coming from VMware then the actual dollars will be greater than they were in 2009. So you're probably directionally generally okay.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thanks for taking my question. When you look at the mix between your VMax your DMX products in the fourth quarter, can you talk about the progression there, and secondarily can you talk about, you know, margins related to VMax versus DMX, clearly higher given the componentry? Do you think there is continued leverage on the product gross margin front as that continues to gain share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Brian, on the VMax versus DMX question that transition continues to be ahead of plan compared to &#x2013; and continues to be going faster than other major transitions. So we were up close to three-quarters of total mix this quarter coming from VMax versus DMX. And yes, because of the design of the VMax, it does inherently -- particularly now that we've got up to higher volumes of production levels, costs us less on per box or per capacity basis therefore margins are better. And that's one of the reasons why you saw a margin uptick as well in Q3, 2 or Q4. The mix shifting from about -- a little over 50% of total to close to 75% helped us a little bit as we moved through the progression between the two quarters.</p>

But as David said, on a macro -- we don't break that out but on macro level, you know, we're not going to guide that way. But on macro level, if you look at -- disregard 2009, look at the previous four years or so and I think you can come to the proper conclusions.</p>

          <p>Yes, thank you. I wanted to just follow up on the very strong gross margin performance and try and better understand beyond volume, what else may have helped in the quarter and then just kind of more permanently. So when you think about the 450 or 500 million in cost savings that you generated year-over-year in 2009, how much of that is impacting the COGS line. Should we be thinking about the six COGS portion being structurally reduced by a certain amount and how do we think about that? And then can you also comment on changes in depreciation, warranty expense and other allowances and whether those had an impact on gross margins in 2009 and expected for 2010?</p>

A, you build up a lot of expertise; B, you build up a lot of commonality which helps both volume side and it helps on the cost side as we get more commonality of physical parts. Obviously it also helps on, we're also seeing with VMax it helps on the performance side as, you know, Intel and others have done a phenomenal job moving the power curve and the performance curve and with better environmentals. So that's proved to be, you know, a great bet for us and one that we'll continue to get benefit from. David you want to...</p>

          <p>Toni, just some of the other areas that you mentioned. In terms of our cost transformation program we have basically about a third of those reductions impacting COGS and two-thirds in Op-ex. And the areas that we're impacting on the COGS side are along some of the areas you spoke about, reducing some of our structural fixed costs in the product and services side of the business. I think the important thing to recognize is it that quarter-on-quarter we had really nice progression in both product and service margins. Yes, volume is the biggest single factor but we did get benefit from ongoing cost transformation. But as you know, if you are adding volume on to a fixed cost structure the variable margins are attractive and that's what we saw during the quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. A question for Joe, here. When you look at pipelines can you provide more color on pipeline by segment, geo or product and any additional color on the direct pipeline and what you're seeing with the channel partners? Where are the bright spots here, when you look across the world for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly David commented some of our emerging markets. We call it BRIC+13 here and we we're increasing that 13 number, which is BRIC countries plus 13 others. We've really put a strong focus into that 13 number will go up. That's performed very well. We continue to believe that will perform very well. I think there's a lot of opportunities on the back of our partnerships with Cisco in VCE and in revitalizing our Dell partnership. I think those two are massive opportunities for us if we do them right. And I believe we can do them both right.</p>
          <p>And of course, you know, as we really get to this next generation of how we take -- you know, these cloud computing and really bring it &#x2013; the internal or private cloud market's going to be the big, big, big opportunity for us and how we really execute on that is phenomenal. And then the reception of the combination of the Data Domain and Avamar products is nothing short of exceptional. So I would say those are the things, and markets and opportunities for us that come to the top of my mind.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can you give us a little bit more color on the 20% operating margin for 2010? R&amp;D is going up 20%. Where is the leverage coming from? Can you quantify in any way your expectations for SG&amp;A or what are your gross margins assumptions for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kaushik, I think we've given you lots of pieces of the puzzle; we're not going to give you the entire puzzle. Our real focus here is a commitment to -- for 2010 for the full year of course delivered at 20% operating margin. What you'll see is you'll see our operating margins improving sequentially during the year with 20% being the average. I've told you that Ran D is going to grow faster than revenue, so we're going to see by definition negative leverage there. So on a year-on-year basis, to deliver the increase you're going to need to see improvements as a percentage of revenue on both the SG&amp;A and gross margin, but I'm not going to give you the mix between those two pieces, but I think I've given you most of the puzzle.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Good morning. First a clarification, if I could, on Ben's question earlier. Could you talk more about the inventory protection. Is that more on the hard disk drive solid, solid state drive? Any comment there. And then, Joe, can you talk a little more about the smarter pricing environment that was exhibited throughout most of 2009? Obviously the- downturn hurt a lot of folks, but it seemed like discounting was not as pervasive within the system environment. Do you expect the discounting to change and get more competitive as we go through 2010 or are folks going to be structurally a little smarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, being in the middle of the food fight here, so to speak, you know, 2010, you know, was very competitive market with the storage industry in total being down. Obviously because of our cost transformation projects, because of our move to X86 and more commonality in parts and servicing, service, et cetera, we were able to offset that. I think going into 2010, I think you'll see, you know, more of the same. I think obviously it will be very competitive market. And we've got to continue to make sure that we're incredibly cost competitive and make sure we get the best out of our cost transformation. And at the same time just, you can't beat innovative products. As Avamar and Data Domain point out, and VMware point out, you cannot beat innovative products. So that's why the increase in R&amp;D and that is what's going to make more of a difference than anything else.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to pick up, Mark, on the first part of your question. Inventory. Relative to drives, yes, it's mainly on the SSD side but there are other non-drive components as well that aren't quite as obvious but we were concerned about supply chain. But on the drive side, yes, it's SSDs.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning. You announced the resumption of your share buyback. Can you talk a little bit about how you prioritize buybacks versus acquisition and internal spending to drive growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, thank you. Clearly, those are the three priorities for any use of cash. As you know, we're in the fortunate position this year to have strong cash balances and feel sufficiently comfortable about the environment to commit to a buyback. So the most important thing we can do with our cash is put it to work with the company. And things like what we did last year with the acquisition of Data Domain was, you know, a great result for the company, will be very accretive on a long-term basis. But if we have excess capital beyond what we think for investments, that's what we put into buyback. So essentially, first two are our investments and third is buybacks and we've have committed to spend $1 billion.</p>

          <p>Thanks everybody for joining us, hopefully you will leave here believing that we, have a great vision, solid strategy and we have had pretty darn good execution. We are focusing on, as David called it, the triple play. We're focused on taking share and growing faster than the market. We are very focused in investing in the future. And we are very focused on creating leverage. And if we do that it will be a good day for everyone here at EMC and good day for our shareholders. So thank you very much for your interest and being with us today and we'll be talking to you soon.</p>
