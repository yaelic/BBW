        <plist>
          <p>My name is Christian, and I'll be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Third Quarter 2009 Financial Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. Good afternoon everybody. I would like to welcome you to our third quarter results conference call. As we have a lot of ground to cover today, I'll keep my comments very brief, so we have adequate time for your questions at the end of our prepared remarks.</p>
          <p>So joining me today are Kevin Sharer, our Chairman and CEO, who will provide a strategic review of our business; followed by our CFO, Bob Bradway, who will discuss our quarterly results, underscore the significant strides we have made in how we manage our capital and offer insights on our revised growth outlook for the year. George Morrow, our head of global commercial operations will discuss our product performance trends in the U.S. and international markets, as well as how we have held up against biosimilars outside the U.S. And then Roger Perlmutter, who is our head of R&amp;D, will provide a regulatory and pipeline update.</p>
          <p>We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind you that our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement. In other words, through the course of our presentation today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results can vary materially.</p>
          <p>So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Arvind. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2009 conference call.</p>
          <p>I'm very pleased with our third quarter operating results on both the top and bottom line. While acknowledging the benefit from tax this quarter, our results on the bottom line continue to exceed my expectations, and we have once again raised earnings guidance.</p>
          <p>There are many moving parts in the product sales line and George will update you. Net, the base business is solid, excluding Aranesp in the U.S., and grew 5% as we anticipate several future growth drivers. We also completed and announced the results from unprecedented, for Amgen, five major phase 3 trial results in oncology and nephrology. We also advanced our mid-stage pipeline. Roger has more detail.</p>
          <p>One of the studies, TREAT in anemia, has important information that we are actively working with the FDA to communicate soon to physicians. Roger will share the detail on our plans later in the call.</p>
          <p>As you know, we received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding Prolia in osteoporosis. Among other things, the letter was, in effect, a status report and roadmap for next steps. We continue to work closely and collaboratively with the FDA, and I remain optimistic about Prolia's prospects to help patients with osteoporosis soon.</p>
          <p>Healthcare reform continues to evolve and we are paying close attention. While it is too soon to know the final outcome, we will have a view regarding the likely effects on Amgen by the time we discussed 2010 guidance in January.</p>
          <p>I would especially like to thank my colleagues at Amgen for their hard work and excellent results this quarter. Bob, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Kevin. On page five, I'll walk you through the adjusted income statement for the third quarter. As you can see, we reported very strong earnings per share growth of 21% for this quarter and I'd like to walk to you through the components of that growth.</p>
          <p>Let me start with revenues. As you can see, year-over-year revenues were down about 2% in the third quarter to $3.8 billion. When looking at these results, however, recall that the Aranesp label changed last year in the third quarter, and that is reflected in this year's third quarter results. Revenue, excluding Aranesp, increased 4% on a year-over-year basis, and in addition, our results were negatively affected by a stronger dollar in this quarter.</p>
          <p>George will give you more product detail shortly. I would note that looking at our results sequentially, it's also worth noting that revenues were up about 3%.</p>
          <p>Wholesaler inventory levels, which were low at the beginning of the year, have normalized now for the most part, and in terms of specific products, we ended the third quarter with wholesaler inventories below the low end of normal ranges for both EPOGEN and Vectibix, and above the high-end of normal ranges for Aranesp. Wholesaler inventories for our other products were within the normal ranges.</p>
          <p>Shifting to a review of the business by geography, our U.S. sales for the quarter were relatively unchanged at $2.9 billion, and internationally, we posted third quarter sales of about $818 million, which represents a decrease of 4% versus the prior year, reflecting the fact that the dollar was stronger this quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, which was about $76 million in the quarter, total product sales increased 1% and international product sales increased 5%.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our operating expenses, on an adjusted basis, our total OpEx for the quarter was down 5% versus last year, and, as you can see, our operating margin increased by almost 2 percentage points, reflecting the success of our continued cost-cutting efforts.</p>
          <p>I'll now walk you through the components of our operating expenses, starting with cost of sales, which for the quarter decreased by 8%, primarily due to lower royalty expenses, lower inventory write-offs and lower excess capacity charges, which were partially offset by higher fill finish costs, resulting from low utilization levels at our manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico. Year-on-year, you can see we benefited from about 1% margin improvement versus the third quarter of last year, and note also that quarter-over-quarter, our cost of sales margin has remained flat.</p>
          <p>Turning now to R&amp;D expenses, as you can see, R&amp;D expenses for the quarter were down 12%, primarily driven by lower clinical trial costs and lower staff-related expenses, due in part to the optimization of our clinical supply network.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expenses increased 3% versus the same quarter last year. This increase includes the cost of hiring and training the Prolia primary care sales force in anticipation of the approval of Prolia. I'd just like to note that once Prolia is approved and launched, we expect this expense run rate to increase, as we begin promotional expenditures as well.</p>
          <p>In addition, SG&amp;A expenses were higher due to promotional expenses for our marketed products, as well as higher expenses associated with the Pfizer &#x2013; which, as you know, was formerly the Wyeth &#x2013; profit share, due to higher Enbrel sales. These increases were partially offset by lower litigation expenses, or staff expenses and recoveries associated with our collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline for Prolia in PMO [postmenopausal osteoporosis].</p>
          <p>Turning now to the tax rate, let me spend a few moments discussing our adjusted tax rate for the quarter, which was 12.9%, compared to 22.7% in the prior year. There are three main drivers for the lower rate this quarter. First, the third quarter 2009 rate benefited from the fact that we reached settlements with both the IRS and the State of California on certain prior-year tax audits, and the impact of the settlements is specific to the third quarter, so we've taken all the benefit of those in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Second, we had increased both manufacturing and profits in Puerto Rico in the third quarter of 2009 as compared to the third quarter of 2008; and finally, as you'll recall, the federal R&amp;D tax credit had not yet been extended by Congress at this time last year, and obviously we're benefiting from it this year.</p>
          <p>So the third quarter adjusted tax rate is not indicative of the anticipated full-year rate, which we now expect will be approximately 18%.Year-to-date, our adjusted tax rate is approximately 17%, and while we're not providing tax guidance for 2010 at this time, please keep in mind that our expected 2009 adjusted rate is influenced by tax settlements that are specific to 2009 and will not carry forward to 2010, and therefore, our tax rate going forward is likely to be more in line with prior years than with 2009.</p>
          <p>Finishing with EPS, as you can see, our adjusted earnings for the quarter were $1.49, up 21%, and clearly EPS benefited from lower operating expenses, a decreased tax rate, as well as the decreased share counts following our share buybacks earlier in the year. Our GAAP earnings for the quarter were $1.36, up 30% versus the prior year.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to page six, you can see we once again ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and with healthy cash flows. First, let me spend a moment to discuss some of the key balance sheet items. Note that at the end of the third quarter, our global cash balance was $14 billion, and excluding the impact of a change in the way we account for convertible debt, our debt increased by $1 billion year-over-year, and we expect that this will drop back to $11.2 billion after we retire $1 billion of floating-rate notes that mature in November of 2009.</p>
          <p>With respect to our cash flow, we generated $2 billion of cash flow from operations in the third quarter, which is an improvement of roughly $600 million, or 43% over what we generated in the same period last year. This is primarily due to higher earnings and the fact that we had a legal settlement in the third quarter of 2008, which obviously doesn't repeat this year.</p>
          <p>We didn't repurchase any shares during the third quarter, and I would remind you, as you saw on my first slide, that we had a weighted average share count of about 1,021 million shares at the end of the third quarter. We currently have $2.2 billion remaining on our authorized share repurchase programs, and we will continue to use that authorization opportunistically.</p>
          <p>Turning to page seven, I'd like to provide updated revenue and earnings guidance for the year. We are firming our 2009 revenue guidance, which we still expect to be at the upper end of a guidance range of 14.4 to $14.8 billion, and with respect to earnings per share, we now expect earnings to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.05, compared to the previous range of 4.80 to 4.95. Our revised guidance reflects the lower tax rate that I referred to earlier, as well as continued operating expense discipline. And finally, we believe that the capital expenditure guidance for the year is consistent with what we've given you previously, namely, that we will spend less than $600 million in capital expenditures this year.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn it over to George.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Bob, and let's go right to the commercial highlights on slide nine. Product sales declined 1% year-over-year, driven by a few key unfavorable comparisons. First, quarter three '09 U.S. Aranesp sales declined $125 million due to label changes which occurred in August of 2008 and a one-time return reserve adjustment, which occurred in the third quarter of 2008. Second, unfavorable foreign exchange diminished international sales by $76 million.</p>
          <p>Excluding Aranesp, the remainder of the U.S. portfolio grew 5%, and excluding the unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact, the international business grew about 5% as well. On a sequential basis, quarterly global sales grew $102 million, with most products showing positive growth. Aggregate wholesale inventories ended the quarter in the middle of the normal range, up from their first and second quarter levels, which were at the low end of the range.</p>
          <p>The next slide graphically illustrates the components of year-over-year growth in the third quarter, excluding the foreign exchange loss. Aranesp was the only major component of our product portfolio to decline, and it was offset by solid growth in our other products.</p>
          <p>Next, I'll discuss each of these products in more detail, starting with Aranesp. Worldwide, Aranesp sales decreased 19% in the third quarter versus last year. Overall U.S. segment share was down one point year-over-year and down two points quarter-over-quarter. Wholesaler inventories of Aranesp ended the quarter higher than our normal range. In the U.S., Aranesp sales were down 27% year-over-year. ESA label changes made in August, 2008, combined with reimbursement policy changes, are fully reflected in clinical practices, resulting in a sharp year-over-year decline in utilization.</p>
          <p>In oncology, virtually all patients are being initiated and maintained at a hemoglobin of 10 grams per deciliter, and use is minimal in patients where the anticipated outcome is cure. In CKD patients not on dialysis, doses are being titrated to achieve and maintain hemoglobin within the range of 10 to 12 grams per deciliter. We are continuing our ESA REMS discussions with the FDA and expect resolution this year.</p>
          <p>Internationally, Aranesp sales decreased 2%, excluding foreign exchange, and declined 9% including foreign exchange. I'll discuss the specifics of share and segment changes when I review the international results.</p>
          <p>Next slide. EPOGEN grew by 5% in the third quarter of 2009 versus the third quarter 2008, driven mostly by patient growth. Consistent with the label, healthcare practitioners have refined their treatment practices to achieve and maintain patient hemoglobin levels in the 10 to 12 grams for deciliter range, and we expect this to continue.</p>
          <p>Next slide. Neulasta and NEUPOGEN combined grew 2% third quarter '09 versus third quarter '08. In the U.S., sales grew 5%, driven by demand, about half coming from price, half coming from units. Inventory and business adjustments remained flat year-on-year. Internationally, Neulasta and NEUPOGEN declined 7% year-on-year, with 3% growth excluding foreign exchange effects.</p>
          <p>The NEUPOGEN/Neulasta franchise growth continues to be driven largely by conversion of NEUPOGEN to Neulasta, as well as solid growth in previously underpenetrated markets in Central and Eastern Europe. Neulasta and NEUPOGEN wholesaler inventory levels exited third quarter '09 near the middle of the normal range.</p>
          <p>Enbrel is next on slide 14. At a reporting level, we experienced growth of 3% versus the third quarter of 2008. The primary driver was demand growth of 6%, which was partially offset by business adjustments recorded in the third quarter of 2008, which were favorable and also one-time in nature. Within demand, we experienced price growth, partially offset by modest unit decline. The unit decline was primarily in dermatology, where we lost some share year-over-year to new competition. The impact of inventory changes within the quarter was immaterial.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, U.S. Enbrel maintained its leadership position in both rheumatology and dermatology. Despite two new competitors launching in quarter two in rheumatology, Enbrel held share at around 33%, and in dermatology, Enbrel continues to get the majority of first-line biologic use for psoriasis, capturing more than 60% of the dollar share in the segment during the quarter.</p>
          <p>On to Sensipar on slide 15. For the third quarter, worldwide Sensipar sales grew 2% versus the third quarter of 2008, essentially due to international demand. International delivered 14% growth, or 24% excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange. Conversely, U.S. performance declined 3% due to slightly lower segment penetration, driven by continued payer pressure and restrictions on the Part D side of our business.</p>
          <p>Next slide is Vectibix. Our promotional efforts center on identifying specific and appropriate patients based on our existing label, and highlighting the benefits of Vectibix versus the competition. Vectibix's future growth is highly dependent upon label expansion into second- and first-line metastatic colorectal cancer, and Roger will discuss the good news on that front in a moment.</p>
          <p>The next slide summarizes our international sales performance. Internationally, sales grew 6%, excluding divested products and the effects of foreign exchange, versus the prior year. Growth was driven by Neulasta conversion, growth from new product launches, and expansion into new territories.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, we'll look at international segment share for Aranesp in nephrology. As in recent quarters, Aranesp's nephrology share remains steady, as biosimilars continue to take share from EPO-alpha and EPO-beta, but not Aranesp.</p>
          <p>My last slide is new, and it provides comparable segment share data for the G-CSF market. To date, biosimilar uptake is only slightly faster than what we saw with the ESAs, but in line with our internal expectations. Roger?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, George. Slide 21 provides an outline for what I will cover today.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, our R&amp;D organization announced results from five major phase 3 studies in oncology and nephrology, and also made very substantial progress in advancing our mid- and early-stage pipeline.</p>
          <p>Let me turn first to Prolia on the next slide, which is under review at the FDA and other regulatory agencies for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, and for the treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation therapy in breast and prostate cancer patients.</p>
          <p>On Monday, we announced that we had received a complete response letter from the FDA with respect to Prolia. The Agency is reviewing our post-marketing studies in the osteoporosis treatment indication, and our previously submitted Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is still pending. While no new studies were requested in the area of treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, additional clinical trials would be required for approval of the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis indication.</p>
          <p>I should note that receipt of a complete response letter is now a common step in the approval process, especially for first-in-class therapies. As noted in our statement, we believe that working together with the FDA, we can quickly complete the process that would permit approval of Prolia for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.</p>
          <p>We have now also received a complete response letter with respect to the use of Prolia as treatment for bone loss in women with breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitors, and in men with prostate cancer receiving hormone ablation therapy. In both instances, the Agency has asked for additional information from clinical trials that would demonstrate that denosumab has no adverse effect on tumor progression or on overall survival in patients with breast or prostate cancer. We expect to learn more about the Agency's requirements outlined in this complete response letter during the next few weeks.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 23. In September, we presented data showing that denosumab is superior to Zometa in its ability to reduce skeletal-related events in women with metastatic breast cancer. A similar study, performed in patients with either multiple myeloma or one of the large set of solid tumors, showed that denosumab was as effective as is Zometa in delaying these pathologic consequences of malignancy in the skeleton. Results from a third study, in this case performed in men with prostate cancer and skeletal metastases, will be available in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Based on the expectation of completion of this study in the near term, we have elected to file for approval for denosumab in this indication using all three skeletal-related events trials, in this way providing active comparator control data from approximately 6,000 patients.</p>
          <p>Slide 24 shows that, in addition to the denosumab SRE studies that I've just mentioned, in the third quarter, we also obtained data showing that Vectibix improves progression-free survival when used in combination with standard chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer whose tumors contained wild-type KRAS genes. Details of these studies were presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology meetings in Berlin at the end of September.</p>
          <p>The effects of Vectibix treatment on progression-free survival were statistically significant, and we saw a trend towards improved overall survival in one of these studies, our second-line colorectal cancer study. Overall survival information from our first-line colorectal cancer study will become available during the fourth quarter of this year. While I cannot speculate on what the results of this analysis will show, in either case, I expect that we will be able to file for approval of a broader set of indications for Vectibix sometime next year.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 25, during the third quarter, we announced top line information on the TREAT study, which enrolled 4,038 patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, though not on dialysis; and moderate anemia, who were randomized to receive either Aranesp to achieve a hemoglobin level of 13 grams per deciliter, or placebo treatment.</p>
          <p>The primary endpoints for this study were the composite outcome of death or cardiovascular disease, comprising, in this case, non-fatal myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, hospitalization from myocardial ischemia or stroke; and the composite outcome of death or end-stage renal disease. In essence, this is the first large-scale placebo-controlled trial that examines the benefits and risks of anemia treatment.</p>
          <p>As we announced previously, the study did not meet its primary endpoints. There was no statistically significant effect of Aranesp treatment on overall mortality or cardiovascular outcomes. This is important, since many had believed that anemia treatment would improve cardiovascular outcomes in this population. On the other hand, a prior report from a smaller open-label study called CHOIR found a highly significant adverse effect of anemia treatment on the composite endpoint of death and cardiovascular outcomes in CKV patients not on dialysis, so the findings in our large double blind placebo-controlled study are really quite important.</p>
          <p>Among the components of the three outcomes measures, stroke, which has been noted in the Aranesp label since 2001, was more likely to occur in the patients who received Aranesp, with 101 patients, or 5%, suffering a stroke in the actively treated group, versus 53 or 2.6% in those who received placebo &#x2013; a nearly twofold difference.</p>
          <p>This risk must be weighed against improvements in other areas, notably in the frequency of blood transfusion and in patient-reported outcomes, but it is certainly not inconsequential. It is important to note that in this moderately anemic population, the placebo-treated group was permitted to receive Aranesp as a rescue medication and maintained hemoglobin levels above 10 grams per deciliter; that is, they were maintained within the recommend range specified in current labeling. The Aranesp group was treated to the higher hemoglobin target of 13 grams per deciliter.</p>
          <p>I also wish to note that during the course of the study we modified the study protocol, such that patient diagnosed with malignancy were withdrawn from study drug. This precaution was taken to exclude the possibility of harm in the study population. In the final analysis, there were no significant differences between groups in the incidence of cancer or of deaths in patients who developed cancer.</p>
          <p>Among those patients with a history of cancer at baseline, however, there were 60 deaths from any cause in the 188 patients assigned to Aranesp, and 37 deaths in the 160 patients assigned to placebo; and within these populations, there was a further imbalance in adjudicated death due to cancer, with 14 of 188 patients receiving Aranesp, and only one of the 37 patients receiving placebo assigned to this category. This is a post hoc analysis, of course, and requires more detailed investigation. As I noted earlier, it is our view, as stated in our label, that in patients with active cancer not on chemotherapy, treatment with Aranesp should be avoided.</p>
          <p>Details of the TREAT study will be presented at the American Society for Nephrology meeting at the end of this month, and at the American Heart Association meetings in November. In addition, a manuscript describing the results of TREAT will appear in the relatively near future. We have communicated the TREAT study results to regulatory authorities around the world, and we'll work closely with regulators to update the Aranesp and EPOGEN labels with this new data as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>Finally, turning to my last slide, we expect results from five more phase 3 studies in 2010, including the denosumab SRE study in men with metastatic prostate cancer that I already mentioned, as well as a study examining the ability of denosumab treatment to delay the appearance of skeletal metastases in men with established prostate cancer.</p>
          <p>Phase 3 studies of Vectibix as therapy for recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and of motesanib added to conventional chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer will also read out in 2010, as will the EVOLVE study, one that examines the ability of Sensipar &#x2013; Mimpara in Europe &#x2013; to improve vascular outcomes in patients with renal insufficiency.</p>
          <p>In addition, during 2010, our mid-stage pipeline will become progressively more visible, with studies of several new oncology agents reaching completion, so I expect that there will be even more to communicate over the next several months. Kevin?</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks very much. I appreciate the chance to ask the question. Roger, on denosumab, treatment-induced bone loss, the FDA has asked you for PFS overall survival. What sort of study would you do to prove that negative? And just related, are you convinced that you have sufficient data on the SRE endpoint to show that there's no effect on overall survival in PFS from those studies at that dose? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Yes, Geoff, I think that one of the things that we're going to learn is the extent to which the SRE studies, which as you know, are &#x2013; two of three are completed, actually contain the information necessary to respond to the questions raised by the Division of Biologic Oncologic Products at FDA, so we're going to learn a lot more about that. As you know, we do have a lot of detail within the hormone ablation study in prostate cancer that we can also discuss that provides information about both progression and overall survival, and of course, we can discuss those data with FDA as well. So we'll learn a lot more in the next short period of time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi guys. Just following upon the TREAT data, when did you share this data with FDA? And beyond the labeling update, is there any risk to the broader CKD indication for Aranesp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the TREAT data, of course, we obtained the top line information, which is just a flash report, represents just the initial study findings from this very large study, 4,000 patients, back in the last part of August and we shared that information with the FDA immediately, before we sent out a press release. Subsequently, we have been engaged in further analyses of these data, working with the study executive committee, which is, of course, an external group of academic experts on the study data, and with external statistical consultants, and as those data have developed, we've shared those data also with the FDA, and we're continuing to have discussions with FDA and other regulators about these data. So, the question is now, what should be done in order to properly inform physicians and patients about the findings of the TREAT study, and that's what we're in the midst of doing, and we'll work our way through that over the next short period of time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I just wanted to follow up on the TREAT study. Roger, can you &#x2013; so I just want to confirm that the cancer analysis was not prespecified and that among these cancer comparator, they were getting, I think you said, 10 grams per deciliter and Aranesp patients were getting 13? Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two parts to the question. First of all, there was not a prespecified analysis of this. As I indicated, these are post hoc analyses, so what was done was simply to look at the overall cancer incidence in these populations, which is balanced, and then to ask additional questions about deaths due to cancer, adjudicated deaths due to cancer, which was a prespecified feature of the study.</p>
          <p>The important thing to note is that the treated arm, the Aranesp-treated arm, had a hemoglobin target of 13; the placebo-treated arm was permitted rescue medication in the form of Aranesp, and maintained the hemoglobin that was within the 10 to 12 range that's recommended by our label. So you're really comparing a high hemoglobin arm to an arm that's within our current label, as represented, and we're still looking in enormous detail at each one of these cases of malignancy, in order to make sure that they were properly adjudicated, that they were scored correctly, and that we really understand what happened in each case. As I indicated, it's a very large study. We're just six or seven weeks out from the time that the study closed, so it takes quite a while to get all these data pulled together.</p>

Can you help us understand a little bit how was the PFS data gathered in the ongoing SRE studies, both in the prostate and in other tumors, and in breast? And how was that done in the actual tumor prevention study, just so we really understand kind of what to expect in the differences and the quality of the PFS data?</p>
          <p>And I don't know if you can, but just share with us any initial conversation with FDA as to, again, how do they look, what's the crossreads between HALT and SRE as to where the bar is and what kind of data they really want to approve Prolia for the new indications of cancer?

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yaron, the first question had to do with the way in which we capture progression data in the SRE studies, and there's a specialized case report form that was specifically designed for this, and the investigators were trained on this, so they're actually scoring progression, and of course, we capture overall survival data, which we've presented for the 136 and 244 studies, as you know.</p>
          <p>Obviously, in the whole prostate study, and also in the 103 study, we have the advantage of a very specific biomarker that scores tumor burden, namely PSA, and that would be &#x2013; has been and will be very important. And so those are the things that will be available and are available for the agency to look at. Of course, they haven't seen the SRE studies in detail. I think that once they have a chance to look at them, those data would be very important, but the conversations have yet to occur.</p>

We appreciate that. Maybe just a quick question for George. I'll make it an easy question. Can you maybe give us the breakout of Aranesp sales in predialysis in the U.S. and in Europe, if possible, in your opinion, on whether or not you think these data are going to have any impact on those numbers?</p>

          <p>Yes, I'm not going to speculate on what's going to happen, because Roger has to complete his discussions with the FDA and they need to decide what changes, if any, will occur with the label. But if we go back to third quarter of 2009 in the U.S., hard to precisely give you a number, but it's probably in the $75 million range in the U.S. for predialysis CKD patients, and we have even weaker data in Europe, but it's probably on the same dimension, so probably around 75 in that quarter as well, but it could be plus or minus 10, 15.</p>

We're ready to go, and they are going to be doing productive things in advance of the &#x2013; getting the label and a chance to launch this product, so I'm not going to speculate on when that will occur, but they're very much engaged at this point.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wonder if you could help me out, just explain specifically, I know you won't go into details because it is not finalized, but when you say the FDA requires for the REMS, a medication guide, a communication plan and a timetable, is that inclusive of everything they're requesting? And can you just elaborate on each individual element, what that means, kind of what a medication guide, communication plan, and that timetable entails?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Michael, sure. That is the listing that they've indicated, and of course, we've provided those, the medication guide and communication plan to the Agency and they're reviewing it. Medication guide of course is key to the label and provides a means of telling patients with each administration exactly what the benefit and risk profile looks like. It's focused a lot on the risks that have been identified or may exist with Prolia, so that's what the medication guide looks like. And the communication plan has similar information in somewhat more depth that's provided to physicians, and then there is a set of measures that demonstrate that, in fact, the medication guide and communication plan are being appropriately distributed and paid attention to.</p>
          <p>Those things are important. In addition, of course, the Agency is anxious to have, as is typical in such cases, the most of up-to-date safety follow-up from the long-term extension data on our studies, which we'll also provide them with.</p>

Our filing strategy will not be changed much by the activity on Prolia. I am expecting that we'll be able to move forward relatively soon with Prolia, but it won't change our strategy, in any case.</p>

Neulasta went from nine to 11; normal is 10 to 14. NEUPOGEN went from 15 to 16 &#x2013; again, this is all quarter two to quarter three &#x2013; and normal is 14 to 18. EPOGEN went from seven to seven, and that's below the normal range of eight to 12. Let's see. Enbrel went from 14 to 15, and normal is 14 to 20. Sensipar went from 18 to 18, normal is 15 to 19, and Vectibix went from 19 to 12, the normal is 15 to 20.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Roger, just wondering: the cancer outcome was not pre-specified and there was a modest imbalance in the number of patients with cancer at baseline. Do you have any sense yet if there were differences in the types of cancer or the stage of cancer that may account for some of this difference, or is it pretty well balanced and this is consistent with what we've seen before and that is that high doses of this drug may cause cancer to grow a little more quickly?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Steve, first of all, I would say I don't think there's anything &#x2013; any conclusion that we can draw yet about whether the administration of Aranesp is doing anything to cancer progression. When we look in detail of these cases, there's not surprisingly, you're looking at the kind of the tyranny of small numbers, and so things move around quite a bit. There are protocol violators who had active disease, who really didn't get much therapy, and so there's still a lot of work that has to be done to sort out what has happened. Looking at this data that we have, and trying to go through each one of the different cases, it's not at the moment possible to draw any conclusions about the effect of Aranesp on a tumor-bearing population.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks for taking the question. I'm trying to understand why biosimilar uptake in Europe is so slow. Is it a viable business model and do you see any shifting in healthcare policies or regulations to incentivize faster or further uptake of biosimilar agents?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, first of all, I'll say that it varies tremendously by country, and Germany being probably at the forefront of biosimilar penetration, countries the further south you go in Europe, the lower the penetration, and probably the primary reason is there are anti-substitution laws and that the doctor really has to decide. And so far, given pricing and safety concerns, they've largely chosen to stick with the originator product, so. Will that change over time? I think you see in Germany the sick funds making some attempt to spur some additional adoption of the biosimilars, but it's not something that the doctors naturally want to do en masse at this point.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good evening guys. I've got a question for Kevin. In November, 2008, you had expressed an aspiration to be one of the top three performers in the biopharmaceutical industry over the next five years. Given there's been various movements &#x2013; moving parts of the business including biosimilars, d-mab, Aranesp, several positives, several negatives. Overall, given what's transpired over the past year, do you feel optimistic about your future growth profile?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that question and you're right, we did last November in New York express that aspiration. A couple of things. I think that if you look at the positives &#x2013; that is, Vectibix and Prolia &#x2013; I'm very, very optimistic. We knew back then that ESAs were declining and they're declining at the rate that we expected and there's REMS and a few other things on the horizon that we also knew about. So in general, the trajectory that I saw a year ago I still see.</p>
          <p>One thing that is also true is that the industry's prospects, say, compared to a decade ago or two decades ago, are more modest than they would have been by quite a bit. I also note we're in the middle of what's seen as perhaps the greatest recession in a long, long time. So given all that, which I didn't exactly see last November the degree to which we see it now, I'm still very optimistic about our prospects to be a industry leader in growth. And obviously, a lot of that is going to play out over the next year or so as we learn more about the label for Prolia and Vectibix results and other things that will reveal themselves. But I feel like I did a year ago.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. I hate to go back to this original question, Roger, but has the FDA asked you for an additional study on Prolia, or is your interpretation of what they request is, that you may be able to satisfy that request with the data from the SRE study?</p>

          <p>Geoff, it's possible we may be able to satisfy that request with the data from the SRE study. That needs to be discussed further with the Agency. They did not specifically ask for us to begin to conduct additional studies.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Just following up on the complete response letter and looking at the recent guidance from FDA, the draft guidance on REMS, they've got very specific requirements for format and content. When you look at the format and content of what you provided in your REMS, do you think you need to reformat it, because it seems like pretty nitpicky bureaucratic stuff? I know you don't want to characterize it that way, but did you format it and provide the exact content they asked for in the draft guidance?</p>
