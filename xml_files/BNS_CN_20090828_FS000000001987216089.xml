        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and welcome to the presentation of Scotiabank's Third Quarter Results. I'm Luc Vanneste, Chief Financial Officer. Rick Waugh, our CEO, will lead off with the highlights of our results.</p>
          <p>Next, I will go over the financials, including a review of business line performance. Brian Porter, our Group Head, Risk and Treasury will then discuss credit quality. Brian will be followed by our business line heads who will provide an update on their respective businesses. We will then be glad to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would like to refer you to slide number two of our presentation, which contains Scotiabank's caution regarding forward-looking statements. Rick, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Luc. Well, we are pleased to report strong third quarter financial results with reported net income of $931 million, or $0.87 per share and record revenues for the second consecutive quarter. Revenues were up 11% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter while diluted earnings per share were up 7% quarter-over-quarter. These results have delivered a strong return on equity of 18% this quarter and 17.5% year-to-date, a level of consistently high profitability achieved by very few banks and industry-leading here in Canada.</p>
          <p>This level of profitability, coupled with strong growth in earnings from our core businesses, is allowing us to proactively manage through this economic downturn, which has had some impact on our security portfolios and has led to higher loan provisions. Our profitability and internally generated capital allows us to continually improve the strength of our balance sheet and capital ratios, invest in our businesses and provide safe and consistent dividends. Although we have issued some regulatory capital over the last year, we have not needed to issue dilutive common equity, other than a small amount for the partial financing of our CI acquisition of shares and through our shareholders' reinvestment plan.</p>
          <p>In our business lines, both Canadian Banking and Scotia Capital had record quarters, while International produced solid results. This reemphasizes the strength of our diversified global business platform and in addition to strong revenues, our ongoing disciplined expense management also played an important role in our financial performance. Our productivity ratio for the third quarter was an impressive 51%.</p>
          <p>Credit risk continues to be well-managed as loan portfolios are being closely monitored across geographies and industries. Provision for credit losses, both specific and general, are well within our expectations and risk appetite. Two of our business lines, Canadian Banking and Scotia Capital, have performed to expectations, reflecting the economic cycles and appear to be at or near peak levels of provisions and formations. Due to the lag effect of the global economies on our international banking portfolio, provisions may continue to be under some moderate pressure for a number of quarters.</p>
          <p>These economies have had more vulnerability to the effects of the global recession. However, in the developing countries in which we operate, their demographics, financial stability, and growth potential remain strong.</p>
          <p>Leadership is a strategic priority for Scotiabank and as you know, we recently announced some important changes to our executive management team that will be effective September 1, 2009. These changes will support our strategy of diversification across geographies, product lines and our three strong growth platforms. We believe that the strength and the depth of our leadership team is a distinct competitive advantage for Scotiabank and these recent changes certainly further that belief and position us well for the near and the long-term and the opportunities that will present themselves.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, as we mentioned, we see the global economy improving and it should continue to build momentum into next year. We expect real GDP to be positive in 2010 in the major markets in which we are active and as I said, the bank is well-positioned to take advantage of these improving conditions. Given our solid year-to-date performance, we are maintaining the objectives established at the beginning of this fiscal year. We are confident that the bank is well-positioned to meet its 2009 targets and we anticipate that the fourth quarter will be substantially better than the results posted in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>So with all that, I will now pass it over to Luc to talk about our financial performance in greater detail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rick.</p>
          <p>Q3 was a strong quarter with net income of $931 million, up 7% from Q2. This increase was driven by strong capital markets-related revenues, which included a record trading quarter, a higher margin and increased wealth management revenues. Partly offsetting were ForEx, higher PCLs and lower securitization revenues. Compared to Q3 '08, the decrease in net income was due to higher PCLs and write-downs on securities, partly offset by increased net interest income and trading revenues.</p>
          <p>Our ROE remains high at 18%. Our year-to-date ROE is 17.5% within our 16 to 20% target range and continues to be very strong by international standards. As Rick mentioned, our productivity ratio was a very impressive 51% and well below our target of 58%.</p>
          <p>This quarter's results were impacted by a number of items. Trading revenues were a record $514 million in Q3, up $183 million from Q2. Clearly, this quarter's trading revenues are not sustainable. Offsetting was an increase of $100 million to the general provision, AFS security writedowns of $175 million, including the write-down of an equity investment in international and we also benefited from mark-to-market gains on CDOs of 56 million, mostly in International Banking. Overall, the net impact of these items I just mentioned is not material to our EPS.</p>
          <p>For the second straight quarter, we achieved record revenues of 5% versus Q2 and 11% year-over-year. Compared to Q2, net interest income rose 4%. We also benefited from a higher margin and a longer quarter, partly offset by ForEx and lower asset volumes. Other income was up 6% driven by record trading results.</p>
          <p>Mutual fund fees were also higher than last quarter. Partly offsetting were ForEx and lower securitization revenues, which were down from a very high level in Q2. Compared to last year, the 11% increase in revenue was due to broad-based asset growth, higher trading revenues and positive impacts from financial instruments and ForEx. Partly offsetting were losses on investment securities versus gains in Q3 '08.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide nine, you will see that our spot asset balances decreased $28 billion, or 5% versus Q2. $17 billion of the decrease was due to ForEx while the remainder was due to the pay-down of bridge loans and other corporate loans.</p>
          <p>Mortgage balances declined $13 billion during Q3. The decrease was due to the conversion of insured mortgages into mortgage-backed securities for liquidity purposes. These mortgage-backed securities remain on our balance sheet and are included in available-for-sale securities.</p>
          <p>Excluding this conversion, underlying mortgage balances increased approximately by $2 billion. Looking at the right side of this slide, risk-weighted assets declined by $20 billion versus Q2. $13 billion was due to ForEx and $10 billion was due to the reduction in business volumes. Partly offsetting was portfolio migration of about $3 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 10, the margin increased by five basis points versus Q2. The increase was driven by a number of factors, including asset re-pricing, higher loan origination fees and lower non-earning assets.</p>
          <p>Looking at expenses, non-interest expenses increased 4% versus Q2 mostly as a result of higher performance-based compensation. Year-over-year, expenses are up 4%; however, excluding acquisitions and ForEx, they are actually down by 1%. Growth initiative spending has been more than offset by lower advertising and professional fees. Overall, underlying expenses continue to be well controlled across all of our business lines reflecting our ongoing cost-control measures.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 12, our capital ratios increased significantly in Q3. Our Tier 1 ratio is now 10.4% while our TCE ratio is 8%. Excluding the net impact of ForEx, which was seven basis points negative, the quarter-over-quarter increase in our Tier 1 capital ratio was due to the following factors.</p>
          <p>We had internal capital generation, which resulted in an increase of 17 basis points; new capital issuances, which includes the innovative capital instruments and our dividend reinvestment program; and the underlying risk-weighted asset declines of $7 billion.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the business lines. Canadian Banking had a record quarter with net income of $500 million, up 22% from Q2. Revenues were up 8% from last quarter with solid gains in both net interest income and other income. Net interest income rose due to a higher margin and a longer quarter. The increase in other income was due largely to higher wealth management revenues, which were bolstered by stronger market conditions and market share gains.</p>
          <p>Provisions declined $19 million quarter-over-quarter due to lower commercial provisions and the $10 million sectoral established in Q2. Partly offsetting were higher retail provisions.</p>
          <p>Expenses continue to be well-managed. The 4% increase versus Q2 was due to increased commissions in line with stronger wealth management revenues and the longer quarter. Compared to Q3 '08, earnings increased 8%. Good revenue growth and strong cost control produced another quarter of positive operating leverage, which more than offset the increase in PCLs.</p>
          <p>International had a solid quarter with net income of $312 million. Revenues were down 3% quarter-over-quarter; however, they were up 3%, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Expenses were down 2% reflecting the positive impact of ForEx. Underlying expenses were well controlled. PCLs were up $64 million quarter-over-quarter due to higher commercial and retail provisions. Last quarter, we had a reversal of a $29 million provision on certain retail portfolios in Mexico. Brian will provide further details on our provisions.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year, net income was down 7%. The positive impact of acquisitions, foreign exchange translation, solid asset growth and wider margins were more than offset by higher provisions for credit losses.</p>
          <p>As mentioned, Scotia Capital had a record quarter with net income of $470 million, up 43% versus last quarter and 58% year-over-year. Compared to Q2, revenues were up 30% with record revenues in both global capital markets and global corporate and investment banking. Strong revenues in global capital markets were driven by broad-based performance, particularly higher derivatives revenues. Increased global corporate and investment banking revenues reflect higher spreads, loan origination fees and credit fees, partly offset by lower loan volumes.</p>
          <p>Expenses were up 15% versus last quarter, largely due to higher performance-based compensation. A component of the performance-based compensation has been deferred as part of the new performance-based compensation plan. Provisions were down $53 million, or 33% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the $50 million Q2 auto sectoral provision. Compared to Q3 '08, net income increased 58% driven by record revenues with strong performances across the business, partly offset by higher provision for credit losses.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to the other business segment, which incorporates the results of Group Treasury, smaller operating units and certain corporate adjustments. As you can see, we have expanded this quarter's presentation to provide a better view of the key components in this segment. The first component we have highlighted is Treasury's funding net interest income, which includes the bank's term funding, as well as our short-term foreign funding. It mainly includes the negative or positive carry on funding positions. Quarter-over-quarter, net interest income declined as favorable foreign currency positions matured and were rolled over at more normal spreads. Year-over-year, the negative carry has risen as we have taken on more term funding.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next line, net securitization revenues are comprised of the gain we earn from securitizing our mortgages and the reduction in mortgage net interest income from removing these assets from our balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter net revenues declined $163 million, mainly due to significantly lower securitization gains this quarter as we securitized less than half the volumes we did in Q2.</p>
          <p>Writedowns in the investment portfolios and Group Treasury units totaled $95 million this quarter, comparable to the level of writedowns taken last quarter. On the next line, general provisions were up $73 million quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the addition of $100 million to the general allowance this quarter versus $27 million in Q2. Expenses and other items net reflect the salaries and benefits and other costs of operating this unit and other items which are largely offsetting and are not individually significant.</p>
          <p>Moving down to the line at the bottom of the table, as a result of the above, the other business line reported a loss of $351 million in Q3 compared to a loss of $85 million last year and $198 million in the second quarter. We expect the loss in this segment will moderate in Q4 as we do not anticipate the same level of investment writedowns and general provisions going forward. Also, the bank's funding is positioned to benefit from rising interest rates as a portion of our long-term funding has been locked in at fixed rates. While this has a short-term cost, it is both prudent and will benefit us in the longer term.</p>
          <p>I will now turn it over to Brian to talk about risk.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Luc. I will now discuss the key issues on risk. Our portfolios are performing within expectations in the challenging credit markets. This quarter, specific provisions were 466 million, including 12 million that was reclassified from a sectoral allowance established last quarter against the automotive sector.</p>
          <p>In light of some downward credit migration resulting in higher impaired loan classifications in our commercial and corporate portfolios, we added 100 million to the general allowance this quarter. Our general allowance now stands at 1.45 billion, or 65 basis points of risk-weighted assets. We will continue to provision prudently to stay ahead of the curve and maintain sound coverage ratios.</p>
          <p>On the market risk front, our average one-day VaR declined slightly from Q2 and was well within our risk tolerances. I will first discuss our provisions this quarter and then provide some comments on our coverage ratios and market risk. Slide 19 shows the trend in specific, sectoral and general provisions over the past five quarters.</p>
          <p>As you can see, the major quarter-over-quarter increase in specific provisions was in international, reflecting the challenging economic environment. This increase was due in part to a 29 million reversal of our Mexican retail provisions last quarter. The increase in Scotia Capital was modest, whereas Canadian Banking had a small decline. Looking at the year-over-year increase in International, 44 million was attributable to acquisitions.</p>
          <p>I'll make some further comments on our specific provisions starting with our retail portfolios. Excluding last quarter's reversal in Mexico, the overall retail provisions were flat quarter-over-quarter, though clearly higher than in 2008 given the current economic environment.</p>
          <p>For the Canadian book, the provisions of 137 million were up slightly from Q2 and are consistent with our expectations. You will recall that 92% of this book is secured. Our revolving credit portfolios are more than 50% secured and are performing as expected. Balance utilization, customer migration, and delinquencies were generally stable in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to International, the underlying provisions were down slightly in the quarter as a decline in Mexico was partially offset by an increase in Peru. Looking next at the specific provisions against our wholesale portfolios, the major quarter-over-quarter increase was in International. The Q3 provisions of 33 million were spread across several accounts in Asia, Chile and the Caribbean.</p>
          <p>The quarter-over-quarter increase in Scotia Capital provisions was modest. The Q3 provisions of 117 million relate primarily to additional provisions taken against an account in the U.S. and a provision set up against an account in Canada, as well as smaller provisions taken against several accounts in both countries. Offsetting these increases, Canadian commercial provisions declined by 19 million to 33 million.</p>
          <p>Looking at the coverage ratios on the next slide, clearly we have the earnings power to cover a higher level of provisioning as our year-to-date pre-tax, pre-provision income was 3.7 times the total provisions &#x2013; specific, sectoral and general &#x2013; taken over the past nine months.</p>
          <p>With respect to the balance sheet, we have 37% specific allowance coverage and 75% total allowance coverage against gross impaired loans. On the total loan portfolio, our allowance coverage ratio has risen by 15 basis points to 1.1 as a result of increases in allowance combined with a decline in loan assets. We are comfortable with our current level of coverage on the balance sheet and will continue to take a prudent approach.</p>
          <p>In terms of trading results, as Luc mentioned, we had a record quarter with only six lost days compared to nine lost days in the previous quarter. Those losses are well within the range predicted by our VaR.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, while credit markets will continue to be challenging for some time, we are seeing signs of stability returning to our portfolios in Canada and the U.S. On the other hand, our portfolios in the Caribbean and Latin America will be under some pressure for a number of quarters.</p>
          <p>Overall however, the pace of credit migration is moderating, particularly on the wholesale side. We are comfortable with how our portfolios are performing at this point of the credit cycle and we will continue to prudently manage our loan portfolios across all geographies and industries. We expect our provisioning levels to remain in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>That concludes my remarks on risk and I will now turn it over to Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brian. Canadian Banking generated strong financial results in the third quarter and while the Canadian economy remains slow, we believe that stimulus-driven growth will begin to take hold in Q4 and into 2010.</p>
          <p>We see opportunities for continued revenue growth in our core lending and deposit businesses, as well as our key areas of strategic focus. One of our key strategic priorities has been to build our wealth management business and we have experienced good revenue and earnings growth this quarter in each of our wealth businesses.</p>
          <p>A combination of low deposit yields and increasing confidence has brought investors back into the market and we have enjoyed bank and industry-leading market share growth in mutual funds in Q3.</p>
          <p>In the month of July, Scotia mutual funds was number one among the industry and banks for total net sales, while our partners in DundeeWealth and CI were numbers two and three respectively. In addition, according to investor economics, our share of total Canadian household financial wealth market assets has increased in each of the six month, one year and three year basis.</p>
          <p>Our acquisitions have also been performing well. In Scotia iTRADE, new account growth is up 14% and trade volumes have risen more than 22% year-over-year. In 2010, we will bring ScotiaMcLeod Direct Investing and TradeFreedom under the Scotia iTRADE brand to leverage the best customer experience and technology from each of the three platforms.</p>
          <p>Our investments in CI Financial and DundeeWealth continue to progress. These are two of the leading wealth management companies in Canada. Our experience with Dundee has been very positive as we have seen an increase of $4 billion in retail deposits through this channel since our purchase of Dundee Bank. CI and DundeeWealth are important providers to our partners mutual fund program and we will see where their other sub-advisory arrangements could bring additional value. Going forward, we plan to continue to make investments in both people and technology to grow our wealth management business.</p>
          <p>A second area of strategic focus for us has been to increase insurance revenues. Earlier this year, we rebranded our insurance business and we followed that up this quarter by announcing an enhanced product suite and our first retail storefront. We now offer a comprehensive portfolio of home, auto and life insurance products distributed through multiple channels.</p>
          <p>We also remain committed to growing our deposit base. In this environment of low interest rates and stiff competition, we have responded with a number of innovative deposit products during the quarter. In Q3, we introduced a new Flex GIC, which offers customers both a higher rate and liquidity.</p>
          <p>In terms of our outlook for PCLs, PCLs have increased over the past year in response to economic conditions, but, as Brian indicated, they remain within our expectations. We are beginning to see early signs that delinquencies in both retail and commercial portfolios are stabilizing and our asset quality remains strong.</p>
          <p>We have been very disciplined in managing our cost base. In total, expenses are up 3% on a year-to-date basis, including our acquisitions of iTRADE and Roynat Leasing.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we have focused on optimizing our cost base. For instance, by improving processes to maximize the amount of time our employees spend serving customers.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we'll continue to be disciplined about cost control and look for ways to redirect spending to the most profitable businesses. We expect that overall costs will increase somewhat, reflecting higher wealth management commissions, as well as selected investments in revenue growth initiatives like new branches. That being said we will continue to focus on generating positive operating leverage in the business overall.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd like to say a few words about the Canadian Banking management team. We've recently announced that Wendy Hannam, our Executive Vice President for Personal Banking and Distribution; and Dieter Jentsch, Executive Vice President, Canadian Banking Commercial, will be taking on new roles in International Banking. These moves provide them with tremendous opportunities to grow personally and to share some best practices across the bank. We will miss them and I'd like to thank both Wendy and Dieter personally for their support, expertise and counsel in the past few years.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to take the opportunity to welcome Anatol von Hahn, our new Executive Vice President of Personal and Commercial Banking, to the Canadian Banking team. Anatol will be joining us from International Banking and brings a wealth of experience in retail and commercial banking with him.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will turn it over to Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris.</p>
          <p>International banking had solid results again this quarter. Core businesses continue to hold despite the slowdown in some of our key markets, but we do see challenges over the next few quarters given a number of factors; first, the lag effect of the global slowdown and loan provisions; second, the expected return from acquisitions that we're working through due in part to economic headwinds; finally, the ongoing impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.</p>
          <p>However, this is a short-term situation. We are in good markets. They've held up historically well and they're proving resilient now. Our underlying demographics and fundamentals are good. Our banks are performing very well vis-&#xE0;-vis our competitors and we're well positioned to benefit as our markets recover. This challenging environment highlights the strength of our franchises and our discipline in areas such as growth, credit risk and expense management.</p>
          <p>We're driving down growth in retail banking by expanding and upgrading our non-branch distribution channels, improving the effectiveness of our sales teams, and putting in place core banking systems of a world-class standard. We're driving growth in commercial and corporate banking by focusing on industries where we have global expertise, actively working with Scotia Capital to grow capital markets business globally. We're also expanding ancillary businesses such as insurance and wealth management.</p>
          <p>Credit risk management remains a key priority for us. We're managing through these difficult markets, and PCLs essentially are right on where we planned for them to be at this point last year. Early in the credit cycle, we tightened our credit policies and increased collections. This quarter marked an important milestone with implementation of an advanced retail account management system in Peru and a new collection system in Mexico. These systems will play a key role facilitating profitable growth and ensuring that risk is managed effectively in terms of policy, pricing and returns.</p>
          <p>Expense management has also been a high priority for us this year. We've planned aggressive reductions in our cost base and have outperformed against these targets. We're improving productivity by implementing best practices, consolidating functions internationally or regionally, standardizing our operating platforms, systems and processes across the division. Our year-to-date productivity ratio is 55.4%, 90 basis points less than last year and 400 basis points better than 2006.</p>
          <p>A critical part of our future success depends on continually developing our leadership. This quarter, we're pleased to welcome two members to International's senior management team, Wendy Hannam and Dieter Jentsch, who will be outstanding additions to the team. Anatol von Hahn, who many of you know, has been a tremendous contributor and he will be missed. And I know that Chris will enjoy his participation in that division.</p>
          <p>In summary, we had solid results in challenging times and we continue to build for the future. I'll now pass it over to Mike.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Rob.</p>
          <p>This was an exceptional quarter for Scotia Capital with record net income of $470 million. This strong performance was driven by record revenues of 1.1 billion and record levels earned in both global capital markets and global corporate and investment banking. In GCM, we benefited from our well diversified revenue stream with all businesses performing very well. We were able to take advantage of favorable market conditions with strong capital market results driven by higher levels of client activity.</p>
          <p>While we did report record revenues in our derivative business this quarter, the strength of our diversified revenue stream is best underlined by the fact that all of our GCM businesses have reported record or near-record revenues during the first three quarters of the year.</p>
          <p>Our fixed income business has reported three consecutive quarters of very strong revenues. Our lending business continued to benefit from higher spreads and fees, reflecting much better pricing on transactions. This has enabled these businesses to earn through the higher level of provisions for credit losses this year and through the recent reduction in asset levels.</p>
          <p>So far, about 40% of our facilities have repriced. We expect to see some further improvement in our margin, although the pace of repricing will likely not be as pronounced going forward.</p>
          <p>The recent 9 billion decline in average lending assets was not unexpected. You may recall that we told you that the increase in assets earlier this year was temporary, in part from investment grade bridge-to-bond loans. The bulk of these have now been repaid.</p>
          <p>The relative lack of M&amp;A activity has curtailed some growth and clients are less inclined to borrow in the current environment. Also, the stronger Canadian dollar has continued to lower asset levels.</p>
          <p>In both GCM and GCIB, we see signs that volatility and spread increases are lessening, as markets stabilize and the level of M&amp;A activity remains modest. All of this tempers our views for the fourth quarter and suggests it is unlikely that this quarter's level of revenue is sustainable.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest in the fundamental parts of our business and focus on attracting and developing our top talent. One such example was the equity business enhancement initiative we undertook late last year. It continues to pay off in higher revenues.</p>
          <p>We also continue to invest in our other businesses such as infrastructure finance and commodity trading, businesses which will provide revenue growth later in 2009, into 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>We continue to prudently manage credit market and operational risks. In our lending business, we have focused resources on managing our existing portfolios and accounts of concern.</p>
          <p>While we have experienced some downward credit migration and higher provisions for credit losses, primarily in the United States, we believe this is to a much lesser extent than many global institutions and cost cycles. Our provisions are well within our expectations and risk appetite and we expect them to be relatively stable going forward. Our decision three years ago to effectively exit leveraged lending in the United States and in Europe has contributed to our strength during this significant downturn.</p>
          <p>In capital markets, we have reduced the size of some of our derivative books. Our limited exposure to U.S. mortgage-backed securities and CDOs/CLOs has also helped us avoid significant losses. Furthermore, we believe that our U.S. commercial real estate exposure is the lowest of our peer group.</p>
          <p>We also welcome this quarter the addition of Anne Marie O'Donovan to our team. Anne Marie brings significant strengths to our organization and will help us to continue to grow our wholesale business in the future. In summary, our focus for 2009 continues to be growing our core fundamental businesses in a prudent manner while carefully managing risks and expenses.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand it back to Luc for the Q&amp;A session.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Chris, I was wondering if you could just maybe talk a little bit about business opportunities you see in front of you now in the domestic wealth markets. I think going into the year that was an area that you felt there was some real opportunity, and has there been any change in your thinking in that regard, acquisition versus organic growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brad, we've been very clear in the past that one of our key priorities is to build our wealth business. I think we've made some good progress in that regard. As I mentioned in some of my comments, Scotia iTRADE is going to be a very important platform for us and in the course of 2010, we'll be integrating all of the direct investing businesses, and that has really increased our position in the Canadian market. So we see more opportunities on the direct investing space.</p>
          <p>We also are looking at opportunities with both DundeeWealth and CI. I mentioned with DundeeWealth, we have the Dundee Bank and the deposits that have grown through that area. We are looking at a similar program with CI. There continue to be opportunities in the marketplace and we have seen some competitors act on some of those. But we are more than comfortable with the organic plans that we have in place at this point and the current investments that we have got.</p>
          <p>And we think those investments will leverage our wealth management earnings over the course of the next few years. And in fact, in our results this quarter, one of the reasons we were up from 410, I think, a quarter ago is good improvement in the wealth space, and we will continue to see more of that going forward.</p>

          <p>Thank you. If we could go to slide 16, and it is probably for Luc. Thanks a lot for that slide, first of all. But secondly, looking at the minus 151 related to funding net interest income and the comments that there might be a benefit from higher short-term rates. So let's say short-term rates do increase, is it fair to say that the improvement we would see here would be offset by a decline, an equivalent decline in the divisions or that is not a fair comment?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I think for the bank overall, as we are positioned, a rise in short-term rates would be beneficial, and there would be some shift between other and the business lines as a result.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the other point that I would make, Andre, you are correct on that &#x2013; is that you have to remember that we already have a liquidity charge that we pass on to the divisions as well. That started at the beginning of this year. We passed on a charge of approximately $200 million in the current quarter. Slightly in excess of 100 million of that went to Canadian Banking, and the other two divisions are approximately equal and have around 45 to 50.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. You talked about the deferral of variable comp, and I am wondering if that deferral means that it was lower than normal in the current quarter in relation to related revenue, but that it will eventually increase over time relative to revenue. Would that be the correct interpretation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that, to a very large extent, Michael, the increase in performance-based compensation is directionally the same as the increase in revenues and pre-tax, pre-bonus income.</p>
          <p>What we have had here is a change to the Scotia Capital compensation plan, and the deferred component is now aligned with the bank's plan. It vests over a three-year period. From an accounting perspective, that results in the expense being taken over a three-year period, not in the current year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Thanks very much. A question on International PCL trends for Brian I think. Brian, I think you touched on this, but could you discuss the trends by geography a little bit more? And I guess at the end of the day, I'd like to know &#x2013; what we'd like to know is what is the likelihood of a meaningful spike in credit loss rates in International from here? How far along in the process would you say we are in terms of seasoning? And I'm not sure if this is doable, but is there any way you can put current loss rates maybe in terms of stress test loss rates you might use on the portfolio to help us going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I think that in the last quarter call we talked about International commercial and we said that the portfolio has lagged economically what we have seen in North America. And that we had two hotel projects or developments that we may have to classify in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>We did one of those this quarter, but if you look around, and I will start with the retail portfolio &#x2013; if you look at the retail portfolio, it was $22 billion. Half that is in the Caribbean where we've been for decades, and we're not seeing any trends or spikes in terms of delinquencies or losses. So the portfolio is performing again within our expectations and historical comparisons if you go back to post-9/11 or the recession of the early '90s. So we don't see any big issues there.</p>
          <p>In terms of Peru and Chile, again, these portfolios are concentrated on the mortgage side. Two-thirds of our total International retail exposure is mortgages. Our loan-to-values are very conservative. So again, the portfolios are performing within expectations. We would expect the trend of PCLs in these businesses to be somewhat consistent with what we've seen in the last quarter. So it's going to be a couple of quarters, as I said, or some quarters until we're through this.</p>
          <p>On the International commercial side, you saw that we had an increase in gross impaired loans this quarter. My opening comment related to one of those. But we don't see anything that we haven't identified in previous quarters that we would classify is really my major point here. So we've stressed the portfolios in terms of different unemployment rates and different economic scenarios, spikes in oil prices, et cetera. So again, the portfolios are performing within our expectations across the board, and we don't see any trend in terms of industry or geography that disturbs us.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just like to add to Brian's &#x2013; this is Rick Waugh, and don't forget again over the last year, in fact, over the last two years, we have with our add-on acquisitions been somewhat acquisition-orientated, and these have been in retail credit portfolios: Peru, Chile, to some extent Central America.</p>
          <p>So some of that &#x2013; it's definitely the lag effect of the economy, but there is a reasonable contribution, the fact that these portfolios now just through acquisition have become higher and so by definition, the absolute level of provisions increase. And then secondly, as Rob mentioned, we are integrating &#x2013; these are relatively small, but they are relatively complex operations and obviously when the economy is not good, that slows down some of the benefits and increases some of the costs involved in that, including I think some provisioning.</p>

          <p>Luc, the slide that you presented, slide nine on the assets and risk-weighted changes &#x2013; first of all, thank you very much' that's very helpful. You did mention that one of the things that was happening was a lot of the resis, because you were securitizing but not selling, the actual total asset number is down and I wasn't clear how that impacts risk-weighted. Does it have any impact on risk-weighted at all, just securitizing but not selling?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because I am still grappling with the RWA shrinkage greater than the asset shrinkage because it doesn't look as if there is a lot of &#x2013; when I think of the asset movements, there doesn't seem to be a lot of movements in mix of assets outside of that shift from mortgages to securities. So I don't know if Jeff can maybe give a little bit of a sense of &#x2013; from here, do risk-weighted continue to come down as you learn the Basel II methodology better or it is it that what has been done has been done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things, Ian, that you have to remember here is what we are looking at is on-balance sheet assets in one case and in another case when you get to the risk-weighted assets, you have got to take the off-balance sheet into account so they have an impact as well. I am not sure whether you have taken that into account.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>Sorry, it's the total risk-weighted, yes. But that's everything else &#x2013; that's all risk-weighted related to both on and off-balance sheet?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so I am just suggesting that there is a difference in the off-balance sheet quarter-over-quarter that maybe you need to take into account. Jeff, do you want to make a comment on...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because it doesn't look as if market risk or operational risk has changed much quarter-to-quarter. So you are talking about the undrawn portion of the balances?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Right. So looking forward, Jeff, what do you think from here? The credit migration we all talk about doesn't seem to occur at all.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I am not sure I am the best person to answer that question, but just to go back to an earlier point, the conversion or pooling of mortgages into mortgage-backed securities had no impact on RWA. So I think the points that were made on that slide about ForEx and drop in paydown of corporate loans are probably the key drivers, as Luc had mentioned. Luc, I don't know whether you want to comment further?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there is a couple of things. One, there has been the runoff of some higher risk-weighted assets, as well on a quarter-over-quarter and the risk migration has gone down and so you will see that impact on the right-hand side.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Brian, you've made several references in your opening comments and answer to questions about PCLs sort of being in line with expectations. And you have also made the point that delinquencies are moderating in retail and all of that in the context of things possibly being a little bit rougher in International. What I am getting at is, without really knowing what your expectations are, it is hard to interpret comments like things are sort of progressing in line with our expectations. Can you put any color around the notion that PCLs, on a global basis, are trending in line with your expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will answer it this way, Mario. As I said, the Canadian retail book, the domestic commercial book and the Scotia Capital book, both in Canada and the U.S., are stabilizing in terms of credit migration. And that we don't see &#x2013; we don't see any large gross impaired loans. We haven't classified any large gross impaired loans that we haven't seen for a number of quarters beforehand. So that the loans that we classified this quarter we identified four quarters ago were going to be an issue for us. So definitely trends are stabilizing in those books.</p>
          <p>The domestic retail book, the same thing. Delinquencies have stabilized or come down in all our core products with the exception of Visa and unsecured lines of credit. And that is a function of pressure on some consumers and some geographic areas in the country. And as I said, the International retail book, it lagged going into this. It differs by region, but it is going to be some quarters before we see some <mark type="inaudible" />. For instance, delinquency was stable or up in basically all products across all geographies, whether it was the Caribbean, Peru, Chile, Mexico. But again it is within the credit risk parameters we set out in our strategy and we give to the Board, and it is within our plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it is Rick Waugh again to give a little color to it on the international side. And we are so diversified in the countries we are, so it is hard to give you one sweeping statement like you may be able to do when you are just talking about the U.S. or Europe. For example as a ratio Peru did jump, and largely because of some acquisitions. But at the end of the day while the percentage may look a little higher, it was only 10 only &#x2013; only! We don't like $10 million increases, but it was just $10 million. And so &#x2013; with the number of the countries we are in &#x2013; now the advantage of that, of course, is the diversification, but &#x2013; and that is also why we are not going to be too granular on it and we don't give you quarter-by-quarter estimates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe just one final thing. There was a bit of a step function on PCLs and they tend to move this way, as we all know in Q2 '09, almost doubling from Q1 '09. Brian, can I interpret your comments to mean you have no reason to believe we will see another kind of step function move in 2010 relative to where we are now?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. For Luc Vanneste or Jeff Heath, just looking at the securities gains line, both unrealized and realized, roughly 1 billion in realized securities losses over the last year. Luc, you had a comment, quite direct comment that we should see this number decline. You said that in so far as the other segment is concerned for Q4. Just wanted to touch on your confidence in that statement. Certainly we saw the other fixed income category on the unrealized side, the losses declined significantly. Isn't this very much a reflection of spreads for the unrealized side, but on the realized side, I guess it is a comment on how you are feeling about what is left in that portfolio in terms of quality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It certainly is, and I'm going to pass it over to Jeff who manages that book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if we talk first about the debt portfolio &#x2013; so our view has been and continues to be that we don't think there will be any material impairment charges on the debt portfolios. So what has happened this year is obviously spreads went to extremely wide levels and they have come back materially. We don't think we are going to revisit those wider spreads, but clearly there will be some volatility going forward.</p>
          <p>On the equity side, which is where we have taken most of the impairment charges to date or equity or equity like instruments, as Luc said, we think that will moderate. And from an unrealized point of view, again, we don't think we are revisiting the lows in the equity markets of the last year, but there will be continued volatility in that unrealized gain and loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I am probably looking at this too simplistically. If we have had a very nice period for global equity markets in let's say the last six months or so and the bulk of the &#x2013; what we see on the investment gain line or loss in this case has been equity-related, what am I missing here in those two dichotomies? Or in that dichotomy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess a rising tide doesn't lift all boats would be my general comment. So there have been certain equity positions where, with the passage of time, they have not risen back to cost and the accounting rules basically require you to take an impairment charge when that impairment is other than temporary. So it is not about whether they are good investments. I mean there is a passage of time issue here that drives the impairment issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, if I could just add a little bit of color to the equity side of the portfolio, we don't really trade equities. We invest in them, and we have done this for decades, and we take long-term, usually high dividend yielding equities. The accounting though, of course, has become more rigorous, and you have the 12-month impairment test so that with the accounting changes and all that. Luc, you can go forward on that if you want, but essentially you take impairment charges based on mark-to-market. And you go down to that mark, and we have taken a conservative view, and so you have that issue. So it is based on what has obviously happened in the markets. But we are not trading, we are taking long-term investments, but we have, because of the markets, taken the necessary impairment charges. And as you can see, on the unrealized position that we now have, we are in a very comfortable position there.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. I am looking at the presentation on slide 14. And I was wondering if &#x2013; maybe this is a question for Rob or Luc, I am not sure &#x2013; but I am wondering if we could talk about revenue growth and maybe some other underlying trends exclusive of acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our revenue growth in International has slowed because of the asset growth which underlies that, and asset growth this year, because of the economies, because of certain of the countries, the slowing that has occurred in them, and so we are experiencing that. We have offset that by looking at our fees. We have looked at our pricing. We have looked at our risk-based pricing. We have looked at ancillary revenues through insurance. We have looked at it through wealth management. We are working on Scotia Capital's global transaction banking.</p>
          <p>So the slowdown we see is very natural. There is a lag effect, which will occur through the rest of 2009 and into 2010. We have offset that by taking a number of actions that have helped very much this year and will help next year, and we see ultimately these economies rebounding.</p>
          <p>So it's something that we expected, we planned for it. We took action on the revenue side, we have taken action with respect to aggressive expense reduction, which you can see, and we see all of these returning to normal within a reasonable period of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you free to talk about a number? I mean what would the revenue have been ex the acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ex the acquisitions, they would have been, on a localized basis, they would have been 5, 6%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Down you mean, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, they would have been 5, 6% and ForEx adjusted, that brings them down to flat, negative growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So when we look at the supplemental, your page five when we look at International banking, and we see the decline in other income. So what you are referring to is fees and pricing in a lag effect. Can you help me out? What kind of &#x2013; effectively, maybe just to be blunt, when we think of International and some of the slowdowns that have happened in some of your countries, I think the natural reaction is to sort of clamp down, tighten up on credit and really slow down the asset growth. At some point, my suspicion would be that you would open up the taps.</p>
          <p>So when you talk about a lag effect, what are we thinking about? Are we thinking about say two, three quarters from now, or are we really thinking about you opening up the taps in terms of growth and fee increases in the revenue line? Are we thinking about really 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of other income, we had a drop in our First Bank, which impacted that. We have also had an impact on fee growth relative to the retail side doing fewer deals and the related fees which go with those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Darko, In terms of the write-down on First Bank, that is the equity investment and that was $79 million pre-tax in the quarter, so that is the largest single component that drives the decrease quarter-over-quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So when you look at that and you look at the regular slowdown and you look at our volumes, the loan volumes, which have slowed considerably this year, that explains other income slowing down.</p>
          <p>All of those will come back when these economies rebound, which we think that they will do some time over the course of 2010. And we think that we're well positioned to take advantage of that. We think the franchises are performing very well right now. They are performing very well against their competition, and so we see a return to normal growth.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>Hi, good morning. Just wanted to circle back with Brian on credit. Brian, I know you've done &#x2013; the team has done a lot of work with respect to high-grading the corporate loan portfolio over the past few years and getting rid of the non-core relationships. But it's kind of surprising to hear that it seems that you are saying that the worst is over on the corporate loan book and that losses will moderate because typically we tend to think of the corporate loan book as being late cycle and lumpy in terms of losses. So when I look at your exposures, whether it is auto, hotels, real estate, I guess just circling back to your earlier comments that it seems like the worst is over in that regard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I'd make a couple of comments. With the exception of auto, some portions of media and real estate, corporate balance sheets in the U.S. and Canada were in very good shape going into the downturn. That is point one. Point two is corporations have been extremely aggressive on cost cutting. The third point would be that all these companies have had access to the capital markets for the better part of six months, whether it is high-yield, investment grade debt or equity, which has helped our lenders either indirectly or directly, but that's had a significant impact . But if you look at the auto sector, we had a plan here. We were concerned about four years ago our concentrations in this sector. We exited some, we high-graded others, we migrated capital to other places. That's worked out actually quite well for us.</p>
          <p>We've reduced our exposures. Our losses are within line with &#x2013; Mario's favorite word &#x2013; our expectations, and we only used 12 million of our sectoral this quarter and we don't see any spikes in that sector.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned last quarter, media could be an issue, but again, our exposures are well-contained and we think we can manage them. Our real estate exposure, for all intents and purposes, in the U.S. is predominantly REITs, which have had huge access to the equity markets and raised a lot of capital here.</p>
          <p>Anything else in Canada, our real estate exposures are coming down, amortizing nicely and performing very well. And we haven't been aggressive into putting assets on the books over the course of the last two years. So where we sit today, touch wood, Jim, I can't see anything, my colleagues and I out there in our portfolios, that can come up to bite us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, I appreciate the color with respect to those comments. And so when I reconcile this with the 100 million increase in general provisions and the stability in the domestic franchise, I guess by and large, this general provision is being applied to the international portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes and no. Our general &#x2013; just for &#x2013; lags a quarter, so we are catching up with the migration that we have seen in previous quarters. And as I said, our migration is starting to stabilize. But we have targets internally in terms of coverage ratios, be they on the specific level or the total level, and we felt it was prudent to add to the general this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay, thank you. And I know the call is about to end, so I was just going to ask Chris a very quick question.</p>
          <p>[Laughter].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of the 8% year-over-year strong growth in Canadian Banking, what would the organic growth rate be, because I know you've had the benefit of acquisitions from CI and iTRADE?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of that is from organic growth because actually most of these acquisitions are recent. So to give you some specifics, Roynat Lease actually, we've had very little in terms of bottom line impact, but we have revenue gain there, Jim, of 7 million. iTRADE is 1.8 million. CI is 25 million. DundeeWealth is &#x2013; we picked up 20 million quarter-over-quarter because their last quarter, there was an ABCP write-off. So what I'm really getting at is that most of this is organic and we're starting to see the benefit of these acquisitions and we'll see more of that going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks for the clarification.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>And it comes from Robert Sedran of National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, good morning. Just a quick one or maybe not a quick one, but one for Rick. Rick, the bank was quite aggressive early in the downturn on the acquisition front, I guess following up on Jim's question, much of it here in Canada. Not to suggest that Scotiabank takes pleasure in other people's pain, but suffice it to say, you're generally happy to help.</p>
          <p>[Laughter].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it a lack of opportunity or a lack of visibility that is stopping you from being a little more aggressive at this point in the cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; I call it discipline. We want to be opportunistic and I think the acquisitions we did make primarily in the wealth management. But there was not just wealth management, There was obviously iTRADE, which was opportunistic and Dundee, which unfortunately had some issues in their bank and that was opportunistic and then Sun's decision post-Lehman for whatever reason, it was opportunistic.</p>
          <p>And we moved because it was on strategy and what have you. We did buy some asset portfolios both here in Canada and International, which were portfolio acquisitions although there was a few corporates. So, and was well in strategy, was well in terms of our affordability. Although we were very reluctant to issue stock at what were, in my opinion, very low value, as a CEO, you never want to issue stock, which you don't believe, but we did do a little prudence with the CI.</p>
          <p>And so now, of course, the world is into a new norm. Repricing has taken place, so sellers' expectations and buyers' expectations may be starting to narrow in and that may create some opportunities. But I quite feel that we will try to be as disciplined as we were &#x2013; for market pricing as we are on the higher and we have generally stayed away from anything transformational. And so these are add-ons to the strategies and what have you step by step. It doesn't quite make the headlines or a year-over-year impact, but the acquisitions are like a treadmill and you have got to keep going. And I would rather take it a little slower on the treadmill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the transformational deals are probably not something you are considering right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As is the common word now seems to be saying never say never and we will never say never, because we did look at some which would have been quite significant and we did look at them and we will look at those things in the future. And if its on strategy and we figure it will work, but I would put it at a low probability.</p>
