        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to today's presentation of BHP Billiton's Preliminary Results for the Financial Year Ended in June 2010. I am speaking to you today from London and Alex Vanselow, our CFO is in Sydney and he will present from there.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I would like to point you to the disclaimer and remind you of its importance in relation to today's presentation. I will start by giving you a brief overview of results, I'll then hand over to Alex to take you through the details of our financial performance, after which I will talk to you about our view of the macroeconomic environment, and then before concluding I will talk about our proposed offer to acquire PotashCorp.</p>
          <p>During the 2010 financial year, we observed yet more volatility in the external trading environment. Economic recovery continued for the first half of our financial year, as markets became more comfortable with the idea of a broad-based economic recovery following the financial crisis.</p>
          <p>However, after a period of improving sentiment, sovereign debt concerns reemerged in April of this. And although conditions have stabilized in the meantime, there are some lingering concerns over the health of the global economic system.</p>
          <p>I will talk to you more about our view of this economic environment later, but let me talk about an overview of our financial results first. Our underlying EBITDA for the year was up 10% to US$24.5 billion and underlying EBIT was up 8% to US$19.7 billion. Attributable profit for the year was US$12.5 billion before exceptional items and that is up 16%. Our balance sheet remains strong with a net gearing level of 6%.</p>
          <p>And today we announced the final dividend of US$0.45 per share, which brings our dividend for the full year to US$0.87 per share, an increase over the last period of 6%, thus continuing our progressive dividend policy. Given the volatile trading environment that I have just experienced, we are very pleased with these results.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to our operating performance. In addressing our operating performance, I would like to start with safety. Health and safety performance is critical to the wellbeing of our people and to the success of our business. We will only be successful when every employee and every contractor goes home safely at the end of each day.</p>
          <p>We recognize the potentially hazardous nature of our industry, but it is our view that these hazards only result in injuries when the risks are not properly identified and managed. And against a backdrop of continued improvement in a number of our key safety indicators, the loss of five of our colleagues during the year sadly reminds us that the leadership task is not complete and of the immense challenge that we've got to continue to improve the management of our risks. We extend our sympathy to families, friends and colleagues.</p>
          <p>Turning to our operational performance, BHP Billiton produced another very strong set of results, including a 10th annual consecutive production record in iron ore, and a third consecutive production record for petroleum.</p>
          <p>These achievements and the other production records that we produced across the range of our businesses and assets is the result of a focus on operating our assets to the maximum of their potential, and our continued and significant investment in organic growth throughout the cycle. This organic growth resulted in first production from five projects in iron ore, alumina and energy coal.</p>
          <p>And we also approved a further US$2.9 billion in new projects and pre-commitments during the period. And whilst we've not yet had an outcome on our production joint venture in iron ore with Rio Tinto, we continue to work through the relevant regulatory processes.</p>
          <p>Now, let me hand over to Alex, who will give you more detail on our financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marius.</p>
          <p>It is great to be presenting another strong and clean set of financial results, built on what's a very stable foundation.</p>
          <p>As Marius said earlier, we continue to operate in a very volatile environment, which makes diversity of products, customer and geography combined with asset quality critically important. In that context, our uniquely diversified business ensured we were well-positioned to benefit from a general recovery in markets and more than offset the pressures presented by a weaker U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>Now let's review the major drivers of our strong full year results. As you can see, our solid earnings growth was delivered despite external pressures placed on our business. The net impact of higher prices and a weaker U.S. dollar reduced underlying EBIT by US$1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>In contrast, those factors within our control contributed strongly to underlying performance. To that end, our strategy to maximize production from our low cost assets at all points in the cycle ensured the business was well-positioned to respond to a robust recovery and demand. So, volumes added US$1.9 billion to underlying EBIT.</p>
          <p>Similarly, successful commissioning of petroleum projects such as Pyrenees and Shenzi contributed an additional US$1 billion to underlying EBIT, and also emphasize our commitment to value-adding growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>When we asses our operating performance, and by excluding those factors beyond our control, we see the strong volume growth and our targeted portfolio management, and this has delivered an 18% increase in underling performance.</p>
          <p>And with that in mind, I'd like to address the costs in more detail. So, on this slide if you look on the left-hand side, you'll notice a significant reduction in raw materials and logistic costs. And we've previously mentioned that input costs tend to lag product prices. And as an example, the reduction in energy prices was clearly non-structure in nature.</p>
          <p>However, what should also be apparent is the almost equal yet opposing effect of the one-off costs we had in the period, and I'll highlight some specific points to you. One is the impact associated with the Clark Shaft and planned outage at Olympic Dam. Also the provision we have taken in Iron Ore, relating to the proposed amendments to the Western Australia State agreement, and a provision we've taken in petroleum relating to the current drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>If you take away those non-structural, non-recurring items, I am proud to highlight the US$282 million improvement in controllable cash costs that we delivered in the period. As always, we can do more, and our relentless focus on the cost base will continue to be a high priority for the team.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the performance of the global portfolio in more detail. One of the most obvious highlights of this slide is the balance of our diversified portfolio across the three main business groups. More importantly is the underlying quality of our business is clearly highlighted by the superior margins that we continue to deliver. Furthermore, our commitment to stay low cost and diversified by commodity, geography and customer will be further enhanced by the acquisition of PotashCorp.</p>
          <p>We'll start with Energy. And in Energy, our record production of 159 million barrels of oil equivalent followed the successful commission of BHP Billiton operated facilities in Shenzi and Pyrenees. The increase in high margin crude volumes was the single largest contributor to the US$488 million increase in petroleum underlying EBIT. Low average realized prices for energy coal were a major offset, despite a significant improvement in profitability in the second half of the year on the back of firming Chinese and India demand.</p>
          <p>We remain deeply committed to growing our Energy business, and it remains an area of intense activity in the Group. During the year, we completed three projects across petroleum and energy coal, while seven projects remain in development.</p>
          <p>With the Non Ferrous group, rebounding prices increased underlying EBIT by over $5.5 billion and we simplified our nickel and aluminum portfolios and this led to a US$526 million favorable variance in underlying EBIT. The sale of Ravensthorpe contributed US$457 million to exceptional profit after tax and this was offset by exceptional items specific to the aluminum business totaling US$465 million after tax.</p>
          <p>For Ferrous, the lower metallurgical coal and manganese price reduced underlying EBIT for that group by US$4.5 billion. The significant reduction in the Group's overall contribution actually masked what was a very strong operating performance. Western Australian iron ore delivered, as Marius said, its 10th consecutive annual production record, while metallurgical coal and manganese both witnessed a very strong recovery in production and demand.</p>
          <p>In total, higher Ferrous volumes increased underlying EBIT by over US$1.8 billion. In that context efficiency and productivity across iron ore supply chain remains a key priority for us, and we're particularly pleased to have put the rail access case behind us.</p>
          <p>Similarly, many of you will no doubt be aware that we have tirelessly pursued market clearing prices and for all our book commodity products, not just iron ore, and I am pleased to say that this initial transition is now complete. Marius will talk to this important achievement in more detail shortly.</p>
          <p>Now from a broader perspective, another set of strong operating results speaks volumes for our well-defined yet simple strategy revolving around our commitment to maximize volume from our low cost diversified portfolio through all points in the cycle, and our intention to take this market clearing prices.</p>
          <p>While some of our peers were forced to or chose to reduce production during the recent downturn in demand, we stuck to our strategy. Where possible, we rebuilt inventories across the supply chain, and continue to invest in the future. This ensured less volatility, and a more rapid recovery in our volumes.</p>
          <p>To illustrate this point, in this slide we have compared our performance in copper equivalent units to that of our peer group as shaded grey. And as shown, we are now producing at a rate exceeding the peak levels achieved prior to the onset of the global financial crisis. And furthermore, I'm pleased to say that we are now selling well in excess of 90% of the group production, and this is across all commodities, on shorter term market based prices.</p>
          <p>While volume is one measure, returns and profitability are the ultimate benchmarks. And our consistent and unchanged strategy will continue to deliver superior returns for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>For the sixth consecutive financial year, BHP Billiton recorded an underlying EBIT margin of 40% or more. And an underlying return on capital of 25% or more. This is an outstanding achievement considering we continue to invest heavily in our future. Excluding capital investment not yet productive, our return on capital employed for financial year 2010 would have been &#x2013; would have exceeded 30%.</p>
          <p>And as you can also see, we once again managed to convert those very healthy margins into strong cash flows. Second half operating cash flow rose by over 100% when compared with the first half. What shouldn't be lost on investors is the link between strong margins, superior returns and the ability to regenerate and grow one's business.</p>
          <p>With our very healthy balance sheet we have been able to invest heavily in our business with a capital and exploration expenditure of US$10.7 billion for the period.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, our strong cash flow and balance sheet has facilitated our all-cash offer for Potash Corporation, which, with its Tier 1 assets, will further enhance our unique business model. While Marius will discuss the natural fit of PotashCorp, shortly. I'd like to take the opportunity to discuss some of the financial aspects of the all-cash offer.</p>
          <p>It is a fully funded underwritten credit facility totaling US$45 billion which combined with our strong financial position will preserve the financial flexibility of the group. And with regard to the financing package, we have structured a facility in three tranches, with terms of one year, with an extension option of another year, three and four years. Our commitment to maintain our solid A credit rating; equally ensures our cost of funding remains particularly competitive.</p>
          <p>Importantly, we remain committed to our progressive dividend policy.</p>
          <p>Finally, and I have to cover this, I'd like to make a comment on taxation. Despite the sometimes conflicting messages throughout the recent taxation debate in Australia, when it comes to the numbers themselves and you can see that on the slide, nothing is clearer than that.</p>
          <p>BHP Billiton, Australia's largest single corporate tax payer, continued to pay its way in the last financial year. Company tax, state royalties and petroleum production payments totaled A$5.5 billion. These payments represented 46% of operating profits from our Australian assets in the 2010 financial year. For the seven years, from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2010 average total tax royalty and production payments in relation to Australian profits was 42%. So the key point, I wish to make here is that BHP Billiton pays a lot of tax in Australia at both federal and state levels and has done so consistently over a long period of time.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll now hand you over back to Marius, who will walk you through macroeconomics views. Over to you Marius.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alex.</p>
          <p>Let me take you through our views on the external environment. As I mentioned earlier, during the first three quarters of our financial year, we experienced steadily improving financial conditions, which flowed through into much stronger prices for our commodities.</p>
          <p>However, in late April, the rating agencies downgraded credit ratings for several European countries. And the left hand chart on the screen shows how volatility fell post the financial crisis and then how it sparked again on the back of sovereign debt concerns.</p>
          <p>The European sovereign debt &#x2013; sovereign risk concerns returned around the same time as China was taking measures to cool the property markets in its major cities. And these events provided a trigger for return in sentiment and the right hand chart shows how sentiment has fallen as volatility increased. Due to the factors I have mentioned, our view is that the volatility we have experienced will continue in the near-term.</p>
          <p>Now you would have seen this chart before in our interim results in February. It shows the U.S. net borrowing flows by sector and the orange bars on the right show how dramatically the U.S. government has stepped in to support its economy.</p>
          <p>I have used it again here, because in our view the level of sovereign debt in the OECD remains a fundamental issue for global economic growth. The big question is whether governments can continue to support their economies and not just the absolute level of debt that is a concern, but we are also concerned about the impact on growth of governments withdrawing the unsustainable stimulus packages they were forced to introduce.</p>
          <p>And the chart that we've got on the screen shows how dramatically government spending is outpacing revenues in the euro zone. This is leading to a series of austerity measures being introduced in countries such as the U.K. and Spain. Therefore, the likely impact of fiscal austerity on economic output is yet to be seen.</p>
          <p>And while I have talked about the developed world, in our business, obviously, what happens in China is very important. China's GDP grew strongly in the first quarter of 2010, but has since slowed meaningfully on the back of government tightening policies, in particular, as I said before these tightening policies were introduced to deal with the rapid escalation of property prices in the major cities.</p>
          <p>Our view is that for the remainder of the year, we will &#x2013; calendar year that is, that we will likely see slowing growth on the back of removal of stimulus and tighter monetary policy. However, our anticipation is for a soft as opposed to hard landing and second half GDP growth this calendar year could be closer to 8%. We do want to note that China can and will be more flexible on its domestic policy, if developed market economies deteriorate more markedly than anticipated.</p>
          <p>Despite slowing near-term investment growth in China, we expect to continue focus on the broad range of infrastructure projects to promote interconnection across the country. China is also restructuring its economy away from a dependence on investment towards a more balanced consumption led economy.</p>
          <p>While, I presented a reasonably sanguine picture for the near-term economic outlook, I do want to highlight that the reduction in capital expenditure by others in our industry during the financial crisis is impacting the supply side for commodities. As such, we feel comfortable that our margins will remain healthy, despite volatile economic conditions.</p>
          <p>Over the past five years, we've &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; that should be the past 10 years, if we take energy coal into account, we have methodically sought to achieve floating and transparent market pricing for all of our products. We would like the market price of the day, every day, for all of our commodities, as we believe that transparent prices are good for consumers and good for producers. We are therefore very pleased that during the course of this year, we made very significant process &#x2013; progress in achieving this overall objective, as Alex noted before in this instance for our major ferrous products.</p>
          <p>The chart on the left-hand side of the screen shows the recent emergence of a liquid, traded market in iron ore and importantly, it also shows that we have a now traded forward curve that aids in forward price discovery.</p>
          <p>Also, as you can see from the right-hand chart on the screen, all of our iron ore sales are now priced on a shorter term basis. As mention by Alex, but I do want to emphasize, we now receive shorter term market based prices for over 90% of all of our production across all of our products.</p>
          <p>And while market based clearing prices may be individually more volatile than annual pricing, the volatility of individual commodities is not a concern for us as a result of our diversification.</p>
          <p>And to that exact point, the chart on the screen is the one that we have used many times before. I do need to note that it's Alex's favorite, even though I'll present it today. It's very important because it goes to the heart of our strategy. A diversified portfolio of Tier 1 assets reduces the volatility of our cash flows and gives us greater ability to forecast our cash flows throughout the commodity and economic cycle.</p>
          <p>In turn, having more predictable cash flows helps us better plan capital spending and importantly, invest more consistently throughout the cycle and deliver a progressive dividend.</p>
          <p>Alex mentioned earlier that for the sixth consecutive year, we've had 40%-plus EBIT margin and this clearly illustrates the strength of our business model throughout the cycles.</p>
          <p>And that brings me to the recent announcement to acquire PotashCorp, which is completely consistent with our diversified upstream strategy. We've been studying an entry into potash since 2003, as we believe potash has strong long-term industry financials and significant growth potential underpinned by the following key drivers.</p>
          <p>Firstly, population growth and increasing wealth levels in the developing world are increasing demand for protein and other high quality more nutritious foods. Secondly, increased urbanization and the need for sustainable agriculture puts increasing strains on available arable land, thus requiring greater yields per acre.</p>
          <p>The potash nutrient is an irreplaceable element in enabling increased global agricultural production. PotashCorp is the world's leading integrated fertilizer company and the proposed acquisition of PotashCorp will provide us with an immediate and strong leadership platform in this global fertilizer industry.</p>
          <p>PotashCorp operations are at or close to the bottom of the cost curve and the proposed acquisition will add further diversification by commodity, by operating geography and by customer.</p>
          <p>And as you can see this transaction is wholly consistent with our strategy of developing, owning, operating a diversified portfolio of large, long-life, low-cost, expandable, export oriented, Tier I assets.</p>
          <p>As Alex has mentioned our proposed offer is fully underwritten by &#x2013; is fully funded by underwritten credit facilities that preserve our operational and financial and strategic flexibility. And I need to stress that we are committed to maintaining a strong A credit rating, as well as to our progressive dividend policy.</p>
          <p>Now this brings me to the end of our presentation, so let me conclude. Alex and I have today set out to demonstrate that our strategy of being an upstream resources company, operating large, low-cost and broadly diversified assets remains the correct one. The results we presented today show that the strategy works for us and our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, our disciplined approach and simple portfolio of large, hub-based Tier I assets will allow us to continue to deliver superior returns and margins into the future. Our recent offer to acquire PotashCorp is consistent with our strategy and will add an attractive new commodity to an already well diversified portfolio. But we will remain, as ever, disciplined.</p>
          <p>On that note, I'd like to thank you ladies and gentlemen. I would now be pleased to take your questions. If you could direct them to me in the first instance and I will pass them to Alex in Sydney, but also to Mike Yeager that is on the line.</p>
          <p>We will start here in London and then move on to Sydney, before taking questions from the phone.</p>
          <p>May I have the first question please?</p>

          <p>Good morning, Marius. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Jason Fairclough. There are some commentators that are suggesting that China's metal intensity per unit of GDP has peaked. I'm just wondering if that's a view that you have and if going forward we should expect more capital allocation to non-metals resource businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, our updates that we provided in October of last year at our marketing presentation, probably unchanged. And you will recall that, that basically states our growth aspirations, particularly in two of our key products. In the steel making raw materials, steel and copper, and we have no reason to update that at this point in time.</p>
          <p>As to the second part of your question, we want to allocate capital to a diversified portfolio of resources and I'm always keen to and I will use this opportunity to stress that the market should not see us as a coking coal company stapled to a copper company, stapled to a petroleum company and so on.</p>
          <p>The way Alex and myself and the management team look at it, is that we allocate capital across the range of commodities, from time-to-time we may allocate more capital to any particular commodity that has got more growth options that are value adding to our shareholders. But I should stress that the whole concept of diversification by geography, operating geography that is, by market, i.e. by customer and by product remains very important to us and is something that we take into account every time we make a material investment or acquisition.</p>
          <p>So, can I just remind everybody, I forgot to say, please just state your name when you answer the question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Olivia Ker from UBS. My first question: when you're thinking about your methodology for long term prices, should we now be more thinking towards the incentive price to bring on new capacity if we're thinking in the longer duration or at sort of current marginal cost production?</p>
          <p>And then my second question, if I just look at your CapEx guidance for FY11, I note that it's reduced from sort of just over 20 billion to 15. That amount seems to be that the iron ore JV trend equalization payment is being removed. Can you just provide any update why that's not in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think the JV point is intended to signal anything Olivia. I think, it's purely to illustrate the underlying organic investment in the business as opposed to by acquisition or by buying up.</p>
          <p>To your first question, is it induction or is it marginal cost? I can't give you an unequivocal answer because it depends on the product. For most of our products, I'd say, we believe we like to be positioned in products that grow, which means that they are products that will over decades require new investment. And we take, in those products where new investment will be required, generally, a view of what the lowest cost capacity is that can be built as part of &#x2013; and I want to stress that &#x2013; as part of our process to formulate long run prices, which we review once a year, which generally are little bit more stable than the frequency with which analysts adjust them and I would say historically has generally been reasonably conservative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Sylvain Brunet with Exane BNP Paribas. First question was related to petroleum, if you could give us a bit more guidance to the extent that you've got visibility there on volumes going into next year after the drilling moratorium?</p>
          <p>Second question is on financial leverage, would you have maximum number in mind based on your discussions with rating agencies to maintain the single A rating?</p>
          <p>And the last question on cost inflation, if there are specific items where you see inflation coming back to the business? Caustic soda is reported to be pretty expensive again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Sylvain. Given that &#x2013; two parts of that question, the volume forecast in petroleum as well as the financial question and cost all basically pertain to a set of issues, which Alex looks at very closely. Alex, I wonder if I can ask you to answer those questions. Volume forecast for petroleum, do we have a maximum financial leverage? How do we look at financial leverage? And then any specific cost increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I got that. The petroleum question, Sylvain, we have made reference on our production report that we expect, should the moratorium continue to November, a flat year-on-year overall for petroleum business. So the 159 million barrels of oil equivalent that we produced this year, you can extrapolate that for next year as it stands.</p>
          <p>On financial leverage, the solid A, there is a very well defined criteria by both S&amp;P and Moody's, which is based on the FFO and the CFO, so it's operating cash generation. And we are managing to that. It goes beyond gearing. Gearing is a very rudimentary way of assessing your credit rating it is more into the cash liquidity and cash generation. So if you look at the 1.2 or if you look at the 50%, you're going to see that we are managing towards that.</p>
          <p>Inflation, it is a very good question, because as I mentioned on my note, we see the lagged effect. So what you see now is a retarded reaction of some of the price of the inputs to what was a push on prices for our products a few months back. So, I think anywhere from three to six months that I give that last February, you should look at inflation coming back. In some areas, I would say that labor inflation is manifesting itself stronger and less cyclical than input prices for raw materials, and that would be in Western Australia and in South Africa, but Brazil to some extent as well.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Neil Goodwill from Goldman Sachs. Can I just ask a question around the Base Metals division, really? I mean, could you &#x2013; you're talking about Escondida declining 5 to 10% this year. But could you give us some outline about what Escondida can do over the next say five years or even ten years, and how much CapEx or what you have to do in terms of new concentrators, etcetera, in order to be able to &#x2013; or if you can, in order to be able to maintain production levels there?</p>
          <p>And also any update on ODO would also be useful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Neil, I can't give you any specific updates on either of those two assets today. But I do want to note that the way we look at our portfolios, resource portfolios in all of our products is to look at our tenement maturity and look at the inventory. In Escondido, it remains a fact that the tenement maturity there is still quite low, which means that by the way we look at things, there is still a lot of upside in terms of what is there. We will give you an update on that program in due course, but my take is that Escondido is going to be an asset that is going to produce at very material production rates for decades and decades to come. But no update today on that, and I'll make sure that we, in due course, when we do the Base Metals update, shed a little bit more light on that.</p>
          <p>On Olympic Dam, you'll have noted that even when the tax arguments in Australia were at its crescendo, we were very careful to continue our evaluation program at Olympic Dam of the expansion program. In reality, the rate determining step for us in order to take the next step continues to be the completion of the EIS and again, there is no update on that today.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Craig Campbell, Morgan Stanley. I have a few questions relating to the proposed Potash acquisition. First question is with regard to Potash, if you're successful in that acquisition, the accounting treatment &#x2013; would you be looking to utilize goodwill in terms of that acquisition or will the asset come onto the balance sheet at full acquisition cost?</p>
          <p>Second question, given you've been looking at this market for quite a period of time, and credit markets started to repair themselves during 2009, why is it you weren't able to bid through 2009, and why now or was there an issue around credit markets?</p>
          <p>And then finally, you've mentioned Marius when we've met with you previously that, if an opportunity came up in petroleum, you would look at M&amp;A, does this potential acquisition now push back any timeframe if an opportunity came up, say in petroleum or another asset class?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Craig, I'm going to try and answer the first &#x2013; the last two of those questions, and I'll leave the accounting treatment for Alex to explain our general policies as opposed to this specific instance.</p>
          <p>Petroleum, we are keen on growing that business, but we've got one opportunity here which we're working on and that's the one that Alex, myself and rest of the team are focused on. And I think what you should look towards is that we'd like to, on the Potash transaction, clear the preconditions so that we've got a bid that is capable of being accepted and that's what you should look forward to as we proceed through the remainder of this calendar year.</p>
          <p>I should stress, however, that we do feel that we've got flexibility in our balance sheet. And so I would say that beyond the acquisition of Potash, our aspirations to continue to grow the deployment of capital in the broader natural resources space would be undiminished.</p>
          <p>Credit, cash, I think that there are many factors that go into when something is opportune. In our case, all I can point at is that the combination of PotashCorp having all available information in the public market following their results, following the strong cash generation during this year, which was notable, and where that put us in terms of our balance sheet, plus the credit markets and a variety of other factors, all played into why this is the opportune moment to make that bid. I can't go beyond that.</p>
          <p>Alex, perhaps you can talk a little bit about our general policies towards goodwill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and this hasn't changed. When we acquire a mining interest, we don't book goodwill. Everything goes into the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Perhaps one more question in Sydney, and then I'll move to the telephones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Marius, it's Paul McTaggart from Credit Suisse. Again on Potash, really three bits of question that have been put to me by clients.</p>
          <p>Firstly, how much diversification is enough?</p>
          <p>And let's assume that markets are moderately efficient. How can you add value to Potash, and is your view really about pricing of the product in the long run?</p>
          <p>And thirdly and importantly, given that this is a hostile bid, you haven't had access to data room. How do you manage risk around relying on publicly available information for such a big deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would talk about diversification more in the context of how much complexity does the management team think it can handle.</p>
          <p>And basically, what we've done is we've continued to simplify our business. And perhaps not in a very material way, even in this past year, we've continued, as evidenced by number of employees, EBIT per employee and so on, to trim off little non-core assets and so on, and really concentrate down on those big basin-type assets, which Alex and I've spoken to you before. Things like Olympic Dam, the Bowen Basin, the salt beds of Saskatchewan, Western Australian iron ore, and so on. And what we'd like to do is continue to spend more and more of our effort on these big basin-type assets.</p>
          <p>And to that, I don't know if we've put out any specific data. But I can tell you that the addition to Potash Canada, and a large U.S. customer, in addition with the nitrogen and the phosphate businesses that come along with this, materially reduces the cash flow at risk of this &#x2013; of this company. And that goes to the heart of our value proposition.</p>
          <p>So that's how I would answer those two elements of how much diversification is enough.</p>
          <p>How do we add value? We have the skills to operate these potash mines and their associated infrastructure at the same high levels of utilization that we &#x2013; that is customary for us across the rest of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Secondly, it's notable that there is a material capital investment program for PotashCorp, which is obviously in the share price, but which still carries some risk. We deploy $10 billion plus in organic growth every year. And this is a business which we believe we can, through our CapEx programs, our hub concepts, and so on, add significant value.</p>
          <p>And then the last point is probably back to diversification. We have noted that the Potash market contract cycle is changing, from the way that the product is priced, from the very public statements that Bill Doyle has made about his desires on pricing periods, given counterparty risk and so on, which intrinsically will make that business more and more like all of the other products that we've got. And a diversified company with stability of cash flows, again, can execute that growth program of what is effectively almost a single commodity company much more effectively than that company can. So that's basically our value proposition.</p>
          <p>I think that probably covers it. If I can go to the phone and take a couple of questions on the phone, and then I will circle around to Sydney again. Can I have the &#x2013; operator, can I have the first question on the phone please?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks, Marius. Just a question about your CapEx outlook. And I just sort of hark back to the interim results when you put out your forecast for CapEx this year.</p>
          <p>I'd note that you spent probably 1.5 billion less this year than you assigned back in February. I'm just wondering whether that is a deliberate reaction to what you've already pointed out has been a volatile period or whether you're actually finding it harder to deploy organic capital than you thought? And in that context, what that then means for the $16 billion program for 2011? And talk a little bit about where you're spending that money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, the CapEx came in basically within the statistical ranges that we would see, given the project portfolio that we operate. There has been no deliberate attempt to accelerate or keep it back. That's the normal statistical variation.</p>
          <p>Rather than go through a detailed drawdown of the CapEx schedule here, I think the material that you've got in one of the appendices has got a fairly detailed split-out per product and per project. Andrew, if you've got any other questions I'll be very happy to get the investor relations to just detail that for you, because there is quite a bit of detail available on those projects.</p>
          <p>Can I have the next question please?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Heath Jansen here from Citigroup. Marius, can I ask about hedging. I know that you've always said that you don't do it, and clearly you are going to more of a spot market. But clearly going forward, you might be bringing on 40 billion of debt. So I can understand on the earnings and cash flow why you go to diversification. But I am just wondering whether you might want to look to hedge out some of that risk, particularly on the balance sheet side of the equation?</p>
          <p>And whether you've done any sort of scenario analysis to say, look, if your economic environment and outlook is right, and potentially we go into a double dip, how protected are you going to be potentially on the downside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Heath, we're very comfortable that in any foreseeable scenarios that we've run &#x2013; and we've run extensive scenarios, both to the up and down side &#x2013; that what we're taking on here is very manageable. And we are genetically incapable of thinking about hedging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob Clifford, Deutsche Bank. Just two questions.</p>
          <p>Alex mentioned that you tirelessly pursued market pricing for commodities and are now complete. He used iron ore as an example there. Does that mean you've also completed your pursuit of alumina market pricing?</p>
          <p>And the second question, as you move to more market pricing in potash, assuming your presence increases, that market is likely to become more cyclical. Within your Jackson Pollock chart, where does potash settle &#x2013; or what commodities does it share cyclicality with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, in terms of alumina pricing, that market will continue to evolve, but effectively the market price is available today in China, every day. It's a question of whether you want to devote &#x2013; what percentage of your product you want to send there.</p>
          <p>Historically, we've chosen not to send all of our production over there, but to have a more diversified customer base. But a market price is available today. And I'm seeing a very determined spread towards shorter term re-pricing periods in that industry in general.</p>
          <p>So I wouldn't say anything is complete, but given the relative scale in our revenue line, given what I already see in term of transparency, I wouldn't say that I see material changes in our earnings profile as a result of what's going to happen there.</p>
          <p>In terms of potash, I think we must just step back and say, what are the things that most drive how it plays into the portfolio? Obviously, it's a different currency, and obviously, it's a different short- and long-term market. Essentially potash is a more storable commodity, because it's storable in the soil and &#x2013; than some of our other products.</p>
          <p>But the net impact of all of those cross-correlation coefficients, if we model that into our portfolio, is to materially decrease the cash flow at risk, or if you want to, materially stabilize the cash flow &#x2013; further stabilize the cash flows of this corporation, if we model the complete PotashCorp into our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of return characteristics, potash itself is more of a high margin product, and that is understandable, given the fact that it's also a highly capital intensive business to enter and so on. So the return characteristics may look perhaps something a little bit more like coking coal or iron ore or petroleum rather than aluminum or nickel or energy coal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Charles Kernot from Evolution. Couple of questions, please.</p>
          <p>First, you've talked obviously in terms of basin plays. And given some of the issues and problems in the Gulf of Mexico, could you talk how the Falkland Islands could potentially fit into a basin play? Is that something that you see as far as potential is concerned there?</p>
          <p>Second question is really related back to what you're talking about, given the U.S. high levels of government debt, et cetera. Your genetic incompatibility with gold &#x2013; would you review that at any stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second question, no, we wouldn't review it. Gold is simply &#x2013; other than a byproduct through copper operations and so on &#x2013; it's just not something that we will target on a commodity basis. That remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>And Falklands really is a relatively minor part of our overall exploration activities. And I think it's &#x2013; it'd be a stretch for me to say anything more about that today, Charles.</p>
          <p>If we can loop back perhaps to Sydney, and Alex, if we can take a couple of more questions there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Marius, Tim Gerrard from Investec. Two questions.</p>
          <p>With respect to aluminum and the smelters in Southern Africa, where do they sort of now fit? When you talk about expandable and export-orientated growth assets, where might they fit in the portfolio? And sort of also maybe some comment on the relative importance of the aluminum smelters relative to Worsley, say.</p>
          <p>And the second question is coming back to potash, how difficult has it been to do due diligence on forming a view on the mining risks associated with the potash projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, perhaps in answering your second part of your question, I now recognize that I was actually amiss and I didn't answer the question fully on one of the other question we had on due-diligence.</p>
          <p>The way we look at PotashCorp is that it is an extremely well covered company, which particularly &#x2013; perhaps less evidenced, though, for the Australian investors and for the London investors. But it is a very, very heavily followed stock because it's a bellwether for grain, industrial production, and many things that make this an interesting stock to cover.</p>
          <p>And as such, together with the fact that it is a publicly held company, there is a very, very high level of disclosure here. It's a very small industry, in which I would say that the level of knowledge of what happens is very high. And as such, that makes us very comfortable about the overall level of knowledge that we've got as we proceed to this bid.</p>
          <p>Tim, please just remind me what the first part of your question was because I neglected to jot that down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Where does aluminum fit? The Southern African smelters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that aluminum, along with perhaps nickel, in our business, if you look at our chart of overall number of options that we are pursuing, clearly there is a number of things that we are pursuing across those two products. But it is not as emphasized in our further future growth by options as some of our other products are.</p>
          <p>That is on the basis that there has been quite a technological change in aluminum over the last 10 years, both on the alumina as well as the smelting side, where technology has become more ubiquitous. And perhaps the same thing on nickel with changed consumption patterns and some technological breakthroughs there, as well.</p>
          <p>So I think I'd like to answer the question more by saying you're unlikely to see us deploy &#x2013; without clearly progressing something, you're unlikely to see us deploy large amounts of capital in those two businesses. With the current exposure that we've got, we feel very comfortable, but those two businesses are unlikely to attract a major share of the CapEx of the corporation as we move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Paul Young from Deutsche Bank. Can I focus on the build versus buy strategy in potash? And have the economics changed on Jansen? Because I see now you have split Jansen on your project bubble chart into Phase I and Phase II.</p>
          <p>And I understand you are targeting a single 22 million tonne per annum hole with shaft, but in the potash industry, you know, the maximum hoisting capability of one dedicated production shaft is 11 million tonnes per annum. So has the pay first to Jansen which I understand is in the final stages of completion? Is that showing that you will now need two shafts and a longer ramp-up to achieve 9.8 million tonnes per annum? And how does that influence, if so, your decision to buy versus build?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, general comment about CapEx, I'd like to point you at one of the slides that Alex showed, which basically shows that we continue to ramp-up our organic CapEx at about 20% a year. I think 18% CAGR is the number that Alex has got on his slide today. Basically, that's because we need to build all of those capabilities, the teams and so on as we go forward and therefore you never see us announcing dramatic increases or dramatic decreases in our CapEx. Our strategy is to invest throughout the cycle if we &#x2013; within the constraints of our balance sheet. So nothing has changed there.</p>
          <p>So it's difficult for me to characterize the potash thing as a buy versus build because it is really in addition to, not in place off. I mean we basically see our organic CapEx programs, which we've got on our slate continuing. And really this M&amp;A activity, which has always been there at the top of the pyramid that we've articulated now for the last 10 years, really comes as an additional CapEx deployment.</p>
          <p>And so let me put it even more simply, I cannot go out tomorrow morning and decide to deploy $40 billion of CapEx in the potash industry, because I don't have the human resources to do that.</p>
          <p>With respect to Jansen, I think that our team in Canada, Graham Kerr and the team there, have shed some &#x2013; given some information of how we look at that. I mean, while we will give you more information as we go ahead, we're going as hard as that &#x2013; on that project as we can. The next phase for us, which is quite imminent, is to put the refrigeration plant on the surface and freeze the shaft, that's a single shaft location. And, yes, the targeted lift on that single shaft &#x2013; it's a twin shaft system, one is a production shaft and the other one is a support shaft. But that twin shaft system, which has always been only one production shaft, is targeted for 8 million tonnes of product a year and basically what you do is and I'm going to describe it very generically. As you sink the shaft, you open up your mining fronts, you build the surface plant in modules as the number of mining fronts open up and as you ramp that up and Graham and the team there are going to try and &#x2013; when we get to the approval point, try and ramp that up as quickly as possible, no changes.</p>
          <p>Perhaps one more question in Sydney and then I'm going to try and see if there is anybody else on the phones at this time.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Marius. It's Glyn Lawcock with UBS. One question you are probably going to get a lot over the next few days or weeks is, just how you and the Board rationalize the decision between the buyback option and potash, if you could maybe just enunciate that?</p>
          <p>And then I'm conscious poor Mike Yeager is probably on the phone, falling asleep somewhere. Maybe he could share his views on what's happening with the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico, what he is hearing in terms of his expectations on how that might play out? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can Mike.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Well, in regards to the moratorium, clearly, we are in the midst of it at this time, as everyone knows. That means that for BHP Billiton Petroleum some of our very high opportunities on Shenzi and Atlantis drilling and all are being deferred. Were it not for this, we had another 8 to 10% volume growth outlook. And as Alex said with this situation we are guiding that we are going to be flat year-on-year. Having said that, though, we are progressing right now a number of things, as you know we have kept our operated rigs, not declared force majeure, have those things in full bloom as they move forward to go back to work.</p>
          <p>We are progressing our drilling permits through the system that we are seeing them move, so our drilling permits continue to be the biggest risk coming out of the moratorium, but I am pleased to say that we've already submitted several both water injectors and producers, and we are following those daily and beginning to see the new government system accommodate that.</p>
          <p>So I don't think we've got a clear view coming out, but we will come out, we feel, in the latter part this year, get back to drilling. We're prepared and we hope to be one of the first to get back to work.</p>
          <p>And our major projects, like Mad Dog, Knotty Head appraisal, Gun plant, some of the other things, we're going to lose these six months, but certainly all those teams are still very active and our volume growth after this year should get back and be strong. So Marius, I hope that gives a little perspective, but not clear how we come out of it, but we're seeing progress and seeing our permits starting to move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mike. Let me say a few words about buyback strategy and so on. Glyn, we've said for many years now that once you pass the possible universe of assets that we logically can and should own through the filters of no long tail liabilities, large, low-cost, long-life, expandable, export-oriented through the skill set of the company which is basically mining and extracting. And then you pass that through available for ownership, it's not a large universe. It really isn't a large universe. And from time-to-time the opportunity comes to make a bid for one of those Tier I assets. It's infrequent, the options are limited, and we're probably looking now at the same options that we looked 10 years ago. For us the time to acquire this set of assets, there is a number of things that make it a good time for us to make this bid.</p>
          <p>The buyback option is always there. It is always there and we have taken &#x2013; made use of that overtime as you know either by off market buyback or buying the PLC units which have historically been the cheapest units for us.</p>
          <p>And clearly, both of these options, as we look at them, have got to be value accretive. But I &#x2013; above all I want to stress that for the one there is always &#x2013; that option is always available and for the other one there are only specific times and opportunities to find ourselves there. That's probably how I would nuance the two.</p>
          <p>Okay. Let me go to the phone and just see if there is anybody that's come on in the meantime.  Jody?</p>

          <p>Good evening. Just wanted to ask about iron ore. When is RGP 6 likely to be approved and what sort of work are you still doing on the outer harbor, if anything, assuming the JV doesn't go through, and have you changed your view on medium-term tightness or lack thereof of the market given the price to spend or potentially spend money in potash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, the long term growth aspirations would be same as we outlaid now &#x2013; gosh, how quickly time passes, three years ago, which Ian Ashby and Marcus Randolph laid out and throughout working on the JV, as Rio has &#x2013; because that's uncertain, both companies have really continued to run their businesses on a standalone basis, progressing these standalone options. To that effect we are continuing to progress both the longer-term and what we call quantum growth options, which entails the outer harbor as well as the nearer-term one, RGP 6. We've obviously pre-approved some capital on RGP 6, and one of the key things that's happening there is that the dredging &#x2013; the dredging of the pockets in the harbor is part of that capital spend. I think that we haven't given an exact date for approval of RGP 6. But I &#x2013; I'm probably on reasonably safe ground if I say that it will be sometime next calendar year. But I probably don't want to be pushed more on that.</p>
          <p>Overall, our volume and growth projections that we gave some years back, given the, the near-term slight fine tuning that we give, essentially remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>Can I have the next question on the phone, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>There are no further questions from the telephone, at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just going to move back to London and &#x2013; yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Andrew Gardner from MF Global. More of a topical question, if I may, Marius. More just in terms of coal sector in Australia and what you believe to be the political risk in terms of coal expansions going forward and the ability for any influence really of the Green Party there? And how does that affect maybe your plans for principally coking coal outside of Australia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, I think, we feel very comfortable that the growth plans that we need to execute in the Bowen Basin are well flagged, well researched and on track, again, consistent with our previous guidance. The first major projects there are the Daunia, Poitrel and in the Caval Ridge projects as well as the associated infrastructure. We see no reason to change the guidance on that.</p>
          <p>Where I think it's been a little bit more work is where new basins are coming to play and the situation differs somewhat across the various states as well. New South Wales, I think the well documented Caroona Basin issues that we've had to go through in order to get exploration access. The issues around interaction of farmland and new assets, clearly those processes are quite long. But for existing basins in Queensland, I think we've no reason to change our deployment patterns. We obviously do want to continue the progression of our Indonesian asset because we do believe that that's a good long-term growth option, but we would want to do that in any case.</p>
          <p>Okay. I think we're just about complete here in London. Alex, I don't know if you have any last questions from Sydney?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, one more, Marius.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Marius, Philip Parker, Parker Asset Management. Just on page 26 of your appendix there. There is just looking at the big outliers there copper and met coal, in terms of price variance. I know you said you're giving a briefing coming out fairly shortly but in the interim, can you give us some feel for how that's panned out post 1 July this fiscal year?</p>
          <p>And the second question is probably difficult but can you make any comment on what you think about the outcome of the recent election here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gosh, look, I think for us &#x2013; I can answer the second question a lot of more definitively. Governments change. All oppositions become governments, all governments become opposition. Not clear what will happen here. We've operated in Australia for 125 years. I wouldn't say it's a non-event because for the Australian people it's clearly a very important thing. But for us it really doesn't change &#x2013; whatever happens there doesn't change the way that we'd like to operate the business and how we'd like to go forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of page 26, I'm standing here in front without the detailed information &#x2013; Andre's just passed it to me. Alex, perhaps you can just comment on &#x2013; in the other movements, I would say that the major movements in so far is it impacts on us that we've seen over the last couple of months has been the movement in iron ore prices and just given the weight of that in our portfolio that probably if I step back and try and think about our budget presentations over the last couple of months would have been the biggest relative movement, but Alex you can perhaps add a little bit to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think Philip was asking about met coal and copper. Met coal, what you saw here, Philip, is moving from that fixed higher price that it was last year to a floating price and I think if you look at that, will give a good sense where the curve is going and the shape of that curve now that we have a curve for coal. And if you look at how busy the ports in Queensland are compared where they were a year ago that will put some sort of direction into your analysis there.</p>
          <p>Copper is in a different world, if you look at copper in terms of a supply constraint and the inability of supply to supply on the upside, it will tell you why that commodity has been so vigorous in terms of price sustainability. And we haven't seen anything showing us that that's due to change in the near-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on that note, I think we probably have to conclude.</p>
          <p>I realize that not everybody has got a perfect hour here. We do appreciate the people in London participating early. We do appreciate the people in Sydney participating late &#x2013; late in the afternoon.</p>
          <p>I'd like to close by again reflecting on the fact that we've got a very solid set of results here. We're very proud of the achievements over many years, and we are very convinced that our strategy of being large, low cost, upstream, diversified by commodity, geography and customer, is the correct one. And we continue to remain committed to maintaining that focus on that strategy, and the associated discipline that it puts on the balance sheet and dividend.</p>
          <p>So, thank you again for coming this morning. And thank you again for participating.</p>
