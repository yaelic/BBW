      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice-President of Investor Relations for Johnson &amp; Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the second quarter of 2012. Joining me on the call today are Alex Gorsky, Chief Executive Officer of Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Dominic Caruso, Vice-President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>A few logistics before we get into the details; this call is being made available to a broader audience via a webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson &amp; Johnson website. I'll begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the second quarter for the corporation and highlights for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Alex will discuss his near-term and strategic priorities for Johnson &amp; Johnson. Following Alex's remarks, Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the second quarter financial results and discuss guidance for the full year of 2012. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes.</p>
          <p>Included with the press release that was sent to the investment community earlier this morning is a schedule showing sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These are also available on the Johnson &amp; Johnson website, as is the press release.</p>
          <p>Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2011 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the company or online.</p>
          <p>Last item; during the review, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson &amp; Johnson website, at investor.jnj.com.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to review our results for the second quarter of 2012. If you would refer to your copy of the press release, let's begin with the schedule titled Supplementary Sales Data by Geographic Area.</p>
          <p>Worldwide sales to customers were $16.5 billion for the second quarter of 2012, down 0.7% as compared to the second quarter of 2011. On an operational basis, sales were up 3.5%, and currency had a negative impact of 4.2%. On June 14, the acquisition of Synthes was completed, and the related sales for the remaining 11 days in the quarter were included in the results. Synthes contributed 1.2% to the worldwide operational sales growth.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., sales were down 1.2%, impacted by generic competition for LEVAQUIN and CONCERTA, partially offset by the positive contribution from Synthes. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 7.1%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 7.5 points. The Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., grew by 22.4% operationally, while Europe grew 1.6% operationally. The Asia-Pacific/Africa region grew 7.7% on an operational basis.</p>
          <p>The success of new product launches and Synthes sales made strong contributions to the results outside the U.S. Additionally, the amended agreement with Merck regarding REMICADE and SIMPONI had a significant impact on the very strong sales growth in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S. I will discuss these items in more detail in the segment commentary.</p>
          <p>If you'll now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings, net earnings were $1.4 billion, compared to $2.8 billion in the same period in 2011. Earnings per share were $0.50 versus $1 a year ago. Please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items.</p>
          <p>As referenced in the accompanying table on non-GAAP measures, 2012 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude the after-tax noncash charges primarily attributed to a partial write-down of in-process research and development and intangible assets related to the Crucell vaccines business, an increase to the reserve for previously-disclosed civil litigation matters, and transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of Synthes, Inc.</p>
          <p>Second quarter 2011 net earnings were adjusted to exclude the after-tax impact related to the restructuring of the cardiovascular care business, the net impact of expenses related to litigation matters, additional DePuy ASR hip recalls costs, and a currency adjustment related to the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. Excluding special items in both periods, second quarter 2012 net earnings on an adjusted basis of $3.6 billion and earnings per share of $1.30 were up 2.7% and 1.6%, respectively, versus the second quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to earnings, before we move on to the segment highlights. For the second quarter of 2012, cost of goods sold at 31.2% was in line with the same period last year. Costs associated with the ongoing remediation in our OTC business were offset by the 2011 special charge related to the restructuring of the cardiovascular care business. Second quarter selling, marketing, and administrative expenses at 30.1% of sales were down 130 basis points due to cost-containment initiatives across many of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Our investment in research and development as a percent to sales was 10.7%, 60 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to the timing of expenditures. Interest expense net of interest income of $129 million was up $18 million versus the second quarter of 2011 due to a higher average debt balance.</p>
          <p>Other expense, net of other income of $2 billion in the second quarter of 2012, compared to $206 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items, other income net of other expense was $174 million, compared to $109 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 21.6% in the second quarter of 2012 versus 19.6% in the same period in 2011. Dominic will provide more commentary on both special items and taxes in his remarks.</p>
          <p>Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule highlighting key products or businesses for the second quarter of 2012. I'll begin with the consumer segment.</p>
          <p>Worldwide consumer segment sales for the second quarter of 2012 of $3.6 billion decreased 4.6% as compared to the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 0.6%, while the impact of currency was negative 5.2%. U.S. sales were down 1.9%, while international sales grew 2% on an operational basis. Baby care products increased on an operational basis by 3.2% when compared to the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to international sales of hair care and powders. Sales in the oral care business increased 7.5% operationally due to strong sales outside the U.S. from newly launched Listerine products.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter of 2012, sales for OTC pharmaceuticals and nutritionals increased 0.6% on an operational basis compared to the same period in 2011, with U.S. sales up 1.8% and sales outside the U.S. flat on an operational basis. Sales in the U.S. increased due to the re-launch of selected key products and the impact of the acquisition of sole ownership rights to certain digestive health products.</p>
          <p>McNeil-PPC is operating under a consent decree covering the manufacturing facilities in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico, and Fort Washington and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. McNeil continues to operate the manufacturing facilities in Las Piedras and Lancaster. As we previously discussed, production volumes from these facilities continue to be impacted by additional review and approval processes. We expect this to continue throughout 2012 and most of 2013. Plants operated under the consent decree will produce a simplified portfolio focused on key brands.</p>
          <p>Our skin care business grew 2.2% on an operational basis in the second quarter of 2012, due primarily to strong sales of Neutrogena in the U.S. Women's health declined 8.7% on an operational basis. Sales in the U.S. were down 33.9%, while sales outside the U.S. were down 0.2% on an operational basis. The sales decline this quarter was primarily due to the impact of divestitures of certain brands, as well as the sales impact last year of new product launches related to initial stocking. Wound care/other sales decreased 3.7% on an operational basis compared to the same period last year due to competitive pressures.</p>
          <p>That completes our review of the consumer segment, and I'll now review highlights for the pharmaceutical segment.</p>
          <p>Worldwide net sales for the second quarter of $6.3 billion increased 0.9% versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 5.1%, with a negative currency impact of 4.2 points. Sales in the U.S. decreased 4.5%, while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 15.5%. The loss of marketing exclusivity for LEVAQUIN in June last year and the May 2011 supply and distribution agreement with Watson Laboratories, Inc., to distribute an authorized generic version of CONCERTA in the U.S. negatively impacted worldwide pharmaceutical operational sales growth by approximately 4 points and U.S. growth by approximately 7.5 points.</p>
          <p>Positively impacting sales growth in the quarter were sales related to the impact of the amended agreement with Merck, partially offset by divestitures. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2011, as a result of the agreement reached with Merck, we began selling REMICADE and SIMPONI directly into certain international territories. We therefore recorded lower U.S. export sales related to those territories and higher international sales. Excluding the items mentioned, the underlying worldwide operational growth was approximately 8%, with growth in the U.S. at approximately 10% and outside the U.S. at approximately 6% operational.</p>
          <p>Now reviewing sales for the major therapeutic areas; immunology products achieved strong double-digit operational sales growth of 18.2%. Sales in the U.S. declined 3.5%, impacted by lower export sales to Merck, as I just mentioned. Excluding the change in export sales, U.S. immunology sales increased nearly 11%, led by STELARA, up 52%, and REMICADE, up 6.5%. With these strong results, we continue to be the U.S. market leader in immunology.</p>
          <p>International sales of immunology products more than tripled versus the second quarter of 2011, due primarily to the sales related to the territories we regained from Merck. Sales of infectious disease products increased 1.3% on an operational basis. Excluding the generic impact of LEVAQUIN which I previously mentioned, infectious disease sales increased over 20%.</p>
          <p>Major contributors were the successful launch of INCIVO for hepatitis C, the continued momentum in market share growth of PREZISTA and insulins for HIV, partially offset by lower sales of vaccines, primarily due to a supply disruption at our third-party supplier. INCIVO contributed about 3.5 points to the growth of the total international pharmaceutical sales results. On a sequential basis, sales were down primarily due to some seasonality in treatment patterns in Europe.</p>
          <p>Neuroscience product sales increased 0.5% on an operational basis. Growth was impacted by generic competition with CONCERTA, as I mentioned, as well as products such as DURAGESIC, RAZADYNE, and RISPERDAL. The long-acting injectable antipsychotics RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA, or XEPLION, achieved operational growth of close to 20% due to an increase in combined market share. INVEGA sales outside the U.S. achieved operational growth of over 30%, primarily due to the strong growth in Japan.</p>
          <p>Sales of oncology products increased 14.1% on an operational basis due to the very strong results for ZYTIGA, partially offset by lower sales of DOXIL/CAELYX related to manufacturing issues at our third-party supplier. ZYTIGA is currently approved to treat chemo-refractory metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In the quarter, ZYTIGA achieved sales of over $230 million. On a sequential basis, reported sales increased approximately 15%.</p>
          <p>VELCADE is a treatment for multiple myeloma for which we have commercialization rights in Europe and the rest of the world outside the U.S. Operational sales were flat due to the timing of tender business, as I referenced in my first quarter result remarks. On a year-to-date basis, sales increased 13.4% operationally.</p>
          <p>DOXIL/CAELYX declined nearly 90% on an operational basis in the quarter. Restoring a reliable supply of DOXIL/CAELYX remains our most urgent priority, and we will continue to pursue a variety of options to bring consistent supply of this important medication back to patients and physicians as quickly as possible. We anticipate being able to begin resupplying DOXIL/CAELYX to the market in the fourth quarter of 2012. Note that in some markets, health authority approvals will be required.</p>
          <p>Other pharmaceutical products declined 5.3% on an operational basis due to divestitures and lower sales of PROCRIT, due to the decline in the market, and EPREX, due primarily to the impact of generic competition. Positively impacting results, XARELTO sales grew 80% on a sequential basis, contributing approximately 1.5 points to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate.</p>
          <p>As an update on XARELTO; first, from a commercial perspective, XARELTO continues to make positive gains in access, with over 90% coverage on commercial formularies, half of the preferred branded status. Based on recent IMS data for the oral anticoagulant market, XARELTO now exceeds PRADAXA in new-to-brand scripts overall and has captured nearly a third of the newt-to-brand scripts in cardiology, topping PRADAXA's share.</p>
          <p>On the pipeline front, on July 9 we announced that the FDA assigned a priority review designation to the supplemental new drug applications for XARELTO seeking new indications to treat patients with deep vein thrombosis or DVT, pulmonary embolism or PE, and to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism.</p>
          <p>In addition, we also announced that we withdrew the sNDA for the use of XARELTO to reduce the risk of stent thrombosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome or ACS. This sNDA is contingent on a separate sNDA for XARELTO to reduce the risk of secondary cardiovascular events in patients with ACS, for which we received a complete response letter from the FDA. We are confident in the robust study results and the positive benefit/risk profile of XARELTO in patients with ACS, and we will continue to work with the FDA to fully address their questions as quickly as possible. We plan to resubmit the sNDA for stent thrombosis at the same time we submit our reply to the complete response for the ACS indication.</p>
          <p>Regarding bapineuzumab, the two Janssen-led Phase III studies are complete, and we are currently gathering the data for analysis. The top-line results will be available this quarter, and our partner Pfizer has indicated they will be issuing a top-line results press release. The first presentation of the results will be a late-breaker presentation at the European Federation of Neurological Societies Congress in Stockholm in September.</p>
          <p>Also, during the quarter, the application for an additional indication for VELCADE for the treatment of patients with relapsed follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma was withdrawn after the CHMP indicated the data provided did not support a positive benefit/risk balance. In addition, the CHMP granted a positive opinion recommending approval of subcutaneous administration of VELCADE for the treatment of multiple myeloma. And just yesterday we announced the filing in both the U.S. and Europe for SIMPONI for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.</p>
          <p>That completes the review of the pharmaceutical segment. I'll now review the medical devices and diagnostics segment results.</p>
          <p>Worldwide medical devices and diagnostics segment sales of $6.6 billion grew 3.4% operationally as compared to the same period in 2011. Currency had a negative impact of 3.5 points, resulting in a total sales decrease of 0.1%. Sales excluding the impact of Synthes were up 0.5% on an operational basis, with U.S. sales down 0.8% and sales outside the U.S. up 1.5% on an operational basis. The exit from the drug-eluting stent market negatively impacted the worldwide MD&amp;D sales growth by approximately 1%.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the MD&amp;D businesses, starting with cardiovascular care; cardiovascular care sales were down 10.9% operationally, with the U.S. down 7.1% and sales outside the U.S. down 13.1% operationally. Excluding the impact of drug-eluting stents, sales were down approximately 1% in both the U.S. and outside the U.S. Endovascular sales were negatively impacted by competitive launches and a disruption in supply that is expected to be resolved in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Biosense Webster, our electrophysiology business, achieved worldwide operational growth of 16% in the quarter. Disposable utilizations due to the breadth of the installed base of CARTO 3, complemented by the success of the new THERMOCOOL catheter launches, made strong contributions to the results.</p>
          <p>The diabetes care business achieved operational sales growth of 2.9% in the second quarter of 2012, with the U.S. business up 1.2%. Continued softness in mail-order sales and an inventory contraction at the retail level impacted growth this quarter. The business outside the U.S. grew 4.6% operationally, with strong sales results in emerging markets, partially offset by lower sales in some of the developed markets.</p>
          <p>The diagnostics business declined 3.8% on an operational basis, with the U.S. down 8.2% and sales outside the U.S. up 0.8% operationally in the second quarter. In the U.S., sales were impacted by lower donor screening sales due to competitive pressures. General surgery worldwide sales grew operationally by 0.9%, with the U.S. down 3.1% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.1% operationally.</p>
          <p>The success of new product launches SECURESTRAP, PHYSIOMESH, and the ECHELON FLEX powered ENDOPATH stapler were partially offset by lower sales of mechanical products due to the continued shift to minimally-invasive procedures and low-cost competition. Additionally, in the U.S., lower sales of pelvic floor repair products, as well as competition with trocars, negatively impacted sales growth this quarter.</p>
          <p>Infection prevention grew 2.3% on an operational basis, with U.S. growth at 1% and growth outside the U.S. of 3.3% on an operational basis. A customer program to upgrade systems to STERRAD solutions ended in the first quarter, impacting the timing of capital purchases for the year. Excluding capital sales, operational growth was approximately 11% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Orthopedic sales were up 14% on an operational basis when compared to the same period in 2011. Excluding Synthes, sales grew 0.9% on an operational basis, with the U.S. down 0.6% due to the divestiture in December 2011 of certain neurosurgical instruments. Sales outside the U.S. were up 2.6% excluding the impact of Synthes.</p>
          <p>Operationally, hips were up 4% worldwide, driven by 5% growth in the U.S. due to the strong results in primary stem platform sales, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Hips outside the U.S. grew 3% operationally, attributed to heads, cement-less stems, and acetabular products. Knees worldwide increased 3% on an operational basis, with similar results in both the U.S. and outside the U.S. Worldwide spine was down 3% on an operational basis, with the U.S. down 5% due to continued pressure on price. Sales outside the U.S. were up 1% operationally, with strong results in emerging markets, partially offset by competitive and pricing pressure in certain developed markets.</p>
          <p>Specialty surgery achieved operational growth of 7.8% in the second quarter of 2012, with the U.S. sales up 8% and sales outside the U.S. up 7.6% on an operational basis. Incremental sales from the acquisition of SterilMed and strong international sales of biosurgery products and energy products were the major drivers of growth this quarter.</p>
          <p>Rounding out the review of the medical devices and diagnostics segment, our vision care business achieved operational sales growth of 1.9% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in the U.S. increased 3.3%, while sales outside the U.S. increased 1.2% on an operational basis. Growth was driven by daily lenses and astigmatism lenses, partially offset by lower sales of reusable lenses.</p>
          <p>That completes highlights for the medical devices and diagnostic segment and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson &amp; Johnson's second quarter of 2012. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Louise, and thanks to all of you for participating on the call today. It's a real pleasure for me to join you, this being the first earnings announcement since I've assumed my responsibility as the CEO. This kind of dialogue with the investment community is something I consider important and mutually valuable.</p>
          <p>During the past couple of months, I've done a lot of traveling and a lot of listening. This has allowed me to refine my understanding of the many opportunities we have across Johnson &amp; Johnson and our plans to capitalize on them in the future. So I'd like to spend a few minutes right up front conveying my excitement for the future of Johnson &amp; Johnson and give you a sense of our priorities.</p>
          <p>Nothing is more important than the health and well-being of those we care about. That's why the Johnson &amp; Johnson family of companies for more than 125 years has committed itself to caring for patients and consumers. Going forward, we will build on Johnson &amp; Johnson's long, proud legacy of strong performance, trust, esteem, high reputation, and many accomplishments. Our commitment, a legacy of our founders, and a very real motivating force among our 128,000 employees is embodied in Our Credo, which speaks to our first responsibility to the doctors, nurses, patients, the mothers and fathers, and all who use our products.</p>
          <p>I am resolute in my determination to keep Our Credo as the foundation at Johnson &amp; Johnson. Our Credo has long been and must continue to be the defining feature of our organization because it reflects our core value systems, our beliefs, and our aspirations. Science will evolve, our environment and markets will change, but who we are and what we believe, as described so well by Our Credo, will ensure we successfully navigate through whatever the future has to offer.</p>
          <p>How people around the world achieve good health is likely to be the most significant challenge and opportunity for our entire generation. Because of that, we must be bold, thoughtful, and disciplined as we help shape the future of human health and well-being. Along so many dimensions, the global healthcare environment is changing dramatically.</p>
          <p>From the broad demographic changes associated with an aging world, to the need for healthcare access among developing markets, to healthcare funding challenges faced by almost every government; from higher levels of regulatory vigilance, to changes in healthcare technologies, to consumers increasingly defining their paths to health; all of these currents and countercurrents bring tremendous opportunity and potential risks to healthcare companies.</p>
          <p>Addressing this web of challenges and opportunities is where Johnson &amp; Johnson truly shines, not simply because of our innovations, but because of our dedication to the core strategic principles and values we've had in place for so many years, combined with a real sense of commitment to build an even stronger business and organization for the future. Our new leadership team is fully aware that market needs, dynamics, expectations, and capabilities are evolving, and we must change and adapt with a high sense of urgency as we move into the future.</p>
          <p>Let's briefly consider our four strategic principles. First, we will remain committed to being broadly based in human healthcare. We believe our broad base serves us well in terms of business strategy, product development, and talent development. It gives us access to a wide range of markets and makes us more agile in adapting to change and grasping opportunity. Customers, technology, and financial incentives will continue to change in healthcare. Yet, through our broad base, we can remain disciplined about exactly where in healthcare we will focus our efforts and resources.</p>
          <p>Customers are increasingly aggregating their purchasing decisions, looking for new partnerships. They are focusing on solutions and outcomes that span beyond individual products. With our comprehensive portfolio, we are in an excellent position to shape this trend and to provide a comprehensive partnership across a broad array of customer needs, technologies, and capabilities.</p>
          <p>We know that our broad base in healthcare is particularly helpful in emerging and developing markets, where Johnson &amp; Johnson's equity and critical mass position us well with customers and governments. In addition, we believe that convergent technologies, such as diagnostics, biomarkers, and combined drug device therapeutics, will better enable us to provide differentiated, sustainable, competitive advantage for the future.</p>
          <p>Some of these combination markets are growing at double-digit rates, much faster than other segments of healthcare. We have a wide range of technology, clinical development, regulatory, supply chain quality and commercial capabilities to address these opportunities. In Johnson &amp; Johnson, our broad portfolio of innovative resources and capabilities offer significant potential to bring complex and innovative technologies to patients and consumers.</p>
          <p>As a second principle, we remain committed to being decentralized in those areas that are closest to serving patients and our customers. I like to refer to this as enlightened decentralization, because not everything about Johnson &amp; Johnson is decentralized, nor should it be. We've taken significant strides to standardize many of our support systems and processes and have realized efficiencies and improved effectiveness as a result. At the same time, we want to ensure that local needs, insights, and entrepreneurship drive our commercial efforts. Like our broad base of products, decentralization increases our agility by offering local windows into so many diverse markets.</p>
          <p>Third, we will remain committed to our philosophy of managing for the long term. Now, this doesn't mean we don't have short-term pressures and obligations, but managing with a view for long-term sustainable gains is, in our view, best for the interest of our patients, customers, employees, and shareholders. In fact, our diversification and broad base has allowed us to keep our strategic focus even in the face of short-term challenges in portions of our business. This allows Johnson &amp; Johnson to invest in long-term value creation and not be constrained by short-term issues requiring short-term choices.</p>
          <p>Our expansive view gives us flexibility, perspective, and the wherewithal to manage through a myriad of times, reducing risk while still achieving solid returns. For instance, as our pharmaceutical segment experienced the height of its patent losses from 2007 to 2009, our disciplined approach still enabled rigorous prioritization and continued investment in our pharmaceutical R&amp;D pipeline. This helped us be well-positioned for long-term growth, and has led to our having one of the strongest new product portfolios in the industry today.</p>
          <p>During our capital allocation process, a review of optimal reinvestment rates is evaluated for each business. This ensures that the best growth opportunities are realized. I can assure you that we will work aggressively as a management team going forward to apply this assessment rigorously and in a consistent and systematic manner.</p>
          <p>We recognize that it will be critical for us to exit or significantly revamp areas of our business where we no longer feel we can help patients and consumers or where we can no longer drive positive shareholder returns. Our decisions to exit the drug-eluting stent market with Cordis and to purchase Synthes are good examples of the kind of discipline we use in making strategic choices on where and when to invest and divest.</p>
          <p>Finally, we've always had a core strategic principle of focusing on our people and Our Credo values to ensure our success for the long term. Markets and products will fluctuate, and new challenges and opportunities will be evolving, but in the long term, our people and values will truly make the difference.</p>
          <p>These four strategic principles are as relevant today as they have ever been. They are the solid foundation from which our growth is built. Before I talk about our specific growth drivers, let me briefly describe three short-term priorities that we have identified. We recognize that we must attack these with focus and vigor as an enterprise. The three are, first, to restore supply of our McNeil over-the-counter products to the market; second, to build on the momentum of our pharmaceuticals business; and finally, to successfully integrate the Synthes acquisition and create the unparalleled world leader in orthopedics and neurologics.</p>
          <p>One of my highest priorities is to restore a reliable supply of high-quality over-the-counter products to the marketplace and to do what it takes to continue to build trust in our products and brands. Right now, that means successfully meeting two commitments: first, meeting our obligations with respect to the consent decree at our McNeil plants; and second, meeting our commitment to return OTC products to consumers as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>It has been just over a year since signing the consent decree with the FDA. Since that time, we've learned more about the complexity of implementing and operating under the consent decree, and the skills and capabilities required across our organization to perform this critical work. We will continue to deliver on our consent decree commitments, while ensuring quality and continuing to remediate facilities and processes.</p>
          <p>We will pace production accordingly at those plants, taking a prudent approach to production volumes, and focusing on delivering a consistent supply of select products. During this period, we will ensure our operational and organizational models are appropriate for the business. At the same time, we will bring in additional resources as needed and continue to evaluate other options for returning these great products to consumers.</p>
          <p>Over the longer term, we are committed to and remain optimistic about the future of our OTC business. We are laying the groundwork for an OTC business focused on meaningful, science-based innovation, delivering high quality and reliable products and surpassing consumer expectations. Meanwhile, we also believe we have a number of significant growth opportunities in our skin care, oral care, and base consumer segments. I look forward to updating you further on our progress over time.</p>
          <p>Second, we are extremely proud of the success of our pharmaceutical teams in bringing to market such an impressive array of new therapies in recent months. Now our teams are focused on building on this momentum along multiple fronts by growing our core business globally, through accelerated growth in our new products, and by continuing to build our pipeline. Our core products such as REMICADE and PREZISTA continue to be drivers of growth.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, with successful launch results for products like ZYTIGA, INCIVO, XARELTO, STELARA, SIMPONI, and INVEGA SUSTENNA, Johnson &amp; Johnson led the U.S. and Europe in new product pharmaceutical product sales in 2011 according to IMS, and we see continued momentum this year.</p>
          <p>Also, over the past several months, we have made additional progress with a number of important filings: U.S. and EU filings for canagliflozin for type 2 diabetes, ZYTIGA for chemo-naive indication for prostate cancer in the U.S. and EU, XARELTO for VTE treatment in the U.S., TMC207 for multi-drug-resistant TB in the U.S. We've also made progress on a number of key clinical trials.</p>
          <p>In short, our pharmaceuticals business is poised and resourced to continue to be a strong driver of sales momentum. We will continue to build our pipeline through organic development, partnerships, and alliances focused on significant unmet medical needs.</p>
          <p>Finally, we will successfully integrate Synthes into the DePuy family of companies. As you know, we successfully closed the Synthes acquisition this quarter, and we are pleased with our progress. We are delighted to have been able to retain Michel Orsinger as part of the strong leadership team to direct this business, now called the DePuy Synthes Companies.</p>
          <p>We are positioned as a market leader in a $40-billion-and-growing market, where we have an approximately 25% share, and we are number one, two, or three in most specialties. We are the largest, most innovative, and comprehensive orthopedic and neurological business in the world. Our integration work is well underway. Our regional and functional leaders represent a combination of talent from both DePuy and Synthes. We've already organized a combined sales force of in-house and contract resources. Meanwhile, our manufacturing, marketing, and other functional teams are actively at work on implementation of their integration plans.</p>
          <p>Turning from our short-term focus area to the longer term, we have identified four key drivers of growth for Johnson &amp; Johnson: building value through innovation, expanding our global reach, excellence in execution, and leading with a purpose. We will be focused on accelerating growth in both top and bottom lines, being even more disciplined and decisive in making strategic calls. In this context, meaningful innovation will be more crucial than ever to driving growth.</p>
          <p>We must aggressively gather customer-driven insights, and from these, generate, identify, and develop new treatments and prevention approaches. These approaches must be ones that will make a meaningful difference in healthcare and extend access in economical and sustainable ways to improve the lives of patients and customers. Innovation at J&amp;J is more than products and pipeline. It's about bringing innovation to everything we do. It is everyone's responsibility. One quarter of Johnson &amp; Johnson's revenue, and growing, comes from products introduced within the past five years.</p>
          <p>So, while Johnson &amp; Johnson will remain a leader in research and development, we're also focused on being innovative in how we bring products to market, the kinds of partnerships we develop, and how we operate our businesses. We are at the forefront of driving innovation through diverse models. For example, we are broadening our scope through cross-sector innovation centers.</p>
          <p>We recognize that transforming healthcare and delivering holistic outcomes require that we capture and fuel the best science and technology from all over the world and across all segments. Our innovation centers bring resources together in the leading innovation hot spots around the world, giving us greater access to the most promising science and technology and increased ability to shape the healthcare landscape.</p>
          <p>A second area of focus for growth is a need to expand our reach globally while maintaining our local focus on implementation. That combination has made us effective in the 55% of our business that is already outside the United States. We operate in 60 countries and touch more than 1 billion patients and customers around the world.</p>
          <p>But helping the next billion people will not be so easy. Many live in the developing world and have very different needs than our traditional customers. Income levels, while growing rapidly, are lower. Unmet healthcare needs abound. Indeed, demand for healthcare in these markets is growing three or four times faster than developed markets. We continue to see double-digit year-over-year sales growth in our BRIC markets. In this new world, our focus will be on expanding our footprint to help more people and on delivering healthcare in economical and sustainable ways.</p>
          <p>In medical devices, for example, our engineers are adapting and refining products from Johnson &amp; Johnson's outstanding portfolio to make medical devices that better suit the conditions and needs of Asia's healthcare professionals and patients. A number of products for the emerging markets have already been developed and launched, including such products as the ETHICON Endo-Surgery reusable linear cutter, the Synsyl suture range for ETHICON, the DePuy REACH knee, and ONETOUCH SimpleSelect blood glucose monitor.</p>
          <p>In our consumer space, we have seen unique offerings, like a new line of body wash products from our Dabao business in China, Listerine Natural Green Tea launched across Asia, and a value-priced Listerine formulation targeted to young professionals in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Around the world, we are also pioneering market-appropriate public-private partnerships. A couple of weeks ago, while visiting our businesses in Russia, I saw firsthand the remarkable work we are doing in the partnerships there that range from producing our market-leading VELCADE product locally to training and medical education to partnering on biotechnology research.</p>
          <p>To reach billions of customers and patients, our best strategies and plan must always be paired with excellence in execution. That is our third growth driver. High standards and high quality must always be our starting points. Nowhere is the need for flawless execution more imperative than it is in healthcare.</p>
          <p>About two-and-a-half years ago, we began to integrate our supply chain operations to simplify processes and ensure more consistent quality across our business units. We are already seeing evidence of excellent progress, including the establishment of global quality standards. We will focus on applying this same type of rigor to execution across our enterprise &#x2013; to our commercial plans, our launches, and our clinical trial processes, to name a few. Our strategies, business plans, organizational structures, and ongoing decisions all recognize the need to focus resolutely, then execute with excellence.</p>
          <p>Finally, in driving growth, we count on our leaders to lead with a purpose in all that they do. Our leaders distinguish us from other companies. They exhibit passion and autonomy in meeting the existing needs of their patients and customers and identifying unmet needs, and in being able to marshal resources to address these needs efficiently and effectively.</p>
          <p>We are focused on how we bring innovations to market that can have the greatest impact on human healthcare. Very simply, our success in this depends on having responsible people &#x2013; employees with the skills, judgment, integrity, and leadership qualities to build our future. I am incredibly proud of our employees at Johnson &amp; Johnson. They are associates and colleagues who take this responsibility very seriously. From both internal and external studies, we see convincing evidence that our employees uniquely appreciate our values and strategies and help position us well for sustainable growth.</p>
          <p>With our clear strategic principles and focus on high-priority growth drivers, I am enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead for Johnson &amp; Johnson. We make a difference for over 1 billion people around the world every day. We aspire to help additional billions of people live longer, healthier, happier lives. There's no better company anywhere to pursue this aspiration than Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the call over to Dominic before we open it up for Q&amp;A.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alex, and good morning, everyone. I would like to provide some comments this morning about our second quarter financial results, discuss briefly the Synthes transaction, and provide guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2012.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter performance was solid despite the continuing marketplace and economic pressures. Although healthcare utilization trends are still below pre-recession levels, we saw continuing stabilization of the trends, based on first quarter data, with some signs of improvement in the rate of growth in hospital admissions and surgeries, including joint replacement. And while positive, these signs are still too early and minor to signal any meaningful sustained recovery, especially in light of the continued uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment.</p>
          <p>Sales results for the quarter were impacted significantly by the weakening euro but were positively enhanced by the closing of the Synthes transaction. Second quarter sales on an operational basis, excluding the impact of currency, grew at 3.5%. The two weeks of sales related to the completion of the Synthes acquisition contributed just over 1% to the operational growth for this quarter. From an earnings perspective, earnings per share, excluding special items, were $1.30.</p>
          <p>Louise provided some information already regarding the special items we recorded in the second quarter. Let me take a few minutes now to provide some additional background regarding those items.</p>
          <p>First, regarding Crucell, as many of you remember, historically the rules for acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&amp;D, require that such costs be expensed at the time of acquisition. In 2009, however, the accounting rules changed to require that acquired in-process research and development be capitalized as an asset. Periodic evaluations for changes in the status of the related research projects are performed as the research projects progress.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, the company recorded as a special item an after-tax charge of approximately $800 million regarding Crucell. This charge relates to changes in the timelines for the development projects included in the original capitalized amount, as well as a reduction in the carrying value of intangible assets related to currently marketed products that have been impacted by pricing and competitive pressures.</p>
          <p>In terms of the balance of the Crucell business, there are several other projects in the Crucell R&amp;D pipeline, such as a vaccine for HIV and another vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus, which are advancing well. However, current accounting rules for IPR&amp;D do not permit any increases in the values of programs post-acquisition.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe in the importance of Crucell in delivering innovative healthcare solutions to patients around the world. Additionally, during the quarter, we also recorded after-tax charges for adjustments to the carrying value of other intangible assets, and those have been reflected as special items as well.</p>
          <p>Next, turning to litigation matters, as we discussed several weeks ago, the company incurred a special charge in the second quarter of approximately $600 million after-tax, to increase its reserve for previously disclosed civil litigation matters related to RISPERDAL, INVEGA, NATRECOR, and Omnicare.</p>
          <p>And finally, in connection with the closing of the Synthes transaction, we incurred after-tax charges of approximately $550 million, including integration and transaction cost. We also expect that for the remainder of the year, we will incur additional special items representing after-tax charges of approximately $600 million related to the further transaction, integration, and restructuring costs as well as costs associated with the step-up of inventory values.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss the completion of the Synthes transaction. As we have been forecasting since last year, we completed the acquisition in the second quarter, and we are very pleased to have achieved this milestone. And as we have reported, we expect the transaction to be accretive to earnings by $0.03 to $0.05 for 2012 and $0.10 to $0.15 for 2013. These estimates include the impact of approximately $400 million after-tax on an annualized basis of incremental amortization expense related to the transaction.</p>
          <p>Many of you have asked about the financing structure we used to execute the transaction. It is important to note that the facts and circumstances for the financing structure are very specific to Johnson &amp; Johnson, and we have described the financing structure in a press release and related 8-K filing. We will not be providing any additional information about the financing structure, as this would entail disclosing information which we consider confidential and competitive about our operations. As Alex indicated in his comments, we are moving ahead with the integration efforts, and we are delighted to have Synthes join the Johnson &amp; Johnson family of companies.</p>
          <p>Let me now provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2012. My guidance now includes the positive impact from the acquisition of Synthes, the divestiture of our worldwide DePuy trauma business to Biomet, as well as updated estimates from our consumer business, including OTC resupply timing, impact of supply disruptions for certain of our MD&amp;D businesses, and recent updates to our vaccine business. Let me begin with a discussion of cash and interest income and expense.</p>
          <p>At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $700 million of net debt. This consists of approximately $16.9 billion of cash and investments and approximately $17.6 billion of debt. The reduction in our net cash position by approximately $15 billion since the end of the first quarter is of course mostly due to the acquisition of Synthes. We are very pleased that all three major rating agencies maintained our AAA credit rating, and Moody's revised its outlook to stable from negative following the transaction, owing to our ongoing financial strength. For purposes of your models, assuming no additional major acquisitions during 2012, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $500 million and $550 million, consistent with our previous guidance.</p>
          <p>Turning to other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as one-time gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, and divestitures, asset sales, or write-offs. This account is difficult to forecast, but assuming no additional major one-time gains or losses, and excluding the impact of any special items, I would recommend you consider modeling other income and expense for 2012 as a net gain ranging from approximately $900 million to $1 billion, consistent with our previous guidance.</p>
          <p>And now a word on taxes; for the first six months of 2012, the company's effective tax rate, excluding special items, was 22.2%. We suggest that you model our effective tax rate for 2012 in the range of 21% to 22%, consistent with our previous guidance. Although not yet reflected in our first-half results, this annual tax rate assumes that the R&amp;D tax credit will be reinstated by Congress by the end of this year, and as always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon the rate throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to sales and earnings guidance. Our guidance continues to be based, first, on a constant-currency basis, reflecting our results from operations, assuming that average currency rates for 2012 will be the same as they were for 2011. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this operational view provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also continue to provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2012 with the impact that current exchange rates could have, using the euro as an example.</p>
          <p>Turning to sales, as a reminder, our guidance now includes the positive impact from the acquisition of Synthes, the divestiture of our worldwide DePuy trauma business to Biomet, as well as updated estimates for our consumer businesses, including OTC resupply timing, impact of supply disruptions for certain of our MD&amp;D businesses, and recent updates to our vaccine business. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant-currency basis of between approximately 5.5% and 6.5% for the year. This would result in estimated sales for 2012 on a constant-currency basis of between approximately $68.6 billion and $69.3 billion.</p>
          <p>While we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact if currency exchange rates for the remainder of 2012 were to stay where they were as of last week, as an example, with the euro at approximately $1.23, then our sales growth rate would be negatively impacted by approximately 3% for the year. Thus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales growth to be between 2.5% and 3.5% for the year, for an expected level of reported sales of between approximately $66.7 billion and $67.3 billion.</p>
          <p>And now, turning to earnings, I suggest that you consider full-year 2012 operational EPS estimates of between $5.25 and $5.32 per share, excluding the impact of special items, and now including the accretive impact of the Synthes acquisition, and assuming the same average exchange rates for 2012 as we saw in 2011. The impact of currency movements will be more significant on our earnings than on our sales, as the proportion of our earnings based on the euro currency are nearly two times the proportion of our sales based on the euro currency.</p>
          <p>While we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, if currency exchange rates &#x2013; particularly the euro &#x2013; for the balance of 2012 were to remain where they were as of last week, then the impact of currency movements would be a reduction of approximately $0.25 per share, or an incremental $0.14 per share, from our previous guidance. Therefore, our reported earnings per share, excluding special items, would be between $5.00 and $5.07 per share, which is lower than our previous guidance, reflecting the accretive impact of the Synthes acquisition, more than offset by the weakening of foreign exchange rates &#x2013; primarily the euro &#x2013; versus the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>On a final note, I'd like to point out that as you update your models for the guidance we provided, you should see pre-tax operating margins improve between 100 and 150 basis points, even with the incremental amortization expense related to Synthes. This is consistent with the financial discipline we continuously employ at our business, while at the same time investing appropriately for sustainable growth.</p>
          <p>That concludes my comments on our operating performance this quarter and our guidance with respect to your models, and I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. Now, Louise, back to you for the Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'll start with Alex. Alex, you talked about a bunch of items in your prepared comments, and I think probably the one that I think people should focus on and probably got our attention was your comments about the goal of accelerating J&amp;J's sales and earnings growth over the next several years, not necessarily a short-term goal, but a longer term goal. And within that, you talked about innovation, globalization, and other initiatives to try and accomplishment that. Can you just talk a little bit about the portfolio today in that context? You talked about being more disciplined on strategic decisions regarding what goes into the portfolio and what comes out. Do you have the portfolio and do you have the R&amp;D pipeline today to drive that acceleration, and what do you think you need to do strategically to make that growth acceleration happen? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Mike. Thanks a lot for the question. And as I commented earlier in my comments, I think, overall, we believe that our diversified portfolio does better position us for the healthcare market that we're likely to experience ahead. And if we look across &#x2013; let's start with our pharmaceutical group. I believe that the transformation that has occurred over the past several years, when you consider the fact that we went through a very significant period of generic entries and patent expirations, and you look at not only the fact the major changes that we made in our organization, but also if you look at the focus that Paul, Joaquin, and their teams have put on specific therapeutic areas and, frankly, the success rates that we've had with our clinical development programs and getting new products to the market, we think it's really significant, and it's positioned us very well.</p>
          <p>And we think by being focused in these areas, not only does it give us an advantage in terms of our scientific insights in clinical development, but it also enables us to leverage our commercial organization and really be focused on the right customers. So while we're very pleased with the uptake that we're seeing across that portfolio right now with products like ZYTIGA, XARELTO, INCIVO, STELARA, and SIMPONI, we're also investing for the future. And we're excited about some of the new compounds that we have, whether it's canagliflozin, bapineuzumab, things further out such as ibrutinib as well TMC435. And we're continuing to invest even longer-term, as you heard in our announcement this week, with our new cyclic peptide in heart failure, recognizing that it's earlier. So I think, there, we've got a strong portfolio, very differentiated drugs that the market's demanding; but clearly, we're also investing for the future.</p>
          <p>Now, if I can step over to our MD&amp;D space next, I think what I would say is we're also positioning ourselves for what we believe are going to be the needs, the demands of the future environment. Specifically, it requires innovation, and that's both in terms of products as well as the way that we're offering products to that marketplace. I think some of the recent moves that we've made with Synthes, for example, creating the world's largest orthopedics platform &#x2013; whether it's in reconstruction with hips and knees, spine, sports medicine, the emerging neurologics, obviously working now with trauma, the maxillofacial group coming in from Synthes &#x2013; is going to give us a breadth and depth to work with customers, both in the United States as well as abroad, on a very broad scale, bringing not only a broad array of products, but also other services and solutions that we think are going to be expected by hospitals and other payers in that particular environment.</p>
          <p>We've also made changes in our surgery group. If you look at what we've done over the past couple of quarters by bringing our ETHICON Endo-Surgery group and our renewed portfolio in our cardiovascular group together, there too we think we're not only offering them a very differentiated pipeline, particularly with biosurgicals and our energy instruments, but we're also bringing a more competitive commercial model to bear that we think will bear fruit in the short term as well as the long term.</p>
          <p>And finally, in our consumer group, we're clearly focused on remediation of our OTC business. That's been a very clear priority that we've set for the organization. And we're continuing to make strides. Although we realize that it does present challenges and that there are learnings along the way, we believe &#x2013; and what we've seen, frankly, is that when we do get product back on the shelf, the consumers demand it, and so we want &#x2013; and we will get the consent decree remediation completed. And we're very optimistic about the brands going forward. Particularly when you look at our skin care line, you look at our baby care line; overall, they're doing well &#x2013; our oral care line also.</p>
          <p>So we think that all of our segments of our business have good inline opportunities. We think there's exciting opportunities coming in each of their pipelines. But we also realize that given some of the changes in the market, that we're likely going to have to be even more disciplined, more selective and decisive going forward. And I think evidence of that is the decision that we made in the drug-eluting stent market that we alluded to earlier. We think that was the right call. And by the way, as Louise mentioned earlier, if you look at what we're doing with Biosense Webster right now and the progress that we're making, we're pleased with that. We're putting investments in other areas of our business. If you look at the investment with Synthes, there too we're very optimistic, based upon the work that we've seen through the integration so far. So that'd be my response to your question, Mike. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alex. Let me just do one quick follow-up with Dominic and maybe just to clarify a couple items. One, Dominic, you referenced in your comments, supply disruptions in certain of your MD&amp;D businesses; I don't think I caught that earlier in the prepared remarks, so could you just identify where those are occurring? And then second, Dominic, if we look at the operational EPS guidance, my numbers had, on the last call, your guidance for the year was $5.18 to $5.28 ex-currency, and today you said $5.25 to $5.32 ex-currency. Did I get that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mike, let me take the last one first. You're rightly right. Our previous ex-currency guidance was $5.18 to $5.28. We increased the guidance to $5.25 to $5.32. Two things have happened there. We've added Synthes, which we've described as $0.03 to $0.05, so obviously the upper end of the range is up about $0.04. And we tightened the range a little bit because, at this stage in the game, we feel more comfortable with our earnings for the balance of the year. With respect to supply disruptions, I'll ask Alex if he wants to add some additional comments. Two areas in particular; in our energy business, we've had some supply disruptions, and in our endovascular business with respect to endovascular stents.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Alex, I guess first for you; if you look at where Europe's heading, I think Europe, you were flat when you take out Synthes, roughly. It looks like it's a little worse than it's been. Where do we think we are today, and can you align the costs with some of the pressures you're seeing in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Matt. Matt, are you talking across the portfolio or in a specific segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the overall looks flat. I was wondering if any segments are being hurt more than others in Europe, broadly, as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Matt, your observation is right, that overall we're generally &#x2013; I think we're up about 1.5%. And, again, there's puts and takes across that. But what we're seeing is obviously some additional pressure with price as well as volumes, and price being regulated mostly to tendering in some of the contract things that we would see in our pharmaceutical group. What we're seeing is consistent with around 2011, with perhaps slightly more in southern Europe. If you look at MD&amp;D, we're also seeing pressures, some in price but some just in extended queues, longer wait times for certain procedures. And so we're watching it very closely. We have not seen a dramatic change over what we saw in 2011, but obviously, we still think that there are a lot of macroeconomic conditions and dynamics that may impact that going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And pharma, on the pricing side, has that also been more of an impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we're seeing some impact in pharma on the pricing side, mostly related to tenders and other austerity measures, but not to a significantly greater degree than what we have commented around 2011 so far this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks, Alex. And then, Dominic, one quick one for you; when you look at the operating margin leverage both this quarter and the back half, can you roughly say how much of that might be due to local currency and the lower costs from the FX as an offset to the top line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that one of the things to bear in mind is we typically hedge our foreign currency commitments out about 18 months, so our operations ex-translation are not significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency, Matt. So really what you're looking at is sort of a reasonably equal mix of changes in simply translating the top line and the expenses from the local currencies to the U.S. dollars, so I don't think there's a pronounced difference between those two factors.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dominic, could you help us bridge the current top-line guidance versus the prior? The prior was 4% to 5%. The current, I think, you said was 5.5% to 6.5%, and there were a lot of moving parts that you mentioned. But how much was the increase due to Synthes and some of the offsets? That's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Larry, let me just try to give you general order of magnitude on that. So the addition of Synthes &#x2013; and I think you have to bear in mind that with the Synthes impact I'm going to give you, there's two other factors to bear in mind &#x2013; the impact of the divestiture of the trauma business, and we've taken into consideration some disruption in the overall business as a result of the integration and planning, et cetera. So we've increased our guidance about 2.5 points or thereabouts for the net of all of that related to the Synthes integration and divestiture of trauma, et cetera. And we've decreased the guidance about &#x2013; a little more than one point &#x2013; maybe 1.2 points &#x2013; related to the supply disruptions we've talked about earlier and having a better estimate now on the resupply of products in the OTC business. So those two factors &#x2013; up 2.5, down 1.2 or thereabouts &#x2013; hopefully reconcile the change for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And then just two quick product questions; INCIVO was a little bit lighter than our expectations. Can you talk about what's happening in Europe there? And then just lastly, on CONCERTA, does your guidance assume that &#x2013; any change to generic competition in 2012? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Let me take the last question first. On CONCERTA, we have not assumed any change with respect to the current generic competition, so status quo there for this year. And with respect to INCIVO, I'll start by just commenting that we did see, as Louise mentioned in her script, a discussion that in fact we saw some seasonal adjustments in the rate of treatment patterns throughout Europe. And maybe I'll ask Alex to comment some more as we've been through with the team to understand what's happening there with INCIVO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks for the question, Larry. Overall, I'd say we're really pleased with the launch of INCIVO. As we look at it, starting, I believe, in about the fourth quarter of last year, its uptake in terms of share as well as with the volume has been very impressive, a lot of the volume obviously coming out of France and Germany. And so, overall, we're very pleased with it. We did see some deceleration of that as we went into the second quarter. Part of that we think is just due to the bolus of new urgent patients that you see in the larger markets when we got out there early in the year. Second, we think there's probably some seasonality related to it. So if we combine all that, we're still very confident in what we think the future prospects for that drug look like.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. And if I could get an update on the XARELO ACS regulatory process &#x2013; in other words, at this point, do you know what the FDA is looking for, and if you have any rough guidance on when you might be able to resubmit the NDA?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for the question, Ian. We're in ongoing dialogue right now with the agency. We remain very confident in our file. You're obviously familiar with some of the comments that were made at the review committee. We're working our way through those. And so, again, we think if we look at the overall dataset, we're confident that we're going to be able to work with the agency towards a positive resolution of that in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also if I could ask a quick follow-up on the OTC, can you &#x2013; and maybe this is better for Dominic. Can you give us some sense of when we should see the spending ramp related to the re-launches? Would it be late this year, or is most of that going to be felt in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a great question. As we said before, it's awfully difficult to predict the pace at which we'll ramp up, but we will obviously not be spending on the re-launch of those products until we're confident that the supply situation has stabilized and we can provide a consistent supply to the market. So I think we're going to monitor that and not get too far ahead of that, quite frankly, because we want to ensure that there's, first, a consistent supply of product, and then of course we'll invest significantly behind that once we achieve that. As we said before, we think the return of the products to the market will continue for the balance of 2012 and into 2013.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have a couple of questions. Alex, first, congratulations on your new appointment as CEO. In your prepared remarks, in committing the company to remaining a broad-based healthcare company, it sounds like you're coming out and rejecting some of the strategies that your peers such as Abbott and Pfizer have embraced and which the market has rewarded, so I'm wondering if you could comment on that. And then, secondly, I guess this question is for Dominic. On the pharmaceutical side, it looks like international revenues slowed sequentially quite a bit despite much easier year-over-year comps because of the Merck agreement plus, obviously, increased sales from ZYTIGA and INCIVO you didn't have a year ago. So maybe you could tie that with what you're seeing with the macro environment in Europe. I know Alex touched upon the environment being worse, but not dramatically worse than you had expected. But if you could parse out what you're seeing in terms of price declines, volumes &#x2013; you had mentioned tenders, but if you could be a little bit more specific in what you're seeing in terms of receivables. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jami. Thanks a lot for the question. And also, we always appreciate the challenge and some of the background and comments that you've written about. What I would say, and as you heard in my earlier comments, we do believe that based upon the evolving marketplace going forward, that our diversified portfolio gives us additional strengths and will help us achieve further growth. That being said, we think that there are components of that model that are going to need to be ramped up to make us even more competitive.</p>
          <p>So let me start with first the marketplaces. As we look at the marketplace going forward &#x2013; and particularly, for example, in the hospital space &#x2013; we believe there will be further consolidation, further aggregation of some of those customers, and as a result, we believe that they're going to be looking for more comprehensive offerings and greater solutions as well as outcomes versus just products. And in that case, when you have a very large portfolio, depth and breadth of scale, we think that that's going to be an important source of competitive advantage. And a good example of that may be with an ACO in the United States or, frankly, with some of the governments, particularly in emerging markets, where critical mass is particularly important and where we see a greater opportunity for growth.</p>
          <p>Next, we also think it's going to be important in terms of what we're actually offering. And if we look at products, we think a great opportunity for differentiation is going to be combining and bringing convergent products or offerings forward. So, in pharmaceuticals, that may relate to biomarkers and diagnostics along with some of our therapeutics. In MD&amp;D, that may relate to things like the Fibrin Pad or, frankly, things that we've done with our VICRYL Plus line, adding anti-infectives to other devices. And we think the scientific, the clinical, the regulatory, as well as the commercial differentiation that that provides is a real opportunity for us.</p>
          <p>That being said, we also realize that we're going to have to be likely more selective and more decisive in what areas where we're going to be and where we're not going to be. And so we're going, in fact, through a strategic planning process as we speak, and we are committed to making sure that we make those decisions and are putting our resources and our energy and our effort behind the areas that we think are going to drive the greatest growth opportunities for us going forward.</p>
          <p>So, Dominic, do you want to take the second part of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Yeah, Jami, in Europe, I have just a couple comments. I think our overall growth in the pharmaceutical business internationally did grow &#x2013; of course, second quarter versus first quarter sequentially &#x2013; but we did see some impacts. I think pricing has in fact being an impact. The tender process has been an impact. And in particular, what we saw in southern Europe, it's much, much more difficult in the new tenders to get any sort of price increase. In fact, they usually come with significant price decreases. So we've seen that in the low to &#x2013; low-single-digit rates. That seems to be just accelerating maybe a little bit, but not that pronounced. The real difference in the period is really just the timing of various tenders. One example is, with respect to VELCADE, the timing of the tender in Russia is such that you don't see much of an impact this quarter, and we'll get that impact as the tender gets approved in the future.</p>
          <p>With respect to receivables, I will tell you that it varies by different country. So we just look at southern Europe, our receivables continue to build in countries like Italy and a little bit in Greece. But in other countries, such as Spain, our receivables have significantly decreased. We recently received a very significant payment from the government of Spain. So what we're doing is working very closely with all the governments with respect to payment terms, et cetera, but overall our second quarter receivables and days sales outstanding at the end of the second quarter are much better in southern Europe than they were at the end of the first quarter.</p>

          <p>I had a question, first, returning to the topic of the portfolio, and it sounds like there's some potential for an accelerating pace of divestitures. I was just wondering if that's a reasonable expectation as you come out of the strategic review.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Rajeev, thank you. This is Alex. What I would say &#x2013; and we've been very clear about it with our management team &#x2013; is that our goal is to be very decisive about what businesses we're in and that we're not in. And we realize that when there are areas where, frankly, we don't think we're going to make the difference for patients or we're not as competitive as we should be, as we were in the drug-eluting stents, that we should divest &#x2013; or be out of those businesses and reallocate our resources elsewhere. And where we think there's a greater opportunity, a Synthes, that in those areas we think we should put additional resources and make the right investments to make us even more competitive. So we're going to be very disciplined. We're going to be also very decisive in how we're going to go forward, recognizing the dynamics in the healthcare marketplace.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And I did have one follow-up for Dominic just regarding the operating margin expansion, 100 to 150 basis points this year. Now, I think a lot of us were looking for accelerating growth next year, and I'm just wondering, as we think about the operating margin expansion this year, are there elements in there that we should think of as not coming back in 2013, just to help us kind of gauge where our expectations should be? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, Rajeev, I think one of the things to point out about the 100 to 150 basis points' expansion; it's what we called for at the beginning of the year, and despite the inclusion now in the guidance with the Synthes amortization expense, we still think we're going to achieve 100 to 150 basis points' expansion. So, obviously, the underlying business ex-Synthes is performing in a more efficient manner than even we thought at the beginning of the year. How that continues for the balance of 2012 and into 2013, I don't want to project into 2013 too much because obviously we want to make sure that we balance out the appropriate investments we want to make in the business as we go forward.</p>
          <p>The only thing I would say that's of any significant consequence in the current year and as we progress throughout the balance of 2012 and into 2013 is the remediation costs related to the consumer business are, in fact, higher than we thought this year, and hopefully, as we go through that process, they should then tail off as we move into 2013. But we'll see how the progress is, and we'll update you on that when we do the 2013 guidance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Wanted to start with a couple questions on the Synthes acquisition. Alex, I think that when you announced the deal over a year ago, you were talking about expectations for the trauma market growing 7%. And since then, it seems like the trauma market &#x2013; and at least Synthes sales in particular &#x2013; have slowed, so was wondering what your expectations moving forward now were for the trauma market and Synthes sales in particular. And then, secondly, maybe you could talk a little bit about how you'll be integrating the spine sales forces for Synthes and DePuy, given the direct and indirect distributor models that you have. And then lastly, maybe Dominic, what does your accretion guidance for Synthes assume in terms of synergies? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Derrick. You're right. If we go back to the announcement in the discussion that we had at the &#x2013; again, at the announcement of the Synthes deal, at that time, if you looked historically at the trauma market, I believe you saw historical growth rates that were very consistent in the 7%-plus range. If you look about over the last 18 months, we've seen that come down, probably reduced in about half, consistent with what we've seen in a lot of the other MD&amp;D markets. We think there's a number of factors that are driving that, and at this point, it's difficult to predict whether or not they are secular or cyclical.</p>
          <p>But some of them are the macroeconomic environment has had an impact, although is a bit lagging relative to some of the other markets such as general surgery and particularly in any kind of discretionary procedures. We also believe there's been some seasonality issues, but just as you look at overall macroeconomic ranging from construction to weather to a lot of other things that may be impacting it. As we project going forward, we think for likely the next couple of years, we're likely to see growth in the lower to mid-single-digits versus what we had seen previously, but we would expect that to return to more robust levels as the economy picks up. We're also seeing, obviously, stronger growth in the emerging markets, particularly in Asia-Pacific and some of the areas over there. So that gives you a little bit of background on what we think is going to happen overall with the trauma market.</p>
          <p>If we look at the integration with spine, first of all, we think the portfolios are very complementary, if you look at the two organizations coming together, and I've been very impressed with the work that our team &#x2013; Michel Orsinger, Gary Fischetti, and the rest of the team &#x2013; has done as we've worked our way through this integration. As we mentioned earlier, we're pleased that if you look at our senior leadership, we've been able to retain our top leaders. And while there's been some transition in the sales organization, overall, we're pleased with the performance that we've seen, and we expect to have a mix in our spine sales force of a direct as well as some distributors, and that's going to vary between the U.S. and outside the U.S. But, overall, again, we remain optimistic, and we think that the spine market is a good opportunity longer-term, but clearly it's come down and been impacted by some of the other events as well.</p>
          <p>But let me &#x2013; before I hand it to Dominic, let me just make one other statement regarding the overall Synthes integration. I think we're really pleased with what we've seen so far. The organizations have come together. They share a lot of the similar values. And again, if you look at our turnover, if you look at the core performance of some of our segments &#x2013; ranging from trauma, recon, sports medicine &#x2013; they were really solid in this quarter, and when you look at the leadership and the people that we've been able to maintain and keep on board through the transition. Obviously, we have lots of opportunities going forward to look at the synergies from our R&amp;D as well as our supply chain and other issues in the back end, but we think this represents a significant opportunity for us going forward as the world-leading orthopedics and neurologic company.</p>
          <p>With that, Dominic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Alex. Well, one of the things to mention, Derrick, about our guidance, which we gave as $0.03 to $0.05 in 2012 and $0.10 to $0.15 accretion in 2013, is that it's largely based on growth and not primarily based on expense synergies, right? There are some expense synergies in those numbers, but as we announced when we did the acquisition announcement early on, we said our primary focus here was going to be on growth of the businesses together, so on top-line synergies, and not so much of a focus on expense synergies. There will be some. I think it's important to note that the business is already a very profitable business that we're adding on to the Johnson &amp; Johnson business, and in fact their pre-tax operating margins, excluding this impact of amortization, were healthier than the overall Johnson &amp; Johnson pre-tax operating margins. So there'll be some. We've included those in the estimates that we gave you for 2012 and 2013. But I don't see them as the major driver of the accretion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>With the Synthes acquisition now completed, can you talk about, Alex, J&amp;J's strategy for use of cash over the next 12 to 24 months? Was the deal structured with the ASR to make it accretive to give you more flexibility on the acquisition front going forward, and if so, what healthcare assets would make the most strategic sense for J&amp;J?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Alex, let me take that on the overall use of cash. I think many of you have heard me discuss the answer to this question in the past. So just to reiterate, our primary focus is to generate sustainable long-term free cash flow generation in the business, which we're very proud of our ability to do that. And then we have prioritized and I think we will continue to prioritize our use of cash as, first, to dividends as a primary return to shareholders; secondly, an investment in value-creating acquisitions that enhance our ability to generate free cash flow in the future; and thirdly, any future returns to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. I don't think that the impact of the Synthes transaction changes our philosophy there in any significant way. We are also maintaining our AAA credit rating, which gives us enormous flexibility in our ability to fund our operations going forward or any particular investment we want to make.</p>
          <p>With respect to the accelerated share repurchase program, you're correct that that is a factor in providing immediate accretion as opposed to a longer-term accretion value. And it's basically a result of needing to have the shares necessary to complete the acquisition in a relatively short period of time. After the regulatory approvals were received, we needed to close in a couple days, obviously, and rather than issue shares and buy them back over extended period of times, we elected to do what many companies have done before us, to do an accelerated share repurchase program. And obviously we had the financial strength to be able to do that, so we're very pleased with that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Danielle, but what I would say is, look, we're always looking for areas where we think, first of all, there's a lot of unmet medical need. There could be a new technology, a new platform that just makes a big difference and that we think offers real growth opportunity. The other areas are where there's an obvious complement to maybe something that we already have. And we've got a number of examples of those &#x2013; some of the things where we've gone out in oncology; some of the recent things that we've done in other areas of our business represent those. And then sometimes it could be for vertical integration, where we want to be able to become more effective and more efficient about what we're doing. So those are some of the strategic drivers that we look at, but obviously it's always done in the context of what the competitive environment is and other dynamics. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions; first, on bapineuzumab, it's probably one of the most anticipated trial results of the year. I think most investors on the Street expect the primary endpoint to be missed, but let's assume that some of the secondary endpoints or some of the subgroup analysis is favorable. What does the company do at that point? Do you submit or do you go back and do another clinical trial? That's my first question. Then I had a follow-up for Alex as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Glenn. Thanks. I don't think it's really appropriate for us at this point to speculate on it. Louise went through in pretty good detail our thoughts about bapineuzumab in her comments and about where we are. So really, until we get a look at the data, it's difficult for us to speculate around it going forward. Obviously, Alzheimer's is an area that we remain very excited about when you just consider the sheer unmet need and the opportunity for patients as well as for our business that it represents.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just a second question on the hospital purchasing environment; your prepared comments, you said utilization was stable, but it appears that ObamaCare is here to stay, and this is going to add increased cost to hospitals. So, Alex, as you travel, what's your sense as you talk to hospital executives &#x2013; CEOs, CFOs &#x2013; on the CapEx side? Is this something that's going to slow here in the near term, or are we thinking about big-ticket items that may get pushed off as the implementation of healthcare reform goes forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's a good follow-up, Glenn. Overall, looks, obviously we think that there are going to be opportunities as well as challenges associated with healthcare reform and how it ultimately gets rolled out. Certainly, if we look at some of the data &#x2013; for example, in the first quarter of this year, what we have seen are hospital admissions up just about 2%. We saw some surgical procedures up around 4%. We saw lab procedures up at around 3%, ortho procedures up around 3%, offset with office visits actually down about 3%. And the only caveat, that's first quarter data. That's the most recent data that we have. And, frankly, we believe that the hospitals are going to be looking for ways to become more efficient and more effective across the board. And that's what we hear from our customers, and again, that's here in the United States as well as abroad.</p>
          <p>The offset, of course, in the United States is the increased volumes the hospitals will be getting from the newly covered patients that will be coming into the system under healthcare reform. But, clearly, we would expect there to be additional challenges in the pricing environment, and therefore all the more important &#x2013; to my earlier statements &#x2013; as we look at our portfolio, as we look at our capabilities, having a broad base, having offerings that go beyond the product, building on our relationships, building on our scale are going to be more and more important.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So a couple for Alex, and I appreciate the preamble and the reference to the credo and your long-term strategy. You mentioned emerging markets and sort of the breadth of products and technology that you can bring to those markets. I'm wondering how do you expect to match some of the economic parameters of these emerging economies with some of the advanced top-tier products and brands you deliver, really where some of your strengths are in developed markets, and maybe if you could put your recent China medical device acquisition, albeit small, into that strategic context. And I have one follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Matt, thanks a lot for the question. What I've seen, having just recently been over to Russia and made a number of visits over to China as well as to Brazil and some of the other emerging markets, is, most importantly, that the customer in those markets is the government. And what we've found is that the government is very interested, as they're building their healthcare systems in the developing markets, of not just replicating what's been done in the developed markets, but looking for ways to expand access and, frankly, also to expand and accelerate their access to some of the new technologies in a cost-effective way.</p>
          <p>And so what we're doing is, first of all, making sure that we're trying to work closely with them. And again, this is where I think our breadth and depth and our scale is very important as Johnson &amp; Johnson in those. And if you look at our share position in a lot of those emerging markets, it remains very strong and competitive. Second, it entails new offerings, and that's why we put R&amp;D centers in many of these locations and we continue to invest in them. We're pleased with the rollout of products such as absorbable suture, linear cutters, and staplers, that I would say are very high quality yet more appropriate for those particular markets, both in terms of their actual construction as well as their pricing model. And some of our other things that we're working on right now, again to take smart application of technology for those markets where we think there's a big opportunity.</p>
          <p>The other area that we're focusing on, frankly, is training and education, and in many of those areas, it's a case of trying to get more physicians trained on things like minimally-invasive surgery, on getting the right treatment paradigms for diabetes and cardiovascular procedures. So we're working closely &#x2013; again, in many cases, directly with the governments in China and Russia on extensive training programs to help them train their physicians. So that's why we think that there, again, is a significant opportunity.</p>
          <p>Related to our most recent acquisition in China, we're very excited about it. As we've stated on a number of occasions, we think our biosurgicals area is one of our most exciting in terms of new science and technologies that are really going to make a difference for patients as well as represent a significant growth opportunity for our business. And in China, we've been very limited in what we've been able to do so far, and with this most recent acquisition, it's going to give us a source of a porcine-based biologic that we'll be able to use there and roll out a significantly broader line of products to help patients and, again, grow our business. So we're very excited about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very helpful. And then the one follow-up is a subject that's kind of emerged over the past several years, developed market question, specifically for the U.S., given the more challenging pricing and regulatory environments in the U.S. You speak about innovation. We know that that's important for J&amp;J and for the industry. Particularly in medical technology and medical devices, though, maybe how should we think about what that means going forward? Are you placing longer-duration bets on earlier-stage technologies, or do the shorter-term opportunities become tougher, more pricing, more commoditized? Maybe help us understand what the path for innovations is for devices going forward in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. What I would say, Matt, it's going to take a combination. And it really starts with innovation, but different kinds of innovation. Now, in some areas, it's just going to mean better technology that, overall, delivers better results for patients. So some examples that I would have of that is what we're doing with Biosense Webster and the great progress that they've made with so many of their products in the treatment of A Fib. And just what you see is a huge difference for patients and for systems. We're also excited about a higher technology play in something like the Fibrin Pad, which we think can truly transform the way you treat moderate to severe bleeding interoperably and longer-term potentially for a trauma application. So areas like that we see technology still being very, very important.</p>
          <p>But we also think it's going to be important in how we relate with our customers. And what I'm talking about there is innovating with the way that we work with them, that we partner with them, that we truly leverage our overall portfolio in working together. And obviously it may include new services, new approaches, new partnerships with them in unique ways as they try to not only manage their increased patient volume, but also try to manage their costs going forward as well.</p>
          <p>And we also see an opportunity longer-term to take some of these simplified approaches, actually, that we would develop in developing markets and basically bring them back to developed markets. We're already seeing some signs of that with things that we're doing in the diabetes space and potentially some others. So we think even in the developed markets, people are going to be looking for very effective but lower-cost opportunities as well.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Good morning. So, Alex, just a quick question to follow up on some of the earlier ones on your perspective on utilization, and I know your comments were as of Q1, but I'm just curious, from your look at the Q2 results and what you're hearing from the field, is there anything different going on in the second quarter versus the first as far as you're concerned as it relates to surgical procedure volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we haven't seen significant changes. I've got to say we're encouraged by what we're seeing in orthopedics; if we look at overall worldwide joints against Q1, but as we look at the results, we saw Q1 results around 3%, hips up about 1.5%, knees up about 3%, spine down slightly, although I think a slight improvement on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So, again, we don't have second quarter. I think we're the first large orthopedics company coming out, so we're going to have to wait and see with everyone else. But that's our current view on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then a question on Synthes and in terms of some of the opportunities for you in the United States; I guess I'm curious as to how quickly you think you can benefit from the new scale that you have in orthopedics and how quickly we might see that translate into share gains, especially as it relates to some of the underperforming areas, like spine, which have been struggling below market for a couple of quarters. Just any thoughts on timing &#x2013; will this take a couple of years to really see the benefit, or can we see tangible share gain process in the near term, you think, as a result of your scale and ability to contract?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, thanks, Bob. And again, I would start by saying how pleased I am with the performance of the team so far through such a significant and large-scale integration. We're really excited by, again, what we've seen so far. As you know, when you do these kind of things, leadership is so important and critical to keeping consistency through this kind of a process. I think we've been able to do that. And obviously Michel and his entire team are looking at ways for how do we accelerate growth going forward. Obviously, likely the biggest short-term challenge is spine because you're bringing two organizations together. We were really pleased with the overall way we were able to work our way through the antitrust issues. We think we've got very complementary portfolios. And we're working our way through the integration with direct sales as well as some of our distributor sales as we speak.</p>
          <p>And we're going to do everything that we can to accelerate it, but we also realize that, look, this is a multi-year process, and our first focus is with the customer. We want to make sure that our customer doesn't experience any disruption and, in fact, sees a net benefit to what we're doing. And so we're working hard both with our sales forces as well as with our contracting organizations.</p>
          <p>Our second major area is our R&amp;D prioritization and making sure that we're prioritizing the portfolios, looking for areas where there may be synergies across the different organizations, particularly in places like ENT or maxillofacial, or even in the areas such as biosurgicals and some of the things that we're doing here, so we think that there's a real &#x2013; or biologics, excuse me &#x2013; there's a real opportunity. And then, third, it's the area of how can we integrate our back ends to also make it very seamless, very efficient, and very effective. And so, again, we see it as really being prioritized in that order as we roll out over the next couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what kind of disruption are you assuming on the dis-synergies of sales related to the integration within spine? Is that in the $30 million to $50 million range, Dominic? I think you mentioned that it was part of the equation on guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I won't be able to give you an exact number in that regard, although we did consider that in providing the guidance for both this year and the estimates we gave you in advance for next year. So we do think there'll be some disruption as we convert and combine those two businesses together, but I won't be able to give you specifics, Bob, on that.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit further on just kind of the orthopedic trends that you saw in the quarter. It sounds like you guys are looking at the market as being improved from 1Q to 2Q. I just want to make sure I understand your comments weren't just looking backwards at 1Q data. And then maybe just comment on the price and mix of orthopedics and whether the strength is coming from maybe improved price and mix as well as volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me just take a couple of parts of your question. The first thing that I would say is, as we look overall at orthopedic trends &#x2013; again, it's difficult because we're the first company out, but if we look at the trends from Q1 combined with our sales results from Q2, I would say that we are slightly encouraged by what we're seeing, and we're obviously going to be watching it very closely. We're not seeing the growth that we saw several years ago in what I'd call pre-recession times. And I'm particularly pleased with the performance of the DePuy reconstruction group &#x2013; now the DePuy Synthes reconstruction group &#x2013; through this period, and I think that's been the result of not only just really good execution through this integration process, but also the rollout of new products in both our hip and knee areas. So I think that was important.</p>
          <p>If we look at spine, we see some progress quarter to quarter. There's still significant pricing pressure in spine and other market dynamics, but again, longer-term, we see that as being an opportunity. But if I look specifically at our hip business, what we saw overall was total price change of about down 4%, mix up about 0.5%, so a hip price mix change of about minus 3.4% for the quarter. And if we'd look at knees, if you look at product mix, up around 2%, up about 1% on knee price and mix change; and hip &#x2013; so the overall for hip and knee, we saw mix change of about minus 1%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. And then anything that you're seeing just across the broader medical device businesses in terms of pricing, or do you have any concerns, I guess, going forward in light of the continued pressure in Europe that things may get more challenging on the price front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we do expect there to be continued pricing pressure. As Dominic mentioned earlier, you see some of that, particularly in southern Europe. We still have other tenderings in Europe. We're seeing that in some of the U.S. markets, particularly those that might be things like diabetes, based upon some of the contracting. As well as spine, we're seeing more. In other areas, it's been pretty consistent with what we've seen in earlier trends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. And then one last one on the OTC business; I know, Dominic, you had mentioned that you had updated sales and I guess on the earnings side just for some changes in OTC. And am I correct in just assuming that things relative to kind of last quarter are just taking a little bit longer, and it sounds like you're pushing off some of the expenses related to the launch maybe further out and potentially into 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, just to clarify, so we did update our guidance now that we &#x2013; on sales, now that we have a full half-year already in and we have a pretty good idea of what it's going to take to comply with the consent decree for the balance of the year, so we took that into consideration in the sales guidance that I gave you. And we still think that the products will still be rolling out in 2012 and through 2013, as we said before. Just to clarify, though, we did not change our earnings guidance with respect to OTC at all, right? We maintained our earnings guidance with respect to the base business, despite some changes in sales, and increased our earnings guidance as a result of the accretion related to Synthes. So the impact of OTC is something we're just going to have to manage and we are managing in the business.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good morning. Alex, you commented with respect to remediation, and I realize it's a focus of that particular unit in consumer, but the question is, you made some statements about learnings since the consent decree was actually signed. Could you comment on what one or two of those learnings have been? And then I often note that there is a strain between the FDA and a company under a consent decree, or there can be. Sometimes senior management needs to get directly involved and interface directly with the FDA. Have you found the need to do that at this point, or do you think that people within the division are able to actually handle that process? And I have one follow-up. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tony, thanks a lot for your question. And let me start with the second half of that first, and then I'll go back to the first part. First of all, we feel very good about our overall relationship with the FDA, and it's one that we take very seriously, that we work on building in an appropriate way with a lot of open dialogue. And we think it's critically important that at the most senior levels of the organization, that we demonstrate a commitment and are clearly aligned around our goals and our plans going forward. And so it absolutely involves people at the most senior level of the organization, including myself. So that's a real priority for us, and again, we see the FDA as a very important partner, not only in this area of our business, but really in all areas of our business where, ultimately, we're attempting to get products to patients or to patients in a timely and well-considered manner.</p>
          <p>I think the other aspect when you talk about learnings as you're going through it, a couple of thoughts, Tony. First of all, while we agreed to the consent decree about a year ago, the actual submission of the consent decree didn't go in till like Q3 of last year. And so you continue to work with the agency on all the specific steps as we worked our way through the agreement process and getting aligned. That's one aspect. The second is we are working with an outside party, Quantic, that is working with us, verifying, validating different procedures. So that's also a learning process as they come on board, ensuring that we're fulfilling all the commitments that we've made along the way.</p>
          <p>I'd say the third significant learning for us is getting the right balance between our consent decree requirements, resources, and commitments, and then also producing product and getting it to the marketplace. Our customers, in working with them, are clearly interested in getting a consistent and reliable supply. We're very encouraged that when we have got product back on the shelf, that we've seen a very solid demand on the part of customers. But that's something as well that we're working, again, very deliberately on and that we will make sure we want to get it right having that balance going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for that color, and then a smaller more modest question. While consumer operationally was up sequentially modestly, wound care struck me as being down. And while Q1, it was actually up year-over-year due to new products, I'm curious what may have occurred in Q2 to drive wound care in a different direction. Thanks very much for your time.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Tony, we have seen some competitive pressure, and I know that in one case, we decided not to go ahead with a contract on some of our first aid kits, but overall, we think we remained fairly competitive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, David</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Alex, I wanted to come back to your short-term priorities and your long-term priorities. McNeil, obviously, was your significant first short-term priority, and global was your second long-term priority. And I guess in most of the comments today, there's a great focus on McNeil, but if I sort of go with the inner section of those two comments, it seems like if you take your broader kind of holistic consumer business, emerging markets for consumer seems that it should be a much greater priority for the total business and a much bigger potential growth impactor than McNeil. Can you just talk about how you see your emerging market consumer franchise versus your peers, and steps you can take to perhaps accelerate growth there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks a lot for the question, David. No, you're absolutely right. The emerging market growth in our consumer business is a top priority for us, and we've been focused there for a number of years. If you look at, for example, the acquisition that we did with Dabao several years ago, we see a tremendous opportunity. We're seeing very strong performance as of late, particularly in Brazil. China, we've dealt with a few other issues, but we're very confident in our long-term positioning there. And we've also made some changes in our approach in Russia as well. So we do see that as a major growth opportunity. That being said, our over-the-counter business, particularly domestically, as well as internationally, is significant, and so we know that that's a major priority for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just, Dominic, one quick clarification; I know you were very specific on the change in underlying operational guidance on the revenue side and the factors, but if I think about the absolute change that implies for the back half of the year, it seems large relative to the size of the divisions like OTC and energy you mentioned. Is there anything else that's a big driver of that relative change other than OTC or energy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that it's primarily OTC for the change in guidance, and to a lesser extent the impact of energy, and as we mentioned earlier, the supply constraints in the endovascular business. But I'd say, of that total, it's primarily the OTC change when I compare the current guidance with the previous guidance.</p>
