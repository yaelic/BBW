        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you. Well, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today in Grupo M&#xE9;xico's third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are several directors and executives of our company.</p>
          <p>On today's conference call, I will first briefly comment on the economic environment of this quarter and the main issues impacting the company's profitability. Then, I'll comment on our mining division, we'll go to the results, and explain the financial results of our transportation division.</p>
          <p>Today, capital markets certainly reflect global economic concerns. And despite high volatility, copper prices improved toward the end of the quarter doing a high of $3.82 per pound.</p>
          <p>The key takeaways during here in quarter were China remains the most important driver of commodity. The announcement of a new Chinese infrastructure spending plan was made, which included plans to incentivize home appliances purchases. The spending plan sends a clear signal that the Chinese government wants to see more economic growth, taking real actions to arrest the slowdown.</p>
          <p>Although slow performance in the Eurozone remain, the European Union have made some concrete and well-received decisions like starting their bond purchase program, giving some positive impact to the market.</p>
          <p>The announcement of Ben Bernanke where the Federal Reserve inject $40 billion into the U.S. economy per month, the assisting programs will continue until labor markets improve.</p>
          <p>These factors resulted in an increased demand for copper, although we believe the impact of those measures will not be fully served until next year.</p>
          <p>Another key reason supporting copper prices is the lack of available stocks. Inventories have dropped globally. Even in Europe, copper markets have remained relatively tight. Global inventory touched a new low this quarter, representing a decrease of 34% over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we continue to see positive signs from our customers. Three weeks ago, we closed our annual sales conference and I'm happy to report that our contracts in Europe, Mexico and the U.S. have not seen any relevant changes. In fact, we sold higher volumes of copper rod for 2013, which means an increase premium for the company.</p>
          <p>We believe the fundamentals in our industry will remain strong in the medium to long term have we continue the purchases, pressures on supply from labor unrest, availability of equipment and qualified personnel, bad weather, environmental permits, escalating costs, cancelation and delays of new projects, among other things.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to Grupo M&#xE9;xico financial highlight, I'm happy to tell you that although there's little we can do about volatility in prices, I'm happy to say that we've managed to deliver another strong set of production results. At the close of September, we are reporting consolidated revenues of nearly $7.7 billion, 3% lower than the same period of 2011. The major impact came from the sharp fall in commodity prices.</p>
          <p>We were able to achieve these revenues, I mean despite copper dropping 14%, molybdenum dropping 18%, zinc 15% and silver 15%. This was partially mitigated by higher mining production in most of our units.</p>
          <p>Despite significant drop in copper production globally, during the first nine months of the year, our copper sales increased 9% year-over-year. This increase had been driven by greater production; increased production of copper by 8%, silver 15%, and gold 14%. We also improved our grades substantially and we had better recovery.</p>
          <p>Production of byproducts had also increased substantially. Gold increased to 32%, silver 7%, and molybdenum 2%. We continue to efficiently manage cost inflation through disciplined cost reduction. As you may now, the mining industry is facing a long-term trend of declining ore grade. This means that more ore needs to be treated to produce the same amount of copper with consequently higher cost requirements.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales for the third quarter was $1.2 billion, an 8% decrease year-over-year. This reduction was achieved due to improved productivity and operating efficiencies with the completion of the Buenavista refurbishment in the mining division and operating efficiencies in our transportation division. We are committed to maintaining and achieving more cost efficiencies. We will continue our efforts of further reducing costs, improve productivity and maintain consumption and expense discipline to ensure that our cost base continues to be well-controlled.</p>
          <p>EBITDA for the first nine months before non-recurrent expenses was $3.8 billion, equivalent to 50% of sales. Now, considering the effect of the unprecedented award paid to the attorneys as ordered by the Chancery Court of Delaware, the EBITDA was $3.5 billion, which is equivalent to 46% of sales.</p>
          <p>Net income accumulated in the first nine months before non-recurrent expenses would have been $1.9 billion, which represented 25% of sales. But again, considering the effect of the amount paid to the attorneys, the cumulative net earnings were $1.7 billion with a margin on sales of 22%.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure to September reached a record of $1.5 billion, a 104% increase year-over-year. With this commitment to our investments, we are sending a clear message that even in an uncertain and volatile environment, our strategy is clear and unchanged; that we continue with our five-year expansion plan that we are presuming.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, $311 million was invested in the mining division, an 81% increase year-over-year and mainly was invested in our Buenavista project, the expansion of the mine that we call Cananea. We have great quality mining assets with a lot of potential growth, and we expect Buenavista &#x2013; that will continue to be an important local source of copper production to our growth.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures in our transportation division amounted $152 million, allocated mainly to increasing the useful life of the locomotives and to track infrastructure. Our transportation division had performed well in the face of the usual adverse conditions, which I will comment further in more detail.</p>
          <p>The last year's record capital expenditures are clearly reflecting cost reductions from increases in average speed and improvements in fuel consumption efficiency. To-date, 89% of the total $636 million budget has been invested in our infrastructure division. As I've highlighted, these projects are very competitive from an operating and capital cost standpoint, with commitments of achieving long-term returns to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>The total consolidated debt as of the end of September amounted to $3.9 billion. With the cash balance of $2.8 billion, the company's net debt stands at $1 million. Despite the significant amount that we contributed to selling copper on October 9, and which we took from a financing, Grupo M&#xE9;xico maintains a solid balance with a low leverage. The total debt-to-EBITDA ratio is less than 0.9 times, well below the industry average of 1.4 times.</p>
          <p>You can see that our board feels important to maintain flexibility to have a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. Our first priority for the use of our cash flow is to increase shareholder value by investing in high-quality growth and maintain prudent preservation for our cash in volatile times.</p>
          <p>With respect to dividends, on July 27, we paid a dividend payment of MXN 0.40 per share outstanding, which was equivalent to $228 million. For the third quarter 2012, the company's board approved a quarterly dividend payment of MXN 0.26 per share outstanding, which will be paid in cash on November 7 and represents a disbursement of approximately $156 million. Our current dividend yield is very attractive, and the board will continue to review financial policy on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to Americas Mining, I will now discuss the main financial highlights which comprises of Southern Copper and Asarco. I'm proud to announce that Americas Mining has performed strong during the first nine months. The mining division had managed to significantly increase its production of copper and byproducts, <mark type="ph" /> down minimizing (09:47) the effect of lower metal prices.</p>
          <p>AMC's accumulated mine copper production increased 9% to 614,678 tons of copper, compared to 563,000 tons over the previous year. This increase is due to greater production of Cuajone, Buenavista mines, which increased production 21% and 19%, respectively, as a result of improved ore grades and recovery.</p>
          <p>Asarco's mine copper production in the third quarter 2012 increased 6% compared to the second quarter 2012. This increase was mainly due to more production because of higher ore grade upgrade.</p>
          <p>Molybdenum resulted in a 7% decrease, mainly due to lower production at Toquepala, partially compensated by increased production at La Caridad and Cuajone. This was a result of improved ore grades and recovery.</p>
          <p>Our expansion projects are progressing favorably, and we keep on with our plan to increasing capacity from 800,000 tons of copper per year to 1.4 million tons by 2016.</p>
          <p>I'll give you an update on our project, of Asarco, mainly, as we had Southern Copper's conference call earlier today. The project with Mission in Asarco will expand the concentrator with two new mills, which will increase annual copper production by 10,000 tons of copper. $33 million of the total $60 million have been spent to-date. This reported a 34% completion and expected to start operations in the second quarter 2013.</p>
          <p>In addition, we're about to complete the engineering for our refurbishment and re-opening of our molybdenum plant at Mission. This will have a production capacity of 544 tons of molybdenum. This plant is expected to start operations in the first quarter of 2013.</p>
          <p>Operating cash cost per pound of copper, net of byproduct, was $0.94 per pound of copper, compared to $0.77 per pound of copper in a year-over-year basis. This increase is explained mainly by increased copper production and, therefore, lower relative contribution from our byproducts, lower prices of the principal metals like silver, molybdenum and zinc. However, the operating cash cost per pound of copper excluding byproducts was $1.90 compared to $1.88 year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Costs were reduced 8% during the third quarter 2012 compared to the third quarter 2011 as a result of a decrease in purchase of minerals from third parties, savings in power and water. Our cash cost remains the lowest quartile of the cost curve. This reaffirms our position of the company as one of the lowest cost copper producers in the industry.</p>
          <p>I would like to turn to our mining &#x2013; I'm sorry, our transportation division, I mean. I would like to start reporting that despite the operation had been negatively affected by several external factors in 2012, such as the avian flu, droughts in the U.S. and Mexico, peso depreciation <mark type="indiscernible" />  (13:01), the results posted by the transportation division are very positive.</p>
          <p>Even the volumes transported remain constant, EBITDA grew 20%. This has been the result of operating improvements gained from strong previous investments, which have translated into among other things, a 20% increase in speed and improved fuel performance, together with greater availability of locomotives.</p>
          <p>In terms of load volume, as of September this year &#x2013; and we, as you know, we measure them in net tons-kilometer, they were 39 billion. It was basically in line with 2011. As stated before, this was achieved in spite of the extraordinary events mentioned.</p>
          <p>These have mainly affected the agricultural, by far, are most important, with a decrease of 0.8% in tons-kilometer. But it was compensated with a 7.9% increase in the energy segment as a result of strong fuel oil shipments and a new contract with Pemex to move additional fuel oil from its refinery in Tula, Hidalgo to its warehouse in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz.</p>
          <p>In terms of cars transported, the total was 826,000 or a 2.8% increase year-over-year. As most of you know, this is the way the U.S. railroads measure their loads.</p>
          <p>Net sales reached, as of September, $1.25 billion, 1% better than the $1.24 billion in 2011. This revenue level was achieved despite a 10% currency depreciation against the U.S. dollars, which went from MXN 12 to MXN 13.24 pesos per dollar.</p>
          <p>The operating cost had been the key to a strong profitability improvement. Specifically, the third quarter cost decreased by 14%. For the first nine months through September, it was a decrease of 7%. This has been the result of the significant capital investments in previous years in cracking construction, increased capacity, new locomotive which have all resulted in better consumption of fuel, and more locomotive availability and a much lower expense in car hire.</p>
          <p>It should highlight that we have successfully managed to keep operating cost controlled in spite of an 11% increase on diesel prices. The improved efficiencies in operations translate into a significant recovery of the operating margin from 20% in 2011 to 26% the same period 2012.</p>
          <p>EBITDA for the third quarter of 2012 was $136 million, 17% over the $116 million a year ago. EBITDA accumulated was $422 million, an increase of 20% year-over-year. EBITDA margin for the year reached 33.6%, improving by 5.3 percentage point.</p>
          <p>The transportation division has invested $152 million so far this year in capital expenditures, mainly in track infrastructure, construction from new sightings and improved safety. An important investment during the third quarter was the track rehabilitation between the border city of Nogales and the port of Guaymas that allowed a start of new mineral ore traffic originating in Arizona.</p>
          <p>With this, we'll conclude our comments to the earnings results. Operator, could you please open the session for Q&amp;A?</p>

          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Felipe Hirai from Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon, good day, everyone. I have two questions. The first one is related to the Delaware case. Do you think there is any way that you can reverse the decision, or is this already something that there is no turning back?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to the infrastructures side of your business. Could you just give us some guidance on how much do you think they could be impacting this segment over the next few years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, sure. Thank you, Felipe. Well, unfortunately, I mean, the decision of the Chancery Court of Delaware was confirmed by the Supreme Court, as you may know. When you appeal this kind of decision, the case is not re-opened, Felipe. Really, it's just &#x2013; the appeals are just for a particular technical issue that you can go to the Supreme Court and appeal on. So the appeal, it was &#x2013; I mean the decision was confirmed, so we don't have an additional <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:07). So that's why we've decided to take a financing, comply with the judgment and put this behind us as we want to kind of close <mark type="ph" /> some funds (18:18) and start, I mean, doing what we know what to do, which is mine, man a few railroad and invest, I mean, modestly and very cautiously in our infrastructure division.</p>
          <p>The second question was regarding the infrastructure, and I've &#x2013; I mean what I've given was the CapEx to-date and this year. This has been an important year on investments as the power plants, mainly, have really move forward, and so the budget for the year is $636 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Santiago Perez Teuffer from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, how are you, Daniel and the team? Thanks for your time. And my first question is regarding the rail division. There have been certain information about a very ambitious CapEx plan for the following, say, five years. I wanted to ask you if it had been approved by the board. And if it has, could this be a further incentive to float part of this company to the market?</p>
          <p>And my second question is regarding auto infrastructure <mark type="ph" /> range (19:30). Can you give us some color as to what EBITDA contribution this branch made on this quarter, and also what IRR and/or EBITDA could we expect from the modular equipment for Pemex to have in the future? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Santiago. Well, first of all, regarding the five-year plan, as you know, we do have a very aggressive five-year plan, but we are working on it. We discussed it at the board. As you know, the Ferromex board, we have Union Pacific as our partner, and on ITM's board, we have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:03).</p>
          <p>There was a plan still under development. We are still analyzing and, hence, that's why we have not disclosed this plan as we did in the mining division. So that's full-force there.</p>
          <p>In terms of the infrastructure divisions, yes, you're right. We are planning on acquiring the modular. As we've set out in our press release, I mean, with this, also IRR in these businesses we're targeting are above 20%. That's pretty much our threshold or our quota &#x2013; thresholds depending on the business. And the virtue of this is that Pemex's contracts are longer than the ones that we currently have at <mark type="ph" /> our jackups that were (20:50) defined the contract last year. And I don't know if there was another question.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to ask you about the potential savings on the restructuring of the debt that you announced for American Mining Corporation. How significant this is and if you have any other plans to reduce that going forward? And then, if you can again comment a little bit on the potential listing of the railway business? What are the steps that we can expect going forward, and what are the thresholds that you need to overcome to make this possible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carlos. Well, first of all, well, I mean, the financing as you recall when we reacquired Asarco or took it out of Chapter 11 in 2009, and we took a $1.5 billion financing at the Americas Mining Company level. The debt was not pre-payable for a tranche, and that tranche we prepaid now, in December, which was &#x2013; I mean it was a peso-denominated facility but it was $450 million. That had a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:18) close to 4.25% spread, and the facility that we currently negotiating was a spread of 1.35% of spread against one-month LIBOR. And that was fully pre-payable and it was a <mark type="ph" /> 2.1 (22:39) facility. So that really how we come up with the savings that you're referring to. And, of course this is, I mean, very flexible and that's what we have at Americas Mining Company level.</p>
          <p>The question regarding the IPO, I think we still don't have any news regarding that. As you know, we've been discussing all strategic alternatives with our partners &#x2013; I mean with both of our partners. And we don't have an update, really, to give to the market at this point.  And I don't know if you had a third question, Carlos, I'm sorry.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening. My question is, are you going to reduce there in the P&amp;L $2 billion you lost in the trial? And what margins do you have for IBM in 2012, and how do you think they will be for the next quarters? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, thank you for the question. I think it's important for me to stress what Southern Copper stressed earlier today, is that the $2.1 billion is a contribution to Southern Copper. It's a capital contribution from Americas Mining to Southern Copper; hence, it goes directly to capital, to the capital part of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The only part that affected our numbers was that $316 million that went to the lawyers, to the plaintiff lawyers as ordered by the court. So that is what's reflected in our EBITDA and in our net income. But the $2.1 billion is not reflected anywhere else. It's just a capital contribution. It has no tax impact, nor accounting impact apart from a capital increase.</p>
          <p>And then, just going back to your question, the margins of ITM are 33%. That's the EBITDA margin.</p>

          <p>Hi, thank you very much. Excuse me, what was your guidance for CapEx in 2012 and 2013?</p>

          <p>Yes, did you say 2012, Ulises? It's &#x2013; Grupo M&#xE9;xico's CapEx is $2.6 billion. We were looking today that in Southern Copper, we are &#x2013; I mean, obviously, we're nine months down the road and we haven't been able to spend as &#x2013; I mean, as fast as we thought. Although we are putting a lot of orders and we've been doing a lot of work, as you saw in our earnings releases. We might just &#x2013; the $1.5 billion that we have, our Southern Copper team today mentioned that it might be $1 billion only for the year. So that is $2.1 billion for the group, that's our estimate at this point for 2012.</p>

          <p>Hi, Daniel. I just have a couple of questions on Grupo M&#xE9;xico. The first one is on the production you're expecting for next year. I'm sorry if you already mentioned it, I missed a part of the conference call. But I think that Southern Copper this morning, <mark type="ph" /> revised upward (27:42) the estimate for 2013. So I just want to know what could be the impact for Grupo M&#xE9;xico.</p>
          <p>The other question is on dividend. I know that you're deciding at the end of each quarter what the dividend would be for the next. But just to know if the payment of that and the payments &#x2013; dividend payments we'd be receiving from Southern Copper will have an impact on your dividend for Grupo M&#xE9;xico?</p>
          <p>And the last question is, following the settlement of the Delaware case with Southern Copper minority, if you can reactivate the merger between Asarco and Southern Copper? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, John. I mean, we have Raul Jacob on the line from Southern Copper, and he earlier today gave a couple of guidance for 2013. Raul, do you want to mention that to John, and I'll take the rest of the questions, please?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Yes. On production for this year, we are fulfilling our initial guidance for the year. That was 640,000 tons. However, we have been increasing the participation of our own copper in this figure for 2012. Currently, we're expecting to have 2.5% of that total amount on third-parties' copper and the rest will be our own copper &#x2013; copper from our own operations.</p>
          <p>For 2013, we are &#x2013; at this point, our plans are indicating that we will produce about 670,000 tons, including third-parties' copper in it. That number is under review and will be confirmed or changed at the first conference call of 2013.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And, John, I'll just take the dividend and the Southern Copper-Asarco merger question.</p>
          <p>First of all, on the dividend, I mean, to be honest, I mean this was an extraordinary dividend given the capital increase, I mean the disruption of our capital structure that that created. It was certainly unexpected, as we thought the Supreme Court of Delaware was going to reverse the decision of the Chancery Court, or at least we expected or hoped.</p>
          <p>So this was an extraordinary dividend. I think we'll come back to our normal dividend track record, if you will. As you know, we don't have a dividend policy written in stone. However, we do have a track record and so that has been in the late couple of years kind of like between 70% to 40% of net income of Southern Copper.</p>
          <p>As you know, in the past, it has been 100%, but just depends on the capital needs going forward and the volatility in copper prices and how much visibility our board have for copper prices going forward. And as you know, this has been volatile times.</p>
          <p>And the third, I mean, as you know, from a Grupo M&#xE9;xico perspective, we have proposed to Southern Copper that Asarco and Southern Copper merged back &#x2013; I mean last year, and we cancelled that transaction basically because of the decision of the Chancery Court. I think it creates a lot of uncertainty.</p>
          <p>So we are in the process of analyzing all the alternatives strategically that the Grupo M&#xE9;xico has in order to take advantage of both of its copper-producing companies and the synergies that both companies can generate. So &#x2013; but still, nothing to report now, but thanks for your questions.</p>
