        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our 90th quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, Senior Director, Analyst and Investor Relations; and I'm joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, Executive Vice President of Worldwide Operations; and Gary Moore, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.</p>
          <p>The Q4 fiscal year 2012 press release is on U.S. High-Tech Marketwire and on the Cisco website along with the corresponding webcast with slides. Additionally, downloadable Q4 and full fiscal year 2012 financial statements will be available following the call in the investor relations section of our website including revenue and gross margin by geographic segment as well as revenue by product category. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets and cash flow statements can also be found on our website in the investor relations section. Click on the financial reporting section of the website to access the webcast slides and these documents.</p>
          <p>Throughout this conference call we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The financial results in the press release are unaudited. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our forms filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.</p>
          <p>I will now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter.</p>

          <p>Mel, thank you very much.</p>
          <p>As we close fiscal year 2012, I am pleased to discuss our strong performance, continued execution on our plan to deliver profitable growth and commitment to our shareholders. For the full fiscal year we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 14% year-over-year and revenue growth of 7%, a record year in terms of earnings per share and revenue. For Q4, we delivered our non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 18% on revenue growth of 4%, also a record quarter in terms of revenue.</p>
          <p>Our strategy, delivering intelligent networks and technology architectures built on integrated products, services and software platforms to fuel our customer's business, is proving the right long-term strategy for our success; and you're seeing it in our results. The success of our Service Provider business where we've moved from an individual product provider to today's &#x2013; in today's market where many of our customers view Cisco as their best strategic partner in meeting their top business and technology objectives. It is a clear example of our strategy playing out to our advantage.</p>
          <p>Our role as the official network infrastructure supporter for the London Olympics and Paralympics is another example of our ability to strategically partner, in this case with the British government, the London Organizing Committee of the games, NBC and BT and to do this, we drove incredible outcomes and experiences.</p>
          <p>From a technology perspective which obviously excites especially our engineering team but me as well, the 1,800 Wi-Fi hotspots in the 34 venues and over 80,000 data connections that we provided had a capacity four times larger than the network infrastructure of any previous games and helped connect 10,000 &#x2013; I'm sorry, 10 million spectators, 76,000 volunteers, 22,000 athletes and coaches, enabling an experience in ways before never thought possible.</p>
          <p>All of this was done reliably and in a highly secure manner in front of a worldwide TV audience of over 4.2 billion. NBC used Cisco's software capabilities and infrastructure to support all the web content, live streaming. The equivalent of 7.5 months of 24x7 broadcast across 6 channels. Many viewers paused live TV while switching between TV, tablets and smartphones. It was a complex challenge but is exactly the type of challenge that Cisco is uniquely positioned to handle. And we executed remarkably well, not just again on the technology objectives but on the business objectives of our partners. Congratulations to the Cisco team and our partners for a job done very well.</p>
          <p>There's no question our industry and our world is evolving and at a lightning pace. The network is squarely at the center of the major market transitions, cloud, mobile, visual, virtual and social. And our innovation engine continues to fuel our growth, our customer success, and our industry leadership. Our disciplined focus on our operating model and our company's ongoing evolution enable us to continue to deliver record customer and partner satisfaction levels and drive leverage in our financial model.</p>
          <p>As we move into FY 2013, our focus on profitable growth continues and we will remain committed to driving shareholder value. To provide some important updates along with our FY 2012 and Q4 results, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank. I will then walk through what we're seeing in the business and where we're focusing going forward. Frank will detail our guidance and then we'll wrap up with my favorite part, the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Frank, on to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John, and good afternoon to everyone.</p>
          <p>For the full 2012 fiscal year, we grew profits faster than revenue as we had committed to do with our operating model of disciplined decision-making, sound portfolio management, strong operational execution, and a focus on driving profitable growth. Through these efforts, we have improved our operating margin leverage increasing our value proposition to shareholders. In my section, all results will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated.</p>
          <p>Starting with the fiscal year performance, for the full year 2012 fiscal year, total revenue was $46.1 billion, an increase of 7%. Non-GAAP net income was $10.0 billion, up 11%. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis were $1.85, which grew 14%. GAAP net income was $8 billion or $1.49 per share on a fully diluted basis representing increases of 24% and 27% respectively. We generated strong free cash flows meaning cash flow from operations activity less capital expenditures during FY 2012 of $10.4 billion, increasing 16%.</p>
          <p>Given the stabilization we've seen in our business and our confidence going forward, along with the ongoing commitment to returning cash to our shareholders, I am pleased to announce that we are increasing our quarterly dividend for Q1 FY 2013 by 75% to $0.14 per share which represents a 3.2% yield on today's share price.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we intend through our capital allocation strategy to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually through dividends and share repurchases while providing sufficient financial flexibility to effectively invest in the business and strategic opportunities.</p>
          <p>To provide some additional detail on revenue and profitability for certain product areas for the full fiscal year, starting with Switching, Switching revenue was up 3%, in particular we are pleased to see stability in our Switching gross margins. As an example of what we are achieving with our newer products as they ramp, we've seen the gross margin levels with our Nexus 7000 improve approximately ten points over the past eight quarters.</p>
          <p>Routing revenue grew 2%, the transition to our new platforms is going very well with the market shift from wireless &#x2013; from wireline to wireless providing us with a true competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>Collaboration revenue was up 3%. FY 2012 was a year of transition from a go-to-market perspective with increasing SaaS and software-based offerings, which now represent approximately 50% of our overall collaboration business.</p>
          <p>Wireless had a very strong year with revenue up 19% with continued wireless LAN upgrades and deployments driving strong growth. Security revenue was up 12%, reflecting the growing requirements of security in cloud as well as BYOD deployment. And our data center business had strong growth with revenues up 87%. We continue to execute on our data center strategy by staying on top of innovation as well as delivering a converged architectural approach for our customers to meet their networking as well as their computing requirements.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to our Q4 results, we had a solid quarter. Total revenue in Q4 was $11.7 billion, up 4%. Total product revenue was $9.2 billion, up approximately 3% and services revenue was $2.5 billion, up approximately 12%.</p>
          <p>Total revenue from a geographic perspective grew 7% for Americas, 9% for APJC and decreased 5% for EMEA. The decrease in EMEA was driven by a decrease in product revenue consistent with the macroeconomic related weakness that we've seen in product orders over the past two quarters driven largely by weakness in Southern and Central Europe.</p>
          <p>Total product book-to-bill for Q4 was comfortably above one and in line with normal Q4 seasonality. Q4 FY 2012 total non-GAAP gross margin was 61.9%, down 1.2 percentage points quarter-over-quarter and down 0.8% on a year-on-year basis.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP product gross margin for the fourth quarter was 60.4%, a decrease of 1.6 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily driven by pricing; product mix driven by strength in our data center business; and, to a lesser degree, higher overall manufacturing costs due to higher warranty expense.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP service margin for the fourth quarter was 67.1%. That was flat quarter-over-quarter and down 1.5 percentage points year-over-year. Total non-GAAP gross margin by geographic region were 62.7% for Americas, 61.6% for EMEA and 69.6% for APJC. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, Americas was flat while EMEA decreased 2.3 percentage points and APJC decreased 3.7 percentage points. As a reminder, the APJC revenue benefited in Q3 from the completion of several large multi-year projects that we discussed on last quarter's call, which did have favorable margin impact in Q3.</p>
          <p>The margin decrease was also driven by mix related to strength in our data center as well as SP Video and higher manufacturing costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 34.4% of revenue or approximately $4 billion in Q4 FY 2012 and that was approximately flat as compared to the previous quarter. We recognized pre-tax charges of $202 million to our GAAP operating expenses primarily related to the intended sale of real estate consistent with our ongoing efforts to optimize our real estate portfolio and our restructuring activities.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP operating income was $3.2 billion, 27.5% of revenue for Q4 and grew 14%, consistent with our strategic financial goals of growing profits faster than revenue. We will continue to target non-GAAP operating margin consistent with our focus on balancing investments between gross margin as well as operating expense.</p>
          <p>Our head count at the end of Q4 totaled 66,639. That was up approximately 1,400 quarter-over-quarter. The additions are strategic, including approximately 500 new university graduates who were hired in Q4 mostly in engineering. There were approximately 300 additional hires in R&amp;D in growth areas such as data center and approximately 330 in services to fulfill customer contracts. From a geographic perspective, over half of the head count added this past quarter were in emerging markets and other growth markets.</p>
          <p>We routinely review our business to determine where we need to align investments based on growth opportunities. Additionally, we continue to evaluate our organizational structure as part of our plan to drive simplicity, speed of decision as well as agility across Cisco. If we decide to exit or reduce investments in a business, we will have to make associated decisions that could impact our work force.</p>
          <p>Our Q4 FY 2012 non-GAAP tax provision rate was 21.7%. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $2.5 billion, which represented an increase of 15%. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income was 21.6%. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the fourth quarter was $0.47 versus $0.40 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, which was an increase of 18%. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion as compared to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, an increase of the 56% year-over-year. GAAP net earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the fourth quarter was $0.36 versus $0.22 per share in the same quarter of fiscal 2011, which was an increase of 64%.</p>
          <p>The total of cash, cash equivalents and investments at quarter end was $48.7 billion, up $304 million from last quarter. Of this total balance, approximately $6.2 billion was available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. Our cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was approximately $3.1 billion.</p>
          <p>During Q4, we did repurchase $1.8 billion of common stock under the share repurchase program or 108 million shares at an average price of $16.62 per share. A dividend payment of $425 million representing $0.08 per share was also declared and paid during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Product backlog at the end of fiscal 2012 was approximately $5 billion as compared to approximately $4.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2011.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the call over to John for additional color on the quarter. John?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Frank, thank you very much.</p>
          <p>I'll now provide a more detailed discussion of the market and our five foundational priority areas in terms of revenues followed then by a discussion on geographic and customer segments and that discussion will be in terms of orders or what we internally refer to as bookings.</p>
          <p>The following foundational priority results are shared in terms of the year-over-year revenue growth for Q4 unless otherwise stated. First, our core business, we continue to feel very good about our performance in our core markets, routing, switching, wireless and security. We continue to perform well in routing growing revenues 4% year-over-year while many of our peers are experiencing negative growth and sometimes negative growth in double digits. As you would expect, current industry analysts show our market share gains in both SP, core and edge routing to be up dramatically year-over-year.</p>
          <p>We saw strong performance in mobility with ASR 5000 up 67% and in the edge with the ASR 9000 up 97%. We continue to do a good job of maintaining our access routing market share of approximately 85% with slight fluctuations up and down each quarter. Optical was down 20%. CapEx budgets will continue to be challenged in the current environment, especially European service providers and governments in the developed world. With the strength of our portfolio, alignment of priorities with our customers' priorities and our architectural approach we believe we can continue to grow our share of spend in our key customer accounts with service providers being perhaps the best example from a customer segment perspective.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to switching, overall switching revenue was flat this quarter at $3.6 billion with fixed switching up 3% and modular switching down 7%. Within fixed switching our Nexus 2000 and 5000 Switching had another record quarter and was up more than 24% year-over-year due in part to strong data center build outs. From a modular switching perspective our Nexus 7000 continued its strong growth, up approximately 13% in Q4. Our corresponding CAT 6000 decline reflects the product transitions to the Nexus 2000, 3000, 5000 and 7000 as planned.</p>
          <p>A number of factors have driven this solid demand including the Gig-Ethernet 10G transition with the 10G port shipments growing 54% and solid momentum in the top ten MSDCs where full year FY 2012 growth was 38% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>The most recent quarterly industry LAN-switching market share estimates are in line with our goals of 70% revenue and 50% ports in terms of market share reflecting our continued competitive stance in this market. Our Wireless business is very strong growing 22% in Q4 with mobility driving one of the biggest market transitions in the industry.</p>
          <p>With new products, such as our flagship AP3600, being well received with sequential order growth that is quarter-to-quarter over &#x2013; order growth of over 100%. In addition to the growth in enterprise and commercial segments, a number of large service provider Wi-Fi deployments are now in full swing driven by the ability to retain and attract customers with a bundled Wi-Fi offering.</p>
          <p>Security grew 8% with growth of 15% in network security and 10% decline in content security. Network security growth was fueled by our high-end firewall offerings and product transitions to the data center systems and solutions, and Identity Service Engine, what we ISE internally, I believe we have the right leaders and the right strategy to lead in the security market and expect to continue to invest and execute here. Transitions like the move to cloud-based delivery models and transitions to bring-your-own device play to our strengths and we plan to continue to capitalize on these opportunities, especially in the security space.</p>
          <p>Now moving to the data center, data center performance was extremely strong with overall data center revenue growing at 90% in Q4, up more than 42% from Q3. With year-over-year UCS order growth that is booking growth at 58% &#x2013; growing 58% driven by the Romley transition, seasonality trends and Cisco's compelling Unified data center value propositions. The innovation we're driving and our traction in the data center is truly incredible as measured on almost every scale, revenue growth, market share, and customer mind share. Our ability to move first in this market transition to unify compute, storage, and networking and deliver on long-term and ongoing innovation around Unified Fabric, Unified Compute and Unified Management has helped solidify our position as a leader in the next-generation data centers.</p>
          <p>Our approach to the data center has always been based upon open architecture, an ecosystem of partners. Proven solutions such as V-Blocks with VMware and EMC, FlexPods with NetApps, VXI with Citrix and Private Cloud with Microsoft have seen significant traction in the market and we expect will remain a key driver of our strategy going forward.</p>
          <p>Momentum with PCE continues to be very strong. We saw continued traction in enterprise data centers and cloud search providers, both with new customers and existing customers growing their footprints. With strong demand growth in the second quarter &#x2013; their second quarter, VCE continues to achieve our expectations, that again, is our partnership with a VMware and EMC, with order growth in the most recent quarter of approximately 58% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>An area that many of you have asked us to discuss is our view and the focus on software-defined data centers. And specifically the effect on our strategy as it relates to networking. As a quick summary, the discussion is around evolving networks to be more programmable, more virtual, and more flexible. Make no mistake about it, our goal is to lead this evolution along with our partners and I would point to three advantages that we have in this marketplace.</p>
          <p>First, customers understand that optimizing for the hardware and software combination, to drive consistent experience, policy, quality of service, security and mobility is the only way, in our opinion to meet their total cost of ownership, reliability, and scalability requirements. They want their networking vendor to deliver an evolutionary and also a comprehensive approach.</p>
          <p>Second, we have a complete framework across the portfolio that addresses all the elements of network virtualization. We recently announced an initial set of technologies under the Cisco Open Network Environment umbrella called Cisco One. The customer and partner reception has been very positive and we have quite a bit more up our sleeve as you would expect in this area.</p>
          <p>Third, our global market presence gives us a unique glimpse into customer requirements which helps us ensure our innovation engine is ahead of the market. Cisco pioneered network virtualization in 2009 when we introduced the Nexus 1000V, the first virtualized switch. Today, while start-ups in this space can generally count their production customers on at most two hands, Cisco has more than 6,000 Nexus 1000V production customers using the distributed virtual networks to deliver highly secure multi-tenant data center environments.</p>
          <p>We have been driving the future of the data center for a number of years now together with our strategic partners. Whether it is EMC, VMware, Microsoft, IBM, NetApps, Citrix, Intel and many others; our open approach is driving innovation and unique customer value. To be clear, we will continue to utilize our unmatched expertise in this evolution of the network and build, buy and partner, as we have always done, to drive network leadership for generations to come. And while we view this trend as a positive business driver for us going forward, it is also important to realize this evolution will play out over many years in the future.</p>
          <p>Now let me move on to collaboration. Collaboration declined 8% to $992 million in its most recent quarter. The decline is driven primarily by decreasing TelePresence sales due largely to challenges in the public sector, which were down year-over-year almost 30% and the European markets which were down in terms of TelePresence in the mid-30s as well. We did see the launch of our new TX9000 immersive system getting solid acceptance in the first quarter. We believe that the move to a post-PC world will be a driver of our business going forward and plays to our advantage.</p>
          <p>It also enables our evolution to new business models and greater mix of software and software as a service. And let me just give you a couple of proof points on this. Our Jabber software application that enables instant messaging, conferencing, voice and TelePresence video to multiple devices across most major operating systems has gained significant traction, increasing 55% in licensed volume. Hosted WebEx increased again in this quarter solidly on a global basis. And our new enterprise licensing agreements are off to a strong start with key U.S. enterprise customers. We believe strongly that an open architecture that enables communication of any device to any other is one of the top productivity drivers for this decade.</p>
          <p>Now let me move on to video. After three quarters in a row of comfortable double-digit growth, SP video declined by 2% in Q4. Lower CTMS shipments were partially offset by growth in IP set top boxes, where we continue to gain market share, and cable modems.</p>
          <p>As we begin to think about this market move into the cloud, we see more software content and potentially more profitable growth opportunities. The NDS deal that we just closed should enable us to achieve these goals at a faster pace than we would have been able to on our own.</p>
          <p>Almost without exception; and I literally, Rob, can't think of one; our customers understand that NDS brings Cisco at a much faster pace into the higher end of their business models. A combination of data center, cloud, software, combined with our capabilities and knowledge of video positions us very well for the future. The timing could not have been better in terms of what's going on in the market and I'd like to take full credit for that, however this just happens to be how the market and our peers and the events evolved together. Bottom line, so far, so very good.</p>
          <p>When you think about what NDS does for us, their software and their services model should accelerate the delivery of Videoscape, a key component of our SP Video strategy. With NDS we have the opportunity to transform the way that next-generation video is delivered to consumers worldwide. We believe our customers clearly appreciate the value of NDS to the Cisco portfolio and we look forward to delivering highly differentiated opportunities together.</p>
          <p>NDS also has a strong recurring revenue stream as its primary source of revenue and is expected to help us accelerate our evolution of this business to more of a recurring revenue base both in the video but in other segments of our business as well. While Frank will provide more details on the transition, I would be thrilled and I want to thank and welcome personally the NDS team on behalf of all of the Cisco leadership team to the Cisco family.</p>
          <p>Finally, our architectural approach and focus on delivering solutions has cemented our role as a strategic business partner with our customers worldwide. While we often discuss the innovation in our products, the innovation we are driving in our services, solutions and integrated architectures, are equally as impressive and fundamental. Services, which are a key ingredient to our move into solutions and integrated architecture was up 12% this quarter, with particular strength in advanced services growing at 24%.</p>
          <p>Cisco Smart Services an offering that leverages the intelligence from Cisco's 50 plus million devices and customer connections to protect and optimize network investment grew FY 2012 orders by over 240% and is a good example of an innovative offering fueling our services growth and attractive business model for Cisco and for our partners.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with our progress to date across almost the entire company. There are areas for continued focus and improvement in execution. And this is where I'm asking you, Gary, to take the lead for us. You've done a tremendous job this last year and we just want to keep it going.</p>
          <p>In summary, I am pleased with the innovation and differentiation we are driving across the business.</p>
          <p>I will now move on to provide some color on the geographic and customer segments. The following geographic and customer segments growth rates are in terms of year-over-year product orders for Q4 unless specified otherwise.</p>
          <p>In Q4 Cisco's total product orders grew approximately 2% year-over-year. I want to remind you that both the comparable Q4 of FY 2011 and also the quarter we are now entering, Q1 of FY 2012, were very strong year-over-year order quarters averaging comfortably in the double digits. And, therefore, will make the toughest year-over-year comps in terms of orders we will face for the next fiscal year in that this Q4 we're just reporting and in Q1 for next year.</p>
          <p>Looking at the numbers from a geographic perspective, specifically the Americas products grew orders by 4%. We saw the U.S. slightly stronger with Canada and Latin America both down. When we first signaled slowing of the market almost 15 months ago the initial indicators of the slowdown occurred first in the U.S. state and local governments, followed by large global enterprise accounts, then general enterprise accounts in the U.S. then U.S. federal and then into the commercial marketplace. In Q4, with the exception of federal government, we saw positive growth and/or up trends, especially in the second half of the quarter. Now I want to say is it is way too early to call this a trend, but if this were to continue through Q1, this would be a solid indicator of potential future market improvement in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Just to give you some additional data, and I'm going to give you both Q3 and Q4 order trends in the U.S., the following is a summary of the U.S. performance in those areas. U.S. state and local government grew 7% in Q3 and 17% in Q4 and remind you 15 months ago, that was the first one to really slow dramatically. GET in our largest 29 enterprise accounts declined double digits in Q3 and increased in double digits in Q4. Those are our global enterprise accounts again in the theater. While U.S. enterprise grew 1% in Q3, it grew 4% in Q4. U.S. commercial for Q3 was 6% and for Q4 was 7%. As expected, our U.S. federal business declined in both quarters with minus 8% decline in Q3 and minus 11% decline in Q4. In Europe, Middle East and Africa and in Russia region, product orders were down 6%.</p>
          <p>The primary weakness was across all sections of Europe with most of our customers not foreseeing improvement in the near future. The U.K. was down 13%, Germany was down 4%, France was down 12%, Italy was down 24%, Europe, not including emerging markets, and EMEA and Russia represent approximately 19% of our company's business.</p>
          <p>Public sector in Europe was down 13%, service provider was down 15%, enterprise on the other hand was up 2% and commercial was flat. On the positive side, our emerging markets and the EMEA grew 12% with Russia up 12%. Emerging markets represents about 23% of EMEA's pure total business. Asia-Pacific, Japan and China, our third theater, of the three regions, it grew the fastest at 12%. We expected this growth in APJC and they delivered, and I want to congratulate Edzard Overbeek in that and also Jaime going into the new role.</p>
          <p>There was also nice rebound following Q3 growth of 7% up to the 12% in Q4. China had a strong quarter up 17%, Japan, which has been very solid all year, was up 12%, Australia up over 30% and India flat. We continue to see India challenge largely self-inflicted by their own internal issues but getting back to flat growth after multiple quarters of double-digit negative growth was encouraging.</p>
          <p>As many of you may be aware we recently promoted Edzard Overbeek who had run the APJC region from sales operations to head up our Global Services business reporting to Gary Moore. We are deliberately moving away, moving many of our high potential leaders at all levels within the company to new functions in the business as opposed to just promoting within a functional silo to provide the experiences and the perspective that our customers and shareholders expect of future leaders at Cisco.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to a customer market view, enterprise global grew at 6% in Q4 versus Q3s minus 1%. While we were glad to see some renewed momentum at the enterprise, we remain conservative and cautious in our expectations given the uncertainty remaining in the macro environment. Commercial on a global basis grew 4% but the U.S., as I said earlier, continued to be very solid with 7% growth year-over-year. Service provider declined 1%. Again, I'd like to just share with you the data that in Q4 FY 2011 we saw 19% growth, so some really, some tough comps for this quarter. In Q1 of this year we saw growth of 16% and Q2 of fiscal year 2012 growth of 12%. We will clearly have some challenging comps in these three quarters in FY 2013 and Q4 of this last year. Despite the decline in orders this quarter we believe we gained more than our share of available market, and we believe this will be seen in share increases in the SP market. For the year, our Service Provider business grew 8%. Public sector in total global was up 1% for the year and I'm sorry 1% for Q4 and was up 3% for the year.</p>
          <p>We have always been able to control and rapidly adjust to both opportunities and possible challenges in the marketplace. This is a core strength. We will always have strategic partners with whom we both partner and compete. Our commitment to open standards and to any-to-any positions us incredibly well to navigate through the changing industry dynamics. We have done this successfully for decades, and we feel very comfortable with our ability to control our own destiny.</p>
          <p>In thinking about guidance for Q1 FY 2013, which Frank will give you in a moment, here are the top things on my mind. First, from a challenges perspective, we are modeling Europe to continue to be very challenging over the next several quarters. Second challenge, global public spending will also continue to be a challenge, especially in the U.S. federal government and European governments. And third, many of our customers continue to anticipate a challenging next 12 months on a global basis and, therefore, these CEOs will remain conservative both in their IT expenditures but also in their hiring or at least that's what they're telling us.</p>
          <p>However, we are also seeing a number of potential drivers for growth and balance to these challenges. First, our solid position in commercial accounts, and the strength of our channels, which, Rob, we never should underestimate how key that is for us; second, cloud and our ability to expand both our products and architectural wins in the data center, which grew this last quarter comfortably above 50%; third, Cisco's expanding value with both traditional and new service providers and new partners in this area, especially in the growth areas such as cloud, video, mobility, open architecture and hosted UC at a time when many of our competitors in the service provider market are really struggling; fourth, emerging countries, which represents about 20% of our business and yet approximately 50% of the world's global GDP.</p>
          <p>While we are pleased with our progress in many of our top emerging countries, we believe we can do even better, starting with the alignment of more resources to the emerging country opportunities, which, Frank, you talked about earlier in terms of our head count changes with 700 of the 1,400 going to emerging countries. Fifth, while we are very strong in the enterprise marketplace, we think we can do even better with the appropriate caveats in our technology and business architecture approach to our leading accounts, in many ways, taking our enterprise strength to the next level by replicating key parts of our successes in the service provider market.</p>
          <p>Finally, we believe our continued profitable growth and leadership in services positions us very well with a foundational base for future growth and profitability. We all understand the uncertainties in the macro environment so as you would expect, we will focus on what we can control and influence with particular emphasis on gaining share of wallet and profitable market share leadership, managing tight expense control and enhancing shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Frank, let me move on to you for Q4 guidance.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. I would like to remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements and you should review our recent SEC filings that do identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those in contained in the forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>The guidance is based on the current pipeline and our view of business trends based upon the information that we have available today and, of course, the actual results could be above or below our guidance. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP. I will first provide guidance excluding the recently closed acquisition of NDS and then conclude with the guidance that does include NDS.</p>
          <p>So looking forward, we are basing guidance on neither a significant improvement nor a deterioration in global macro economic conditions in the near future. We expect Q1 revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. As we have said in the past, forecasting gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, mix, cost savings as well as competitive pricing pressures.</p>
          <p>So for the first quarter of FY 2013 we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 is expected to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%, which is up approximately four-tenths of a point to 1.4 points over Q1 of FY 2012.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the first quarter. Our Q1 FY 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.47 per share, which is up approximately 5% to 9% year-over-year, consistent with our goal of delivering profitable growth.</p>
          <p>As we announced earlier this month, we have closed our acquisition of NDS. As with any acquisition, there will be adjustments to NDS' historical financial reporting as we conform NDS to Cisco's accounting policies. The primary changes impacting the NDS income statements are the write-down of deferred revenue as part of the purchase accounting adjustments, conformance to Cisco revenue recognition policies resulting in increased deferrals of revenue impacting the timing of the revenue recognition, as well as the classification adjustments that will increase NDS' cost of goods sold and reduce operating expense.</p>
          <p>The classification adjustment is related to a portion of NDS' technology and development costs, which relate to the customization and integration of NDS' software or specific customers. As the costs are customer specific, our policies require their classification as cost of goods sold. This will have no impact on the overall profitability, but will impact the NDS standalone gross margin percentage and will be approximately neutral to Cisco's gross margin percentage over FY 2013.</p>
          <p>In addition to these financial adjustments, there will be integration costs for the first one to two years. We expect the full year FY 2013 impact of the acquisition to be approximately $1 billion to $1.1 billion in revenue and accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.03 all in the second half of the year this fiscal year and we expect that benefit to increase over time.</p>
          <p>In Q1 FY 2013, there will be minimal operating income contribution because of the accounting items referenced above and the integration costs. All NDS revenue will be classified as product and included within the service provider video category in our financial reporting. In Q1, we are anticipating the NDS revenue to be approximately $200 million. We expect Q1 revenue growth including NDS, this is from a total company perspective, to be in the range of 4% to 6% on a year-over-year basis. For the first quarter of FY 2013, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin including NDS, again total company, to be in the range of 61% to 62%.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 including NDS is expected to be in the range of 26.0% to 27.0%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate including NDS is expected to be approximately 22% in the first quarter and our Q1 FY 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share including NDS, again total company, is expected to be the range of $0.45 to $0.47 earnings per share, which is up approximately 5% to 9% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>We anticipate our GAAP earnings in Q1 will be $0.09 to $0.13 per share lower than the non-GAAP EPS. This range includes our typical adjustments as well as any impact of up to $0.02 as a result of our anticipated restructuring charges. Other than those quantified items noted above, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings and tax or other events which may or may not be significant. And as a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a specific public disclosure.</p>
          <p>Related to our July 2011 announcements on restructuring, we have incurred total pre-tax charges of approximately $1 billion to our GAAP financial results to date. We expect the total restructuring charges to be approximately $1.1 billion, which will include through the first quarter of fiscal 2013.</p>
          <p>This past year, Operational Excellence was one of our key focus items across the business and we executed as we said we would. This enabled us to continue to move forward on profitable growth and capital returns. Our plan is to continue our focus on Operational Excellence and efficiencies which we know is important to driving value for shareholders.</p>
          <p>So I want to thank you again and turn the call back over to John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, thank you and well done.</p>
          <p>As I reflect on FY 2012, I am very pleased with our execution as a company. We delivered on our commitments to you, our shareholders, to our partners, and to our customers. We changed where we needed to, built around our core products, our channel and services strengths, while prioritizing our resources to our five foundational areas. Each of us as a Cisco employee takes pride in our earnings per share growth, twice as fast as revenue in FY 2012.</p>
          <p>Our operational discipline and ongoing company evolution is paying off and the dividend and capital allocation roadmap we outlined today reflect our confidence in our business and our commitment to driving long-term shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Our products, solutions and innovations are at the heart of major market transitions. We are not just catching, we are very often driving and leading these transitions. However what is most important to me personally is how we have architecturally tied hardware and software products together to deliver solutions to our customers that achieve their top priorities and therefore enhance our value to the customers and our ability to achieve premiums in the market and to continue to be among the very best in the industry.</p>
          <p>As billions more people and devices come onto the network in coming years, we'll be fueling unprecedented innovation, creativity, transformation, and opportunity. Fifteen years ago we said everything will be connected in ways that were hard to imagine at the time. Today, we see the Internet of everything as another driver for our growth and opportunities in coming years. We will always face good competitors and new technology transitions but our track record of success is among the best in the industry. While our focus will always be on our customers and the major transitions, we are also a company that loves to compete.</p>
          <p>Our market share position across all of our largest markets is the best that I can remember in recent history and we strongly believe that we are making major gains in share of wallet across many of our top customers. As we look to the next quarter, our projections with all the appropriate caveats for revenue growth of 4% to 6% is well above that of many of our industry peers. Growing as we have through challenging times reinforces our conviction to capitalize on our expanding growth opportunities when the global economy recovers.</p>
          <p>As we look forward to FY 2013, I want to thank our shareholders, employees, customers, and partners for their ongoing commitment. Together we will continue to do amazing things and we are committed to managing the company to deliver the value you expect from Cisco. As a last thought, let there be no mistake. We are listening to you, our shareholders. The entire company is committed to driving long-term shareholder value creation.</p>
          <p>Now let's do, Mel, what I enjoy most, open it up to questions. I want to apologize. It was a little bit long but trying to do the fiscal year, NDS, some other transitions, and the quarter was a little bit challenging.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our first question comes from Rod Hall with JPMC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, guys, for taking my question. I just wanted to clarify on the capital allocation commentary, you guys had originally linked the dividend increase back to international cash repatriation. And so, I wonder John and Frank if maybe one or both of you could comment on what the &#x2013; if there's any change in your thinking on the probability of getting any cash back or if you've just decided to move on with the dividend even though there's really no decision made?</p>
          <p>And then, I also wish you guys could clarify a little bit on the macro commentary you made, John, because the guidance doesn't seem &#x2013; I mean, it's a little weak, it's not terribly weak. But you did say that a lot of the guys you are talking to are thinking the next 12 months is going to be pretty tough. And I just wonder if you could tell us whether you are seeing them cutting budgets already or if they're waiting to take any further action until they see more evidence in the economy? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rod, I'm going to do something that Mel's going to kick me for. I'm going to answer your two questions but then I'm going to ask all of your colleagues to please hold it to one. I'm going to take the easy part of capital allocation and to give you the details, Frank, as always. And I want to congratulate you, Frank. You have been working on this for three quarters. You worked with our finance committee, board of directors. We were waiting for the right time to do this so I want to just thank you very much.</p>
          <p>The easy part of the conversation is, no, this is not dependent in any way on repatriation nor are we signaling that. There are a number of levers that we can pull in this area and putting the levers together, we believe we are in good shape to be able do it with the U.S. cash that we will be getting over the next several years. Frank, take it to the next step?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, definitely. As I mentioned on the call, given the stabilization that we've seen in our business and really on the confidence going forward and as John just mentioned, really just the outreach with listening to shareholders over the past year and what's important to all of you and trying to balance both the buyback as well as the dividends and provide a framework on what we want to do going forward over multiple years and our commitment to that.</p>
          <p>And that is really what we outlined today, to have a minimum &#x2013; and I stress, minimum &#x2013; of 50% of our free cash flow that we will allocate through a combination of the dividend as well as the buyback. When we announced the dividend, we did say that we would support the dividend over a longer period of time. And this is just a further verification of that. We will continue to support that over time and continue, as is appropriate, to support the buyback. As you saw, we had $1.8 billion of buyback in this past quarter.</p>
          <p>Again, it is to provide a framework. We feel comfortable based on the analysis that we've done kind of looking out in the near-term, as far as managing the U.S. cash to be able to make this commitment. And we will continue, of course, to be a very strong advocate for tax reform in the future as we work through this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And taking the second part of your, question I'm going to break it into a couple parts. First, when you look at comparisons &#x2013; and these are both for orders and for revenues &#x2013; and revenues usually slide slightly behind the orders by maybe a half a quarter or a quarter. Q4 of last year in orders was our strongest quarter that we have seen, Rod, over the last five quarters, comfortably in double-digits and so was Q1.</p>
          <p>So when you compare comps, if you're really comparing sequential comps, that number would obviously be a little bit different in terms of what you are looking at. And I encourage you to think about the market that way. So in year-over-year numbers these are actually pretty good, aggressive numbers in terms of the marketplace, especially when almost all of our large peers are forecasting flat to down revenues. And many of our competitors are forecasting down dramatically negative or actually double-digit negative growth. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves.</p>
          <p>Secondly, Europe. It will be as tough as you're hearing. Europe for us in the last four quarters if I remember this right &#x2013; keep me honest, Rob, I think that was up 13% four quarters ago, and then up 7%, then flat, and minus 6% this quarter. We can all draw the curve. That's probably going to get tougher before it gets better. And that might last for a good little while. We've got an amazing team in Chris Dedicoat and team over there, so we will get whatever it is to get but that's going to be tough.</p>
          <p>To the positive, normally I wouldn't be real excited or point out interest but when Enterprise was going down, it to go back up from 1% to 4% and the U.S. was clearly there. And while federal government remained tough for several quarters, with government spending going up a little bit in the 6% level driven by state and local government.</p>
          <p>Now you all know seasonality. Seasonality for state and local government was in our last quarter so it is heavier in terms of total percentage of business in state and local during Q4 where Q1 is much heavier on federal. Federal business is going to be negative and be tough for several quarters as we look out into the future. But if you watch the trends, we wanted to just share them with you. We saw it in the last 45 days of the quarter.</p>
          <p>We also have a good book-to-bill, which you saw in terms of our comments going in and I would want to watch it at least another quarter before I'd get really excited on it. Latin America was a little bit soft as we said earlier. But overall, we think we are getting our share of the market and our strategy seems to be winning well.</p>
          <p>You've got two answers, Rod, and two questions. And I will keep my answers tighter, Mel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, John. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on delivering a solid quarter in a tough environment. I was hoping you could expand upon what you are hearing from your service-provider customers with respect to their second-half spending plans? To what degree do you still expect to see second half improvement and to what degree has there been any change in your expectations from carrier business, particularly from some of your North American carriers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if what we're seeing in the service provider business &#x2013; this one we believe we are taking very good share of wallet spend and we've got to earn that every day. And as you would expect, I knew the question was going to be what about the second half of the fiscal year in terms of cap spending?</p>
          <p>I think AT&amp;T today said that their capital spending in the second half of the year would be up over the first half of the year. That's what we were expecting from them. It's mixed across the U.S. I don't believe there's a flush going to occur in terms of dramatic differences Q2 &#x2013; I'm sorry second half of the year versus the first half. Asia Pacific we're modeling pretty solid and I think what Edzard has done there and what we see in Japan and China and now starting in India finally, Rob, we're in good shape on and we've done well in Australia and in Korea already. That looks solid. We will get our share of spend there.</p>
          <p>Balancing that, however, is very tough comps because service provider had very tough comps in Q4 and Q1 and Q2 of this last year. So that kind of I think balances a little bit of what you're seeing momentum wise. European service providers, especially the large &#x2013; what we call the large five or six, are going to not be spending much the second half of the year in compared to people that &#x2013; what they might have thought six months ago. Most of them are going to be very conservative, in our opinion, over the next two quarters. We'll get our share of spend there and share of wallet and again with Edwin and Chris there I think we'll do well versus what's available. We're modeling that a little bit tougher.</p>
          <p>So overall in Service Providers, we're positioned extremely well. Balanced dramatically different across the three theaters and we think we will gain share of wallet as we go forward versus almost all of our peers, especially in the routing segment where we were real pleased about how much share we've taken. Thank you, Jess.</p>

        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Hey, Brian.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Hi, John. A question. Obviously, you addressed a little bit on SDN, but how do you see Cisco competing with VMware and Nicira in network virtualization? Do you see a need to beef up there? Do you see that having any effect on VCE or any of the relationships that you have? Can you talk a little bit about that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when you really think about SDN, and I want to be very candid, we think the future's going to be hardware and software combined. We think when you have knowledge of the network and are able to know what's going on in the network, you can program to it, you can give dramatically better flexibility, etcetera, it's a nice way of saying we think it's going to be ASICs, hardware and software combined.</p>
          <p>Secondly, if you watch what we've done in this area, we saw virtualization coming early. So it wasn't like it snuck up on us. We went into the virtualization with the Nexus 1000V in 2009, which is exactly when we entered the data center market with the UCS and our movement there. So we saw both of these trends coming. Our view on this SDN, OpenFlow, Nicira type of activity is you're really looking multiple years out in terms of its impact one way or the other and our ability to handle transitions with our partners and at times compete and times partner has been unprecedented in the industry.</p>
          <p>So as we look forward, we're completely staying committed with VCE and our ability to work together. We are looking at the innovation that we can do in our market and we will have partnerships like what occurs with Microsoft and IBM and Citrix in this area as well. So good growth this last quarter, but if you look at it, we think we will encompass this in literally an architectural play pretty crisply.</p>
          <p>Rob, would you add anything to that?</p>

          <p>Just, John, that we obviously expect to leverage the strength of our install base, which is pervasive across the data center, multiple ecosystem players. We're going to support multiple hypervisors, multiple applications and operating systems. So we've got work underway in every area and we can't forget some of the innovation we've got going both inside and outside the company.</p>

          <p>Just want to echo, with VMware and EMC it's been a very strong partnership. We've both benefited greatly from it. They candidly need us and we like very much being a partner with them. So I think you'll see us work this out in terms of our direction. But we are going to be an open player and we've shown in the marketplace when we compete we can be really, really tough.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. Just wanted to ask a question about product gross margin. I think you said it was 60.4%, which is the lowest it's been in some time, and I think one of the drivers you cited was pricing. So if you could give us a few more examples of what areas you're seeing pricing be a factor in particular. And then also on a go forward basis, can you comment on how you see product gross margins, especially now that they include NDS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Simona. If you look at where we're going, the pricing on a global basis has not changed I don't think, Rob, materially in the last one to two quarters. Those people who come at us with price and unbelievably aggressive pricing, sometimes half of our bids, we are now learning how to compete very effectively against them and our comfort level in competing not with our traditional players in the marketplace some of whom, some people had concerns 12 to 18 months ago, but taking on Huawei and others, we're getting very good at doing. So on a global basis not abnormal pricing in any area.</p>
          <p>Any time you win large deals in emerging markets such as China and India, especially in service providers, those have tighter gross margins. And clearly you saw us win some of those these quarters. So I would not say that it's an unusual pricing environment. You just see at times certain pressures based upon size of bids and also geographic issues. Mix is probably something that I watch more and it was very positive mix when you have 90% growth with UCS and Nexus. And while the two together are clearly better than server margins it brings us down a little bit in terms of the direction.</p>
          <p>Frank, what would you add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, so we gave guidance for the quarter for Q4 of 61% to 62%, we came in at the high end of that, 61.9% overall total product margin. As you said from a pricing standpoint, the pricing has been fairly stable now going on about two years if you look at it from a quarter-on-quarter standpoint in the range of what we had expected. Yes, we did have a mix impact as you mentioned, primarily from data center strength, which was positive. We also had a manufacturing cost was higher in the quarter driven by warranty costs. If you would kind of just normalize for that warranty cost and warranty costs do kind of come up and down from quarter to quarter and you look at the margins going back, fairly consistent, I would say from that perspective.</p>
          <p>And, Simona, then also, a good thing as far as going forward similar to what we've done this past year, tremendous amount of focus on gross margins. We have now incentives across the board from a leadership standpoint in the sales regions as well as in our business groups that are focused on profitability, which has been driving a lot of the emphasis on projects like value engineering, which we saw great improvement on this past year and which we're now going to see some further leverage as we move into FY 2013. And we've been investing more in FY 2013 to see that continue as we move into 2014.</p>
          <p>So many initiatives continue on margin, and then I would say as far as the guidance that we gave today for Q1, consistent guidance 61% to 62% overall, which I would say if you look at it from even a product standpoint, fairly consistent from a quarter-on-quarter standpoint when you take into consideration the items I mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gary, you've been driving for us more discipline and really focused on profitability and value added engineering and even how we measure each of our leaders in terms of profitability. Maybe just spend a little bit of time on trends here and how that's going to help us in the margin picture over the next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, so as Frank pointed out, and we've stepped it up. When we started the transformation work last October we invested more money in value engineering, which goes beyond just value engineering, value design. So bringing together the engineering teams with the procurement teams, as well as the overall supply chain team has really driven value and Frank and I set targets for them. They hit the targets, which we thought we set pretty aggressive targets and that's just one area where we think we have leverage to continue to drive efficiency and effectiveness to drive profitability higher and certainly higher than revenue as we go forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Frank I want to particularly thank you and Colette and Kelly and how well they worked on your team. They really are interfacing to engineering and manufacturing amazingly well here. So, Simona, to the indirect part of your question, we don't see anything unusual occurring in pricing or margins. And while it's always a possibility of us being wrong, we've actually been getting more accurate about forecasting that in mix rather than the reverse.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks. I'm just trying to sneak in a clarification so to make sure I understood something correctly and then my real question. On the clarification, Frank you gave a bunch of numbers that were awesome, $10 billion free cash flow last year assuming that's roughly a run rate 50% pay out of that is $5 billion and your new dividend rate will give you roughly about $3 billion a year in dividends. So that would leave about $2 billion for buybacks. You just did $1.8 billion in buybacks this last quarter. So the math that I just went through unless I did it wrong, I just want to understand if I did do it wrong...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to count that as a question, Ehud.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, no. Then let me ask my other question. My other question &#x2013; I can throw that out there and you answer it any other time because it would imply that buybacks are going down.</p>
          <p>My other question really is when you look at your product order growth, it has now gone for the last couple of years where we have easier comps then your product order growth accelerates, and then you hit the tough comps and your product order growth starts to decelerate for the last couple quarters I had &#x2013; yes, quarters. I'm sorry. I have it going down a few quarters in a row. Are we in a world right now where product order growth accelerates for a year then hits the easy comps or the tough comps and decelerates and then hits the easy comps and accelerates and that's kind of the pattern as we just kind of anniversary back-and-forth? Or do you envision a way I know you're structuring the company in a way that we can actually have a multi-year order growth reacceleration because something breaks out of the mold or something else takes hold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So on the question, we deliberately worded as a minimum of 50% of CapEx going into that you're going to see us be aggressive both opportunistic and predictability. We wanted to get the dividend to a level that the shareholders clearly understood we are committed to. And if we do our job right at the right times we're committed to raising. We also have been aggressive in shareholder &#x2013; share buybacks and you'll continue to see us, where appropriate, do that. So I was kind of teasing you about the question. My sense of humor is getting better here. At least I think it is.</p>
          <p>Frank would you add anything to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That's true. I wanted to stress that because it's a framework over multiple years and it's also to set a minimum just so that you can expect us to at least get to the minimum.</p>
          <p>The other thing I just want to add, the question was answered before as far as when you look at U.S. cash and the question that came up on the tax rate. One thing to add that we factored in, especially when you look at it in the near-term let's say over the next year, year-and-a-half, one of the other factors that does give us a little bit more flexibility from U.S. cash position is we periodically make some distributions of our cash to the U.S. from some of our foreign subsidiary earnings. These are some earnings that have been previously taxed by the U.S. so we have a little bit of flexibility there. And that's also been factored in as I look at &#x2013; or I take into consideration the commitment that we're making on the 50%.</p>
          <p>So again that does add &#x2013; we had a little bit of benefit from that just in this past quarter if you kind of look at the overall balance sheet and we'll continue to see some of that in the near-term and we'll factor that in as far as distributing the cash through the dividend as well as the buybacks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To answer to your question about overall product order growth and are you going to see waves like this, Lord knows I hope not. I mean we went through the toughest recession in our lifetime and we went through a European Union issue that has shaken the world's confidence. And yet, we navigated through those, I think, pretty well. And if you look at profit growth which I think all of you have encouraged us to focus on as much or more than the revenue growth, we grew profits last year twice as fast as revenues and that's non-GAAP profits. GAAP profits actually grew in the 21% and 27% range respectively.</p>
          <p>So no, I would not expect this and it's a lot easier to manage through normal times but these are two of probably the three toughest economic times I've seen in my lifetime. And I think to be growing at the rates we did and gaining market share like we did, I'd have to give the Cisco team pretty good marks.</p>
          <p>In terms of are we going to move over time to a more predictable revenue stream, the answer's yes. If you do that too fast you see short-term growth rates drop. So we've got to evolve into that. And so when you see models like NDS in terms of what we do with NDS and keeping their revenue stream and actually using it as a model for the future as opposed to the past. And being able, Mel, to not have a base behind us so we can build this revenue stream is good. And if you watch what we've done with some of our products at the multi-core edge, as an example, we're learning how to price both on the product itself and then price for software additions and be able to add and bring up gross margins over time. So you're beginning to see us rethink this through.</p>
          <p>Gary and team and Rob and team have a lot of work going on to this. And so, making that revenue stream a little bit more predictable is key. Making that transition from primarily an acquisition to a regular revenue stream over a period of years, we have to do that delicately as you would expect.</p>
          <p>So I'd answer your question, I hope not on the order growth fluctuations. None of us want to go through the last three years or four years again. And in terms of do we see our ability to transition through this and become a little bit more predictable, I think we've got to. We just have to be careful in the transition. Ehud, did that answer the question okay?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Tal.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I also have clarification and a question so let me just stick with one clarification part. How much of your cash flow is generated in the U.S.? I'm trying to reconcile between the dividends and buybacks? I assume that buybacks are done also globally when you buy ADRs and convert them. But dividends have to be paid in U.S. dollars and domestic cash flow generation. So when I do the math of how much cash flow you generate and then deduct the dividends, I'm not left with much for U.S. cash flow to do the buybacks unless most of your buybacks are done overseas. So I'm trying to understand the dynamics of the global use of cash flow from a buyback perspective and from a dividend perspective. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, if you look at from a buyback and from a dividend perspective, both have to be funded as U.S. cash. As you know when we mentioned we had a U.S. cash balance at the end of the fourth quarter of a little over $6 billion. And that would be what we would use for both the dividend as well as the buyback and any other U.S. needs that we have, we'd have to fund out of that. We will continue as far as forecasting what we would generate in the U.S. from an operations perspective and working that flow.</p>
          <p>The other aspect as I mentioned just a few minutes ago as far as can taking into consideration some previously taxed cash that we have which is outside the United States. We have the potential right now based on our analysis to bring back and use as part of this in the near-term. And I have, clearly I wouldn't go out there and make a commitment to a plan or framework with a 50% commitment if we didn't have the ability to kind of work through that. The dividend right now with the increase that we had today would be about $2.8 billion on an annual basis. And then the buyback of course does change from quarter-to-quarter and we would have to work that in based on opportunistic as well as just kind of where we can fund that and work that through.</p>
          <p>But we've done extensive planning kind of looking at this based on expected business results and be able to kind of work this through. And then we will continue to always look at, as I said before, ways of being a strong advocate for U.S. tax reform as we go into the next several years, which of course would give us even more flexibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're not stepping off that. We think regardless of who wins, this is something our country needs to do. And we'll see what we can do as an industry and a business group in the period between the election and the next President becoming in the role. And we all know that there is one President that's already committed to supporting this should he get elected in terms of doing the changes that need to be made.</p>
          <p>In terms of the overall process, a small data point. Cash from operations was $10.5 billion this year. A year ago it was $10 billion. That's an additional $1.5 billion as you begin to think about our models. Lots of levers that Frank can pull. Which ones he pulls in which sequence and which ones don't get pulled, that is your call, Frank. I'm very pleased with what you're doing in making this commitment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Gentlemen, if I look at Cisco from an S-curve point-of-view, we went from a growth phase to now a stabilization phase, which results in faster profit growth and higher cash generation, which you are commendably returning to shareholders. What happens next on the curve? And how do you fund future innovations so that the trajectory of the curve points higher? And can you do that without growing expenses? Or do you take the approach of exiting certain businesses and then acquiring higher-margin software companies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to take the easier part which is really talking about growth opportunities. And then, Gary, I would ask for you to fill in, in terms of how much we're freeing up resources to be able to move them both in terms of productivity, duplication of resources, layers, etcetera, which is what we did in this last change. And moving them to where the growth is like emerging markets.</p>
          <p>In terms of the opportunities, Mark, I don't think we'll surprise you in a big way but there are a lot more opportunities we can go after than we can bring down. So we're going to stay within our five foundational frameworks with mobility and security and any across those. But even within those, when you think about the Internet of things, you begin to think about smart-grid, you begin to think about how we do connected industries, how we really put this capability to work and drive video in a big way. Each of those are major growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>So what we will try to do is share with you where we think the growth opportunities will come in normal times. And I think all of us would agree this is not normal or anywhere near close to it. GDP growth in the U.S. at 1.5% to 2% is anemic. Growth in Europe in the full-borne recession where every major country in Europe is showing negative year-over-year comps in mid-to high single-digits, that is anemic. What we have seen in challenges in Asia, even though we have managed through them pretty well, have been challenging.</p>
          <p>So I think you are talking about an economic question. I think you are talking about our ability to move into new markets and our ability for current core markets to grow. So I think it's a combination of that. Now, however, one thing that we've gotten much more disciplined about and Gary I really want to compliment you and the whole team, but, Rob, you and Frank as well, is we're starting to say where do we have resources that we aren't using effectively? How do we realign those resources with productivity implications? How do we move into emerging markets effectively? How do we not have duplication of efforts across the board?</p>
          <p>So, Gary, your thoughts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so, Mark, we wouldn't make the commitments that we've made if we didn't feel very confident that we still have operating leverage to bring to bear here. I think we're much more confident than we were a year ago about our disciplined focused approach. I think the business being well managed you wouldn't see the results we achieved in Q4 or for that matter FY 2012 if we weren't. But we still have a number of transformational things going on that drive revenue, reduce expense and make us more efficient.</p>
          <p>So without going into detail in every one of those, we're very confident that we still have almost 1,000 full-time equivalents working on these programs to look at things. And what you don't see is during the last several quarters internally we have also realigned 1,000 people every quarter to the priority. So if you think about what sales is doing, if you think about what engineering is doing, services and the rest of the business, we're putting our best people where the greatest opportunity is, and we're putting our resources where we have significant opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, could you expand a little bit just to give Mark a feeling for example what you've done in sales and how you're beginning to share the common resources, take layers out, move resources to where the emerging markets are, etcetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, John. We're now a full year into creating these three regions with the vast majority of our go to market sales resources all under one of those three leaders. We can see right now that as the opportunities in emerging markets exist, we're shifting investments and resources into emerging markets and out of some of our slower markets in Europe. We can see that we can prioritize architectures and investments across the board. So the idea of creating that very simplified operating model with the vast majority of our resources is allowing those regional teams to actually move much more quickly, and we can see that in some of the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What's been exciting, Rob, is you've done this, and when I looked your regional leaders in the eye and your key theater VPs and senior VPs and say how much effect is this going to have on the business, they've been in unanimous agreement, almost none. It will actually accelerate the business over time in terms of the direction. So just giving you a feel, Mark, we clearly understand the question you're asking both directly and indirectly. We think we're going to be even more disciplined and focused, and we also think, Gary and I, all of us believe and hope this is not the market we're in for the next ten years with the current slowness.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks a lot for taking my question. Looking at security, it looks like we've seen six quarters of sequential growth in this business and it seems like the business has kind of turned a corner. Can you kind of talk about what's working in that business and kind of what kind of things you can do to maybe start taking share and really drive growth a little faster?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If you watch what is happening in security I think it's a combination of issues. It's been one that we've always felt architecturally could go across all of our products and tie them together in a unique way that no one else in the industry could replicate and our customers are pushing us hard to do that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we've made some changes in the leadership there, and I just want to congratulate Chris Young and the teams that they are bringing together. We've got a leadership team we really believe in.</p>
          <p>Third, the way Gary structured engineering, we are now moving much more effectively and crisply across the groups to say when we say we're going to after security here's what we expect each one in each group to be able to do. I like their plans and directions and, Grady, this may surprise you but it won't surprise Chris listening to me at the other end. I think this is one that we can do a lot better growth on, but it can be the best example of how we tie it all together.</p>
          <p>So I like the movement. As you saw, we got our growth primarily in network security, firewalls, etcetera on that. We've got to expand that and get an architectural play as we move forward.</p>

          <p>Thank you, our next question comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel, Nicolaus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. John, I want to take another crack at the order growth situation. I understand that the year-over-year comps are tough. But just going through the other metrics you've given, which is your backlog is up, I think, 11% year-on-year, your book-to-bill is comfortably above one. But your order growth is still about 2%. So just trying to see if there's anything we can go through to help us explain sort of the disconnect over there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, as you'll see in our Q report, our backlog is up about $500 million versus last year. We clearly went out of this year with a good backlog, which is what you want in all Q4s and that's because our orders come in very back end loaded. In Q1 as you know, order rate wise it's always off dramatically versus Q4 even during double-digit growth years.</p>
          <p>In terms of the comps, the comps are tough when you have 12% or 13% growth in a quarter and you compare the next year to that, the comps in quarters where you only have 2% or 3% growth, i.e. Q3 and Q4 this next year, are a lot different. So just with normal execution you'll begin to see things balance throughout the year in terms of the comps.</p>
          <p>The second issue is we're taking share at the present time and our peers are almost all at negative or flat growth. So for us to be at 4% to 6% is something we're pretty pleased of in the industry given the economic challenges involved. So I just don't want us to get ahead of this. We are gaining share at the present time. If the economies turn, I'd expect us to do better as they turn. But I don't want to mislead you. Europe is going to get worse before it gets better and federal government spending is not going to improve in the short-term here in the U.S.</p>
          <p>So we're focused on share of wallet and where we want to be one and two years out. And I hope we'll be apologizing to you a couple quarters out about being conservative. But I think these are pretty candid and aggressive numbers at the present time, especially based on what we're seeing from our peers.</p>

          <p>So I didn't mind you taking a crack at me a second time, Sanjiv, it's more than fair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sanjiv. Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, John. If I can return you all to the margins. Two questions. One, Frank, can you quantify the price impact? Historically it's been running about 250 to 300 basis points of degradation a year and I heard the comment that there was nothing extraordinary about pricing, but if you could speak to that.</p>
          <p>And then a question &#x2013; related question on operating margin. 34% is the best you've done in terms of OpEx as a percentage of revenue, going back to the telecom bubble days. You'd have to go back to fiscal 2000. You're at 34.5% now. I heard your comments about further improvement. Can you talk to that 34% benchmark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as &#x2013; Paul, as John mentioned before, if you look at the pricing aspect &#x2013; I mean you can see it in the filings that we provide. The amount of impact on the pricing has been fairly stable from a quarter-on-quarter standpoint and that really hasn't changed much as we look back over, as I said eight quarters. I'm not sure what more I can share on that, from that perspective. But if you look at pricing from the standpoint of last quarter, it's in the range of about a half a point as far as how it impacts from quarter-to-quarter. And again, that's fairly stable as you look at it over a number of quarters and that's what we would anticipate. The other items in gross margin, as I mentioned, you always have a mix dynamic. You also have &#x2013; usually we get benefits from a cost perspective. This quarter we had more of a warranty impact and that kind of took us on the negative side.</p>
          <p>Now as far as the operating margin, yes, 34% is at a low level from what we've had before. That is not &#x2013; we're not saying we want to stay in it. We're continuing to work through. I mean we're also looking at a period of time where we're going to be investing in the portfolio to make sure that we have strategic investments that we need to make. A lot of that's going to be done through just continuing to be much more efficient in aligning our portfolio as we work through it. And as Gary mentioned before, continue to drive areas of productivity and efficiency continuing on some of the things that we've put in place over the last year to 18 months.</p>
          <p>So the overall &#x2013; if I stand back and look at the overall commitment to what we had talked about last summer or last fall I should say, we kind of looked at a three year model of revenue growth in that 5% to 7% range, profits growing at 7% to 9%. So better than balanced, growing profits faster and with that you're going to have to see some leverage, as Gary talked about. But we'll have to continue to see how that plays out, but that's the objective that we've laid out and one that we use as a management team to make sure as we make the decisions we follow through on it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold, Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks a lot. I'm glad I was able to get a question in. I wanted to follow-up on some of your commentary around data centers and thank you for the clarifications on software defined networking because I think that's caused tons of confusion for folks. But maybe if you could elaborate a little bit to help us with some context and there's really two parts to the one question and legitimately two parts. It's one question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But in terms of data centers, if we could get an understanding of your total revenue derived from data centers. So not just the data center segment but if we could get an understanding of the overall revenue coming from the data center markets including other switching products going in there, routing. I'm believing it's between 10% and 15% of revenue. I want to make sure that that's correct and then just drilling down on the partners, I think there's some concern about the coopetition environment that you addressed. But if we could get an understanding of your diversification or dependency on partners beyond the VCE partnership but how much is coming through partners and direct in that data center vertical in particular. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon, for the first part, it's almost impossible for us to get that answer. It's not that we shouldn't go through and look at it and maybe, Mel, in future times think about how we'd answer it. If you look at our run rate and what we consider data center and cloud and that's primarily the UCS categories, etcetera, the run rate is well over $1.6 billion type of run rate in terms of that segment. We're up to over I think 22% market share in North America, number two in terms of that segment and rapidly closing in the global market, just a little bit behind the number two player in terms of direction. Our value to our customers has probably never been more relevant in the data center and where we're going to go. And we &#x2013; Rob laid down a heavy comment. We work across not just an EMC VMware partnership, which is very good and very strong and very successful, but we are an open standard in terms of where we go here, and we fully will control our own destiny not to be dependent on anyone in terms of our long-term strategy, although strategic partnerships must be a part of achieving that strategy.</p>
          <p>Your thoughts, Rob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, John, as well you mentioned the Cisco ONE developers approach where we are going to give programmatic access to our operating systems. I think that's going to have a big impact on the value that customers can subscribe through our data center portfolio and it's something that we plan on leveraging going forward. So I think it's an ecosystem play, John, in summary, great relationships across multiple environments and that's exactly what our customers expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've seen this multiple times before also when we look at markets and there's often a lot of excitement, often three to five years before it really is as impactful as some people might think. And each time that has occurred Cisco has not only responded well, we usually lead the transition. We're very comfortable with doing it again, and as I said earlier, this didn't sneak up on us. We've known it's coming for a while and you'll see us address it through strategic partnerships, partnerships where we compete and partner at times. You'll see us address it through internal startups, you'll see us address it through spin-ins and acquisitions. And it's a fun one to play out.</p>
          <p>The nice thing is and this is the advantage of not being the big incumbent, is this is largely new greenfields for us to be going into and the direction. And if you think about cloud and you think about virtualization, it is more network centric than anything that's been done. You've got to know the network in this and while there's always a chance we'll be wrong, I think we'll be sitting here three to five years from now and saying it was about the network and the structure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, our next question comes from Brian White with Topeka Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, John. The cloud market 50% growth phenomenal and as we look forward, I'm wondering if there's any other pieces to the puzzle we need to add here, specifically storage, big data and what type of use cases are you seeing the most success in the storage market or in the cloud market? Is it more with enterprise customers or more with carriers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mel's giving me the signal that that's the one we're going to kind of end on in terms of the last question. So we deliver to you all being done by three o'clock as we said we would on it.</p>
          <p>In terms of the cloud, the numbers and thank you for the compliment of 50%, it was actually even better, 90% revenue and 58% on the orders. And it does speak to a market where we're just starting to get penetration, and while we have very good share versus the market, the server growth in blade servers is where all the growth is going as opposed to rack and that's where our strength clearly is.</p>
          <p>In terms of the use case for it, we're getting a lot of use and, Rob, I'm going to ask about how service providers are going to do that and some of the things we do with hosted Unified Communication to you in a second. I'll take the enterprise piece.</p>
          <p>The enterprise piece when you look and we've done our own surveys and we've looked at some outside surveys, we're getting the vast majority of the true production clouds in the enterprise space built off of Cisco and our partners. And our win rate there is extremely, extremely good. Service providers it's even better because very often they consider quote, "the incumbents" in the data center actually competitors.</p>
          <p>And, Rob, a little bit about both where we're doing from a positioning perspective and a little bit how they're using it more than just in the Service Provider space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think across our portfolio, John, the number one use case is private cloud. We're seeing, obviously, the move towards converged infrastructure playing very well to our strengths with UCS and the partners we have. The trend is our enterprise customers are looking for more benefits from automation and actually taking the benefits of virtualization even further.</p>
          <p>The second most popular use case is for cloud providers where they are looking at provisioning and management as the number one area of focus. One of our use cases that's extremely strong is our own call control call manager offering as a hosted collaboration solution where we have dozens of service providers delivering call control as an enterprise class application from those centralized data centers.</p>
          <p>The third use case is massively scalable data centers, which we're winning in and you've mentioned that before about our position there and the strength we've seen and some of the innovations we're bringing in those areas.</p>
          <p>And then obviously, there are multiple use cases that exist across the board. But those are the three that we're focused on. We're winning in enterprise class apps. We are seeing Microsoft and SharePoint and other applications. We are seeing SAP and Oracle in their virtualized environments and actually I think our strength is that we are bringing this infrastructure to enterprise class applications and matching service providers, trying to drive services for business apps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's interesting, I'm going to talk about this at the sales meeting, Rob, a little bit more. But we had two really good competitors, medium sized, that recently have said the same thing from their top sales leadership to their field and that is that as Cisco sells technology and you compete against Cisco in technology you've got a chance. The minute this goes to the business decision makers and they begin to look at a business impact cost of ownership where they're trying to achieve their business goals, they are now telling these teams &#x2013; one of them was a major wireless player and one of them was a major switch player in the data center &#x2013; they're just saying you need to go away, you're not going to beat Cisco there. And it does speak to how our strategy is coming all together. It isn't about standalone products, it's about how do you solve customer problems. Not just in theory, but having the services behind it, Gary which your team is doing amazing on; having the capability to think about how you solve their problems with the British government.</p>
          <p>I mean we did everything from job creation, to education, to helping in East London in terms of the implication to pulling off the Olympics to be an example of how you do innovation within a country and tie together the innovation centers. That's a different conversation than any company in the world has with a government leader and it's our ability to really pull that together and to teach ourselves which, Rob which I know is very key, they've not got to just learn products they've got to learn product technology architectures and then they can learn how to install their business architecture. But Brian would be the first one to lift up our enterprise environment to say that he's starting to see our ability to sell that, be more and more across the client directors in the business levels, Gary our ability to pull together services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess that's the right one to wrap up on, Mel. Bottom line for the quarter and for the year, we did what we said we would do, very pleased with the results. We appreciate you all's confidence and trust in us and continue to push us on the challenges. Our strategy and vision appears to be working well. We wouldn't have done the dividend commitment and the cash commitment if we didn't see stabilization in our business and have good confidence going forward. And most of the major market transitions we're all over and a couple of them where we've got good people we can do even better and I think you all brought it up in a couple of your questions and that's what you saw reflected in our guidance, probably more aggressive than most any of peers in the industry. We'll see if that's the right scenario or not and thank you for your confidence.</p>
          <p>Mel, let me turn it back over to you.</p>
