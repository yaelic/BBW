          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the First Quarter 2008 Results Conference Call of Bayer AG for investors and analysts on the 24th of April, 2008. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alexander Rosar, Head of Investor Relations of Bayer AG. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, <mark type="inaudible" /> Good afternoon everybody also on behalf of my colleagues, we would like to welcome you to our Q1 conference call.</p>
          <p>With us today on the call are our CEO, Mr. Werner Wenning; our CFO, Mr. Klaus K&#xFC;hn; and as always the CEOs from our subgroups Arthur Higgins from HealthCare; Friedrich Berschauer from CropScience; and Patrick Thomas from MaterialScience.</p>
          <p>Before handing over to Mr. Wenning for his presentation, I'd like to draw your attention to the forward-looking statements, which govern our call. Thank you. Mr. Wenning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, we're happy to report the successful start to the year 2008. In the first quarter, we delivered strong growth, record quarterly underlying EBITDA and EBIT, and a considerable improvement in margins. The upward trend at Bayer thus continued unabated.</p>
          <p>Q1 2008 is the 21st consecutive quarter with a year-on-year improvement in underlying EBIT. Further strategic progress was made in the quarter with the acquisition of Possis Medical to strengthen our Medrad healthcare devices business and the acquisition of Sagmel to strengthen our OTC business in the fast growing Eastern European markets.</p>
          <p>The substantial start to 2008 strengthened our confidence for the year as a whole. We're anticipating further growth, increased earnings, strong cash generation, and an improvement in margins.</p>
          <p>Let me briefly comment on our Q1 figures. Group sales advanced about 7% in the quarter if adjusted for portfolio and currency changes. This pleasing growth was mainly driven by our pharmaceuticals and crop protection businesses. The group's underlying EBITDA advanced by 10% to almost &#x20AC;2.2 billion mainly due to the excellent performance of our CropScience and HealthCare businesses. Underlying EBIT gained 9% and core earnings per share 14% over the prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>HealthCare reported the strong quarter; portfolio and currency adjusted, sales advanced 9% and underlying EBITDA 11% to over &#x20AC;1 billion. As expected, business in our Pharmaceuticals division gained momentum in the quarter. Sales improved by 10% after adjusting for currency and portfolio changes.</p>
          <p>Our key pharma products all reported strong growth. Currency adjusted figures were: Yasmin plus 33, Betaferon plus 18, Avelox also plus 18, and Mirena plus 51%. Nexavar sales more than doubled. Kogenate sales gained 22%, thanks to higher shipments of Helixate to CSL and a low reference base in the previous year.</p>
          <p>The gratifying improvement in margin shows we are continuing to capture the synergies from the sharing integration. At Pharma, we have recently launched various initiatives to more efficiently address the challenges we and the industry are facing and to secure earnings growth beyond 2009.</p>
          <p>We have stated several times that the 28% underlying EBITDA margin target for HealthCare in 2009 is just an intermediate step on our way to benchmark profitability. The measures initiated include optimizing the pharma business organization, to reduce complexity and simplify our structures; and measures to keep our welfare costs under control. Strategically, we will continue to systematically improve our portfolio and progress in external growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>The sales performance of our OTC and Diabetes business must be viewed against the strong previous year quarter where we launched the Aleve Liquid Gels and the new Ascensia Breeze blood glucose meters. The portfolio, in terms of the adjusted growth figures of 4% in OTC and 7% in the Diabetes business, does look pretty reasonable. Underlying EBIT and EBITDA both advanced nicely, up 9 and 8% respectively.</p>
          <p>CropScience numbers were superb in the first quarter. Sales were up 15% if adjusted for currency and portfolio changes. The strong performance in overall positive agricultural markets led to this growth, particularly in the seed treatment, herbicides, and fungicides business units. We achieved particularly strong Crop Protection growth. Sales were up 18% if adjusted for currency and portfolio changes, with especially strong performance in Europe and Latin America. Higher sales prices contributed 2% to the increase. We are particularly pleased with the performance of our new products, which grew 40% to over 600 million.</p>
          <p>Our BioScience business also advanced strongly. Currency and portfolio adjusted sales were up 14%. The expansion resulted mainly from the success of our InVigor canola seed business in North America. Chiefly as a result of bad weather conditions and generic competition in North America, sales of our Environmental business declined by 8% if adjusted for currencies.</p>
          <p>CropScience EBITDA before special items advanced by a very gratifying 22% to a record level of &#x20AC;713 million in the quarter. Higher volumes and higher selling prices and cost savings more than offset the margin pressure from adverse shifts in currency proprieties.</p>
          <p>Although we are unlikely to sustain the current rate of growth throughout the year, we believe the guidance of 5% currency-adjusted growth was too conservative. We now expect to exceed this level and are also upgrading our margin guidance. We are now targeting an improvement in the underlying EBITDA margin to approximately 24% this year.</p>
          <p>MaterialScience, we saw a very strong coatings raw materials business, robust volume both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter in MDI and TDI. Year-on-year, slightly weaker polyether business and non-expectedly some volume decline in polycarbonates. Overall, sales were basically flat year-on-year if adjusted for portfolio and currency changes.</p>
          <p>The main reason for the somewhat weaker growth in the Systems segment was lower raw material sales, mainly styrene. This resulted in 60 million of lost business in polyether unit, or if you look at the entire Systems business segment, accounted for roughly 3% of lost business.</p>
          <p>Polycarbonate volume suffered from weaker U.S. business, especially in the construction and automotive industries and from the competitive environment in the Asian ODS business. Bottom line performance, the MaterialScience business was better than anticipated. Underlying EBITDA was particularly at last year's level.</p>
          <p>The systems business benefited from robust demand, higher selling prices and tight cost management, which more than offset the negative impact from the raw materials and currencies. In the materials business, we consistently pursued a price before volume strategy to optimize profitability.</p>
          <p>However, these efforts were entirely cancelled out by higher raw materials and energy costs. Thanks to the increasing business performance, gross cash flow improved by 17% and net cash flow by 41% allowing us to improve operating free cash flow by 13%.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures were almost 90 million higher in the quarter, but in line with budget. Net debt was lower by 80 million in the quarter to 12.1 billion. We continue to <mark type="inaudible" /> significantly lower net debt by year end. As always this target is pre any mergers and acquisitions activity.</p>
          <p>2008 got off to an excellent start and has so far been operationally better than anticipated. This increases the confidence we have for our 2008 outlook. We are targeting further growth, high underlying EBITDA and improved margins.</p>
          <p>In light of the ongoing strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar and also against other currencies starting late March, early April, we had to adjust our currency assumption. Our planning and thus our outlook are now based on an exchange rate of $1.51 to the euro. Against previous year these assumptions diminish our sales by 1.3 to 1.4 billion and underlying EBIT by approximately 450 million. We confirm our updated HealthCare outlook mainly to grow in all divisions at or above market and to improve the underlying EBITDA margins, target, 27%.</p>
          <p>At cost side, as I've already mentioned we are now distinctly more optimistic and plan to exceed our 5% growth target and are upgrading our EBITDA margin guidance to approximately 24%. We expect robust performance in MaterialScience to continue in the second quarter with underlying EBITDA close to the Q1 2008 level.</p>
          <p>We believe that this again is an ambitious yet realistic outlook. Unfortunately currency trend has restrained us from making a more optimistic forecast. We will keep a close watch on developments and plan to update you again in our Q2 releases. Thank you very much.</p>
          <p>Now we will be happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you ladies and gentlemen.  At this time we will begin the question and answer session.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you.  Our first question comes from Richard Vosser from Bear Stearns. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for taking my question.  Hi, it's Rich Vosser from Bear Stearns.  A couple of Pharma related questions please.  I wonder if you could explain or give some more color on the component of the Helixate shipments within Kogenate, trying to understand really an idea of the organic growth of the brands in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Second question on consumer health and focusing on the Ascensia brands within Diabetes Care.  I think to my mind, the first quarter sales were slightly disappointing; the growth wasn't as I had expected.  I was wondering if you could talk whether you're seeing the same delays in placing orders that some of your competitors are seeing in the US and whether that has affected your first quarter sales number.  Then finally on the tax rate, I think the tax was below my expectations.  My calculation is a rate of about 28 and a bit percent.  I was thinking of full-year guidance around 34 to 35%.  Is that still the case?  So, basically some guidance on the full-year tax rate will be very helpful.  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for your question.  We will start with the taxing issue.  Klaus K&#xFC;hn will talk about it and then Arthur will elaborate about the healthcare related questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Richard you are correct.  Whereas at the beginning we were thinking about or guiding of our tax rate in the area of 34%, 34% plus.  We see now that the composition basically is better in our earnings profile, so that we are now targeting for full-year tax expense rate of the area of 32%.  I think the updated guidance for the full-year 32%</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Brilliant, thank you.  And going-forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And going-forward we have no, let's say information that that might be, we have no indication about specific events that that might change in the future, but it's always a little bit hard to predict these things in the future.  But at least best guess is that it will stay at these levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Stay at those levels.  Okay, brilliant thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Richard.  Richard, let me give you some numbers here.  In the quarter, we had approximately 88 million of Helixate sales, and that compares with approximately 60 million in quarter one '07.  But I am pleased to say that the overall brand growth remains robust.  Clearly, we had a shipment timing here.  You may recall that fourth quarter was rather weak in Helixate.  So, this was really a catch up.</p>
          <p>Bottom line, we remain committed to our guidance for Kogenate, and we are very pleased with the organic growth of the brand.  If we turn to our consumer business on the Ascensia brand, here again, we have to be a little careful.  We had a very tough comparative with first quarter last year when we were lunching some new Ascensia Breeze products.  Our understanding &#x2013; and we've had some perspective on our first quarter performance Richard, is that we are doing better again than our key competitors.  We expect to gain further market share this year and are pretty confident that we'll have another strong year in our diabetes care business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Brilliant, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Mr. Thomas Gilbert from UBS.  Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got one or two question from UBS, thank you.  For Patrick probably, Savic, are they behaving now or have they stopped selling for volume and is the integration there going a little bit better?  What do you see in the marketplace there?  And then the second question is related to Pharma.  Obviously very strong growth in the multiple sclerosis arena, 18% I understand.  Probably, two thirds of that were price and a third volume if I'm correct. And I was wondering if you could a little bit talk about regional development for price and volume prescription progression for better there on and how that continued in the second quarter and for the rest of the year.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let's start with BMS. Patrick...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I appreciate your question about Savic.  I think it would be wrong for me comment on Savic's behavior, so I'll avoid doing that.  Maybe just to give you some color on what's happening in polycarbonates, we've tended to follow a price before volume strategy in polycarbonates, particularly as we are seeing particularly in Korea some decline in the ODS market.  So, generally the ODS market has been the battleground in Asia.  There are a large number of players in Asia who can satisfy the needs of the ODS market, which are truly regional players.</p>
          <p>So that's an area we've tended to step away from more and concentrate on the higher value added compounded business.  So, within the whole world of polycarbonates, different players are playing different games.  We're tending to focus on the value-added applications of polycarbonates and we probably reduced our total share in optical discs by 2 or 3% as part of our portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I take if I understand you correctly, you're implying that you could continue with that strategy for a couple of quarters or is it going to eventually hit you at the operate &#x2013; at the capacity utilization rates in terms of you hitting your fixed-cost and then you get margin squeezes, because you're saying you can fill the plants in a different way. Is that what you're saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely and just to give you one sort of fact on our side.  We have still held back on the start-up of our second line in Chao-Ching.  We will choose to start that line up when the market needs that capacity.  Our fixed cost associated with that line are very, very, very low, because it's an integrated second stream in the existing plant in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Thomas.  What I would say is just as I explained the comparter on Ascensia where we had a strong first-quarter.  We had a weak first quarter in 2007 with Betaferon So, there's that aspect. Geographically, really quite pleasing performance on U.S. business comes to adjusted growth, approximately 18%, rest of the world close to 20%.  Clearly we are getting significant price in the U.S. but very modest price outside of the U.S.</p>
          <p>The only other geography I would point to, we are seeing some strong &#x2013; we did see some strong business in Russia in the first quarter, and obviously as you know the Russian buy-in patterns can be a little spiky.  But what it does give us is very good confidence in our overall performance.  We launched last year what we call better-selling Betaferon.  It's not a sophisticated program; it's simply getting back to the basics.  And we do believe that's having an impact, and as a result we're very confident that we will grow in line with our guidance 7 to 9% this year for the Betaferon franchise.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Mr. Paul Walsh of Morgan Stanley.  Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  The first question I had was on the pharmaceutical business, relating to synergies, how much do you think incrementally you delivered in the first quarter?  Secondly on Nexavar, it might be a difficult thing to do, but can you give us an indication as to how much of the Q1 number was liver or more simplistically have we seen a plateauing in kidney in terms of sales?  My second question relates to the crop protection business.  In terms of price increases, do we think that's sustainable through the balance of this year?  That would be the question on Crop.  Just lastly on material science, MDI looks like pricing was okay in the first quarter.  Are we still worried about potential capacity additions coming through later this year and disruptional pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let's start with the Pharma and Nexavar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this time with Paul, your question on synergies.  Synergies were approximately a 100 million for the quarter compared to the prior year and approximately 20% of those synergies were fresh synergies.  And Paul we are very, again confident that we'll deliver on our commitment of realizing 80% of our synergies before the end of 2008.  In regard to Nexavar, Paul it is a little bit difficult, but let me try and give you a little help here.  We believe our RCC share has stabilized and clearly the bulk of the growth is coming now from HCC and if I was pushed, I would say approximately 40 to 50% of the sales in the quarter could be coming from HCC, but as you are well aware Paul, we don't have perfect data here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And cost for enterprising?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cost for enterprising, first of all we are happy that we have been successful in increasing our prices as you know the discussion we had months and years ago.  Your question, if tended to be sustainable, we believe yes, there will be regional differences.  We are very optimistic in Europe as well as in Latin America.  In North America it might be more difficult, but overall we believe that we could continue in this task.</p>
          <p>In the long year, third comment which is in my opinion an important one.  It's not directed to price, but to value creation.  Mr. Wenning mentioned that we increased our trades of new-products innovation by 40% in the fourth quarter. That means now that in cost protection our new products contribute to roundabout running short of our global turnover in cost protection is very, very important.  Because we need to keep in mind that the overall average margin of our new product, that's significantly higher compared to the old one.  So, combining all these factors we are as optimistic for the rest of the year and at least confirming from what my side our guidance is continuing to generate approximately 24%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On our prices, in our MDI?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Paul, the MDI position is quite interesting.  The volumes are up year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.  The prices are stable year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.  So, the underlying growth seems to be good.  That is against the context of Nippon polyurethane bringing on 200,000 tons expected in Japan.  Although that seems to be constrained by raw material feedstocks currently, and that seems to be a structural issue.  Yang-Tai Yuan Yuar in China bought on about 40,000 tons, which has not had a major impact.</p>
          <p>The net capacity addition is our own at the end of the year.  The earlier start-up of that factory will be in the middle at the end of quarter four this year.  Obviously, we are already pre-marketing material for that fund.  So, there is some pricing effect, but your observation is correct.  The expected price decline is not as sharp as some people had forecasted.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  Just a couple of questions please.  Firstly Arthur, I just wanted to hear if you've had any clarity over and above what we do on the potential timing of a generic Yasmin, clearly we haven't seen that yet, and how much of that uncertainty is affecting your unwillingness to take margin guidance for the full-year up, given that you have reported very strong margin for healthcare in the first quarter?  First question.</p>
          <p>The second question again on margins on the consumer side, to the highest margin in this division for four or five quarters.  I just wanted some color on the sustainability of that.  Then a final very broad question on the hemophilia factor-8 market, Wyeth has recently seen approval of a new plasma-free, alkaline-free product.  Just wondering if you think the launch of that in the third quarter is going to change growth or share dynamics for Kogenate.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Obviously, I am not going to speculate on Yasmin in terms of genericization, but perhaps again remind everybody, the contribution that Yasmin in the U.S. represents of the total Yasmin family.  In the first quarter, it is now below 25% of their global sales.  So, again I think it puts in context the exposed business year, but that's all I am at liberty to comment on.  As far as consumer, we have been very pleased with our consumer businesses.</p>
          <p>They continue to outgrow the market, and we've made a commitment that as they do so, you should continue to expect margin improvements.  So, that's a trend that you should expect to see continued.</p>
          <p>In terms of hemophilia and the launch of the Wyeth product, we have not seen any material impact in that. It's something we are monitoring closely, but we believe we have a very strong position in this market, the benefits of Kogenate are well-established.  So we obviously monitor any new entrant, but at this stage I'm not seeing any impact in our business.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Merrill Lynch again.  A couple of things.  Firstly on MaterialScience from systems, I just wondered if you could walk me through how the EBITDA improved almost 40 million year-on-year, considering sales actually shrank by just over a percent.  I'm guessing it is a combination of those cost savings starting to come through, and maybe product mix, but I just wondered if you could elaborate on the reason for that particularly positive outcome.  The second question is in CropScience; very, very impressive numbers in herbicides, when you consider 2007 and the step change you have seen in the first quarter.  I wonder if Dr. Berschauer could talk through what's gone on in the herbicide in the first quarter and what your feelings are now for the full year?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, MaterialScience.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Andrew, the system's EBITDA is a mixture of effects.  The first is a sort of fundamental effect that for the first time in a while we are seeing price and volume significantly greater than the negative impact of raw materials compared to the prior quarter, and that's certainly the fundamental driver.  There is also a mixed effect in the co-product styrene that we produce on our POSM unit in the Netherlands was taken out of operation during a shutdown, so you get a product mix effect there, so the volumes were reduced but the volumes were of a reasonably low margin product.  So that has an impact as well.  But generally I think the overriding effect was price and volume were roughly three times positive on EBIT compared to the raw material cost increase, it's basically pricing power.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, in the first quarter there was something of the order of 30 million of positive effect.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Friedrich Berschauer. Herbicide turnover you are absolutely right, these are impressive numbers, but these numbers are mainly driven by Europe and specifically cereal herbicides.  So cereal herbicides, Europe that was the main driver.  On top of it we had new product introduction <mark type="inaudible" /> in United States is also contributing, though the strong demand for cereals, the new direction in terms of insecticide products in Europe also helped.  So that has been the main reason for this impressive herbicide number.  But our cereal herbicides application now is just now basically, so of course you can't expect that these high improvements will continue for the full year.  It's the mainly cereal herbicides Europe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But would it be fair to say that the price component of the growth in cereal herbicides, and therefore herbicides as a whole, was much greater than the other product categories?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what's very important when we talk about cereal herbicides is that our margins in the cereal herbicides are very, very good and it helps in terms of our profitability, that's of key importance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon.  Can you talk a little bit in CropScience on stock effects, and just could you clarify also the environmental science issue. I didn't quite understand where is the generic competition coming from, what's the factors behind it.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; I mean, Yasmin, I thought it was only one of the three patents was invalidated, why are the other two seemingly pointless as patents if they are not there to protect. I mean and if they're fairly pointless does that mean that the sundry or the remaining patents on Yaz as well are unenforceable?  Could you just explain that?  The other contraceptive, the Mirena that seems to really be growing very strongly, I wonder why suddenly that was taking off.  And lastly, just on the totality of group cost reduction benefits that are likely to come through this year, you mentioned 100 million so far I think in healthcare, 30 million in CropScience.  What is the totality of it likely to be for the group this year?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Let's start Andrew with CropScience and Mr. Berschauer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes stock effects &#x2013; so if you had watched the numbers of the whole industry, the first quarter overall was very good.  This was mainly driven of course by the overall very good business environment.  But this very, very strong first quarter was also driven by the reaction of our customer distributors because there was some rumor in the marketplace that some products would be short which in some cases was right.  So this was the main reason for these very early orders.  Now of course it depends very much how the weather conditions will be, Newark for example because it started to go to the ground, presently the weather situation is quite positive, we have good conditions just now so, we believe that the stock effect will disappear rapidly so, that it will be real business, it means the products have been used.  Your question in terms of our environmental science business development, undoubtedly disappointing, specifically in United States.  The rest &#x2013; other regions are okay. In United States we have generic competition specifically in terms of EBITDA growth rate.  We already talked about during our last conferences about this situation so this has not significantly changed.  In the consumer business in the United States, the consumer spending is rather weak, this is also an effect in the first quarter and on top of it, in United States the weather condition for our consumer business in the first quarter was relative forties .  Overall we believe that we had the most significant peak now in the first quarter, and we believe that for the rest of the year we could perform more or less according with the performance in the last year for the two and three and four.  That's the present situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Yasmin and patent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Andrew, I hate to you correct but that is not the case.  We believe all of our patents are of value, and indeed you should be aware that we're using an additional patent to sue both Watson and Sandoz.  So all of our patents are valuable and we use them I think to the best effect to protect our assets.  In regards to Mirena, I think this is another good example of the sort of better execution that you've seen in the women's health franchise since it's been a part of BHP.  We, in December, began in the U.S. for the first time direct-to-consumer advertising of Mirena and we've clearly identified a very significant unmet medical need for this type of product.  So we expect a very strong year for the Mirena franchise in the U.S. and indeed globally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Andrew our cost reduction programs, Klaus K&#xFC;hn will summarize the effect, the group effect.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, for the Group we forecast roughly savings in this year of cumulative roughly 500 million, more or less 280 or so allocated to the Schering integration in HealthCare, roughly 140 to the river prole and BMS, and 60 additional on CropScience, and then let's say 20 asundries and then the overall overhead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great.  Can I just get back on the issue of patents because I thought the 531 patent was just one of three patents.  I wasn't aware of any judgment invalidating the other two, and yet you're recommending that people be cautious with the expectation of generic competition even though there appear to be two valid patents protecting Yasmin on the -- I just don't understand that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, first of all you're right, the 531, there's two other valid patents.  I think based on our experience with the 531 where we clearly believed and still believe we had a very strong patent position, and obviously we will appeal that decision.  I think it's only prudent that we advise our investors to be aware that in all patent disputes, you have to be cautious.</p>

          <p>Yes, thank you.  Two questions.  First of all Crop Protection, Dr. Berschauer, you've already partly talked about that.  But how has the underlying business fared so far in April since we are already heading into the last week of April both in U.S. dollars and the U.S.?  And then second of all regarding MaterialScience, can you give us an assessment of current and future business prospects in North America for MaterialScience, and in addition I already asked this during the full-year conference call, do you so far see any spillover of a weak U.S. consumer into your Asian MaterialScience businesses, I'm thinking of furniture, sneakers, et cetera?

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Certainly business in the first quarter in North America has cooled down slightly.  The construction industry domestically has cooled down, which means clearly the impact on furniture purchases.  Luckily the rest of the world is very bullish on furniture.  So we just moved the material primarily to Asia.  Construction of industrial and commercial buildings is actually increasing in the U.S. at the moment, and that's the more important market for us from the point of view of insulation materials.  So it's only really the private housing that is down.  Automotive is slightly down in the U.S. in terms of domestic production, but foreign vehicles up.  In terms of spillover, the effect is primarily driven in polycarbonate, because that is virtually the only material we are manufacturing in China, which -- or selling in China, which moves back into the U.S.  Most of the polyurethanes and coatings materials stay inside China with the product.  And we are now seeing really that part of our business driven by the Chinese economy, rather than the export from China.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen.  I have one remaining question, it's a financial one.  On the pension liabilities, it was -- during the first quarter it was down almost by &#x20AC;1 billion.  That is quite a change during one quarter.  Could you just explain why that was the case, it's almost &#x20AC;1.1 per share?  And was it only because of the accounting differences like changing interest rates or were there any cash contributions to add to pension liabilities?  And then secondly perhaps a follow-on on Yasmin.  Are you still promoting Yaz at the moment?  I noticed in March the market share of Yaz was down month-on-month for the first time ever.  So if you could give a comment there.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  First pensions and then Yasmin, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes you're correct, and your assumption is also correct that this reduction in pension liabilities is almost completely related to the increase in the discount rate which has to be applied here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So how do you define your discount rate, is that government bond or some commercial BB plus ... ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; then that wouldn't be the case.  It's usually price of an iBoxx, let's say AA bond index, and that is the one which is commonly used here in Germany.  And as this index also includes, let's say, some AA banks, so the spreads have there also increased to some degree and that may have also played a role, but it's not the increase in normal yields but it is generally the increase in spreads which we see, which generally increases the yield.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We are very much still promoting Yaz, and we are very pleased with how the product is responding.  I think you may be referring to a little anomaly that happened in quite a few markets in late March, which was really the Easter effect.  So we saw the total market for oral contraceptives tail down in the end of March. But the products -- you had asked me how the other products are doing.  Let me tell you that April looks very good for our women's healthcare franchise in the U.S.  So that would confirm that that was simply an Easter effect, and let me finish by saying we are now very pleased that Yaz has overtaken Yasmin in the U.S. as we predicted it would do.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe in this context let me make another remark with regard to pension liabilities. This discount increase has often an effect on the financial results and the overall guidance, I would like to make it that we see the full year's financial results in the area of 1 billion, so that would mean 250 million for the following quarter, which is maybe somewhat above some of the expectations. One reason for that is the increase in discount rate which also increases the interest portion on all pension liabilities. On the other hand secondly, this quarter we bought back bonds, which also has some one-time negative impact and also keep in mind that in previous year, we had some extraordinary currency gains, which we usually do not budget for for the year. So keep in mind for that guidance overall financial results for the year at minus 1 billion roughly.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. A couple of questions; one on CropScience and a couple of parts to that. Just looking at the price increase, I wonder if you are able at all to talk to either in absolute terms or give us some guidance on how that split between your &#x20AC;600 million of new products and the rest? And with that whether you could just remind me on what your target for new product sales is? And secondly on the price increase, how it compared to the development in raw materials during the quarter?</p>
          <p>And then, the second question is on Pharma and this may be a too simplistic view &#x2013; a way of looking at things, but if you look at the Pharma sales year-on-year excluding &#x2013; outside of those products that you split out, there was a drop of about 9%. Now I appreciate some of that's going to be to do with currency. But I wonder if you could give a little bit more color on the sort of tale of Pharma products? Thank you.</p>

          <p>So pricing we need to differentiate between new products and older products. With new products &#x2013; we are introducing new products, we are, for this time to start with a very, very high price because later on it's very difficult to increase prices. So our &#x2013; the impact we &#x2013; what we have achieved in the first quarter, with about 2% price increases was mainly based on price increases in terms of our older portfolio and the total value of price increase was exactly &#x20AC;23 million in the first quarter.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>And, Neil, regarding our tail end products the currency adjusted number was approximately a 6% decline and the biggest contributor to that was obviously Trasylol, where you know that we suspended the sales of Trasylol. So I don't think there is anything to be concerned there. The rest is flat.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. A few product questions and then just a general margin question on Pharma please. And starting with Trasylol &#x2013; when are we going to get the final data of your study where you'll be able to decide really what you're going to be doing with Trasylol? Because you're saying its temporary suspension at the moment.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I noticed that Levitra is now essentially flat. This is a product that requires a lot of consumer promotion I guess, and you see Cialis from Lilly in particular doing very well. Is there anything that you can do to revitalize your Levitra franchise?</p>
          <p>On Yasmin, forgive my ignorance here, but Barr won against the 531 patent. You've now sued on the 652 patent and you've sued two other people. Is Barr completely clear on the 652 patent or could they also be caught up in this additional litigation?</p>
          <p>And a question on Nexavar; I know that it is difficult for you to perhaps know exactly what the drug is being used for in terms of indication. You must know exactly where it is geographically. So perhaps you could give us a little bit more help in terms of the countries where you're seeing strong uptake of the product.</p>
          <p>And the margin question was a very broad one. When you get to your guided target, you still don't give us a breakdown of the traditional way, if we look at pharmaceutical companies, would you like to tell us where you feel you are still adrift from your peers in terms of margin? Are you still &#x2013; still have higher cost of goods? Is it still more R&amp;D in relation to sales than your peers? So just give us some sort of sense there, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jo. Quite a few questions. Regarding Trasylol, it is not our study, Jo, it's a study done by Canadian investigators, the so-called BART study. And as it's not our study, we have no way of accessing this data. It's very frustrating from our perspective that we have a study that was published last autumn that we, as a company, have had no visibility to. So we are very frustrated by that and we can offer no guidance because it's not in our control.</p>
          <p>As far as Levitra goes, I would not take too much conclusion from the first quarter. First of all, you have to remind yourself that Levitra is distributed through Schering-Plough and GSK in the U.S., so you don't really see in on our numbers the end market performance. And we believe, overall, we are growing in line and maybe a little better than market with Levitra.</p>
          <p>As for Yasmin, you are correct in your assumption that we have given Barr in our dispute the fact that we would not pursue litigation in other patents &#x2013; or I should say Schering had given Barr that release.</p>
          <p>As far as Nexavar, your question was on geographical split?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you can't help us, which I understand, on the indication.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Give me one second; I can definitely give you that. Yeah; sorry. Yeah, Nexavar, the split, U.S. was 34 million in the U.S. in the quarter and obviously 67 million rest of world. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a little bit more insight into the rest of the world that I was keen to get. If you could help us where &#x2013; which countries you've got good penetration in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, it's really across the board. I mean our &#x2013; strong growth in Europe, which probably accounts for the bulk of the market to date, but all geographies, Jo, are showing really strong progression. In summary, we are seeing much stronger growth outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. So the territories outside of the U.S. are performing very well.</p>
          <p>As far as margin guidance, I would remind everybody that you can all do the math. For us to be at 28% for HealthCare, means that Pharma has to have a three in front of it. Okay? We believe at a 30% plus EBITDA margin for Pharma, we're very much closing the gap. I would like to say that this is as much as us increasing our margin, which it is the case, but also as you are aware of, Jo, the others unfortunately are coming to meet us as their profits are decreasing.</p>
          <p>So the delta, whether it's in cost, R&amp;D or geographical mix, I would say the people who are enjoying a better margin have a higher &#x2013; historically a higher percentage of their business in the U.S., as you know the most challenging market. And you've seen already people reporting from historical 50% of the global market being the U.S. is now moving towards 40%.</p>
          <p>But let me also mention something that we take a lot of pride in, that I think some of you already noticed, which is we are punching, as some of you have said, above our weight in the emerging markets. If you look at our pharmaceutical business in Russia, in China, in Mexico, in Brazil, and in South Korea, here we are seeing very dynamic growth with more than a third of our growth coming in pharmaceuticals from these key markets where clearly we are a top five player in average. So, I think we have a geographical benefit going for us, as well as, in a perverse way, we're less exposed to the downturn of the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Jean De Watteville from Lehman Brothers, please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon, Jean De Watteville, Lehman. Some question on Crop Protection again. Firstly, on insecticide, in this quarter you have a pretty low growth that has surprised me, only 3.5%. Can you just pass through what are the reasons of that slow growth in insecticides, if it's phasing out of all chemistries that is the explanation?</p>
          <p>Second question still on insecticide, I understand organophosphate are getting incredibly tight, because of shortage of phosphorus. Bayer used to be very exposed to organophosphates. I know that you have phased out a lot of your organophosphate products. Can you just pass through how big is your organophosphate business right now, and what is the price trend that you are enjoying right now in this product category?</p>
          <p>Third question on Crop Protection, I understand you recognize that there is some stock effect in Q1, Syngenta, in their conference call, has been actually a little more specific in giving their &#x2013; what is their best guess, what is the pre-buying contribution in Q1 and they came with a figure of 3 to 4%. I wonder if I could share with us what is your own guess of the pre-buying contribution in Q1? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, may I start with your last question, stock effect I would be a little bit more careful overall, I think if you read what Syngenta is publishing and guidance we are giving overall, I see no major differences if you compare the performance in the first quarter and the outlook they are giving for the rest of the year. So, overall I think it's more or less, at least for me it's the same.</p>
          <p>Talking about insecticides, you are right, insecticides performance was a little bit lower, our hope was 10%. Here we have to keep in mind that imidacloprid is our most important product. As you know, we have no patent protection anymore. But we are very pleased to report that even in spite of patent protection we could keep the total sales volume of imidacloprid. So that's, in my opinion, a clear achievement.</p>
          <p>In terms of organophosphates, you are right, we have agreed on plan to phase out organophosphates in the insecticide segment. In terms of pricing, there is no significant difference compared to other products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, can I ask you, in imidacloprid, is it a price effect; are you still seeing declining price effect in this product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are in &#x2013; specifically in imidacloprid, we are performing volume strategy, so we are decreasing prices to some degree and improving volume significantly keeping overall top-line constant.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Andreas Heine from UniCredit. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good afternoon. Andreas Heine from UniCredit. First I would like to ask one question regarding U.S. dollar sensitivity. You have given your new budget and the implication this has to sales and EBIT. If the outcome of the U.S. dollar is even weaker than this, can we extrapolate the change from the 1.45 to the 1.51 or do we then do something wrong on this?</p>
          <p>Secondly, could you give the split, especially for the U.S., of Yasmin and Yaz, you said that Yaz for the first time had higher sales that Yasmin. But maybe you can put a figure behind this?</p>
          <p>And in MaterialScience the Systems is doing very well quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter. So as you will guide for our lower earnings into the next quarter, I would assume that once again materials are of concern. So would it go even down to the loss situation on EBITDA level?</p>
          <p>And last but not least on Crop Protection, you have already mentioned the price environment for that &#x2013; they are, especially for the older products, better. And you have also said that imidacloprid  is a little bit down in prices. So does it mean that for these older products have price and these increase are in the magnitude of 5 to 6% of what, could we read out of this? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Start with your first question Mr. Heine, currency and currency in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Heine, you're right we gave you some guidance what the impact would be if the currency market would be as forecast &#x2013; that's including the dollar at 151. That was not only a dollar, you keep in mind the dollar is roughly 50% of our foreign exchange credit exposure. And as Mr. Wenning said at that level we see &#x2013; we forecast 1.4 billion impact on sales and roughly 450 million on clean EBIT. Now if the market would move into the levels of the end of the quarter as we have seen and actually so that would mean for instance for $1, 1.58 and also the other currencies as they were at the end of the quarter, that impact would change to 1.8 billion in sales and another 100 million for 550 million in the clean EBIT. By the way maybe you should also know that if this overall has an impact on our overall EBITDA margin for the group of roughly 0.6% and most affected was the CropScience here with 1.5% roughly and half percent for BMS and 0.3% for Healthcare. That's basically the sensitivities as we see them.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. I think you asked about the Yasmin split?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yasmin split in between U.S. and ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The Yasmin family, 48% of our revenues come from the U.S., which was in the quarter approximately 142 million euro. Of that 76 million were Yaz. So more than half was Yaz and now, well you can do the maths, its 67 for Yasmin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andreas I think you asked a question about Systems. Clearly Systems are going to dominate the generation of EBIT and EBITDA. Going from the second quarter it is very clear that we will approach the level of the first quarter. Our aim for the full year is to make sure that we generate a positive EBIT at materials. That will be my key target for 2008 and I would expect to achieve that unless there were some real shocks in the area of raw material prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Crop price environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Presumably that group that's specifically shore bound . We need to differentiate between imidacloprid as spray product or indiscernible product where we have not patent protection. But we are using imidacloprid in a lot of combinations. Where we have patent protection we are using imidacloprid for example in treatment where we also have patent protection so it's a very differentiated picture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But then overall if you have a decline in imidacloprid and you do not increase prices for your new products, that means that for let's say the rest of the 50% the price increase has to be substantially higher than the 2%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's continue in terms of imidacloprid, we need to differentiate so we have a system, we contribute the turnover to the solo product of course and if we have a combination say contribution is to the product. It has the combination, it has the highest value. So again it's a very complicated &#x2013; over complicated calculation.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. This is Preeti from BNK Securities, India. I have a couple of questions for the Bayer CropScience division that is the Indian division. The first one Bayer CropScience in India has closed one of its plants in a place called Thane and the plan is fled across 108 acres and the management has given VRS to most of its workers. I wanted to know as to what the company is &#x2013; what type of plans does the company have to do to deal with that land and number two what type of growth do you see for the Indian CropScience and Bioscience divisions and what strategy do you have in place for the Indian division? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sort of, you are right, we restructured Thane, but we are very committed to our Indian business in CropScience. We are the company from the domestic companies having the highest market share. We have impressive growth rates in India and we are committed to grow our business in all our divisions. This means the crop protection and environmental science is also in bioscience, so strong commitment, strong growth, big support for India.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Two questions if I may. Just a quick update, could you give us an idea where we are with Xarelto in terms of patient recruitments and exposure? And second question goes back to Barr and something Jo mentioned earlier you've mentioned that you're not pursuing Barr on a 652 patent. I mean is there any explanation for why you're approaching it that way? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me answer this. The Barr question first. As I explained this part of our litigation with Barr is a restate of our intent to sue them under the other patents, but we are as you know appealing the decision on the 531 patent in the U.S. In respect to Xarelto it is not our intention to provide any more safety update, we provided that last December. We will provide an update on patients exposed and safety data. At the same time we submit our registration in the U.S. in the summer of this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. First question regarding Bayer HealthCare. Adalat is still doing quite fine if I'm right, you will lose your global ECC patent in 2008. Should we figure in any downturn for the coming ongoing year in Adalat?  Second question, Mirena you said you have this advertising campaign 5th of December. Did that lead to some kind of stocking effect in the first quarter or is the first quarter real underlying demand meaning should we continue with such a high number or high development here. And Xeralto, you're presenting something at indiscernible I believe. Will that be the U.S. filing package or have you any schedule for the indiscernible conference presentation?</p>
          <p>And then a question to biomaterial science. Patrick you mentioned before you acquired BayReach for benzene prices. You expected them to rise. Obviously, we have significantly higher oil price, but benzene prices do not rise as much as oil prices which means market seems to be less tight here. Any new outlook from your side for the benzene price? And a last question actually on polycarbonate, you are now at breakeven on the EBIT side. I believe if you have potentially the best cost structure in the world meaning others have potentially have losses on the EBIT side. Do you see any reaction right now from other competitors and if they are loss-making do they change their behavior in the market in your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes let's start with &#x2013; this time with BMS, Patrick you are fully effective...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me talk a little bit about those mysterious benzene phenomenon. I guess if we look back over the last couple of years, we have seen the traditional march in over naphtha for benzene go from what was $400 for many, many, many years to 650 and above and now dropped to a level of just over 100. I think what's going on is of course the oil price and the naphtha price is rising at rates which the benzene market cannot actually sustain. There are two factors there. One is that the mobile &#x2013; top six regulations in America are now requiring refiners to drop lead benzene into the gasoline pool and that releases nearly 800,000 tons of benzene into the market. And second thing is that quite a number of the on purpose styrene production facilities have actually closed because of lack of profitability in styrene. So the benzene market is certainly longer than we expected at the moment. These will affect &#x2013; we had expected to kick in 2009 along with additional aromatics capacity. And what we've seen is a market effect rather than the capacity effect kicked in slightly earlier. Whether that will be sustained through to the second half of the year is a good question. So I remain with my previous guidance that I gave at the end of last year on overall raw material. But I think the benzene point is interesting to watch and of course it's reflected in toluene as well. The raw material impact we are seeing most at the moment it's actually propylene price. The biggest single hit we have at the moment is propylene, which has risen much further than we expected and that's probably causing us more problems through the polyether polyols part of our business. In terms of your comments on polycarbonate, I think your analysis is perfectly correct. I wish that the behavior would follow your logic of the analysis. Certainly there must be producers who are EBIT negative. We have over 1.2 million tons of capacity in the polycarbonate market, which is probably the largest slating of capacity. We have the lowest cost manufacturing process and we're at breakeven on EBIT. As you can see, others must be suffering a lot more than we are.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting with Adalat. We've been faced with generic competition in many markets. And I think we're all but dealing with that very effectively. The other important point with Adalat is we are seeing good growth in the Asia Pacific region particularly China, where again it's offsetting any impacts of genericization. So we're very pleased with the performance. We think we can go to single, low single digits. As far as Mirena is concerned, I think there clearly was some stocking effect, a 50% comes to adjusted growth in the first quarter that can't be repeated in a sustainable manner. However to give you a perspective on that, I'll say that in the U.S. the brand is growing close to 20%, we as I mentioned believe we've uncovered a very significant market need in the U.S. So you are going to see a very strong year for Mirena, how strong I'm not prepared to commit at this stage, however please do not assume it's going to be 50% growth. But we do have in Mirena, a very exciting asset that we will make a very substantial asset. As far as Effort is concerned we have not made any final decision as to what will be presented with at Effort. We will make that decision shortly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's impossible for us to judge. What we are seeing is that, there was a lot of prescription demand. How much of that was, when you have a very rapid take-off to people over stock perhaps for the, the most important message here is we have clearly a significant opportunity with Mirena.</p>

You mentioned in the introduction of further growth from external sources acquisitions &#x2013; just a reminder of exactly where that might be, size of acquisition. I know you've got that debt targets in place, but just a bit more transparency on that. Are we closer to anything tangible?</p>

          <p>Look, we would like to share with you our future that's among the ad activities when we really did a transaction. This was our behavior in the past and will be our behavior in the future, but I can only repeat what we said of the past and I reconfirmed it today that it is our clear intention that we are going to expand our businesses mainly our healthcare business internally and of course, we are looking also for external options and we are pleased to join with you our thoughts when different action is disclosed.</p>
