          <p>Thanks for joining us today. This morning Apache Corporation released third quarter 2008 results, which totaled net income of $1.2 billion or $3.52 per diluted share and cash flow of 2.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located on our website. In addition, any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations, or costs incurred will be identified as such with the reconciliation located on our website at www.apachecorp.com.</p>
          <p>I'll note that we routinely put important information on our website, and as an example, last week we had an analysts' meeting in Houston, and we currently have slides from that meeting on our website for your review. On today's call, Steve Farris, our CEO, and Roger Plank, our CFO, will make prepared remarks prior to taking questions. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings conference call. During the quarter, Apache's international portfolio once again demonstrated its strength and momentum through drilling success and our sustained progress in delivering our pipeline of development projects and strong earnings of $3.52.</p>
          <p>And I'd like to echo Bob's comments and thank all of those who attended our yearly analysts' conference last week in Houston. We really did appreciate the opportunity to walk through some of the details of our portfolio and the growth plays that we have that we're presenting around the world, and I'd encourage those who did not listen to view our website and listen to our webcast. Today in my remarks, I'd like to review just quickly our position and our outlook and then give you some activity highlights from our regions.</p>
          <p>I think, first of all, Apache is in a very strong and honestly differentiated position in the current volatile environment. Our portfolio is balanced, which benefits our shareholders across multiple business environments. That means we're balanced across products, pricing benchmarks, international basins and play types.</p>
          <p>We also hold strong positions in all of the places we operate with a number one producer in Egypt's western desert, with a number two producer in the western Australia, with a number one producer in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico shelf, with a number three producer in Oklahoma, and along with our partner in Canada, we're the number one producer in the Ootla shale play in Canada. Our strategic platforms in building value in mature basins, our international exploration in global gas are aligned with long term realities for this energy industry.</p>
          <p>We're financially stronger than we've ever been. We have seven development projects underway that alone are expected to add about 120,000-barrels of oil equivalent to our production over the next four years. We have a resource depth, as we updated in our conference last week, with 9.8 billion barrels equivalent of resource potential on our 36 million acres across the globe. And finally and probably most importantly, Apache's culture has gotten to this point, and that strength will continue to guide us in the future.</p>
          <p>I'd like to summarize quickly our immediately outlook. In the short term, we intend to live within our means. We've been living within our means for a number of years now, which puts us in a very comfortable relative position in the industry. We're going to stick with our conservative principles, and we review our investment plans on a quarterly basis. We're going to remain focused on execution on two fronts, delivering our pipeline of development projects and continuing our exploration in our ACE countries of Australia, Canada, and Egypt.</p>
          <p>We have a strong balance sheet. We have approximately $2 billion in cash, plus another $2 billion available in credit facilities. We've stayed out of the asset market for some time now as the recent spike in commodity prices made it &#x2013; good deals hard to find. Things are clearly changing now, at least presently, and we are going to evaluate asset opportunities selectively. We have a lot of opportunities within our portfolio, and we're not in any rush. We'd only consider opportunities that would advance our portfolio and generate long-term value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Last week, we provided production growth perspective for 2009 of 6 to 14%, and I know that's a wide range. I think everyone would agree that uncertainty is abnormally high right now. Assuming we do recover the 2008 shut-in volumes in Australia and Gulf of Mexico that I'll go over in a minute, we would grow at about 6%, and we expect our development projects should add another 6 to 7% for the potential of a 13 to 14% growth rate. But within that range, our annual growth rate will depend upon the level of capital spending for the year. And our planning process has been just begun. Frankly until we get closer to 2009 and get a better idea of price and cash flow, it makes no sense to zero on a capital number at the present time.</p>
          <p>I think, if you back up a little bit, I think we don't make widgets. I mean, the opportunity ahead for us has never been greater. Despite the recent downturn, the world still needs energy to the tune of 85 million barrels of oil a day and an ever-increasing quantities of gas. Just yesterday, the International Energy Agency upcoming annual study was quoted by the Financial Times as having found oil fields globally to decline rate of 9.1% per year and 6.4% expected even with large investments to the tune of $360 billion. And I noticed today that the IEA has said that the article was misleading and several months old, but I think it does point to the fact that no one can deny that there's &#x2013; needs to be tremendous capital in order to meet the demand over the next several years.</p>
          <p>In any event, we're going continue to be conservative in the balance of our capital program with our cash flow. With the frenzied boom time activity coming to a halt, we believe it's an opportunity to build long-term value.</p>
          <p>I'd like to address specifically the results for the quarter, and Roger is going to cover the financials in much more detail. I'm going to speak to our production for the quarter. Production, as you saw I'm sure in the release, was 511,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. That's 7% below second quarter of 2008, which is entirely due to the outages in Australia and the Gulf of Mexico. And we expect to recover substantially all of those volumes by year-end.</p>
          <p>In Australia, we restored partial production on Varanus Island during the third quarter of 2008, but we still lost a net of about 75 million a day and about 2,800 barrels of oil per day due to the pipeline explosion, which is relative to the second quarter of '08. Net production of 4,000 barrels of oil per day and 78 million cubic feet of gas a day remains shut-in and should be restored by year-end.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. substantially all the production variance relative to the second quarter of 2008 was a result of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Most of this shut-in production was due to pipeline and processing facility issues. As of now, we anticipate those to be cleared by year-end. Only 12% of our shut-in production is associated with platforms that we actually operate.</p>
          <p>Apache had four operated and two non-operated platforms which were, which were lost. These contributed volumes of about 7.5 million a day and 1,200 barrels of oil per day in the previous totals. We expect to be able to recover all but about 1,100 barrels a day from those leases because a couple of the platforms were lost were processing platforms instead of producing platforms, which will allow us to take the production to alternative processing locations.</p>
          <p>We're currently producing about 250 million a day and 38,000 barrels of oil per day, but by year-end we expect the worst to be behind us. For the year the one on Varanus Island and hurricane events reduced our annual production growth by 3% each or 6% in total. These events didn't affect our reserves, and actually if we're able to restore the production by year-end, it gives us a leg up on 2009 growth.</p>
          <p>I'd like to now cover our regional operating highlights. For additional details I encourage you to review a lot of this material, which is on our website from last week's analysts' conference. In the central region we have expanded our acreage base in the Stiles Ranch, which is in the Texas panhandle, threefold since the beginning of the year, and gas production exceeded 90 million a day in the area for the first time during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>In east Texas we drilled the Folk-6H horizontal well, which was a Bossier &#x2013; in the Bossier formation, and it's averaged about 8 to 10 million a day for the first 90 days of production. And we have the potential to drill as many as 12 offset wells.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf region, the Geauxpher 2X deepwater well at Garden Bank 462 is currently completing. We expect net production of about 50 million a day from the development area, which should come on during the first quarter of 2009. And we see the potential to drill at least three additional wells on that block next year.</p>
          <p>Also in the Gulf region, during last week's conference, we showed for the first time our acreage position in the Eagleford Shale in central Texas. The Eagleford underlies the Giddings Austin Chalk field in Burleson, Brazos, Washington, Lee, and Fayette counties, and we have now over 450,000 acres, 425 of which, 425,000 of which is HBP in a play that &#x2013; our first extended lateral, we have just drilled our first extended lateral. We put 10 fracs, which is an experiment, actually. Came on yesterday pulling over 525 barrels of oil per day. These, I've got to warn you, these are early results. We have very little idea what the decline rate will be, but I can tell you for sure that this rate exceeds our expectations.</p>
          <p>In Canada, recent production results from wells we drilled with our partner in Canada, Ootla, suggests that 7.4 BCF per well utilizing a 10-stage frac completion. Frankly, we believe that there's further reserve upside in completing these wells with even more frac stages, which is what we plan to do this winter. At 7.4 BCF per well, this play works with Henry Hub gas prices of about 6 bucks and represents a net recoverable resource potential of 6 to &#x2013; 9 to 16 TCF for Apache.</p>
          <p>In the North Sea, our third quarter production achieved its highest average in two years. We drilled nine wells this year that produced at peak rates of about 17,000 barrels of oil a day during the third quarter of 2008. We have now developed a four-year drilling inventory of over 60 wells, which are targeting more oil production potential like the nine wells we just completed.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, we completed our 2,500 square-kilometer 3D megashoot in Tierra del Fuego, which is on an island in the Southern tip of Argentina, and have identified over 100 potential features to drill in the future. In the Neuqu&#xE9;n province, we've had notable successes there and expect upcoming production from areas to qualify for the premium sales price on our Gas Plus program.</p>
          <p>In Australia, we continue to develop four major projects to remain on schedule. During the third quarter we drilled primarily development wells in Carnarvon Basin. We do expect we have now taken custody of a rig for our Gippsland Basin exploration program, which should spud next week and also potentially exposes the company to some meaningful oil reserves.</p>
          <p>And finally in Egypt, we achieved record production, made four discoveries during the quarter in East Bahariya Concession which is in the Abu Gharadig Basin. The D-1X well found 61 feet of upper Bahariya pay along the same 13-mile ridge as the C-1X well that we reported last quarter. The D-1X tested 1,145-barrels of oil a day and could have node of waterflood potential, pending further appraisal along that ridge.</p>
          <p>Our third well on the ridge, the E-1X actually has currently been logged and has upper Bahariya in it, also. In the East Beni Suef Concession, which is in the Beni Suef Basin, the Azars East-1X well tested 930 barrels a day, which is from Abu Roash G, and also has waterflood potential associated with that. These two discoveries are important because they potentially add to our inventory of waterflood projects. We're currently producing 37,000 barrels of oil a day from eight different waterflood projects that we have undertaken in Egypt just in the last two years.</p>
          <p>In the Matruh Basin on the Khalda Offset Concession, the Sultan-3X wildcat made a gas condensate discovery, tested 5,027 barrels of oil per day and 11 million cubic feet of gas a day from Jurassic Safa formation.</p>
          <p>And finally, yesterday I think we announced the West Kalabsha &#x2013; on the West Kalabsha Concession, we drilled a well that discovered oil. We tested 4,746 barrels of oil per day, again from the Jurassic Safa at 14,600 feet. And this well is a lookalike to the Hackett II well that we reported last quarter that is still actually producing over 2,000 barrels a day. Both wells tested black oil from a much deeper horizon than we earlier thought possible. It's a much cooler basin than the Shushan Basin where we have the cost for gas. It opens a fairway &#x2013; a oil play fairway of potentially 800 square miles, mostly within Apache operated concessions, and we plan several wells next year to evaluate the play.</p>
          <p>And now, I'd like to turn it over to Roger.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As the credit crunch gave way to global downturn, Apache turned in solid third quarter results and earnings nearly doubling the year earlier period. Cash flow increased by $0.5 billion or nearly one-third. 43% higher oil prices and 49% higher gas prices in the quarter enabled oil and gas revenues to climb $870 million from third quarter '07 to $3.4 billion. This overcame a 9% reduction in volumes and enabled earnings to outpace all but the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>As we have indicated in press releases and on our website, the Australian pipeline incident and Hurricanes Gustav, Ike, et al. put a dent in our third quarter production. As discussed at last week's conference, these incidents constrained third quarter production to 511,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. I'd reiterate this production is not lost forever, but rather deferred. And as Steve indicated, we anticipate volumes to be restored between now and year-end.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange again impacted the quarter's results, this time on the plus side given the rebounding U.S. dollar. Normalizing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our deferred tax results in adjusted earnings of $3.19 per share versus $2.17 in the third quarter of '07.</p>
          <p>Now, if we compare third quarter to the second quarter of 2008, a $9 per barrel and $0.66 per MCF decline in oil and gas realizations coupled with a 7% decline in production reduced oil and gas revenues by $535 million and earnings by 254 million or 18% sequentially.</p>
          <p>Cash flow likewise declined $196 million or 8% sequentially. Cash margins declined 13% with lower prices making that impact, but remain quite strong at nearly $52 per barrel of oil equivalent. Including DD&amp;A our total pre-tax margin decreased a little over $8 to a still respectable $38.60 per barrel of oil equivalent.</p>
          <p>Now turning to cost detail, lifting costs included a number of items that caused their increase to $10.39 per BOE from $8.90. The start of repairs at Varanus Island, repair and maintenance work in the Gulf Coast, plus increased workovers and power costs in both Egypt and the central region were responsible for just over half or $0.83 per BOE of the increase. Lower production accounted for the remaining increase in our unit costs, because most of your base lease operating expense offshore is fixed. It doesn't go away with shut-ins; it just gets divided amongst fewer barrels, which brings the cost per BOE up. Hurricane repairs will continue to pressure lifting costs until covering our insurance deductibles.</p>
          <p>Physical damage insurance coverage is subject to a net deductible of around $7 million in Australia and $70 million in the Gulf of Mexico. The Australia deductible was satisfied in the third quarter, and the Gulf deductible should be satisfied around year-end. Based on present expectations, we have more than enough insurance to cover costs above our deductibles in both the Gulf and Australia. So once we have reached the deductible limit, our lease operating expense should revert to normal.</p>
          <p>Full cost DD&amp;A increased 1% sequentially to $11.93 per BOE, consistent with recent drilling costs. General and Administrative costs decreased $0.35 to $1.22 per BOE. Absolute costs were down $21 million, the result of lower stock-based compensation expense. Leaving aside any changes in stock price, rising fourth quarter production should enable a rate of somewhere around $1.25 to $1.50.</p>
          <p>Taxes other than income increased $0.53 to $6.48 per BOE with $0.42 related to lower production and $0.11 primarily related to higher North Sea volumes and revenues resulting in increased PRT taxes. Finance expense decreased $0.07 to $0.71 per BOE on greater interest income, given higher average cash balances.</p>
          <p>I think as most of you are aware, earlier this month, Apache issued $800 million of 5- and 10-year bonds. This will add about $13 million to our quarterly interest expense while adding to our overall firepower as well. Having the ability to tap capital is nice. To do it in the peak of the credit crisis at an average cost of under 6.5% is frankly exceptional. The proceeds arrived October 1, so after this quarter &#x2013; third quarter's end, we anticipate our cash balance at year-end to be around $2 billion, plus or minus, depending on prices and the timing of production recoveries. This includes working capital changes for the impact of third quarter capital carryover into the fourth quarter and also reduced receipts following hurricane and Varanus production curtailments.</p>
          <p>Turning to income taxes, our third quarter effective tax rate increased &#x2013; decreased to 34% from 38% in the prior quarter. As mentioned earlier, our deferred tax expense benefited from the strengthening U.S. dollar by $113 million, reducing our effective tax rate. Our deferred tax percentage increased to 51% from 22% in the second quarter, and that just reflects significantly lower current tax estimates given lower commodity prices.</p>
          <p>Given the heightened volatility of both commodity prices and the U.S. dollar, estimating our future deferred tax percentage and effective tax rate is difficult at best. Also difficult to predict is exact timing of production recoveries due to factors beyond our control such as when damaged pipelines will come back online.</p>
          <p>At last week's conference we took a stab at our estimated average 2008 production, came up with a range of 540,000 to 545,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. So you can do the math to arrive at a fourth quarter estimate, but I've got to tell you there is a lot going on here that has potential to impact fourth quarter volumes in either direction.</p>
          <p>Despite these short term uncertainties, Apache's financial condition and outlook are sound. In the face of changing global economic circumstances, not only are we in a position to carry out our business strategy, Apache is well positioned to take advantage of the inevitable carnage that springs from adversity.</p>
          <p>We are by no means immune to substantially reduced oil and gas prices or the bleak world economy. However, given our contrarian ways, we earlier took steps that put us in good stead relative to our competitors. Because we didn't chase the upswing too hard and avoided outspending our cash flow, we're among the fortunate few with access to capital at a reasonable cost. Our A minus credit rating, which is ignored most of the time, has proven itself invaluable in accessing additional capital in today's difficult environment. Debt, even taking into consideration the additional debt that came with a bond issuance, is a manageable 20% or so of our total capitalization, and cash of around $2 billion is an opportunity fund.</p>
          <p>Our unused credit facility commitment totals $2.3 billion, it's committed for the next four years, and while you really don't know until you test that or draw down from the banks which banks will fund and which banks won't, I will tell you that our lead bank indicated recently that they have had draw downs literally thousands over the last month, and there was only one bank that didn't fund, and it shouldn't surprise you, that's Lehman, and they are not amongst our bank in our credit line. So if you add the 2 billion and the 2 plus billion of unused credit facilities, at least in theory we've got potential firepower or dry powder of some $4 billion.</p>
          <p>The final point I'd make is that there's nothing like rising production to mitigate the impact of falling prices. And although we don't yet know our capital expenditures or our precise production for '09, it's hard to imagine a scenario under which we would not grow production next year. These advantages give Apache an important leg up on our competition in terms of turning adversity to advantage, and while difficult times challenge every company, Apache is at its best in tough times, such as the environment in which we find ourselves today.

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take our first question from Tom Gardner with Simmons &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Hey, Steve, I appreciate your analysts' conference last week, and I appreciate you sharing your views on the M&amp;A markets where you basically said that you thought things might get worse before they get better. Is there anything you've seen in the last week that might alter that view at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it starts with the global economy, and I don't &#x2013; I mean, I'm certainly not an economist by any stretch of the imagination, but I don't see anything out there that leads you to believe that things are going to get better before they get worse. The real, to me the real proof in the pudding is going to be what consumer spending is going to be between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And I &#x2013; I question whether or not we're going to have any kind of robust consumer spending during that timeframe.</p>
          <p>But in terms of in overall oil and gas, the only silver lining, and it depends on where you're coming from, frankly, although it hurts our earnings and our cash flow, things getting worse are not a bad thing for a while, frankly. I mean costs come down, rigs are laid down, people start paying real numbers for acreage, rather than paying way too much for acreage. So that's, in our business that's not a bad thing to put those costs on the books at a lower cost. Having said that, we have created a just-in-time inventory, certainly in gas in this country, if you just look at the type of things that are being drilled. And the question is how long can you not drill before you start having a problem again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd mention too, because when you live it, you see it a little bit differently, but in a capital intensive business like ours it takes a while to put the brakes on capital programs because you make commitments in advance. And so when cash flows drop rapidly with prices, you really don't see the damage for a quarter or two. I mean, so unless you see some kind of snapback in prices, which is highly unlikely at this point in time, the chances are that it is the same as Steve indicated last week, its going to get worse before it gets better. A lot of those things don't play through to companies' balance sheets for a quarter or two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And just jumping over to Egypt, you've had continued exploration success there. Can you discuss your thoughts on the possibility of getting some extensions on those concession lines, particularly in the Khalda area, and would that, if you were to enter negotiations, would that diminish your current metrics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For those of you who may not be familiar, concession agreements have a term that is an exploration term, and then when you develop &#x2013; if you have a development lease and a bigger &#x2013; big portion of Khalda is in a development lease, which then has a &#x2013; has a term of 20, 25 years. Our Khalda, Greater Khalda area doesn't expire 'til 2023 and 2024. We renegotiated that back in 2005 and extended those concessions from 2010 and 2011 to 2023 and 24. All of our other concessions in Egypt that are development leases have at least 20 years to run. So from that standpoint, we're in pretty good shape. On the exploration side, we have some exploration acreage that will start turning over in 2010 that we're intent on over the next 18 months to work with the government to extend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I appreciate the color there. Just one last thought on the concession agreements. When they expire, how is the equipment handled? Do they purchase it from you, or is it just turned over to the government? What's the compensation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the way the concession agreement works, we basically have been repaid for that, all of the equipment that are associated with it through cost recovery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, got you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, everyone. A couple of questions, and Roger, you referred to it briefly, but the LOE, can you go through that again? You said you have $70 million deductible in the Gulf, and you think that will be met by year-end? Is that what you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It should &#x2013; we've got to chew through our deductible before the insurance proceeds kick in. So we'll have a higher LOE per BOE cost than would otherwise be the case until we get through that, and that should happen right around, right around year-end. Maybe it'll trickle into the first quarter in part, but most of it will be behind us at year-end. After that, we've got sufficient insurance that any incremental costs would be covered by that. So you wouldn't see it in our numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and what did that hit for the quarter? Did that hit in LOE?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that &#x2013; I'm specifically addressing LOE.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's where the &#x2013; where did the insurance deductible, that 70 million, hit during the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>LOE, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of it will hit, virtually all of it. What tends to happen is your LOE costs are the ones that you &#x2013; you also have capital costs, but those typically are later, so they get covered more by the insurance if you know what I'm saying. So yeah, you'll see it in LOE, by and large.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then a question for Steve, you talked about the Eagleford and at the conference it was more focused on the oil side. Can you talk about the potential on the gas side in that same property?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In fact, we're drilling two wells that we think will be in the gas window, as we speak. Certainly if you move down to the gassier part of the Austin Chalk, which many of you might have read Petrohawks. Now we're quite a ways to the northeast of the Petrohawk acreage, but there's a high in between the two. But both of them are over old Austin Chalk field, and they drilled in the gas window of the Austin Chalk, and we're drilling these two wells in the gas window of the Austin Chalk, and we anticipate them being gassier. Actually we anticipate them being gas. Certainly, the gas can move through the shales a little easier than the oil. Although I'll be real honest with you, and I've got to be careful, I really wasn't expecting that kind of rate out of the &#x2013; out of the Eagleford in the oil side. 525 barrels a day if it will just rollover, will be very, very economic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. When do you anticipate giving us an additional update on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's going be &#x2013; we've got another well that we're getting ready to frac. We've got four wells down with horizontals in them that we're fraccing. We just fracced a second well, and that should, we should have some results in the next month. It'll take a month to understand the decline curve associated with this first well that we're talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then one last question, if &#x2013; and I think it was Roger that mentioned it. You talked about fourth quarter volumes, and you said there's a number of factors. Any other big factor besides the GOM and Australia, the timing of those two that we can look at in the fourth quarter as far as a swing on the value side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are the biggest, although we also have late in the fourth quarter 100 million a day net and 5,000 barrels a day net in Egypt that will come on &#x2013; begin to come online. So you know, the timing of that could also impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and you scheduled that for late 4Q?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One quick question, any update on the Australia gas contract? Apologies if you mentioned it earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, other than it &#x2013; that we're &#x2013; that we're continuing to noodle very small points, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in Egypt, I guess any sign, maybe it's a little early, but can you talk to anything you may be seeing in terms of gas demand and any implications from a potential decrease in economic growth there and what that means for your ability to extract additional price increases there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think we showed a chart at our analysts conference on terms of the growth rate in Egypt, what it's been domestically. It's significant, as if you look in that chart or look on our website, last three or four years, it's been about a 22%. And they have targeted natural gas to back out oil. So I don't see that diminishing, but one thing I will say is that not unlike any other country of the world, Egypt watched what happens to natural gas in this country. And at current prices the ability to sit down and talk about meaningful price increases when you've got a NYMEX where it's priced today is going to be more difficult than it was when it was at $9.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I think, I think over time for two reasons, one is they have to have investment for natural gas, and they have to have infrastructure which we have been doing both. And the need that they have, I think over time that will happen. I just, I just think what is happening in this country is &#x2013; has an impact on what's happening in Egypt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One thing I'd say, you may have noticed in the &#x2013; in our numbers in the blast facts that our average price in Egypt was $5.62 for the quarter. So we tend to talk about most of our gas, which is capped at two...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>65.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>65, but we also have an old, I think we're the only company with an old sort of legacy contract that is tied to crude oil that has dragged that price up. So Steve's point about prices coming down, we get &#x2013; all of a sudden that $5 gas looks more attractive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and the thing, we got to be careful, because the other thing is we're going to start diluting that as we come on with our cost of gas. Because that's 100 million a day contract, and if we go up to 7.50 on gas, all of a sudden you've got &#x2013; you've got 6.50 at 2.65 against that price where versus what you've got today, which is about 3.50 versus that price, 4.50 versus that price. So you're going start diluting that contract. That contract is still 2013, that existing contract that we have.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Quick question on your Egyptian gas volumes this quarter. Looks like you guys posted a pretty healthy increase, and it's my understanding what you didn't have your Salam plant coming on for a little while. Just curious as to why you had the nice pop in Egyptian gas here in 3Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a couple of &#x2013; specifically what has happened is that we are starting to put more gas, part of our gas takeaway is going through the Obayed plant, which is a Shell plant, and that Shell plant, we have &#x2013; we have the ability to produce 150 million a day until they get some work done, and then we can go to 210. And what's happened is Shell's production is falling off, so we're getting a bigger share of that plant than what we anticipated. So we have had hot days of over 200 million a day going through the Obayed plant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jumping over to Canada real quick, this is your gas volumes have been declining pretty steadily over there. Do you guys have any sense of when you think that will kind of turn around and flatten out and maybe start growing, kind of what point in time you think that can happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, I'm pretty encouraged, given the amount of capital we've put in Canada, at our ability to keep that relatively flat, frankly. And the other thing you've got to keep in mind is that in the second quarter we sold about 15 million a day net of Canadian gas. So you've got to be careful when you compare quarters-to-quarters. With what's happened in Alberta with respect to the royalty, our big growth in &#x2013; I mean in Canada is going be from our Ootla play over time. In fact, if you wanted to be very optimistic over the next four or five years, the Ootla play net to Apache could be the same as what we're producing today. We're producing about 25 million a day right now. Our plans for the winter, right now, with our partner is to drill a multiple of the wells that we have drilled in the past, and we'll have the capacity to take that gas out of there, also. So that ought to help our production going into next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Think you'll start to see some impact once we get into spring of next year from increased Ootla line up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably spring and fall, because what we'll do is drill those wells in the winter and actually frac them and hook them up later in the spring, summer timeframe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what's your capacity up there at Ootla in terms of your net share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our capacity right now is about 25 million a day, which we will be working on this winter and increase that significantly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Just a question about Argentina and any thoughts around the pension plan nationalization and the moves there relative to the thoughts at the analysts meeting of being able to increase pricing over the long term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I you know &#x2013; I think, you're seeing an administration that is trying to shore up their financial position. I don't know what the outcrop is. I know we had an awful &#x2013; we have a number of Argentine employees that were pretty long faced when they heard that news. The fundamental problem in Argentina, I mean if you take out the things that go back and forth with respect to different laws and stuff and unions, et cetera is they have a fundamental problem in meeting demand, whether it's on the crude side or the gas side. And again, I would refer you to our website, but they are now, their supply is less than their demand, and they're having to import LNG or use VIESEL or use &#x2013; put, make propane natural gas by putting air in it.</p>
          <p>And what they have done is come up with a program that is called Gas Plus that basically allows you to contract directly with the supplier at whatever price the market will bear. And part of our program for the first part of next year, right now actually in the first part of next year is going be drilling those gas wells in the Nick and to test the resolve of the government to actually make that work. I mean, there is a law in place and the only, the only time you will know whether or not that is really going to stick is when they get into winter months, which is our summer months, and they need gas as to whether or not they're going to redirect that gas into the residential market. But I think fundamentally things have to change there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Any &#x2013; how would you risk or assess, how do you internally assess risk of nationalization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I have very little concern about a true nationalization in Argentina, and the reason is they don't have &#x2013; I don't know what they'd use for money to invest in order to do anything different than anybody else does. What you really continue to be concerned about is they got an export price on oil, they depressed the price of natural gas, and what happens is they bleed you to death, if you know what I'm saying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But in terms of actually walking in and nationalizing, I think that would be obviously they could do anything. There's a government, but I don't think it's in their best interest to do that, I mean if you just look at it from a purely self-interest standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one thing it took me years to figure out, and it's so obvious now that I look back is if you think about nationalizing where that's happened in the past is where a country is exporting and getting all sorts of cash over and above what's being invested in the country. A country that doesn't have enough energy in and of itself and doesn't have the cash to invest, there's a symbiotic relationship there. They need capital, and if they had, if they had excess oil and were exporting oil, they wouldn't need it. So it's a lot harder to say, get lost, because they don't have, what are they going to do for money?</p>
