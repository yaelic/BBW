        <plist>
          <p>I thank everyone for the time and opportunity to come here on a Friday evening for this press conference because it also only after one of the largest state owned company that is also disclosing their information for the first half of the year. So there is good opportunity to compare our results today.</p>
          <p>You will listen to two presentations. The first presentation will be concerned with the results of the first half of the year, some expectations for the future. And the second presentation let me introduce to you the head of our largest branch the Nizhegorodnefteorgsintez company. This is the company that is responsible for our fields in the Caspian and this gentleman will make a presentation of our vision over the Caspian projects. And starting from next year we expect first oil -- first big oil to come from the Caspian and generally I can tell you that our expectation is around 1 billion barrels per day, it's about 50,000 tons per day of oil. And this is something that we're looking at in the quite near future.</p>
          <p>Now, a few words on the forward-looking statements, even though that all statements that are made here are conditional and they are build on certain assumptions.</p>
          <p>Next slide, the key statements, the executive summery. I am here making the presentation for the third -- for the fourth time and every time I'm making a presentation I'm reporting the best results. Today I'm here to report the best ever quarter and semi-annual financial results of the company. And this is indeed the fact you will see these results from our presentation and other things mentioned is, we expect a significant decrease in tax burden and consequentially fast growth of the company's cash flow.</p>
          <p>The cash flow will be necessary to develop our new field including Caspian field. We also note an increase in refinery throughputs and increasing marketable gas production and we were very successful in mergers and acquisitions in refining and marketing segments.</p>
          <p>So key facts for the first half of 2008. Sales grew by almost 60% year-on-year on the first half of 2007 and it reached $56,890 million. EBITDA raised by 74.5% and now it is $11 billion. Net income excluding hedging and impairment losses, whereas to say the income that was really generated but was reduced through the calculation system adopted by the GAAP or U.S. GAAP system was 8,168 million. And reported net income after all the write-offs, all impairments and everything else is 7.2 billion, plus 91.1% on a previous year basic EPS, plus 89.5% and reported net income per boe of production plus 93%. Free cash flow grew by 333%. So it almost tripled. It's more than tripled.</p>
          <p>Macroeconomic and tax environment were typical for the last three years. Of our operations the price on oil and oil products was growing steadily and it's peaked in the last six months. And as the taxes were also growing quite steadily at an accelerated rate and under such conditions the company managed to reach high efficiency, high performance, high revenues; it means that this is a very well managed company.</p>
          <p>Let me note that the oil prices grew by 76% and taxes, the export duties and the mineral extraction tax grew by 90%. At the same time, our net income doubled over that period of time. The real appreciation of LIBOR plus 24% and average inflation in oil industry, the producer prices there it's grew around 20%. That would be a weighted average, and this is higher than the consumer inflation.</p>
          <p>The main operating results are as follows: we reduced our oil production somewhat, by 3.8%. At the same time, the marketable gas production went up rapidly, plus 18% on the whole. The really -- marketable hydrocarbon production declined by 1.5% but in general terms since we have one more working day, the actual reduction was about 1%. Oil refining, our most profitable segment, grew by 7.4%.</p>
          <p>Crude oil exports went down by 12.4%, and I will give an explanation for that; at the same time the petroleum products exports grew by 6.3%. And retail sale of petroleum products surged by 17% this is because of the demand in Russia and also through our new acquisition, the grant system.</p>
          <p>A few words on exports, export of oil and oil products. I was furious to read today a message from one of the Western news agencies that the LUKOIL was instructed to shorten exports to Western Europe, but it turns out, I guess, you are all familiar with this information. But it looks like we received this inflection already in January when it was started, reducing our exports slightly. And in one year we reduced our exports by 12.5%, and this is on par with overall Russian statistics.</p>
          <p>But this is not because we are concerned by the political situation around the Caucasus, but the thing is, there is a typical economic logic underlying such a decision. Today the export of petroleum products is 60% much more efficient. And there is another reason that there is a very solid domestic demand on petroleum products purchased by LUKOIL.</p>
          <p>Today the Russian domestic market is our priority, and in future Russia and LUKOIL will continue to decrease exports of oil and oil products. This is not because we are responding to some extent; it's because of the economic logic and this is cost efficient. And I want to underline it once again, to check it once again for the news agencies that this reduction has been a trend over the last year. We are furtherly reducing the Russian crude oil exports.</p>
          <p>And I have already have mentioned on different occasions that similar story will happen not without the producers of oil, not only in the former Soviet Union area, but also in the Persian Gulf. And I believe that other countries will follow similar trend, because all countries are developing and refining, and they will be entering the market with refined products rather than with crude oil. And this decrease in consumption of oil of which everyone is talking these days is balanced by the supply, one of the reasons being the internal consumption in the countries producers of oil.</p>
          <p>As to marketable hydrocarbon production, you know that we have serious problems that were identified in the middle of last July in Western Siberia. And we were talking about this quite along. Mainly these problems are depletion of our fields, then there are some issues and challenges and -- with electricity energy supply in the construction is yet another big concern.</p>
          <p>But with satisfaction, I can say that in our six months we managed to come out of this. We recommend that you can see with the launch of the Yuzhno Khylchuyu field that our average production increased and its higher today than the average production for the last year. We are in the plus area now. And this is a very good indicator we expect that the overall marketable hydrocarbon production in the first half of 2008 it has already been more than 2 million boe per day in Australia at the same level in the second six months of the year. LUKOIL always was focused on storage growth of production in international projects and gas production.</p>
          <p>There is one good underlying reason for that until very recently before tax release were announced by the government gas and international projects were much more profitable than production projects in Russia. And now I'm very pleased to say that the situation after the recent changes to the order were adopted in June this year, took a new turn and today the company has a serious good, strong appetite for production projects in Russia and we will report about this in a short while.</p>
          <p>Refining -- crude oil refining. Crude oil refining grew by almost 75,000 barrels per day in the last year and this is the capacity over an average refinery basically. And today the refining margin of Russian taking the refinery in Russia stays at a very good level. Today refining is the most  lucrative segment for the company, primarily due to the specifics of the taxation legislation in the country. That's why we have always -- and we'll focus on our refining projects.</p>
          <p>Already today we produced a lot of fuel about mid Euro-4 and Euro-3 standards and in the near future we've planned to produce only these fuels that have high consumer qualities environmental -- that meet the environmental standards. The consolidated financial results are presented in the following slide. We have already posted them. I'm sure you possess this information and basically this is one of the best, it is the best. It is the best of first six months of the -- here in the history of the company and let me tell you that the effect of the growing prices is only say 75% of the reason for this brilliant situation, and the rest 25% is the contribution of the management of the company.</p>
          <p>Sales reconciliation of the changes in prices and there is also a change in sales mix. There is a change in volumes sold. You can see that the $1.4 billion was achieved through internal work in the company and change in prices is a big factor and this is also happening because we increased our export of petroleum products and we reduced the export of crude oil. If the increase in crude oil exports was plus 45.3% then the oil product export grew by more than 74%.</p>
          <p>This is both domestically and abroad and the company will emphasize from now on the production of products with high added-value. I'm talking about refining products now because in high value-added product wise the profit for the company and its shareholders' operating expenses -- operating expenses stayed under control. And I have already told you that average inflation for the industry is higher than 20%, and real ruble appreciation is around 24%. You can see that lifting costs grew by only 17.7%. As to oil refining expenses and their growth again this is explained by higher refining volumes and I have already given you the figures.</p>
          <p>So we keep all these costs under control and we intend to continue to invest. Today at the Board of Directors, Mr. Alekperov stressed that our managers will be accessed not only based on the -- their performance in production, but also in terms of their cost performance and operating expenses will be definitely taken into account. The drivers for OpEx growth primarily are the real ruble appreciation 24%, and now the energy assets of the Group of the company were entered into the cost estimates.</p>
          <p>Acquisition of TGK-8, there was also a rise in the transportation of volumes and the costs for transportation adjust in <mark type="inaudible" /> to their own ways considerably, and basically of this growth that we've been witnessing was inline with the approved business plans and fully meets the expectations that we have at the beginning of this year.</p>
          <p>Administrative and commercial cost SG&amp;A and transportation expenses, transportation expenses again grew but &#x2013; were growing less than &#x2013; grew the tariff of Transneft. This is because LUKOIL is employing it's own terminal base in Varandey in the <mark type="inaudible" /> and you can see that we're actually doing better, a little bit better than Transneft and SG&amp;A grew by 24% this year. This is because bonuses were paid out to managers, the bonuses that were again paid out based on the results of last year, so nothing extraordinary here.</p>
          <p>Optimization of logistics saved us more than $200 million actually. Tax payments, tax payments are traditional every month. We break another record in tax payments and right now, there is a peak in tax payments as the prices are going down a little bit and the taxes are still pretty high. So, we believe that LUKOIL has always been and is today one of the largest tax payers in Russia, and we fully meet with our obligations to pay taxes to the budget of the Russian Federation.</p>
          <p>Net income reconciliation. The biggest factor in reduction of net income was the growing taxes, 7 billion almost. Let me say a few words on hedging, a $521 million we have already announced that all our trading operations abroad are hedged as is customary with main measures to avoid the consequences of drastic changes in oil prices and in the international markets when the price is growing, we are losing one or half a percent; when the prices are going down, we bring this one or half percent back to us.</p>
          <p>And in the last month out of this 521 million more than 350 million have been already recovered from the dropping of markets. We believe that our report for the third quarter will actually look even better taking into account that all the hedges that we have <mark type="inaudible" /> will now work on us and for us and that's how we avoid again a sharper fluctuations on our products and we ensure a stable receipt of cash flow regardless of the market situation.</p>
          <p>The structure of the cash flow. Yes, indeed this year is a record year in CapEx on capital expenses a considerable growth of capital expenses has several reasons, TGK-8 was entered on to the books this year. Everything else stated was in last year, but you remember that this particular transaction was a combined yield and it included cash and payment in shares, so basically there is not a big influence on cash flow or the operating capacities of the company and cash flow at the end of the first six-month, twice or more than two times as high as we had at the end of the first six months of 2007.</p>
          <p>CapEx breakdown, the main capital expenses, exploration and production projects, LUKOIL is still one of the largest investors into the economy of the Russian Federation and we intend to further build up our investments since the government is now providing us the incentives via the tax  release and we are very grateful to the government of the country for noticing right in time this investment crisis, that was about to spread and the government undertook very necessarily and timely steps to put a stop to this crisis and LUKOIL and our colleagues can assure you that all our investment projects will be brought to life and may be more than that as we expect additional steps from the government taken towards the oil industry.</p>
          <p>Let me just remind you of what has been done by the government. Amendments were adopted to the tax code as they will become effective from January 1, 2009. And these amendments change the base oil price in the mineral extraction tax formula.</p>
          <p>They introduced tax holidays in a number of regions of the company's presence. And they also allowed to use indirect method of produced oil registration for fields with high-viscosity oil and for fields with depletion levels higher than 80%.</p>
          <p>We expect that the overall effect in the next ten years depending on different scenarios will be between 24 to $27 billion. In 2009, if the oil prices are above $110 a barrel, we expect to get additionally 2.6, 2.9 billion and how they were calculated amounts, whether they come from mineral extraction tax. The base tax rate is &#x2013; the base oil price sorry, is increased from 9 to $15 per barrel, this will give us additionally 800, $900 million next year and approximately the same amount in 2010. On the whole, we expect to receive $8.5 billion in 10 years time.</p>
          <p>Tax holidays, in order to stimulate investment in the regions, where there is no legal transportation or industrial infrastructure in order to stimulate work in the shelf, in the offshore areas the government undertook several measures in particular. Our fields in Timan-Pechora and &#x2013; in Azov and the Caspian seas are subject to this benefit to tax holidays. We believe that in the Caspian region, in the fields that have been already registered these holidays will us additionally &#x2013; will give us additionally 10 million tons in Nenets autonomous districts, it's a 33.9 million tons, and total remissions for the period of seven years, until 2015 will reach 6.6 to $7.8 billion, again depending on the scenario. If production is even greater in the Caspian, this amount might be even higher, everything depends on how successful and how active we are in commissioning our field in the Caspian.</p>
          <p>As to highly depleted fields that this benefit &#x2013; this tax relieves was put in place sometime ago, already, but it was basically non-operational. In some areas, it will just &#x2013; not efficient to apply the direct method, but starting from next year through the indirect method of accounting, of registration, we'll get an additional follow-up to &#xA3;5 billion in ten years time. And this will again enable us to pay much more attention to the fields that they are considered to be not profitable, or manage to retain these fields, regardless of the water cut, and regardless of the teleconnectivity.</p>
          <p>Another important tax relieves is for fields with high-viscosity oil, Yaregskoye and</p>
          <p>Usinskoye field, with reserves of around 1.5 barrels of oil equivalent, and now these &#x2013; the production of these fields becomes profitable, and we are building our business plans to reach &#x2013; to start production there. Probably, if we use more aggressive technologies, carbonates deposit, we will be able to derive one more, and the cash flow generated will be anywhere between 5 to $6 billion in 10 years time. The total effect of all tax relieves is presented on the next slide, as you can see it is pretty high. And we believe that our company's value due to this decrease in taxes will grow by 20, 22%, at a discount rate of 10%.</p>
          <p>You'll also know that additional efforts to decrease tax burden in Russia are under discussion. At first there was talk of an additional 400 billion rubles, but then <mark type="inaudible" /> that most probably this will not happen, and other steps are being put forward. We believe that some steps can be taken, the change in the excise taxes for instance, the change in the structure and rates of excise for petroleum products, probably that will help some companies produce not a fuel oil, but rather high octane gas fuels.</p>
          <p>And I think, the export tariff rate for light and dark petroleum products is a possibility, is a very good possibility. Again, this can be done in order not to export fuel, oil but to export gasoline, and if the rate will be equal than this huge investment that today is required to upgrade refineries will have, will receive substantiation, will be justified. This is a &#x2013; this could be a big step. I can't give you a very estimate of this step, but again it is under discussion.</p>
          <p>There is also negotiations around an increase in base oil price in the export tariff formula. But I think that this is a list of probables, a step probably, it might interest state-owned companies, they are very active and loving this particular step, if it comes true then we'll only welcome it obviously.</p>
          <p>Then, of course the investment policy is also on the agenda of the government. An investment policy that will encourage upgrading of fuels and new equipment et cetera, et cetera. And this way new export initiatives that will be discussed until the end of the year, will create in my opinion, a very solid ground both for large investments, for large investment projects in the Russian Federation. And they will lay, again the necessary ground to build up our export of petroleum products rather than crude oil.</p>
          <p>Russia needs to become a large exporter of oil and oil products in the world. There are all reasons for us to become such a big exporter. We understand that the results that we have here are pretty difficult, they are challenging. So, we need to work on them, and we can already demonstrate to you, something that we have already done in that respect.</p>
          <p>Yesterday, we made a presentation of our major project in Timan-Pechora, the Yuzhnaya-Khylchuya. This is a greenfield project. There are no cities, there are no settlements, there are no roads there, there is no electricity; everything was built from scratch. Our own energy producing units, our own construction, everything is on pillars, together with our partners from ConocoPhillips, we have started this project and to-date, it is reaching start into production, and next year we expect to reach the level of 7.5 million tons of crude oil per year. This is the planned production level for next year and the company LUKOIL is ready to work in the &#x2013; in the most challenging environments. This is a polar circle area, and this is &#x2013; I would say our first step towards the offshore polar areas.</p>
          <p>A few words on the acquisitions that LUKOIL made in the last period. LUKOIL was trying not only to sell oil products, but also to sell petroleum products, refined products, that we signed an agreement to acquire a share in ISAB Enterprise, in Sicily. This is one of the largest and best performing refineries in the Mediterranean. And we also acquired Akpet network in Turkey, which gave us about 5% of the Turkish retail market. LUKOIL will pursue this policy or continue to make steps to increase our presence in Europe.</p>
          <p>Conclusions, the company plans to develop dynamically, and to exceeding market expectations thanks to tax burden decrease, and accelerated refinery throughputs growth, gas production and processing, and expanding cooperation with state companies.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention. And now I would like to give the floor to Mr. Nikolayev. Mr. Nikolayev will make a little presentation on one of our most important investment projects with Caspian, a very promising Russian province and unit volume it will be comparable to our LUKOIL projects in the Western Siberia. But probably the Caspian will be much more efficient, thanks to the benefits offered these days by the government on the Russian Federation. LUKOIL will be able to accelerate the launching of these new projects.</p>
          <p>Mr. Nikolayev is the representative of President in Volgograd and Astrakhan, since Nikolayev is the General Director of LUKOIL in Nizhnevolzhskneft. Nizhnevolzhskneft today is the operator who will produce oils in South Federal District and our jurisdiction covers Astrakhan, Krasnodar Oblast, Krasnodar Krai and the Republic of Kalmykia. I will make a brief presentation today on our work that we do to develop the Northern Caspian oil field but let me remind you that new large-scale research that started in 1990's LUKOIL discovered six fields. This is a huge oil and gas province so one of them is Maltsevskoye field &#x2013; oil field is unique in reserves. More than 170 million tons of oil and more than 40 billion cubic meters of gas are at the Maltsevskoye field. This is the largest discovery that was made by Russian oil and gas in the last 20 years; it is planned that the maximum production of the six fields will be 200 billion tons per year; will be reached by 2015.</p>
          <p>Well -- and it was stay at this level. In 2015, it will produce &#x2013; sorry 12 million tons of oil and 12 billion cubic meters of gas and this plateau in production will stay flat for another 8% a year according to our forecast. This is the data as we see today. At the same time, exploration continues in the Caspian and in addition to already discovered six field in the Northern and Central Caspian, some prospective structures were identified. Commissioning of all assets in the licensed provinces of LUKOIL subject to expected discoveries will enable by 2023 to reach the oil production -- at the level of almost 30 million tons and natural gas at the level of 18 to 20 billion cubic meters. The fields in the Northern Caspian will be commissioned in stages starting from next year and the first field to be launched is the Korchagina field. According to the schedule -- the drilling of wells is set for the 1st of July 2009 and first oil is expected in December next year.</p>
          <p>In 2010, our plan to produce 640,000 tons of oil and by 2013, we will reach the maximum production level of 2.5 million tons per year. As to the infrastructure of the Korchagina field, we started the work at the end of 2006 and less than one year in the Northern Caspian a huge complex will be build; you can see now a schematic of this complex. I will tell you a few words about this object, this facilities of Garfield platforms, LSP-1 and LSP-2 and undersea pipeline the --floating storage and a single point mooring LSP-1 will be drilling and processing of oil and gas and LSP-2 is intended as the housing facility for the personnel using pipeline of the oil will be -- one to two will be single point mooring and on to the floating storage off-shore and from the floating storage, the oil will be delivered on to tankers that will take this oil to Russia and to other places.</p>
          <p>The total cost is almost RUB 27 billion, which is with our drilling and as of August 1, 19 billion have been already spent out of this amount 6.5 billion were spent on construction assembly, equipment cost was more than 9 billion, exploration more than RUB 1 billion and design of all this facilities is done by the Russian and foreign contractors around the world.</p>
          <p>Now, a few words about the facilities themselves they designed the construction of the subsea pipeline was done by McDermott Company in May, June, this year in the Northern Caspian the pipelines were laid. The total links is 56 kilometers and on the 13 of July, the first step and the construction and the assembly work was finished, you can see now the big shift taken at the site as to the 14 storage facility, the design is done by Kazakh company and the work was started in December 2006, and less than one month ago after they dock in Singapore, a few hull strips were already commissioned in Singapore.</p>
          <p>You can see now the pictures now well, they have been prepared to be transported by sea to Baku and there the hulls will be put together into one facility, its installation under sea and test our plan for 26 of June 2009. The projection -- the design and construction of single point mooring is done by Bluewater Company, the construction of the upper part of the mooring and additional equipment has been already manufactured in the Netherlands, and the pillars &#x2013; the base of this facility is building in Astrakhanskaya in Russia in the first six months of this year basically the complete set of work to manufacture of the main deck was done.</p>
          <p>And today, the structure is build in the Netherlands are being delivered to Astrakhan to furnish them on to the main deck build here. The installation on the sea will be done in June 2009. LSP-2 and LSP-2 and then the bridge, the bridge that will connect LSP-1 and LSP-2 these are build by LUKOIL <mark type="inaudible" /> LUKOIL's subsidiary and total cost for construction is RUB 2 billion. As of the 1 of August, the main modules of this platform were finished and by the 15 of October this year, they will be shifted to Astrakhan, where they will be put together and equipped with additional structures. 13 of April 2009 is the time for installation and commissioning and start of drilling is scheduled for July 2009. The most difficult and most challenging and costly part of this work is design and construction of the ice-resistant platform, one, it will treat and process the gas to be overloaded onto tankers. Total CapEx on LSP-1 is RUB18 billion out of this degrade about 70% has already been spent; about RUB12 billion have been already invested into this project.</p>
          <p>LSP-1 consists of four very difficult technological complexes. They do drilling energy supply, oil, gas and water treatments and transportation of marketable oil and gas. So the construction of all four, module four structures are almost finished and that will commissioned during the first quarter of 2009. The equipment has been in almost fully supplied. Assembly, furnishing, and laying the pipes and cables is where this construction at the moment.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; we need to install almost 700 units of main equipment and more than 170,000 units of auxiliary equipment. 60 kilometers of cables must be laid, more than 600 &#x2013; sorry, kilometers of cable must be laid on to this platform this is the distance between Volgograd and <mark type="inaudible" />. The delivery term of for some of the most complicated pieces of equipment is between eight and 14 months and because the manufactured plants are overloaded with orders some of the articles, some of the items unfortunately were not manufactured on time as per contracts, but we are taking measures and we are negotiating with the manufacturers, this issue is now and we are confident that we will be able to start our work on time as scheduled. LUKOIL next year will open a new page in its history. We will start production in the Caspian. Thank you very much.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much. We have finished with the presentation. We are &#x2013; and we are ready to take your answers please, sorry questions.</p>

          <p>Well, yes, actually, our results were 800,000 tons, or $428 million, and now we are looking at two million tons, $1.6 billion. I have given you the figures and the reasons for the figures is the year-on-year, the longer delivery periods through arbitrage to Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last question here. What is the mechanism of hedging contracts in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As to the amounts of these contracts, I will not be able to give you the figure right now; I will get back to you on this one. But I can confirm that we got a confirmation that out of the $500 and some million that we had in the period of time we managed after the reduction in oil prices from 140, 132, 100 and some, we could get back the 300, almost $300 million.</p>
          <p>Now, we'll take questions from the audience, please. Please use the microphone and please introduce yourselves.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Arco Media. I have several questions for different people. Again <mark type="inaudible" /> you mentioned that these tax release that were approved by the government from the 1st of January 2009 they will change the strategy of LUKOIL, and LUKOIL will buy oil assets in Russia -- it will buy more oil assets in Russia. Do you have anything specific in mind? That will be very interesting to know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer the questions as I receive them. Okay, assets in the Russian Federation are sold only at auctions and tenders, so unfortunately we can't buy anything because everything goes to state-owned companies. The question is that we have big reserves and Mr. Nikolayev have given you the information about six already discovered fields in the Caspian, and 11 prospective areas in the Caspian and accordance to our estimates the investment that will be required is astronomical. I can't give you specificity as the inflation is so fast. In the past, we used to look at the years 2030, 2040 even for investment projects. Now we think that we can accelerate this investment projects. We can solve them sooner as we will have additional resources. The depreciation will also go faster, and the return on invested capital will be greater. The government will give us the environment to work very quickly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>These six discoveries -- where are they?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> the Caspian, would you mean the Caspian?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So six discoveries in the Caspian plus 10, plus 11 prospective structures on the Caspian; yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The focus on the production in the Caspian, these focus that you remember, do they include the new dynamics or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of existing structures, the Korchagin and the Filanovsky field &#x2013; fields. The forecast is based on the original information. As to the estimates, as to this prospect, we have instructed our production block to review our forecasts. And we think that we will be able to start this project sooner, again. And the potential that we're looking at is around one million barrels of oil equivalent a day, about 50 million tons. This is the potential in this region that we...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What is the timeline; what's the timeframe for your projects? When do you think you will reach the figures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's &#x2013; we are talking about 2020, 2022. We will have to see what other tax initiative the government takes. But again, based on the current data it's year 2020, around that time. You would get additional money and maybe the oil industry will be able to accelerate their process. Again, we have just discussed one field in the last conversation. You see how challenging any production is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have another question. Transportation of diesel fuel from Perm to Moscow of our diesel pipeline: when and how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as I understand the Perm facility refinery is not yet connected to this pipeline. We've got Perm <mark type="inaudible" /> and Almetyevsk pipeline, and this pipeline is already operational. It has been in operation for eight years and large amounts of diesel oil &#x2013; diesel fuel is transported to Central Russia via this pipeline. There is another pipeline to be constructed from <mark type="inaudible" /> when it is commissioned by Transneft, <mark type="inaudible" /> it maybe we will also supply from Nizhny Novgorod -- not from <mark type="inaudible" />, from  Nizhny Novgorod the additional amounts of diesel fuel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One more question, please. If you want to restart export of oil to Germany...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One last question. African field &#x2013; gas field. And African <mark type="inaudible" /> huge. Do you have only plan for the production there, for the development? Would you do it alone or together with your Poland partners? Or I mean, what have your plans for the African gas fields? Do you want to do it yourself or do you want to sell it maybe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a huge field. It's very complicated, probably the most complicated field in the Russian Federation because the content of sulphur and HGA (47:25 is extreme there. And at the third well, how much 3.5 thousand meters the design depth is 4.7 thousand meters. In several days it will reach the design depth and we will start testing the reservoirs. So we get <mark type="inaudible" /> we are preparing for production there in a test mode. It's a huge field; it has huge potential, but we need to have nano technology for prediction there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What is the potential of Caspian in terms of gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I have given you the figures &#x2013; we gave you the figures about 20 &#x2013; up to 20 billion cubic meters and taking into account our shares in the joint venture with Gazprom and our joint venture in &#x2013; with the Rosneft.</p>
          <p>Please let other people ask questions, if you don't mind. Okay. Let's take chance, who is next. Okay, yeah, you can do that. The question is off the mic. The question is off the microphone.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately there are regulations of the London Stock Exchange that does not allow me to make any forecasts of this type. But in any case, I can tell you that this year will be an extremely successful year for LUKOIL oil company.</p>
          <p>Another question, the question is again off the mic. The question is not into the microphone.</p>
          <p>I'm afraid this is a sensitive matter. I can only confirm our position that we are interested in long-term and direct contracts. We do not want to work through intermediaries and to share our profits. The situation is changing all the time and LUKOIL is reducing its proposition in oil to the European and international markets. And we are offering more oil products to international markets. But we will only sell oil at maximum price, where we see feet and where we see that there it is profitable for us.</p>
          <p>Please ask the questions into the microphone, because there are other people listening the translation and they would really appreciate knowing what the question is.</p>
          <p>And the last request: please comment today's &#x2013; statements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the statements makes today in a daily telegraph. Apparently you received instructions from the Kremlin. No, I have already mentioned that I had a special slide on this subject. What's the number of the slide? I think its slide four or slide number five.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Six.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Six; yeah. You can see that starting from 2007, 2007, we have been reducing our exports. I mean, Russia and LUKOIL from 2005 was reducing its export of oil, although before that we experienced a big growth in that, again today is the time of oil product. For LUKOIL it's very profitable to export petroleum products, and in future we will increase our volumes of petroleum products exported and decrease the volumes of oil export. And this instruction from the Kremlin is just nonsense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you didn't receive any request from the Kremlin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are just &#x2013; they just do not make any sense. I'll just give you an example once again. If we get the price for oil products 60% higher than the price that we get on oil, then why should I export oil? I would recommend your colleagues on the Daily Telegraph to do their math, to learn the math. They need to know how to count, and if they know how to count, if they know how to do math, they would not be writing this strange thing.</p>
          <p>And I also spoke to Mr. Alexieroff, and he asked me specifically to tell you that we did not receive any instructions or request, and if there any further statements or <mark type="inaudible" /> will be made by anyone we will recourse to court, we will protect our business reputation, we are an independent and a very proud company. We will protect &#x2013; we will defend ourselves.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> newspaper, yesterday you announced that you'll participate together with Conoco in the tender for West Qurna. What are the terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, do you see West Qurna, consists of two parts there is West Qurna-1, and West Qurna-2, West Qurna-2 we still believe that all the rights to the field under the production sharing agreement with us, we shall keep this right and we have very patiently talking to the government and to the component authorities of the Republic of Iraq on this subject, that's one part of the matter. And there is another part of the matter, the ministry of oil of Iraq intends to have a tender on West Qurna-1, and this is a different project now. We are ready to participate in this project based on the terms that will be offered by the government of Iraq.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last week there was a visit from the Minister of Energy at LUKOIL, we said that LUKOIL was invited to participate in tender, so can you say anything about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again we stand on the same grounds that we respect the existing agreements with the government of Iraq and we are very optimistic about the future of our relations with this country and <mark type="inaudible" /> said that Rusal filed a claim to the Court of Arbitration about the &#x2013; on the delivery of coke, today there is no monopoly in the market of coke, there are five companies in the coke market, at the same time there is a monopoly consumer, which is Rusal. So the situation is quite strange. The contract is essential 27 or 2011, I will not comment these are legal matters. No, comments should be made here. Next question?</p>

          <p>Let me congratulate you first of all on your wonderful results. And my question is about CapEx. In the presentation, you have showed 4 billion I'm not mistaken $4 billion &#x2013; $5 billion in the first six months. My question is in the second six months, I was looking at the same figure more or less and where the manual got to. In the second six months the CapEx will be greater because, there will be media acquisitions and acquisition...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is aspects and network in Turkey and the Sicily plant. All other investments will go as per schedule as per the schedule of our projects. We are very active in mergers and acquisitions. I would expect additional mergers during the second half of the year. Well, of course, and as soon as we acquired new assets that generate high added value for the company you all done about and we'll make a big announcement rest assured.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one more question please. Gas production this year &#x2013; the rate of growth, so you will review the same as on the first half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we expect them to be at least as good as in the first half of the year.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Dresdner Kleinwort. In the third quarter and the situation looks negative for oil companies, because oil prices are going down, duties are filled very high, due companies manage to keep some, I think they keep very little. Is there a common understanding between the oil industry and the government that we should reduce this lag &#x2013; this time lag between monitoring of prices and defining the duty levels? So, do you have &#x2013; are you in agreement with the government on this subject?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, frankly speaking and personally I don't think that we need to reduce this lag. Oil prices are growing slowly and they go down quite quickly. So for the oil industry, the advantage lies in a longer lag rather than a shorter one, but <mark type="inaudible" /> puts another question and it's a good one, that we need to change the mechanism of the export duty. If we manage to change this mechanism, it will be a big benefit for the whole industry. I don't know, it would be 18 or 20, even if it's just $1 up, it will be very good. It's not our initiative. We are aware of this initiative. What is important for us is that we know that the government realizes now that there should be a flatter rate on oil products and this will stimulate refining in Russia, and this will also encourage production of environmentally friendly on fuels and this will encourage investment into refineries and upgrade, refineries this is very important for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What is your target for refining inside the country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have made already the announcement, if you remember our previous presentation we said that we expect to get an additional 10 million tons of refining in Russia alone, in Russia alone yes, as to your first question this since there is a cubrian as they are known cubrian subsidiaries well nothing dramatic happened, oil prices went down now they are going back a little bit. They are going up, again, we recovered $340 million through the hedging mechanism and we found there is a balance &#x2013; checks and balances system. You see, we try to hedge the legislation of the Russian Federation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question net income, very good net income that you reported, what is the dividend company and we feel the company, do you plan to raise your dividends and if earnings per share will go down, do you intend to have any buybacks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As for the dividend policy &#x2013; a dividend policy is set, it's about 15% at least 15% of net income, so you can do the calculation yourself. If we keep the same rate &#x2013; the dividends next year will be record breaking.</p>
          <p>Buybacks, I'm not ready to comment on buyback, because this is a sensitive matter. I don't want to be accused of manipulating the market. You might have noticed that the company is buying back the shares and their main shareholders Mr. Vagit Alekperov, who are constantly buying the shares and we do not charge by  <mark type="inaudible" /> that fact.</p>
          <p>You have to shift in Venezuela and petroleum is pretty active in Venezuela and LUKOIL a few was in Venezuela and we haven't heard much from you on it &#x2013; So, I think you missed the interview of the Venezuelan President Mr. Chavez, once he was here in Russia, which you said that three companies LUKOIL, Gazprom and TNK-BP got plenty opportunities for investment in the Orinoco basin and the largest block is allocated to us for our development. And if we manage to find proof of the reserves that are there and if we manage to find common language or the political retail of Venezuela this will be one of the largest producing assets of our company as the potential that is unique. Venezuela has the largest reserves of oil in the world, and we have the potential and we have the capability of participating in production there. A little bit under the political wheel of the Venezuelan government, we are in the second stage of negotiations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one more question about the cost. Your cost in the first half are quite big. Will you keep the same rate? I mean transportation costs and other operational expenses -- will you comment please what else in addition to hedging and transportation costs are in the OpEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you speak about the costs, we keep our main cost under control, and the main factor influencing our cost is the exchange ratio between the ruble and dollar. Our costs are in rubles; our reports are in dollars. Transportation cost. You can't leave without transporting oil and Transneft is the monopoly owning the transportation network. In every year Transneft sets their tariff and we are made to work on this tariffs. We are the only company that invested into our own logistics, and in the first half of this year we got $240 million of sales because of saving our own logistics.</p>

          <p>Next question</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Anna Chavez , <mark type="inaudible" /> Agency. Two questions. The first one. Operated forecast for oil production this year in early June, it's guided the market till the June that will be quite an increase, but we didn't give us any percentage figures. So what is your information?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unfortunately, I cannot share this information with you because right now we are looking at a very interesting situation <mark type="inaudible" />. Frankly speaking from the 1st of January for our oil, we will be getting much more money than for the oil that we are producing today. So our partners in joint venture are considering the situation because from the 1st of January the tax release will be there, but we will be in the plus, so to say, at the end of the year, but I can't give you a specific figure right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Another question for Turgai Petroleum. As far as I understand Mr. Alekperov's interview recently said that you decided against the exchanging assets with CNPC and you went back to the original plan of buying the 50% share. So when do you want to exercise your preference right and what is the current state of affairs with the Turgai Petroleum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are in the procedure that it will define by the Stockholm Court of Arbitration and this procedure defines certain steps that we must take, us and CNPC, and I think that during this year we'll take the steps and we will become rightful owner of the share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. We don't have much time left actually. I can see one more raised hand and I don't see any other. So this will be the last question if you don't mind.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as far as I know LUKOIL does not have any noncore business. We had it and we sold it, we divested it. Now we have only core business: exploration, production and some sale, marketing of our core. And actually all are invited to a conference today in the evening, the symphonic orchestra we are sponsoring  will be playing.</p>

          <p>With respect of Timan-Pechora we had a special slide actually here showing the tax release that we have. This tax release from the mineral extraction tax at slide 22 in the Yamal-Nenets district we expect that the amount of crude oil subject to release in the Nenetsky Autonomous District is 33.9 million tons and total remissions for the period will reach 6.6 to 7.8 billion. This is page 22 of the presentation. Are there any other questions from the listeners on the telephone line?</p>
