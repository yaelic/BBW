        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for coming this morning, and welcome to today's presentation of Commonwealth Bank of Australia's Result for the Year Ended 30 June, 2010.</p>
          <p>Today's presentation will follow our normal process, which Ralph will kick-off and talk about the overview and the general themes. David will then talk in more detail about the results. So, after that we will have an opportunity for questions.</p>
          <p>So I'll hand over to Ralph. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Warwick, and good morning to you all.</p>
          <p>The Commonwealth Bank has today reported another good operating result, which is testament to the significant progress we've made over the last four years in executing our key strategic priorities. The result was delivered in a challenging environment, particularly in the second half as credit growth and business momentum slowed.</p>
          <p>While I remain confident about the medium to long-term outlook for the Australian economy, recent uncertainty over the pace of recovery in the United States and Europe highlight the downside risks at play, and have not helped domestic consumer and business confidence.</p>
          <p>As a result, it's appropriate to maintain a degree of caution about the short-term prospects, and we have therefore retained our conservative capital and liquidity savings. However, I remain optimistic about the strength of the Group's business franchise and our ability to continue to deliver superior returns for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the result itself, cash net profit after-tax was up 42% to $6.1 billion, statutory net profit after-tax was up 20% to almost $5.7 billion, and David Craig in his presentation will provide the reconciliation between the cash and statutory profit numbers. Return on equity rebounded strongly to a healthy 18.7%, and cash earnings per share was up 34% to $3.96. This was a strong result built on good volume growth and continuing cost discipline.</p>
          <p>Again, all of our businesses performed well, which is particularly pleasing and a testimony to a consistent, clearly defined and well-executed strategy, which the team has put in place over the last four years. Relative to position 12 months ago, the result also benefited from a reduction in impairment expense as worst of the bad debt cycle appears to have passed, and improving equity markets which drove a strong turnaround and investment experience in this period.</p>
          <p>We delivered for shareholders by raising the final dividend by $0.55 to $1.70, an increase of 48%. This lifted total dividends for the financial year to $2.90, returning the payout ratio to pre-GFC levels of 74%. Given the Group's high level of Tier 1 capital, the directors have decided to remove the previous dividend reinvestment plan discount of 1.5%, and neutralize or minimize the dilutive effect of the dividend reinvestment plan through an on-market share purchase.</p>
          <p>Since early 2006, the Commonwealth Bank has consistently pursued a simple, clear strategic plan with the objective of becoming Australia's finest financial services organization through excelling in customer service.</p>
          <p>Once again, today's good financial result is testimony to the successful execution of this strategy. As I indicated at the half year results, the Group has made significant progress over the past four years across our five core strategic priorities. And I don't intend to dwell on each of these strategies today, but I'd like to focus on one area, which has been the subject of some commentary of late, and that is the area of small business.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, much of this commentary has been, I believe, rather ill-informed. When I joined the Group some five years ago, we said about improving the Group's historically underweight position in business banking. Far from ignoring this area, as some have indicated, this has been one of the Group's five strategic goals, and I'm pleased to say that over the past four years, we have made significant progress.</p>
          <p>From an underweight position, we now have the highest or close to highest market shares in both business lending and business deposits in the country. Over the past four years, we've opened new business banking centers, we've deployed more local business bankers, put business bankers back into branches, rolled out our market leading business banking platform compass, and made a number of other enhancements to our products, systems and processes to improve business customer experience.</p>
          <p>At all times we've remained open for business, and have been ready, willing and able to support our customers. Indeed over the past six months, at a time when all of the other major banks have experienced declining balances, we have been growing our business lending balances and gaining market share.</p>
          <p>In SME lending, we are growing our balances at an annualized rate of 7%, well ahead of system growth. In business banking, our customer satisfaction score as measured by TNS has improved from 56.5% to just under 68%, and we have shown the fastest rate of improvement amongst the major banks. Further reinforcing the progress we've made, the recent DBM Business Financial Services Monitor survey recognized the Group as the number one major bank across all big business segments.</p>
          <p>More generally on customer satisfaction, we've come from a position of being a clear last to now showing consistent improvement across every segment of our business. And this year, it was particularly pleasing to have again being rewarded with the accolade of 2010 Money magazine Bank of the Year award.</p>
          <p>In the year ahead, we will concentrate on the momentum we've achieved in business banking, and continue our relentless focus on customer satisfaction underpinned by the roll-out of our core banking modernization program.</p>
          <p>This slide shows some of the many initiatives we've undertaken to help our customers and improve customer satisfaction. As you can see, improvements in customer satisfaction are translating directly into better cross-sell performance and more products to the customer.</p>
          <p>As we improved our customer satisfaction levels, we are finding that our 11 million domestic customers are increasingly willing to do more of their business with us, to the point where we now have the highest number of products per customer of the major banks.</p>
          <p>Given the size of our customer base, this translates directly into stronger revenue growth. It's also worth pointing out that within our total of 2.56 products per customer, we have the highest rate of deposit product ownership amongst the major banks. While we have made real progress, there is still significant opportunities for us to further improve our customer satisfaction and cross-sell outcomes. Core banking modernization is the next key phase in the evolution of our strategy, something which will further enhance customer experience and deliver a clear and distinct strategic advantage over coming years.</p>
          <p>The program is tracking to plan and producing some encouraging early results. The first key phase, the migration of over 1 million term deposits from our legacy Hogan package has been completed successfully, and we remain on track to migrate our remaining deposit products and transaction accounts by year-end.</p>
          <p>The Bankwest acquisition has been a very good one for the CBA. Integration work has proceeded smoothly, and Bankwest operating performance remains very strong, highlighted by growing customer numbers, improving customer satisfaction, strong income growth and significant improvements in cost to income ratio.</p>
          <p>At the time we acquired Bankwest, we were aware that while the West Coast retail franchise was of a high quality, there were likely to be credit quality issues within the business banking book, as a result of the aggressive growth strategy previously issued by Bankwest under HBOS ownership.</p>
          <p>Once we acquired Bankwest, we quickly introduced substantial improvements to lending practices and risk management procedures, and conducted a comprehensive review of the high-risk elements of the book, which we identified as being predominantly on the East Coast.</p>
          <p>Following a disappointing loan impairment experience in the March quarter, a detailed review was initiated, focused primarily on the performing component of the legacy Bankwest business book, and the results of this review were then extrapolated to the remaining lower risk segment of the book.</p>
          <p>This comprehensive review conducted in conjunction with external industry advisors has identified systemic issues in the portfolio, which led to risk rate reassessments and security revaluations, resulting in the recognition of a 212 million after-tax loan impairment expense to pre-acquisition loans. It's important to note that these problems relate to smaller performing loans that were written prior to CBA's acquisition of Bankwest.</p>
          <p>Finally, before turning to the outlook, I wanted to talk about a few broader issues. Not only has 2010 been a good year for the Group and shareholders, but has also delivered great outcomes for all the stakeholders. What this slide shows is that our shareholders are only one of a number of groups who share in the $18 billion of revenue, which we generate each year.</p>
          <p>As an organization, we employee over 45,000 people, and in a period where many global banks have been reducing head count, we actually increased the number of employees in the 2010 year as we've grown our business.</p>
          <p>Last year, we paid out people over $4.5 billion, which help support families and communities right across Australia. At the same time, we remain committed to retaining jobs within Australia, and are not currently undertaking or planning to undertake any offshoring. Much of the $4 billion of expenses shown on this slide was paid to many thousands of external third-party suppliers for a wide range of products and services. All of these companies received competitive remuneration and provided employment to thousands of Australians and contribute directly to the economy.</p>
          <p>We are re-investing in the business to ensure that it remains strong and has the ability to continue to grow profitably. We also paid over $2.9 billion on taxes in the 2010 financial year. And finally, our 780,000 shareholders have benefited from the Group's robust performance and financial resilience. With the Group paying out 74% of its profits, they will receive $4.5 billion in dividends for this financial year, and most of that will go directly to moms and dads, or indirectly to millions of Australians via the superannuation funds.</p>
          <p>Our customers tell us that we are providing them with better service and they're rewarding us by doing more of their business with us. In addition, in the current year, we've reduced exception and ATM usage fees to our retail and business customers by over $200 million. And while consumers in many countries are finding it difficult to get credit, we continue to support our customers with over $100 billion of new loans and advances, most of which were to our retail and small business customers.</p>
          <p>As I've noted before, robust banking systems are the cornerstone of a strong economy. So in part, the relatively good performance of the Australian economy over the past two years can be attributed to the strength of our banking system. In fact, it is our continued strong performance that has enabled us to remain one of only a handful of global banks to still have a AA credit rating. Without that rating, it would have been much more difficult and significantly more expensive for us to raise funds in wholesale markets, which would have in turn made supporting our customers much more challenging.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the outlook. Despite some improvement, the global recovery remains uneven with concerns about the advanced economies balanced out by strength in the emerging economies. However, the Australian economy remains well placed relative to most other developed countries. Pleasingly, some of the uncertainty over capital and liquidity requirements for the industry, which has persisted for some time has diminished, thanks to the collaborative efforts of the banks and the regulators over the past 18 months. Recent uncertainty over the pace of recovery in the United States and Europe highlight the downside global economic risks still in play. These risks have not helped domestic business and consumer confidence, both of which remain fragile.</p>
          <p>This fragility manifests itself in slowing &#x2013; in the slowing and the underlying momentum of our business at the end of the 2010 financial year. As a result, it is appropriate to maintain a degree of caution about the prospects for our business for the coming year, and we intend to retain conservative capital and liquidity settings for the foreseeable future, so that we are able to provide support to our customers in what are uncertain times. Despite the current economic headwinds, I'm optimistic about the medium term outlook for Australia and the Group's ability to deliver superior returns for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And I'll now hand over to David Craig to run you through the results in greater detail. Thank you. David?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning everybody. It's nice to be able to talk another good result to you.</p>
          <p>Analysts and investors have been asking me a number of particular questions of late focusing on some very specific issues. And so I'm going to try to cover those in this presentation. Now in so doing and in keeping the presentation to a manageable length, some of the favorite slides that you've probably seen in the past have been relegated to the back of the pack or included in other material. But I'm sure that in the 311 pages of material we've released to you today, all of your questions are going to be answered.</p>
          <p>So turning to the result, as Ralph has pointed out, a $6.1 billion cash net profit after-tax was up 42%. At a headline level, our revenue for the year is up 6% and expenses up 5, giving a positive jaws, and an operating performance up 8. However, in the second half of the year, there has been some slowing in revenue and negative jaws and I will explain that a little later on.</p>
          <p>You'll also notice that the result has benefited from a turnaround in investment experience, which went from negative 263 million last year to positive 236 million, with the improvement in equity markets, and of course, a significantly lower impairment expense.</p>
          <p>If we have a look at the statutory profit compared to the cash net profit after-tax, you will see two significant items that are classified below the line. The first one, the New Zealand conduit tax settlement, which was reported in the first half of the year, and the second one being $216 million of non-cash items on Bankwest, primarily being as Ralph has pointed out, the result of the detailed review we did on performing loans, pre-acquisition performing loans in the Bankwest book, which proved to be far less well provided for than we expected, and we've adjusted that effectively against the $614 million acquisition profit that we declared last year. The other non-cash items are pretty much consistent with prior year's.</p>
          <p>If we have a look at each of the business units, it's pleasing to see that really across the board we've had strong underlying operating profit growth. In the case of the retail bank, a further 15% growth in operating revenue with 9% banking income growth and costs is flat. Volume is a key driver in the banking result across the board, and I'm going to go through that in more detail in a moment. In institutional banking and markets, income was up 7%, margins improved, and importantly, our cash net profit after-tax was up over $1 billion, of course, with the release of impairment or reversal of impairment problems.</p>
          <p>At the same time, expenses in that business were up 17%, as a reflection of the fact that it's a far more profitable business, and so there were higher compensation paid to the employees in that area, and as well as that we've been investing in parts of our business.</p>
          <p>In Business and Private Banking, it's really pleasing to see double-digit growth in every single one of the businesses there, income up 11% and costs up 3. As Ralph has pointed out, Bankwest income was up 25 and costs down 3, and that's driven our cost to income ratio in that business, down from 66% a year ago to now 51%.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management, again, pleasing to see increase in funds under administration, and improving markets have led to income up 5, and costs again under control, up just 1.</p>
          <p>And then finally in New Zealand, the recession there is finally abiding but there are some one-offs that make that results look the way it does. The year before last, we had break fees that &#x2013; fees paid to the bank by customers going from fixed rate loans to variable rate loans, and they were 100 million higher in the corresponding previous period, and trading income declined on the back of lower volatility.</p>
          <p>Really the headline story in this result is about volume. As Ralph has said, a drive on customer satisfaction and competitive pricing has seen volume greater than system in every one of our major products. Our home lending and business lending both up well. Deposits in both household and business growing greater than system. And funds under administration growing ahead of system. What's particularly pleasing to see here is that with business lending in the system declining 3.7, our business lending grew 3.3. And specifically, within that, our SME lending actually grew at 7%.</p>
          <p>Those volume growth numbers have really driven the operating result. As you can see, $919 million added to our operating income for the year through volume, offset to some degree by the 219 million impact of reductions in exception fees and other fees, particularly in the retail bank. You will see that our trading income for the year is pretty much flat period &#x2013; each six month period, settling between 290 and $310 million, and funds and insurance income is just steadily increasing.</p>
          <p>The other side of the ledger from the volume, though, is the price, and there is no doubt that our funding costs have continued to increase. The left-hand diagram here shows the yield curve or the cost of raising funds just before the recession and what that yield curve looked like at the 30th of June, 2010. And as you can see, a very significant increase as we roll off low interest, pre-GFC debt for much higher cost debt now, it's increasing our funding costs. And that you can see in the right-hand diagram under the Wholesale Funding where since the beginning of the GFC, our wholesale funding costs have increased 89 basis points.</p>
          <p>Significantly, though, this has also impacted consumer deposits with a great deal of competition in this market from regional banks and, of course, from the Big Four. And in the deposits space, our cost of funds has increased 146 basis points, so when you count the fact that that 58% of our funding comes from that retail deposit market or consumer deposit market, our increased funding costs since the beginning of the GFC is 122 basis points.</p>
          <p>This chart shows you our net interest margin in six monthly periods since the beginning of the GFC, starting with the decline that was caused by the original turbulence, the higher funding costs, which were not immediately passed on to our customers, and then the repricing that occurred to take account of the much higher risk that hadn't been properly factored into pricing, as well as those higher funding costs, which peaked early in the first half of this year. But since then, net interest margin has been under pressure from continuingly higher funding costs, which has driven net interest margin down 10 basis points in the second half.</p>
          <p>You can see this more specifically when you look at the retail bank. Pre-GFC, we had a margin in that area of 251 basis points, which had declined to 226 by the beginning of this year. It picked up early on in this year, as we had an out-of-cycle rate rise of 10 basis points in June that flowed through in the first half. But in the second half, as you can see, 24 basis points of incremental funding on the retail book, which is only being very partially recovered in pricing. And so margins in the retail bank are down 14 basis points in the second half.</p>
          <p>It's been these higher funding costs then that have driven our negative operating income in the second half. As you can see, there are three fewer working days in the second half, and that's accounted for about 1% of decline or 98 million. And the fee changes that occurred in the first half have had a compound effect in the second half, knocking a further 47 million off. But it has been the $280 million decline on margins or 3% that has really told the story in the second half result on income.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, looking at the other side of the ledger on costs, you are aware that in the first half, we were able to contain our cost growth to just 1%, and I am pleased to say that in the second half, that's been further contained to just a further 1.5%, with most of that being related to IT expense, maintenance, development, and just significantly higher volumes going through the business that lead to higher IT costs.</p>
          <p>However, and very pleasingly from my point of view, throughout this period and for the third successive year, we have invested more than $1 billion in our business. We're determined to get this business right and to set it up perfectly for the future. Of course, core banking modernization that Ralph was talking about is a very substantial portion of that investment spend.</p>
          <p>Turning now to impairment, and what you can see here is impairment expense running pretty much as we predicted. That is, in December '08 we had the spike from institutional banking when the GSC first hit.</p>
          <p>That then tailed off through SME and consumer lending, which in the case of CBA, we voluntarily passed the peak of, but it has a longer lag on it. But unfortunately, Bankwest has continued to have problems in its legacy book, and that has been a cost to this year. On the right-hand side, you can see that in the second half of the year, we've expensed $441 million of impairment for Bankwest and 251 million for the rest of the CBA Group.</p>
          <p>However, we have continued to maintain strong and conservative balance sheet provisioning. With the total provisioning sitting pretty much same level as it was at December, the management overlay has reduced slightly but it's still very strong at $1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, the reason for that reduction in management overlay is purely an improvement in credit in the CBA book. So as the quality of the underlying loans improves, the collected provision declines and the management overlay relating to that collected provision declines, and that's what you're seeing flowing through there.</p>
          <p>You can see what I was talking about on the consumer bank on the right-hand side with consumer arrears across the board, declining, and they're declining also in New Zealand, which is not specifically shown there.</p>
          <p>Looking at impaired assets, you can see that in this current period new impaired assets are 46 billion, down from the 51 and 49 of the prior two periods. So there is a tailing off going on in most &#x2013; a big chunk of that 46 billion, of course &#x2013; 46 basis points, I'm sorry, is Bankwest.</p>
          <p>The total impaired at 102 is up, but, of course, you're going to see that continue to rise slightly, because once loans get into that impaired bucket it takes a long while to work through insolvency or whatever, and so it will be awhile before that tails down.</p>
          <p>Now another question that I have been asked about a lot is funding, and in particular funding for Australia, and there is no doubt that at the moment we are facing a long-term issue as a country. Our credit growth in this country is greater than our deposit growth, because we're growing in strong economy. And so that means that our funding task is greater than the domestic capacity to fund us. We have to fund offshore, and of course, we know that our global funding costs are increasing significantly, and they're going to continue to increase, in part because of the volatility overseas, in part because international banks are now starting to lend. And so if they're going to start to lend, they'll start to borrow in their own markets; and in part because the regulation internationally is causing those banks to have to hold more liquid assets and to term out their debt. So the competition for international long-term debt is tough, and that will keep rates internationally high.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, looking at the impact of regulation locally, as Ralph has said, I think there has been some very good work done, and while we're not through the entire regulatory thing, it's clear that in Australia we will be able to manage that regulation, although overtime we will certainly have to continue building up our liquid assets, and that means that we'll have to continue funding more.</p>
          <p>In Australia, rather uniquely, home loans, all of our home loans are on bank balance sheets. Now that's quite different to what other financial systems have. We don't have the active securitization markets with some of the other methods of taking home loans off balance sheet but other countries do, and so our balance sheets do look different.</p>
          <p>But Australia itself as a country remains an extremely attractive investment proposition where a strong fast-growing economy tapped into Asia, and we're going to as a country continue to attract both equity and debt investment. It's just a question of how that will come through.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, the Australian banks are very well regarded internationally. CBA like its peers has had a step change in funding costs, but our excess to debt markets internationally and locally remains extremely strong. We are very well regarded internationally, and as you know we've retained our AA stable rating.</p>
          <p>We continue to mange our treasury operations in a prudent manner, which means that we strive to have as diversified a funding profile as we can. We are continuing to extend our term maturity and we are pre-funding to ensure that when there is a volatility, let there was, for example, in the last quarter, we don't have to go out and fund that, the most ridiculously high rates. At year-end we got about $14 billion pre-funded towards this current year. And particularly we are working very collaboratively with the ABA, with Treasury and with regulators on these systemic issues for Australia, and I am confident that they will be addressed appropriately.</p>
          <p>Let's turn then to the funding and what's happened for the year. Well, what this chart shows you is a few things. Firstly, that almost all of our funding needed to fund our asset growth came from deposits this year, $26 billion of additional deposits. Wholesale funding, in fact, in aggregate only accounted for $3 billion of our funding. However, what you can see under there is a significant shift from short-term wholesale funding into long-term.</p>
          <p>Now this is a prudent measure to ensure that we have long stable funding but it comes as a significant cost, and you can see from the graph below the bars that we are effectively replacing cheap old short-term debt with much more expensive long-term debt and that carries with it the cost.</p>
          <p>If we look at what's happened to funding as a whole, our new funding this year was at an average tenure of five years, and that's increased our total long-term debt tenure to 3.8 years, up from 3.6 years at the beginning of this year. At the same time, retail deposit or consumer deposits now account for 58% of our total funding, up from 56%, and we're keeping &#x2013; increasing our liquid asset holdings.</p>
          <p>Tier 1 Capital organically has continued to grow, and you can see that we were looking at upwards of 9.52% of capital before considering this on market purchase. From our point of view, we don't need that much capital, and so we are &#x2013; as Ralph has pointed out, taking the discount off our DRP and we will conduct an on market buyback to neutralize the DRP and bring our capital back to 9.15%, which we still regard as extremely strong and conservative. Our Tier 1 ratio has increased from 8.07 to 9.15, and on a U.K. FSO basis that's equivalent to 12.82%.</p>
          <p>So let me summarize for you. It's been another good financial result; with cash net profit after tax at 6.1 billion, up 42%. Our return on equity for this year is 18.7%. This is being driven by very strong volume growth with all our major products performing ahead of system. However, the headwind has been in margin, with margins down 10 basis points in the second half. In the face of this, we've been keeping our costs very tightly under control, with costs in the second half only increasing 1.5%, but at the same time we'd continue to invest in our business with a further $1 billion invested in the current year.</p>
          <p>As Ralph has said, we are maintaining our very conservative settings with $1.2 billion of management overlay in our provisioning with a Tier 1 ratio of close to 9.2% and $14 billion of pre-funding on our debt profile. Above all though, it's been our clear and focused strategy, our focus on those five key initiatives, and in particular, continuing focus on improving our customer satisfaction, that is driving these volume increases and delivering the great result.</p>
          <p>Ralph and I would now like to take any questions you may have.</p>

          <p>Thanks, David. Just before we kick-off, just a couple of ground rules. Can you please wait for the microphone and also identify yourself, and if you could just limit yourself to two questions initially. I understand there is some media on the line, appreciate if they could keep their questions till the media briefing this afternoon. And I'll start questions from the floor and then I'll move to the phone.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi guys, Jon Mott from UBS. Just a question, some of the issues that you talked about there, a strong credit growth in the second half, but obviously the margin got hit and with the funding cost obviously going up. Are we now at this stage where the marginal cost of funding is almost equal to the marginal revenue you're getting on these loans that you're writing at the moment? And is it actually, are we now in a situation that unless we re-price, we're now seeing profitless growth across the banking sector? And if that's the case, should the banks just keep lending over, what's the outlook for the return on assets going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think, Jonathan, we've reached that point yet that the marginal cost for &#x2013; on a loan from the point of view of funding cost has reached the point where its profitless business. But certainly over the second half, we did see a diminution in margin of 10 basis points, but margin was still overall at around 2.08%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Victor German from Nomura. Just a question on bad debts.</p>
          <p>I understand the rationale that you've outlined with relation to Bankwest, but are you able to, first of all, make assurance that we should not expect further deterioration in that book and further below the line adjustments? And also, if you actually experience, what you experienced in that book improves going forward, should we expect write-backs to be below the line as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that we will treat the write-backs consistently in regard to those particular &#x2013; that particular portfolio of loans that we have gone through without operation Magellan to establish where the weaknesses were in that portfolio. You will notice that there were significant bad debt expense above the line in regard to Bankwest, but this was primarily due to the fact that that particular book of loans, which are all currently performing was the fact that we were concerned during the third quarter that we saw a number of loans that came straight from the loan book without going through a watchlist to being impaired. And as a result of that, we decided to undertake obviously a very rigorous review of that portfolio, and came to the conclusion that based on Commonwealth Bank writings, they are about one and a half writing levels higher than that would be on the Commonwealth Bank book.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we also looked at the collateral supporting those loans, and came to the conclusion with expert advice that the valuations in regard to that collateral were also inflated. And as a result of that, we came to the conclusion that we would take that write-off below the line against the pre-acquisition profit that we booked last year below the line because if we had obviously established that in the first half of last year, we would have netted that off at the &#x2013; against the pre-acquisition profit, so that's the rationale.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. I just want to actually ask a bit on the margin inside. You've mentioned some housing &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; you've shown your retail books had a bit of contraction in the margin in the second half. Just a view on an out-of-cycle rate rise I know you need there?</p>
          <p>And second question is just actually, having a look at your outlook statement, you are saying that the business has slowed or the momentum has slowed towards the end of the financial year in '11. Just a bit of a view as to where you expect that to go? I notice your credit forecast is still relatively high at about 9.5%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure, James. I think the issue here in regard to out-of-cycle increases, we haven't made any decision in regard to that situation. All I'll say is that we've worked very hard over the period of the last two and a half years, as the global financial crisis has obviously wound its way through the system, to make sure that we've balanced the interest of our customers with the interest of our shareholders.</p>
          <p>And certainly, when you look at our mortgage rate, we've been either the lowest or the second lowest of all the major banks and the regionals through that period. And certainly we see the need to make sure that we do remain competitive in the marketplace. And certainly we've obviously got to manage our funding costs and our pricing, obviously on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>So we will continue to monitor this situation, and we will make decisions in regard to what we have to do in regard to pricing as and when necessary.</p>
          <p>As far as growth is concerned, I don't think there is any doubt that everybody around the country has experienced a degree of drop-off in activity during the last two to three months. And I think that our view is that the first half will be a little softer than possibly we thought coming into this year &#x2013; that is, the calendar year. And I think that my view is that the second half will be stronger.</p>
          <p>And if you look at the underlying performance of the Australian economy, you look at the situation regarding the trading surpluses that we are seeing coming through. There is no doubt that the Australian economy is, underlying, performing well.</p>
          <p>I think that you'll see obviously a flow through into the economy from those higher levels of trading balance into the overall economy as far as further investment. But I think that that's probably going to be lighter in this half rather than earlier in this half, so that would give me some confidence that the second half would be stronger.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Craig Williams from Citi here. Your response to James's first question there, I think suggested that you are keeping an eye on your funding costs.</p>
          <p>So do you think there is a need to control deposit pricing as an industry a bit more than has been the case, rather than necessarily the recovery of your retail and <mark type="inaudible" /> margins coming on the asset side of the balance sheet?</p>
          <p>And a second question, with respect to the core banking system amortization in particular. Slide 41 and 40 sort of gives a bit of color there, but how much of the cost of this project are we seeing through the P&amp;L over the next couple of years? And how much sort of really hits the P&amp;L, once the project is largely built out and complete?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will pass over to David to talk about the second part of your question first. Dave, in regard to the core banking system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it would be amortized over, I think, 10 &#x2013; Michael? 10 years. And basically the amortization starts as different components within the system are turned on.</p>
          <p>So very little has yet been turned on, so there is very little amortization. It will be I think 2013 would be the first year of full amortization. And then the last of that will be 10 years after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In regard to deposit pricing, well, deposit pricing is really a situation where the market prevails.</p>
          <p>We certainly have, in the second half of the financial year, probably taken a more competitive stance than we took in the first half of the year. And the reason for that was that we did see some outflow of deposits. But if you look at our position today, we have increased our proportion of domestic funding versus wholesale funding to 58%.</p>
          <p>And certainly, there's obviously been a lot of pressure from a number of financial institutions who have not been able to access wholesale money because of their ratings, which has led to a situation where they've obviously bid up the cost of deposits. And therefore we've had to go some way towards competing. So I don't think the ACCC would be very keen for me to make any comments about &#x2013; and I wouldn't be keen to make any comments about what they should do in regard to the system.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse. First of all, a follow-up question to Victor's question, acknowledging you're taking the Bankwest provision below the line against the acquisition cost.</p>
          <p>Why has it taken eighteen months? I thought this would have been done during due diligence, so why has it taken eighteen months to do that? I thought that was all part of the negotiation with HBOS. So that's first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, just more broader question. Outlook for lower loan growth going forward. You've really &#x2013; you've started a backdoor buyback with this result. With capital being less than what we thought it had ultimately be from regulation, what's the likelihood that we move into more broader reaching capital management initiatives to &#x2013; as a big lever for the cash EPS line going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Looking at the first question, in regard to the issue around those Bankwest loans, I'd make the point that these loans were performing loans, so they are not &#x2013; they weren't impaired. They would not have been found through the due diligence process that we undertook. And also, at the same time, we had a situation where, because they were performing, they would not have been part of the settlement arrangements that we had with HBOS or Lloyds based around impaired loans.</p>
          <p>So, as I say, these loans weren't impaired &#x2013; as I said, caused us some concern. Because when we saw a number of loans during our third quarter, which was the first calendar quarter of this year, going from &#x2013; straight from the loan book into impairment without having gone through a watchlist process. And as a result of that, we said, well, hey, we want to have a look at this whole book and understand its dynamics. And that's the reason why.</p>
          <p>As far as the work that we did in regard to impaired loans or large loans that we had concerns about, I think that we did that job particularly well. This is an issue around East Coast small loans. On average, these loans were under &#x2013; or around $8 million. There's about 1,100 of them. We've gone through 67% of those, which were at the high risk-end of that book, and then extrapolated the findings across the other third. At the same time, we obviously employed advisors to assist with the process because it did take a lot of resource, and we wanted to make sure that we got it right.</p>
          <p>And I have to say we have made some management changes in regard to risk management at Bankwest as a result of this. And so certainly I have to say, Jarrod, I share your concerns. And I have to say that I was very concerned about this, and I think that the process that we have adopted in order to make sure that we've got on top of this has been carried out.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the capital &#x2013; on the capital side, look, I mean, clearly we're still waiting to see what the final capital rules are, and particularly these sort of rules around possible cyclical buildups of buffers and so on.</p>
          <p>But what's very clear to us is that with the rate &#x2013; now that the cycle is turned, and so we're generating capital rather than having procyclical capital rates going the other way, we can generate lots of capital. It seems silly to have a DRP churning out even more new capital at this time of the cycle.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ralph, Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. In the retail bank, the ROI fell by about 5 basis points to 95 basis points in half. Given the pressure on funding costs and also some pressure on fees that you've flagged, do you think your level of retail bank profitability is sustainable? And do you consider NAB's pricing strategy as a threat to profitability for retail banking in Australia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the interesting thing is, yeah, obviously, we've gone through this period where we've seen some compression in margin, and certainly you are right that we've seen a reduction in the return on average assets in the retail book.</p>
          <p>I mean, pricing is pricing, and it changes over time, so I mean I'm not going to get too concerned about that from the point of view of whether this is a point in time or a permanent change. I don't think that is the case.</p>
          <p>As far as our business is concerned, what we've demonstrated I think over the last year or two as we've got our customer service proposition right is that our customers have been prepared to do much more business with us. You can see that from the cross-sell ratio, you can see that from the products per customer, you can see it from the point of view of our customer's view of us as an organization.</p>
          <p>I get letters of commendation from our customers now. I very rarely see a letter of complaint addressed to the Chief Executive. And the reason for that is that the problems are solved at the lowest level within the organization, so they don't have to be shot up the line to the Chief Executive. But I do see, every week, significant letters coming in commending our service and saying that regardless of price, even, the quality of our service is such that they want to continue to be a customer in the organization.</p>
          <p>Now that is, I think, very unusual. And I think if you look at a number of proof points &#x2013; I mean the complaints to the ombudsman have reduced two-thirds over the time since we put this strategy in place. If you look at the Bank of the Year award, which had a significant component this year based around customer service and customer satisfaction, which was done by mystery shopping across the country through branches, through call centers, et cetera, we beat off all of our competitors and the regional banks in that regard.</p>
          <p>So, I think that then that's, when it's done on a basis of a common approach, rather than based on one of prejudice or whatever, so based on looking at things on an even-handed basis. So I feel that, when I look at the trends, I look at the amount of business that we're generating internally with our customer base, then I feel quite very much of the view that, in the end &#x2013; you have price driven strategies. Price driven strategies will work part of the way. But if you've got high levels of missed settlements with your mortgage customers, if you're making mistakes around transactions, you're not being responsible enough, you're not taking ownership and following up customer complaints &#x2013; that I think in the end accounts for a significant amount of customer loyalty.</p>
          <p>And certainly I think that from where we stand, we will operate a business that will be sustainable. One that's based around treating our customers appropriately and making sure that we are selling our products and our services for a fair price.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mike Wiblin from Macquarie up here. Can you just remind us of the amount that you've pre-funded for FY11, and how much of that is part of the FY11 total term wholesale funding requirement?</p>
          <p>And then just going forward, is it the intention to actually to continue to replace short-term wholesale with term funding? And are you going to be sort of funding growth going forward with deposits? Or just talk a little bit about funding mix and how you see that playing out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think this year was rather unusual in only a net $3 billion being needed in long-term wholesale funding. So that I wouldn't necessarily say that's typical of any given year.</p>
          <p>I think I mentioned that we're about $14 million pre-funded. What that funding task is for the year is a little unclear because it depends a bit credit growth, obviously, and on deposit growth. But at this stage, we are targeting to raise about the same amount this year as we did last year.</p>
          <p>And in terms of strategy of short to long, we are probably, at this stage, done on shifting from short to long at this stage, but again, it's going to depend on how the liquidity rules play out as to how much and in what form we have to hold liquid assets. And that will be something that will become clearer, I suspect, over the next 12 months.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning to you all. A question on troublesome exposures.</p>
          <p>I remember at the trading update on the third quarter that you were unable to provide us with details around the breakdown of the troublesome exposure. Now it seems that for Bankwest it has moved from 1.7 billion in the December quarter to 2.8 billion in the June quarter, but also I see an uptrend for the CBA troublesome exposure from 5.5 billion to 5.7 billion. At the same time, you are releasing part of that economic overlay in the half, if I look at the 90 days past due residential mortgages in a sort of slight uptrend in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Could you comment around asset quality in the CBA book? And then also shed some light on troublesome exposures for the whole of CBA Group please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, and I might get Alden Toevs, our Chief Risk Officer, to comment, as well.</p>
          <p>From our point of view, troublesome exposures is a less well-defined term. Impaired is very black and white. You know when an asset is impaired or when it isn't. What's tending to happen as we come through towards the end of the cycle is we are being even more diligent in identifying things that might potentially prove to be troublesome.</p>
          <p>And so I think that the slight uptick from 5.5 to 5.7 for CBA is more a reflection of greater diligence or greater care, so to speak, than of actually increasing exposure. In fact, our experience in the CBA book, as you know, we only expensed 250 million in the second half, has been one of &#x2013; to be honest surprised at how quickly and how well &#x2013; how quickly the book is recovering and how well it's performed throughout the cycle.</p>
          <p>Our 90-day arrears are down pretty well across the board. I think you're looking perhaps at a slight uptick i.e. in personal loans in ASP at 90 days. That's pretty immaterial to the Group as a whole.</p>
          <p>Clearly, the uptick in Bankwest, on the other hand, was as a result of this detailed review that Ralph ran you through, where we identified a number of new troublesome loans. And of course, that provided for those during the second half.</p>
          <p>Alden, is there anything else you want to add to that?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can I ask a follow-up question on the liquid assets? I'm just wondering, we see the minimum capital requirement going down to 34 billion, yet you've maintained a high level of 89 billion, resulting in a liquid asset multiple of 2.6 times. When would you expect to wind down part of the surplus in your liquid asset book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to be honest, I don't think we will be winding down surplus, as much as I might like to. The rules that are going to come in are going to require us to hold more liquid assets over time.</p>
          <p>What we're waiting for is clarity around exactly what types of assets can be held for those liquid assets, because I think you'll be aware the proposals originally globally were for banks to hold liquid assets in the form of government debt. Australia doesn't have enough government debt to cover what the banks need to hold in liquid assets, so we're all just working on a solution to that particular problem. But I don't think we're going to see liquids declining.</p>

          <p>The capital position is that that you start to grow into that and see that gradually decline from the very high levels that you've been enjoying when you generate capital. Do you see that as an issue given that relative to the sort of European banks, now you're just sort of hovering around middle of the pack. And given Australia is still very dependent in offshore funding markets.</p>
          <p>And then just a follow-up question to that is just, how do you see some of those structural issues that you've been &#x2013; you discussed in one of your slides as being resolved? Is there something quite material? Is it something like covered bonds? What are you sort of thinking in terms of your forward planning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the first question, about our capital levels. And I think there are lots of questions in there, Ben.</p>
          <p>But on slide 104 in the pack, we have a comparison where our Tier 1 Capital is compared to the European banks. And 12.8%, we are significantly ahead of the pack, with average Tier 1 being at 11.4, and we're at 12.8.</p>
          <p>So we're certainly not in middle of any pack there. And we're not having &#x2013; when we talk to debt investors, we're not having any issues at all about recognizing that we have and have always had &#x2013; and by the way, the four Australian banks, as well &#x2013; very strong capital position relative to global capital.</p>
          <p>As far as where we're going with capital, again, I'd repeat that we're waiting to get absolute clarification on where capital is supposed to be and whether or not we have to build up buffers in good times. Once we have clarity on that then we'll be able to formulate a final capital strategy.</p>
          <p>On the question of funding, yes, we're talking to regulators and Treasury and others about a range of things and in particular covered bonds would be a logical &#x2013; well, partial solution to the funding issues. Australia is the only developed economy in the world that doesn't have a covered bond market, and certainly covered bond markets in Europe held up remarkably well during the GFC. So, they are one of the logical solutions that we're discussing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's Matt Davison for Merrill Lynch. A couple of more questions on bad debts. Firstly, in the outlook statement, you've suggested that impairment losses will continue to trend lower. I just wanted to confirm that the base for that was the second half, and within that whether you think both the Bankwest book and the ex-Bankwest book will trend lower or whether it's a Group statement?</p>
          <p>And the second question is just related to the Bankwest review. I'm just wondering if you could give a bit more color on the geography of those problem loans and whether the security issues were a Bankwest specific issue or one you view more as an industry problem in that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So your first question was on &#x2013; sorry, just the general trend in loan impairment expense. Yes it will be down, it will be down on the second half, and it will be down in both Bankwest and CBA. That is certainly what we're expecting at this stage. As far as the review of problem loans across Bankwest, we've got two distinctly different things happening here. On the one hand, the major part of expense that's been incurred in Bankwest since we bought that business has been East Coast property. Well, there is no doubt that that's being the big hit. They were lending imprudently on property on the East Coast and that's had a big burn.</p>
          <p>The review that Ralph referred to where we looked at 1100 accounts was across the entire portfolio, and what we found was systemically credit practices in Bankwest, three acquisition were not good. So systematically they were overrating the credit quality of the accounts, and systemically they were overvaluing, I should say the underlying security.</p>
          <p>Those two things meant that across the book that below the line hit of 212 million after-tax related across the book, and was more systemic in nature. Those things are being corrected, they're not &#x2013; with all of these things, we are not losing money on the post-acquisition lending, and the post-acquisition lending is a much, much higher quality. It's much more the CBA style of lending, but we certainly had problems pre-acquisition, and that's why we've seen some change in staff and policies and processes.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian Johnson, CLSA. I have three questions if I may. The first one is, if you really summarize what's going on with Bankwest, is it you guys stuffed up the due diligence because you certainly reviewed the impaired assets but you didn't review what HBOS actually declared wasn't impaired. Can we get some commitment that going forward when you do a due diligence, you won't be taking their word for what's good and what's bad, the potential vendor? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is if you refer on page 112, we see that the balance sheet provisioning has actually declined by about $150 million, but when we have a look at the expected loss, the regulatory requirement has actually gone up by $210 million, which is suggesting that, to me anyway, at least that the regulator is suggesting that you actually need more provisioning coverage rather than less. Could we get some comment on that?</p>
          <p>And then the final one is the one that I'll continue my decade long practice of asking about. In March of 2010, APRA basically came out with their financial conglomerates proposal, which basically suggests by the beginning of, I think at the end of 2012 but early 2013, capital enhancement and double gearing will be a thing of the past. Can we get some feeling as to how you &#x2013; notwithstanding the capital management initiatives you've announced today but the quantum that that would have on the Tier 1 and the aggregate Tier 1 and the aggregate capital, and how you intend to make up what I'm guessing would be gap of about $2.2 billion, which isn't all that far away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the first question, Brian, in regard to Bankwest and due diligence. Obviously, the acquisition of Bankwest was done quite quickly, was based around a purchase price of 0.8 times book. In the end, after the settlement of the transaction, we ended up with a cost of 0.7 times book. This particular additional cost has taken us back to about 0.8 times book as being the cost of the acquisition.</p>
          <p>I would do this sort of acquisition a 100 times over if I had the opportunity, if I could buy a 0.8 times book. When I look at the underlying performance improvement that we've brought to that business over the last 12 to 15 months, and our ability to continue to grow its market share, grow its customer base, from my perspective I look at it as being a very successful acquisition. I am annoyed about what's happened, and have taken steps to rectify that, and at the same time some people have paid with their jobs as a result of this.</p>
          <p>Well, I have to say that regardless of whether we've known about these performing loans with inflated credit ratings and issues around the value of collateral, we would have still done the transaction. And unfortunately, we would not have been able to get any recompense from HBOS or Lloyds in regard to these loans because these loans were performing. The arrangement in regard to the acquisition was in regard to impaired loans, not in regard to performing loans.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Brian, I think your second question is around the $90 million adjustment on capital &#x2013; Sorry, well on the calculation of regulatory expected loss?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that what happens is, as you know, there is a difference between the accounting standards and the way you can calculate provisions versus what the regulators require.</p>
          <p>The regulators just take a formula on home loans, for example, 20% home loans. And as economic times improve, the amount of provision you need from an accounting point of view declines with the amount of provision you need from a regulatory point of view just as the same. So surface comes up and you get $90 million or 45 million of which becomes an adjustment against capital in terms of the calculation. So that's all that that represents.</p>
          <p>On your favorite question on conglomerates, there is a lot of &#x2013; one way to go here. Firstly, I think it's important that the market understands that there is no proposal for any change in Tier 1 capital as a result of the conglomerates standard and whether or not this non-recourse debt is traded one way or not. It's a Level 3 capital adjustment if it happens. Now, then you get the question of the interpretation of what the conglomerate standard is, and it is very unclear and APRA hasn't yet made a decision on whether or not non-recourse debt is or is not an adjustment in terms of Level 3 capital, and that's a discussion that we're having on an ongoing basis. That long-term debt amortizes over a period.</p>
          <p>There's 1.5 billion, Brian, of that remaining would be 75 basis points of capital roughly, but not level &#x2013; not Tier 1 capital. It's Level 3 conglomerate capital. If it were to be adjusted. But as I said, APRA hasn't reached a conclusion and nor have we about whether or not that needs to be adjusted.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The regulatory adjustment on page 112 includes a very conservative loss upon home loans that's dictated by APRA 20%, downturn LGD, so the number for this page has that very conservative level of calculation in it, which then would be far in excess of the 90 million. So we would say that it's not a likely outcome that we would have this result actually transpire that would lead to these kinds of numbers.</p>

          <p>Brett Le Mesurier from Axiome Equities. David, a simple question on the cost of funds.

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>And we might go back to the phones. David Marshall, you had a question I understand. Sorry. Oh. Which reads, in regard to regulatory reforms, NEB indicated that it might need an additional $50 billion of term funding to meet stable funding requirements. Has CBA assessed the possible impact on its own funding needs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, this is about the most perplexing, difficult question to answer because there is so many moving parts and the regulations or the proposed regulations is changing all the time.</p>
          <p>We don't actually expect at this stage any significant impact from the stable funding ratio. However, we are as I flagged expecting to have to hold more liquids, and probably it's about $50 billion more liquids over the next five years on a current view. But as I said it's changing all the time because as every time you hear from the regulators they have changed their minds on just what they are doing.</p>

          <p>Philip Parker, Parker Asset Management. Could you just give us a feel for home loan defaults year on year from last year with the interest rate rise going up? And secondly, are you having any pressure put on you with regards to the payback of late fees on credit cards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as far as, I can't &#x2013; David is obviously going to look up those numbers, while I address this. So I think one of the interesting elements is obviously looking at what's happened with customers in hardship. We go back to the peak for us was around 13,000 customers were having hardship. Process is applied to their particular relationships. That has now dropped to 5,000, so there has been quite a significant reduction in the number of customers that are now in our hardship arrangement process. So I think that that speaks well for what's happening to the underlying book in regard to credit cards, personal loans and home loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, specifically on home loans, we had 400, at the peak we had 4,642 home loan customers on the customer assistance, and today that's 912. So there has been a dramatic reduction. We are not seeing &#x2013; in fact, as you see arrears have gone down, so all the indicators are that our customers are coping well with interest rates at the current level. Alden, I don't know if you have any addition on credit cards? No. Again, credit card arrears are down, so we are not seeing any systemic issues there.</p>

I acknowledge that there's lots of regulatory uncertainty but perhaps one thing we do know is that this time next year the guarantee of deposits up to $1 million will be removed by the Federal government.

          <p>Well, I think as far as we are concerned, we think that the strength of the organization, its franchise, means that we don't see that being a negative factor for the commonwealth bank. In fact, before the guarantee was put in place, we had very strong deposit inflows, so they somewhat moderated once the guarantee was put in place. So I don't see us being an organization that would have any negative impact as a result of that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that we do have some exposure to the Asian economies obviously with our Indonesian operations. We operate in Indonesia both in the area of funds management, banking and also life insurance. Those businesses are growing strongly, albeit from a small base. And if I look at the arrangements that we have in place in China, certainly the Citi Commercial banks that we have, cornerstone shareholdings are continuing to perform very strongly.</p>
          <p>And particularly in the case of Hunjo being the number one rated Citi commercial bank in China, and I'd like to think that the work we have done with our Capability Transfer Program into both Hunjo and Chilu has assisted those banks to become much stronger banks, and as a result of the strength that they do have, they both are now able to expand outside their regions of operation, and also have the approval of CBSA to undertake acquisitions.</p>
          <p>In case of Hunjo, we have successfully put our Com-C platform into Hunjo;. And that obviously is operating within the Chinese environment in Mandarin, so we see that we had some significant value to gain from those businesses.</p>
          <p>Our life insurance business up there is growing very strongly, and that's as a result of the arrangements that we have put in place now with a new joint venture partner in that business being BoCom, and the distribution of life insurance product through their 2,500 branch network has significantly increased the flow of business into our life business there. And certainly we have obviously a joint venture, funds management business up there with Chinda. And likewise, I mean, recently announced cornerstone investment in VIB in Vietnam. We obviously have owned operations now in Mumbai, Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo.</p>
          <p>So from the point of view of us being able to support our corporate and business customers in those markets, we have a very strong base that we're putting in place. So all-in-all I think that we've got a pretty good story to tell, and certainly we will continue to look for opportunities for expanding our business operations in the Asian region.</p>

          <p>Yeah, just got a couple of questions on the phone and one online, which we might just run through quickly.</p>
          <p>The online question is from John Vanoosty. How confident is CBA that the issues from Bankwest that has shown up within the East Coast portfolio won't show up within the West Coast line portfolio? What economic outlook changes this assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that the West Coast book of Bankwest, its dynamics are very much more similar to those of the commonwealth bank than the East Coast.</p>
          <p>There was really very much a bifurcation in the loan portfolio of Bankwest between West Coast and East Coast, and certainly we feel quite comfortable in regard to the West Coast. And if we look at moving away from the business portfolio over the year, looking at the mortgage portfolio, the arrears rights in that portfolio are actually less than those for the commonwealth bank. And certainly our view is that over the next 10 to 15 years, we see no reason why Western Australia won't continue to perform strongly, and that's obviously contingent upon the continuing successful &#x2013; the Chinese economy being successful. So, I mean that would be the downside effect, if that was to obviously have significant problems, and obviously that would have a flow through effect but I think that would flow through to the entire Australian economy.</p>

          <p>A question off the phone from Scott Manning at JPMorgan. Scott?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, two questions, one on margins then just one on provisions. Just slide 35, you refer to the 10 basis point decline in margin associated with higher funding costs. I'm just trying to reconcile that with slide 71 where you have the NIM impact over the six month period coming through from the replicating portfolio and balance sheet positioning. So I just want to be clear, to the extent how do they normalize in the second half of this calendar year, the first half of your next financial year? If we have no more change in interest rates, will those conditions normalize, therefore, giving a bit of tailwind to the margin or will they be repeated?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on the provisioning, just in terms of the outlook that expects to be improved going forward, is that relative to the 28 basis points of average gross loans that you've referred to on page 10 of your profit pack, which is inclusive of the seven basis point write-back of the overlay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we haven't written back the overlay, Scott, I know, I saw that in your newsletter. As I said to you before what's happened is there is a credit migration happening as credit quality improves, and as credit quality improves loans migrate up the path. And as they migrate up the path, not only they need less direct collective provision but then the 20% management outlay automatically also feds away. So that's all that's happened on the outlay.</p>
          <p>As far as the management is concerned, the replicating portfolio and indeed the balance sheet positioning are both countercyclical things that are put in place to protect against low interest rate environments. So as when we were in the very low interest environment, and therefore by definition in the low interest rate environment, you tend to be in the middle of a downturn and normal interest income declines because you've got less, less interest rates.</p>
          <p>You have this hedge protection in replicating portfolio to protect against that, and indeed we'd also taken balance sheet position to protect against low interest rates. So as interest rate go up, the value of that hedge declines, and what we're seeing here is that impact. So interest rates go up, less relative impact of replicating portfolio. We're still receiving a benefit at the moment, and we will continue to receive a benefit from the hedge in the replicating portfolio, but the amount of the benefit is less each period. And because it's less, it appears as a negative NIM, but it's not as if it's actually a loss or anything like that. It's just a lesser gain on the hedge that we've got. Does that cover the question on NIM?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and so, if the &#x2013; just thinking of the duration of that replicating portfolio, there will still be some of that to work through then over the second half of this calendar year then I assume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and for some considerable period to come. I mean this is a five-year hedge. So it's a hedge over the &#x2013; other than the &#x2013; it hedges the normal behavior or term of the underlying deposits that it's protecting. And so it's a significant hedge, but of course it depends &#x2013; the amount we make on that hedge depends entirely on what the interest rate is at the time. So the higher the interest rate, the less we make on hedge, but on the other hand, the more we make from the fact that's it's a high interest rate. So it's one trades off against the other.</p>

          <p>One final question from Paul Biddle from Celeste Fund Managers on the phone.</p>

          <p>Bit of a clarification if I could. You mentioned that obviously you're putting on borrowing cost that is at a higher level to what's rolling off. Presumably at the peak of the crisis, you were putting on funding that was significantly higher than where it is now. So I'm just trying to get a bit of an understanding about where you think you reach a normalized point at which the funding cost stops actually hurting the book if we look forward?</p>

          <p>I might ask our Treasurer, Lyn Cobley, to answer that question. Just get a microphone.</p>

          <p>On this funding cost, we can expect to be &#x2013; I mean, difficult for another &#x2013; probably another year as we look at what's happening in the market and the volatility offshore. So I think that in terms of, our book will completely re-price in the next 12 months so the check funding for GFC would have rolled off by that time, and of course then will have largely repriced some of their assets, although I think we've still got more on the asset repricing to go on the institutional book of the business book. So that will catch up over time. Do I answer that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you get any &#x2013; Is there any funding that was put on a significantly higher price as to what you're effectively paying today so that you actually get some, get back in that sense or is that unlikely to occur?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Although, Paul, we've got benefits certainly from not having to fund over the last few months when spreads went between 5 and 80 odd basis points wider than what they were before, but it's still about 5 to 35 basis points wider. So yes, there is some benefit in staying out. But look at &#x2013; at all averages in the way I look at it, you just got to keep being programmatic about it, keep averaging in, and you can't say that the odd deal you've done with such a large issuer in the market has substantially benefited us vis-&#xE0;-vis another deal to be frank.</p>
