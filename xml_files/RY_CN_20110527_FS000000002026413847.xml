          <p>Hello and welcome to the RBC 2011 Second Quarter Results Webcast and Conference Call. As a reminder, all lines will be on listen-only mode and we will conduct a Q&amp;A session at the end of the call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Josie Merenda, VP and Head of Investor Relations, so you may begin. Please go ahead, Josie.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning and thank you everyone for joining us. Presenting to you this morning are Gord Nixon, our CEO; Morten Friis, our Chief Risk Officer; and Janice Fukakusa, our Chief Administrative Officer and CFO.</p>
          <p>Following their comments, we will open the call for questions from analysts. The call will be one hour long and we will post management's remarks on our website shortly after the call. To give everyone a chance to participate, please keep it to one question and then re-queue.</p>
          <p>Joining us for your questions are George Lewis, Head of Wealth Management; Doug McGregor, Chairman and Co-CEO of Capital Markets; Dave McKay, Head of Canadian Banking; Mark Standish, President and Co-CEO of Capital Markets; Jim Westlake, Head of International Banking and Insurance; and Zabeen Hirji, Chief Human Resources Officer.</p>
          <p>As noted on slide two, our comments may contain forward-looking statements, which involve applying assumptions, and have inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these statements.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Nixon.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Josie, and good morning, everybody. This quarter, RBC delivered strong earnings of over $1.5 billion, which were up 13% from last year. On a year-to-date basis, we have earned over $3.3 billion up 18% from the prior year, demonstrating the strength of our businesses and the diversity of our business model.</p>
          <p>This morning, we also announced a $0.04 or 8% increase in our dividend bringing &#x2013; the quarterly dividend to $0.54 a share. We advanced our leadership across businesses and our Canadian Banking, Wealth Management and Insurance businesses had strong revenue growth and earnings growth. The diverse mix of business lines in Capital Markets also enabled us to generate solid earnings notwithstanding the impact that challenging trading conditions had on fixed income trading in latter part of the quarter.</p>
          <p>While our trading results were lower than last quarter, we anticipate a moderate improvement in trading revenue in 2011 compared to 2010 as economic, market and regulatory environments stabilize. We do expect trading revenues to remain in the range of $700 million to $900 million a quarter, similar to past levels that exclude market and credit related items, which are outlined on slide six.</p>
          <p>As mentioned on last quarter's call, we also settled all claims against MBIA and eliminated our credit default swap exposure. We continue to hold the underlying assets in our trading books. These assets are appropriately provisioned and we are selling down these assets as favorable opportunities arise.</p>
          <p>Our investment banking businesses continued to build momentum and delivered strong results, with revenue up 35% from last year. I've talked in the past about our desire to shift our mix in Capital Markets and increase the investment banking component of earnings.</p>
          <p>As you can see from this quarter's results, we continue to execute against this plan and going forward, our investment banking and lending coverage grows in all geographies, the contribution of the lower risk investment banking will be an increasingly bigger component of the overall segment in Capital Markets.</p>
          <p>By delivering strong earnings, we generated internal capital and strengthened our capital position. Our Tier 1 ratio now stands at 13.6% and our TCE ratio at 10.3%. Although, we already meet the 2019 Basel III capital requirements as I highlighted on last quarter's call, our businesses have a number of activities underway to fully optimize capital usage and focus efforts on products and businesses that generate higher risk-adjusted returns.</p>
          <p>We believe it is essential that Canadian banks not only meet these minimum requirements, but their capital plans appropriately provide for the build up of strong capital cushions in order to be fully compliant with requirements by 2013. We are well positioned and quite comfortable with our capital plans, including our ability to continue to invest and grow our businesses.</p>
          <p>Before moving to our business segments, let me spend a moment on a recent topic in the media. There has been a lot of speculation and media coverage lately on RBC Bank. Although I will not comment on speculation, with respect to RBC Bank, we do remain focused on turning around these operations and we are making good progress. I also want to take the opportunity to point out that we have a strong and growing presence in the U.S. through our other businesses, particularly our two largest businesses; Capital Markets and Wealth Management. We remain fully committed to the U.S. market and committed to generating strong returns as we expand our businesses south of the border. We have been building strong relationships, winning key mandates and gaining market share in the United States, and we expect to build on this momentum.</p>
          <p>Moving to the performance of our business segments, I will make a few comments and Janice will take you through a more detailed review of the results.</p>
          <p>Canadian Banking continued to underpin our results generating double-digit earnings growth from last year. We outperformed in the market, driving solid volume growth of 7% by leveraging our strong branch network and our unmatched ability to cross-sell products. We actually expanded our margins in Canadian Banking and had solid operating leverage net of pension expense, which is a reflection of the decrease in the discount rate.</p>
          <p>We continue to access more customers through the build-out of our multi-channel strategy and we are targeting a 25% volume growth premium to the marketplace. Although market trends point to a slowdown in consumer loan growth, we had growth in commercial loans for the second consecutive quarter as companies regain confidence and continue to invest and build out inventories. Growing our commercial loan book is an area of focus as we leverage our industry expertise to win new business and grow market share in this high margin business.</p>
          <p>While we are managing Canadian Banking to outperform in the market, we are also transforming the future of banking. By investing in innovation and expanding on alternative distribution capabilities, we are evolving the banking landscape. For example; we are partnering with Google in a new program designed to encourage website adoption by small businesses across Canada. To be successful, small businesses need to be online and again we are leading the market with this opportunity.</p>
          <p>We also recently introduced a new online Click to Chat feature, which allows clients to interact with customer service representatives real-time around the clock. Our unmatched size and scale gives us enormous potential to generate more volume than peers and drive better efficiencies, enabling us to reinvest in innovative solutions that hopefully will continue to drive top and bottom line growth.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management, we had great momentum across all of our businesses this quarter with earnings up 23% from last year after adjusting for tax and accounting impacts. As a market leader, we capitalized on improving global markets and investor sentiment and grew fee-based client assets through appreciation and net sales, and executed greater volume of client transactions.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter long-term mutual fund net sales were the best on record, enabling us to capture 25% of the total industry in Canada and increase our market share to 14.3%. And for the fifth consecutive year, RBC Dominion Securities ranked number one among bank-owned investment dealers according to Investment Executive's 2011 Brokerage Report Card.</p>
          <p>Our acquisition of BlueBay is progressing better than expected with assets under management in U.S. dollars increasing from $39 billion to $43 billion this quarter. This acquisition expands our distribution capabilities and the reach of our Global Asset Management business into Europe and Asia.</p>
          <p>Our focus remains on building client relationships both in Canada and abroad, growing our global footprint and increasing our product offering to solidify our position as a global leader in wealth and asset management.</p>
          <p>In Insurance, we grew earnings by 36% from last year and remain focused on growing our market share by collaborating with Canadian Banking and Wealth Management to deliver innovative insurance products through cost effective channels. I also want to point out that at the end of the quarter we closed the sale of Liberty Life.</p>
          <p>International Banking's net loss of $23 million was comparable to the net loss in the prior year. While we were profitable in the first quarter, as I mentioned previously, there are a number of factors at play in sustaining profitability in this segment, given the unpredictable nature of timing and levels of PCLs. We continue though to see credit quality improve in our banking businesses and our underlying businesses are showing positive signs of growth.</p>
          <p>In the Caribbean, integration efforts are well underway to streamline operations and enhance the client experience. We are continuing to see momentum in RBC Dexia as client assets appreciate, client transactions increase, and we acquire new businesses. We also had unprecedented success with the recent international survey where institutional investors gave RBC Dexia top marks in the Global Investor 2011 Global Custody Survey.</p>
          <p>Not only did we rank number one in the top three categories, Best Custodian Overall, Best Custodian Overall for EMEA, and Best Custodian Overall &#x2013; Americas, we also received number one rankings in 22 separate categories. These survey results are quite exceptional and reinforce the fact that we provide our clients with exceptional service.</p>
          <p>Capital Markets earned $407 million this quarter with solid contributions from our global markets and corporate and investment banking businesses, attesting again to the diversity of that platform.</p>
          <p>In global markets, challenging trading conditions arising from the events in the Middle East and Japan, continued uncertainty in Europe, impacted our fixed income business, particularly in Europe, in the latter part of the quarter. Although global markets revenue is down from the strong levels of last year, I wanted to point out that factoring in &#x2013; out our gain on assets hedged by MBIA from last year, there was only a modest year-over-year decline.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we saw impressive growth in origination and M&amp;A activity in our corporate and investment banking businesses, which had substantial revenue growth over last year. Over the quarter, although revenue declined, we put more deals on the books with smaller deal sizes than we saw in the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Some of the deals we led or advised on, during the quarter in Canadian, U.S. and UK markets included; joint bookrunners for Rogers Communications C$1.85 billion dual-tranche 10 year and 30 year bonds, the largest ever BBB rated deal in the Canadian market, sole bookrunner for Lloyds Bank's C$500 million, five-year senior Maple bond transaction renewing momentum in the Maple bond market.</p>
          <p>We acted as exclusive financial advisor to Fronteer Gold on its $2.3 billion U.S. acquisition by Newmont Mining, one of the world's leading gold producers. And in the UK market, we were the joint lead manager on a &#xA3;400 million bond transaction for Thames Water Hold; the first lead managed corporate Sterling high-yield transaction for RBC.</p>
          <p>Our underwriting and advisory businesses continue to be recognized for their leading ability to serve clients. We placed 11th in the Bloomberg 20, an annual ranking of top 20 investment banks globally by fees, which was up from 14% last year. This was our highest ranking and we were the highest ranked Canadian bank and our forward calendar continues to remain strong.</p>
          <p>You may have read about the launch of our new equity electronic trading business THOR, a smart order router that is designed to help institutional clients compete with high frequency traders and efficiently fill orders, while also reducing costs for our customers. We remain focused on growing our global client base in Capital Markets by investing in our competitive and diverse product offering to meet changing needs.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we had strong results across our businesses this quarter demonstrating the strength and diversification of our organization. While we did have some quarter-to-quarter volatility, we're happy with our year-to-date operating results and continue to see strength across most of our businesses.</p>
          <p>We are executing our long-standing strategy and our business model continues to serve us well as we expand our leadership position in Canada and build our global platforms. And we will continue to invest in all of our businesses to provide our customers with advice, expertise and the products that they need.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Morten.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gord. Turning to credit on slides nine to 11, both total and specific provisions for credit losses increased slightly over last quarter, as credit quality continued to stabilize and we saw lower recoveries in Capital Markets.</p>
          <p>Over the quarter, the Canadian economy showed signs of strength as the unemployment picture improved modestly. Personal bankruptcy filings increased slightly, but are expected to decline in the near term as improving labor market conditions reduce strain on household finances.</p>
          <p>The impact of these positive signs is apparent. Specific provisions were down $10 million in Canadian Banking from last quarter as provisions declined in our residential mortgage and secured personal lending portfolios.</p>
          <p>Despite these positive signs, we saw credit card specific provisions as a percentage of average net loans and acceptances climb 34 basis points over last quarter to 379, largely reflecting a decrease in outstanding balances, mainly due to seasonal spending patterns. Despite the increase in provisions, this portfolio is performing in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>As the Canadian economy continues to recover and unemployment rates decline, Canadian retail PCL is expected to improve marginally through the second half of the year. Similar to our Canadian portfolios, we continue to see the asset quality stabilizing in the U.S., although the level of impaired loans remains high.</p>
          <p>Specific PCL in International Banking decreased by $13 million over the quarter as our U.S. commercial portfolio had lower provisions. We expect to see improving PCL trends in the U.S. as the labor market improves and personal bankruptcy rate continues to decline and approach long-term averages. However, the timing and level of PCLs are difficult to predict and are highly dependent on the pace of recovery of the U.S. and Caribbean economies.</p>
          <p>Before I move on, as you can see on slide 10, I wanted to point out that the gross impaired loans improved by $683 million to $4 billion. This was largely due to the sale of certain securities classified as loans in RBC Bank USA, which were sold given favorable market conditions.</p>
          <p>I also want to point out that this quarter we have expanded our disclosure on page 19 of the report to shareholders regarding our outstanding loan exposure to certain European sovereigns, and as you can see our exposure is minimal.</p>
          <p>In our wholesale portfolios, which include our corporate accounts and Capital Markets, we saw stabilization of credit quality this quarter. We had no new PCL in Capital Markets, but a net recovery of $5 million comprised of a few accounts. This compared to a recovery of $27 million in the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Now turning to market risk, management VAR was flat year-over-year and down slightly compared to last quarter. During the quarter, we had a total of four days with net trading losses, with no losses exceeding VAR. The largest loss, which totaled $31 million, was primarily due to credit valuation adjustments, largely resulting from movements in credit spread, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the presentation over to Janice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Morten. As outlined on slide 13, we reported second quarter net income of $1.5 billion, up 13% from last year, driven by strong performances in Canadian Banking, Wealth Management and Insurance.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 14, revenue was up 2% compared to last year. However, the mix of revenue has shifted. While trading revenue declined, fee-based revenue increased and represented a larger portion of total revenue this quarter. This rise in fee-based revenue reflects a combination of higher fees generated in our retail businesses and more M&amp;A and origination transactions in Capital Markets. This ability to shift our revenue mix by capitalizing on market and economic movements demonstrates the benefits of our diversified business model.</p>
          <p>Expenses increased 7% over last year with more than half of this increase arising from an increase in pension expenses in our Canadian retail businesses with the remainder relating to business expansion initiatives.</p>
          <p>For example, in Canadian Banking, we've increased our investment in online and mobile technologies, and expanded our branch hours by over 13%. We're also continuing to invest in several initiatives that will make our operations more efficient and more responsive to our clients' evolving needs. And in Capital Markets, we continue to build the required infrastructure, ensuring the proper financial, control and risk management systems are in place to support our growing businesses and to meet the requirements of increased regulation.</p>
          <p>Let me now take you through a detailed performance of our segments. Starting with Canadian Banking, our net income of $851 million was up 16% from last year, as solid volume growth of 7% translated into 6% revenue growth, and the provision for credit losses declined. Compared to the prior quarter, net income was down 4%, largely due to seasonality, including fewer days in the current quarter. Expenses were up 6% from last year and essentially flat from the prior quarter. More than half of this increase relates to higher pension expenses and the impact of the harmonized sales tax.</p>
          <p>I wanted to point out that Canadian Banking not only has the impact of direct pension expenses, it also absorbs proportionately more pension costs associated with the functional groups supporting that business, so the impact of rising pension expenses is larger than one might think.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date, we had negative operating leverage of 1.5%. However, if you exclude the higher pension expenses and the impact of HST, our operating leverage jumps to a positive 3% as revenue growth outpaces expense growth in this business.</p>
          <p>On this same basis, our year-to-date efficiency ratio improved 140 basis points to 45.9%. We continue to target an efficiency ratio in the low 40's over the medium-term and we're making ongoing investments in the business to achieve this.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Wealth Management, net income was $220 million, up $130 million from the prior year and flat from the prior quarter. We had a number of accounting and tax adjustments that impacted net income in the comparative periods. Excluding these adjustments, net income was C$185 million, up C$34 million or 23% from the prior year, primarily due to higher fee-based client assets from capital appreciation and net new fund sales and higher transaction volumes.</p>
          <p>Compared to the prior quarter and factoring out items of note, net income was down C$25 million or 12%, largely due to the impact of fewer days in the quarter, and BlueBay performance fees earned last quarter and lower transaction volumes as uncertain market conditions reduced client activity in the latter part of the quarter.</p>
          <p>In Insurance, net income was $146 million, up $39 million or 36% from last year driven by net investment gains across most businesses, lower auto and life claims costs and business growth. Early sales indicators are very positive on our newly launched life and annuity products and we continue to focus on claims management activities to maximize savings from auto reform. However, due to the nature of this business, it can take a few quarters before this translates into any bottom-line impact.</p>
          <p>International Banking had a net loss of $23 million as compared to $27 million losses in the prior quarter, in the prior year. Lower provision for credit losses as credit quality continued to improve and stronger results in RBC Dexia were partially offset by spread compression in our banking businesses, primarily in the Caribbean.</p>
          <p>Over the sequential quarter, earnings declined by $47 million. Almost half of that decline relates to a favorable reversal of litigation provisions in Caribbean banking in the prior quarter. The remainder of the decline was largely driven by tighter spreads in our Caribbean banking business. We saw growth in RBC Dexia as improving markets led to higher fee-based client assets and increased client activity.</p>
          <p>Turning to Capital Markets, net income was $407 million, down $95 million, or 19%, from a year ago, primarily in fixed income trading. This was largely as a result of the gain related to assets hedged with MBIA of $84 million after-tax and compensation recorded last year. Factoring out the MBIA gain from last year's results, Capital Markets net income was relatively flat year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Fixed income trading was also negatively impacted in the latter part of the quarter by the challenging trading environment, especially in Europe. We had strong corporate and investment banking growth of 35% as issuance activity significantly increased driven by higher originations, M&amp;A and loan syndication.</p>
          <p>Compared to the prior quarter, net income was down $206 million, or 34%, from the record first quarter, due to lower trading activity this quarter and a gain of $49 million related to the settlement of MBIA last quarter in our fixed income business, as well as lower origination and lending activity. Expenses in Capital Markets increased over last year as our businesses expanded in Europe and Asia and we incurred higher infrastructure spend. Compared to last quarter, expenses were down, driven by lower earnings.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&amp;A. Please limit yourself to one question and then re-queue, so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Operator?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from Robert Sedran from CIBC. Go ahead Robert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Gord, if I take your new dividend, the midpoint of your target range would imply about a $1.20 run rate. So, is the takeaway from the move that you believe the sustainable run rate is closer to $1.26 that you reported last quarter and the $1.03 you reported today? Or is the run rate really the wrong way of looking at it given the Capital Markets volatility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, that's a tough question to answer given limitations on expectation. The way I would answer it, Rob, is that if you look at where we are for the first half, we're about in the midpoint of our range. Our earnings at a &#x2013; little over $3.3 billion are pretty much on or slightly ahead of our plans for the year, and when we look at our businesses going forward and our expectations, we feel quite comfortable in terms of where we are with respect to being in the mid-term range, and our &#x2013; certainly, our hope and expectation is that we'll trend down to the lower end of that range as we move forward. So, I think it's a reflection of very strong first half results and a continued expectation that the environment will remain quite positive and the fact that our capital levels continue to be very strong and put us in a position where we have that flexibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, it sounds like the latter then. You kind of look through the quarter-on-quarter volatility and you believe your annual earnings power sustains this dividend basically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, the fact of the matter is if you look at some of that quarter-to-quarter volatility, obviously, Capital Markets accounts for a portion of it. And when we look at our Capital Markets business, I mean it's a bit like last year, although, again some inter-quarter volatility, we're pretty well on expectation in terms of our Capital Markets business for the year. And if the earnings were smooth, perhaps, the market would like it better, but unfortunately in that business we tend to look at it more over a longer-term period, and I would say we're pretty much on expectation &#x2013; on our expectation, not necessarily yours.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Question for David McKay. David, just the &#x2013; your spreads were relatively flat in the quarter, which is different from what we've seen at others. So, maybe you want to talk about what happened in the quarter and your outlook for spreads? And then a broader question, the advertising that I see and hear, at least here in Toronto, is on the radio the HELOCs are &#x2013; come to Royal, because the HELOCs are 50 basis points cheaper. And on the TV it's, switch to Royal, because we'll give you some gift vouchers and other fee rebates. So, it appears that you're competing a lot on price, but I don't know if I'm getting the whole picture and I'd be surprised if Royal was competing on price given the brand value. So, maybe you could talk a bit about the advertising campaign and the strategy around that?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Good questions. And I think the reasons our margins have been stable, I think, is a core focus on our value proposition. As you know, looking at our convenience offering, our &#x2013; particularly our advice offering is very strong. So, we've been very good at managing our business, not succumbing to some of the value-destroying pricing tactics that are in the marketplace right now and growing our volumes at a healthy rate and managing our margins at the same time.</p>
          <p>We've certainly, John, benefited from the strength of our deposit franchise in this area, where we've seen some margin expansion and very, very strong growth, and that's helped offset some of the very aggressive pricing strategies that you're seeing in the marketplace around mortgages, not just HELOCs in the marketplace, but in mortgages in general, as we go through what is traditionally a very competitive spring mortgage season. So, core focus on our value proposition, our advice promise has resulted in margin expansion year-over-year and stable margins quarter-over-quarter. So, I think that is the primary message that we are sticking to our core expansion.</p>
          <p>As far as the tactical initiative that you see in the newspaper, the prime plus a half versus prime plus one for all our other competitors, it's an obvious opportunity for us to capitalize on what we feel is a mispricing in the marketplace that at prime plus a half, we are earning very strong ROEs and &#x2013; very, very strong ROEs, and we're able to capitalize on that mispricing and acquire new customers and offer a very good value proposition. So, value for money is one of our four core pillars of customer need that we compete on, as you know; convenience, advice, service and value for money. And when you see market dislocations like we have in HELOCs and value propositions to customers that can generate high ROEs, it makes perfect business sense to go after that type of market opportunity, particularly when you can earn good returns. So, it is a very successful strategy. You can see we've continued to roll it out across the country, offering great value to customers and good returns to shareholders and we're going to keep doing it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think it's important to note that we have not changed our pricing on HELOCs. This has been the case for the past &#x2013; how long?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. We're not lowering the prices, John, as Gord mentioned, we've been at prime plus a half on new originations for the past two years and we moved it up from prime to prime plus a half on new originations, as you know we did not re-price our existing back book, it's still at prime. So, this is for us kind of margin expansion rather than margin decline and it's very, very healthy business for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if you look at margins going forward, assuming that you continue to have success on the HELOC side, can you sustain these current margins or are competitor pressures going to put downward pressure on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a couple of driving forces of margins going forward. So, systematically, margins are affected by the interest rate environment, as you know. And if we do see rate increases in the latter half of the year, I know the July rate increase is in question now, but certainly that serves particularly with the strength of our deposit business and the huge momentum that we have in core deposits, as you see, that serves as a boost to margins if we get a higher interest rate environment. As you know, the journey there in Prime/BA, compression can be a little challenging, but overall higher interest rates expand margins. That's going to be offset by the environment and the consumer lending side that is very competitive and you're seeing compressing margins there. So all-in, I would say as long as we see some modest movements forward in short-term rates, they should serve to offset compression on the lending side. So, our view has not really changed. We're really seeing kind of a neutral margin environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry, I'll stop after this. Just &#x2013; so, if there is no rate increase though, is there a potential for tighter margins or can you still manage to flat margins without a rate increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a challenging environment. Our goal is to manage towards flat margins, but you may see a slight decline. I mean, I think that's a pretty consistent theme out there. There is some very aggressive pricing on the consumer lending side in the marketplace right now. We've done a good job in growing our business and not following the market down in many areas. But it's a challenging environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, a lot will depend, John, on what happens with respect to the mortgage market, and because that's where you're seeing some pretty unusual activity and is probably having the biggest pressure on margins. So, I think one of the issues is, are people going to back away from cutting profitability in that proportion of their book, because some of the activity we've seen in the mortgage market almost implies very low margins to say the least.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Also on Canadian Banking &#x2013; good morning, by the way. On the Canadian expenses, we've had four straight quarters of negative operating leverage in Canadian Banking. I am not clear on the message around expenses here. Is this something we should expect to see continue in &#x2013; into &#x2013; as we head into 2012? And also one on the Basel III, 7%, is there a way you guys can send us a reconciliation of how you get there? I am having trouble doing that. Is this the &#x2013; really the result of the internal models being approved by OSFI [Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions] that you talked about last quarter that reduce your counter-party credit risk-weighted asset inflation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I take the expense question? Certainly, I think as Janice mentioned, half of our 6% expense increase is due to pensions and HST. So, our &#x2013; the management run rate here, as long as we see a higher rate environment in those pension liabilities and the discount rate comes back to where it was, we should see a lower expense growth rate. So, 3% is our, when you normalize for pension cost, is our growth rate, which is allowing us to invest in the business -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Operating leverage.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Operating, well, 3% expense growth, too, both. So, we've got a 3% expense growth rate with 6% revenue growth. So, we are actually net of one-time pension costs, generating a healthy operating leverage and that is our focus going forward. We're still &#x2013; have to invest in the business, have to expand our channels and we are being able to do that in the 3% to 4% expense growth rate range as you've seen from the last two to three quarters. So, I think there are some underlying factors that you've got to pull out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And before the Basel thing, can you quantify if any of the margin preservation, if you will, benefit of having a lot of your distribution or all your real estate secured distribution being proprietary?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, I think our mortgage specialist sales force allows us to originate very, very strong volumes in a cost-effective manner. There is no doubt we feel that is a competitive advantage, along with solid volumes through our traditional branch channel also, so making the best use of our fixed cost base. So, I think we've have done a lot of work in optimizing the volumes through our fixed cost base and redeploying employees to high-growth areas and driving greater traffic through our network. So, a significant amount of work by the management team in optimizing our cost structure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Hi. Just wanted to &#x2013; we've had the questions on domestic margins. I wanted to drill down on the international front. It was mentioned a couple times, spread compression out of the Caribbean was what led to the bulk of the decline. What was really driving behind that and how much did that contribute to the sequential decline in margins? And also just as an add-on to that, what's been the U.S. experience?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's Jim Westlake, John. In the Caribbean, I &#x2013; it's really a combination of two things. Number one, compression, but volumes are challenged as well. The economics in the Caribbean have not bounced back as much as we would like. And so, we're still seeing pretty soft markets generally there. In the U.S., the spreads have been very flat really through the whole quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that we should start to see things pick up as the year goes on. We're seeing a little more strength in the consumer side right now, which is a good sign. The business in commercial still remains fairly flat.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. In increasing your dividend, you had to make the case to your Board about your sustainable earning power. Would part of that case be sustainable $700 million to $900 million quarterly trading revenue? And more broadly, would it also be that your shift in focus to increased investment banking and lending in Capital Markets should result in much less volatility in Capital Markets overall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, it's &#x2013; I'm not sure if there is a question baked in that, Michael, but I think your assumptions are quite accurate. I mean, we've tried to, as Mark Standish said last quarter, I repeated this quarter, tried to give a line of sight in terms of our current expectation on those trading revenues being $700 million to $900 million. And we have been shifting and growing the other component of the investment banking business, and we continue to see that side of the business, which is less volatile, continue to look quite strong in terms of the forward calendar. And if we do start to see some stabilization in the Eurobond market, because the problem with the Eurobond market is not just very little and challenging secondary trade, there has been very little in the way of new issue as well just because of the uncertainty and so forth. So, certainly, that is something that we would hope to see as the year progresses.</p>
          <p>I might add in terms of the mix this quarter, though, I think when you look at the earnings mix this quarter, we're pretty well on our sort of objective of a 50% banking, 25% wholesale, 25% the balance. I think the numbers are somewhere around 52%, 25% for Capital Markets and 23% for Wealth and Insurance and Banking. And if you normalize our International Banking levels, you get pretty much to that business mix. So, I think that we do think that business mix does provide some degree of stability, particularly if we can reduce some of the volatility in the trading businesses and that has been our objective.</p>
          <p>I don't know, Doug, whether you want to add anything to that in terms of the Investment Banking side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think, Michael, the thesis is that in Canada we've got a good mix, and we have a strong lending book and we have good relationship with issuing clients. And so, you're seeing nice origination. In the U.S., we've been working pretty hard at expanding our lending relationships since the meltdown a couple of years ago and we've put on a number of new names and it's really starting to pay off in terms of origination in the debt capital markets, equity capital markets, high yield. We're leading a number of deals in our revenue in the U.S. and actually we split it out in Janice's presentation. You can see that it's sustaining high levels and the book looks good for this quarter.</p>
          <p>In the UK, we have &#x2013; we do not have the kind of corporate relationships that we have in the U.S and Canada, and we are building our investment bank and our loan book to build those, so that we'll have a better distribution in terms of origination between sovereigns, where we're focused now, and sovereigns and corporates going forward. So we continue to add &#x2013; we continue to build out the client relationships and it smoothes out the revenue through the cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And if I could ask one more, slide 13 of your presentation clearly makes the point that two businesses dominate your earnings, Canadian Banking and Capital Markets. Canadian Banking, which now seems to be under increased competitive pressure and with some slower growth, and Capital Markets, which we know can be volatile. Do you feel that this mix provides adequate other sources of growth to add to what may be slower growth from Canadian Banking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, Michael, I would highlight that when you actually put Wealth and Insurance and combine them, they're roughly the same size if you look at that chart as the Capital Markets side. And if you look at the International Banking side, that's where to some degree at some point you have to normalize International Banking earnings.</p>
          <p>So if you, that has obviously been a challenged area over the last number of years, but if you assume that you'd start to get a turnaround in that, then you get pretty well to the business mix that we've been targeting, as I said in my comments, which is somewhere around 50-25-25 and we take a slightly different perspective in terms of the growth dynamics.</p>
          <p>We continue to see that there is good opportunities for investment in growth in all of those businesses, and that includes our Canadian banking business where we continue to think there will be opportunities notwithstanding the fact that there may be some short-term pressure on existing margins and so forth. We still think there is opportunities for growth.</p>
          <p>So when you look across that balance of businesses, I say we tend to look at it in a bucket of roughly 50-25-25 and we think there is good opportunity for capital investment in those businesses. And I think one of our objectives is to make sure that we do a good job in terms of decision making around deploying capital in those areas where we can generate not only higher growth but also reasonably good returns as well.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Gord, in your opening comments, you or maybe perhaps it was even Janice, you were talking about having a pro forma Basel III ratio of 7% plus and that it was important to build a cushion. In that context, could you provide an update? What are you hearing on the systemically important financial institution rules? We understand that we're going to hear something in July. Is there anything you can offer us now on SEFI? And if you could sort of tie that into the dividend increase, does it make sense to raise a dividend the way you did in the context of the uncertainty associated with SEFI?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean I've addressed the dividend firstly upfront. I mean our earnings growth at roughly 18%, our dividend increase at 8%, we're very comfortable. It's not going to have a material impact one way or the other, given the capital that we're generating internally. So we're quite comfortable on that front. Particularly, as I say, when we look at our sort of forecast going forward and our current capital levels, we feel quite comfortable.</p>
          <p>With respect to the SEFIs, I mean, again, this is all sort of &#x2013; I shouldn't say hearsay, obviously we have a lot of discussions with regulators, but I think it's still a bit of a moving target. But the expectation is sometime in the early part of the summer, there will be some form of release in terms of SEFI expectations or criteria. And what we're hearing is those criteria will basically put potential SEFI candidates in buckets with the very highly systemic institutions being in a much higher bucket than the lesser systemic institutions depending on whatever those criteria are, which I suspect are going to be things like size of balance sheet, complexity of businesses, et cetera.</p>
          <p>In terms of the impact on the Canadian banks, again it's hard to say. Basically what our expectation is and what we have heard is that none of the Canadian banks will be global SEFIs. The expectation is we will all be national SEFIs and I'm not sure what that means in terms of buffers, but I think what you can expect generally from the marketplace is whatever the minimum requirements are, banks are going to have to have some kind of buffer to make sure they're above the minimum so that they don't slip below the minimums and put themselves in a position where they're to some degree offside with those limits.</p>
          <p>So our expectation is that the Canadian banks will all be in the same category, likely national SEFIs. Be very surprised if we were global SEFIs based on what we've been told, although again they haven't released the criterion and nothing is certain until it's finalized, but that's our current understanding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is it still your view that Royal Bank would not be treated any differently from any other Canadian banks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've been told by basically our regulators, et cetera, that the Canadian banks will likely all be the same in terms of their requirements. Now, again, there are domestic and then there are international discussions and negotiations. So things can certain change but that would be our expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my final related question would be, if there were a buffer of, say, 200 basis points, would &#x2013; do you think the Canadian banks would still feel it necessary to get there much earlier than our global peers, say, by the end of 2012 or 2013? Or would the buffer essentially extend the timeline somewhat? Like still wanted to get to 7% in the previously stated timeline but the buffer would be something you would extend a little further, so how does your thinking work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our expectation would be the buffer would be something that would be extended further. The benchmark for the Canadian banks of meeting the 2019 requirements by 2013 I suspect would be viewed as sufficient. Although you're asking that really the question should be asked to regulators not to ourselves, because ultimately that will be the determinant. But my expectation is, is if there was an incremental buffer that there would be certainly a timeline ultimately to grow into whatever that would be.</p>
          <p>But I would be very hesitant to put a number like 200 basis points because, as I say, based on what we hear, I suspect it will be some form of sort of graduated buffer so that not all SEFIs, whether they're global or national SEFIs, will have the same buffer. So I'd be very hesitant to just put a number on it because I think it will be much more graduated.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. A question on the U.S. bank. About a year ago, we were talking about a couple of years' turnaround and right-size the business. So I guess, first, are we still looking at that same timeline, meaning are we about halfway through, or is it going to be a longer tailed turnaround story? And secondly, if we can maybe get some color on some of the initiatives that have been completed to-date and what's still to come, and how to think of that in relation to the cost base and efficiency ratio over a longer term?</p>

          <p>Yes, I sure am, Gord. Yes, thanks, Cheryl. We are involved in a very large number of projects that we are doing to affect RBC Bank. A number of them that we have done is very much right-sizing a lot of the staffing. We have settled on a common operating model. You'll recall that we had a large number of banks that have been accumulated over the years and had not been on that system. We have done that. We've done a lot of product changes, enhancements in order to get a portfolio that we think is proper. We've redone our commercial business and gone through and made it much clearer what is handling the branch versus commercial offices.</p>
          <p>So on and on a lot of those types of things that are not real noticeable necessarily from the outside but require a lot of work. We are on track with the timelines that we had originally intended and continue to make progress. And the &#x2013; while the numbers have not come in line with that yet, they are largely still driven by both PCL and by losses on the investment portfolio, as opposed to ongoing operations. If you normalize out of that from a revenue and a cost standpoint, we continue to make progress, while modest though, on the efficiency ratio.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A couple of, I think, relatively quick questions, first to Dave McKay. You talked earlier about value destroying strategies. If I look on slide 15 of the deck this morning, loan growth in commercial looks a little light, I think, versus what we've seen from peers at I believe it was 3%. So are you losing share a little here and happy to do so because of tighter margins and increased competition, or is there something else going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Steve. Great question, I think we had a similar question in Q1. I think the answer is a bit of both. We're not happy with our 3% growth in commercial loans for a couple of reasons. One, I think that we have passed on some deals that we thought weren't economically feasible. So there is a pricing element to it where we passed on some market share. Having said that, we've got to continue to build this pipeline and get this back up to at least market if not the 25% that we've targeted in volume in excess of the market average.</p>
          <p>So I think when we look at our pipeline, it's very strong. When we pulled back in a couple of sectors two years ago, our volume &#x2013; our pipelines diminished and it takes a while to build that up. So you're seeing a bit of a lag in rebuilding our pipelines having pulled back in a couple of sectors, so that's part of the answer is getting back to market level and exceeding market level volumes. And part of it is there is some competitive dynamics that make certain business deals unattractive and you've got to maintain a discipline. So all said, we're being selective but we want to see better performance there and we're not happy at 3%.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what were those couple of sectors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't really disclose that. Particularly, I would say during that the downturn in real estate lending, commercial real estate, we paused and that is a long-term pipeline to build as by the time you get construction draws and whatnot, it's not a business that you can immediately turnaround from an outstanding balance perspective. But we have a very strong pipeline and we should see that business start to grow. And that's where the majority of the activity in commercial financing seems to be in the marketplace right now. So we're &#x2013; we felt the pain of pulling back a couple of years ago, but we're being quite aggressive in that marketplace and the pipeline is strong.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And one more quick one, if I could, probably for Doug or maybe Mark, just want to make sure I understand on the trading side, you mentioned trading was particularly weak at the tail end of the quarter and again particularly in Europe. I hear the client activity was a little light, but was there &#x2013; was that the case strictly in Europe or was there anything unusual in terms of trading losses going on there towards the end of the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No &#x2013; it's Mark Standish. There was nothing unusual there. I mean, DCM activity globally was certainly softer in Q2 than it was in Q1 and that drives a lot of the sales and trading activity. In Europe, unlike in Canada and the U.S., there is less connection to a broader corporate relationship, as Doug said, it's more of a sovereign business. So in Europe we basically had to be more active in supporting the new issue activity that we were able to bring.</p>
          <p>So net-net, it was a disappointing and soft quarter, while we did keep DCM activity reasonably stable with the prior quarter, it's a marketplace right now that's obviously dealing with a lot of uncertainties and we're keeping our business fairly close to home. And as Gord said, it's something that later on in the year we expect to see a turnaround in.</p>

          <p>Operator, we have time for just one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. That question will be from Sumit Malhotra from Macquarie Capital Markets. Go ahead, Sumit.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Probably for Gord or maybe George Lewis, a two-parter on the acquisition front. I wanted to get a little bit more color on how you're feeling about the built out of your Global Asset Management business and what opportunities you're seeing there? And related to that, I notice your partners at Dexia took a large charge this morning not really saying that that means anything here expect to ask your view on that business, which I know has struggled with the interest rate environment over a period of time and whether longer term, that's an asset that you would &#x2013; that would fit the acquisition criteria you now are seem to be working with in terms of Wealth Management and lower capital intensive businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks very much, Sumit. I'll take that. In terms of our asset management business, we're very pleased with the performance of that business. It's &#x2013; recall the third year of our anniversary of the Phillips, Hager &amp; North acquisition, and so that has turned out extremely well, resulting in our industry-leading sales in Canada in terms of our mutual fund business. We've just recently completed the acquisition of BlueBay Asset Management and from an operating perspective, we're &#x2013; early days but again, we're very pleased with the growth of that business. Its assets are up 7% in U.S. dollars since we acquired the business, strong net sales.</p>
          <p>Our real focus is on leveraging that acquisition in the near term. It brings us more distribution in Europe and Asia; it brings us a global fixed-income capability to complement our existing asset management business. So we see strong organic growth opportunities in our global asset management business as part of our RBC Wealth Management business.</p>
          <p>We are always looking opportunistically for opportunities to build our global asset management business by way of acquisition. It is a very high margin business for us within the RBC Wealth Management segment, so as opportunities come along, we will definitely take a look.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On RBC Dexia, you're right, there was an announcement this morning in terms of a write-down of some of their U.S. assets. We obviously can't and would not comment on it and really have not seen anything other than the press release. In terms of its impact on RBC Dexia, I mean, I think strategically it continues to be a business that we like very much. It's a business where I think there will continue to be opportunities.</p>
          <p>Going forward, I think the uncertainty over RBC Dexia has been around for a while in terms of what their longer-term desires intentions are and we continue to monitor that and we think there will be lots of opportunities and flexibility as we move forward. I don't think this morning's announcement has any impact on that, though.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I wanted to make sure. This is still a business and obviously your &#x2013; I think it's safe to say you're considering all your options and your operations outside of Canada, and this is still a business that you are positively disposed to, that's fair to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I wrap up, very quickly just for Mark or Gord, on that comment you gave to Steve about the softer trading conditions at the end of the quarter in Europe, is it fair to say that that has continued thus far in Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think in Europe &#x2013; the trading conditions are still difficult. I'd add to Mark's remarks that it's also quite competitive over there. I mean there's lot of banks involved in primary dealerships and otherwise. I would say that also on Gord's remarks, the origination in the U.S. and Canada has been quite good. And the book on the M&amp;A side and the new issue side is quite strong. I don't know, Stan, if you have anything else.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that everyone is aware of the issues that are specific to Europe right now. On the positive side, we are seeing a much broader business in Canada and the U.S., which we're enjoying. I should also note that we focused on the FICC business. While certainly the sales and trading results coming out of foreign exchange and equity are down a little bit, we're certainly seeing very good client activity there and very good flow there. So that's not just a Canadian or U.S. activity. We're also growing that business in Europe and that's actually going quite well.</p>
