        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the presentation of our half year results for the six months ended June 30, 2008. I'd also like to welcome those attending the presentation via the webcast and some by telephone.</p>
          <p>With me this morning are the members of Executive Committee, who are familiar to most of you.  At the front of the room here is, in order, Chief Financial Officer, Trevor Reid; Santiago Zaldumbide the Executive Director and Chief Executive of Xstrata Zinc; Peet Nienaber the Chief Executive of Alloys business; Peter Freyberg, Chief Executive of Xstrata Coal; Charlie Sartain, the Chief Executive of Xstrata Copper and Ian Pearce, the Chief Executive of Xstrata Nickel. And we have three other members of Executive Committee, Benny Levene our Chief Legal Counsel and Thras Moraitis, who you all know well, and Levi Haas as well, but they are in the audience taking notes and reactions.  Ladies and gentlemen, that was a joke.</p>
          <p>You would have noticed this morning that we announced our proposed $10 billion cash offer for London. And I'm certain that you're very keen to hear more about it. However, we are primarily here to announce Xstrata's interim results. They've indulged me. We're going to cover those first. Trevor will then highlight the financial performance of the Group over the period, and then the final part of this morning's presentation we will come back and talk about the proposed offer for London.</p>
          <p>Xstrata's operations delivered a solid performance in a really highly challenging operating environment for the first half of this year, recording underlying earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization.  There was EBITDA of $5.7 billion, which was in line with the prior period. Now while the overall group EBIT was 4% lower than the first half of 2007 due to a number of one-off items in that year, it is pleasing to note that at the operational level, EBIT from Xstrata's operations improved by 5% year-on-year excluding the one-off impact of the sale of nickel inventory to Glencore in April 2007 and non-operational expenses.</p>
          <p>Our earnings per share on a pre-exceptional basis rose 2% to $2.95 per share. And these results were delivered despite a 39% and 36% for nickel and zinc prices respectively, and a number of challenges beyond the control of our operating teams.</p>
          <p>First half production records were achieved in ferrochrome, in platinum, semi-soft and coking coal, zinc in concentrate and lead in concentrate. And you'll notice from our production report issued I think last week, is following adverse weather and operation issues earlier in the year. The volumes improved remarkably across the portfolio in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Now this momentum has continued to build into the third quarter due to higher nickel and copper grades we are experiencing, the ramp up or the commencement of new and expanded production capacity and key commodities and the resolution of some one-off operational issues which took place in the first quarter of the year. Consequently, the second half production is expected to be significantly stronger than the first half, and this has become what I think is a theme for Xstrata, stronger production in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Cost control remains a key strength and differentiator for Xstrata. And I'm delighted that within this highly inflationary environment, we've been able to achieve real unit cost savings. This is despite unprecedented cost pressures, in particular in respect of energy and other oil-relinked costs.</p>
          <p>Xstrata's commodity businesses achieved real unit cost savings of $166 million in the first six months of the year. The consumer price index inflation and mining sector inflation calculated</p>
          <p>using external mining sector indices for the regions in which we operate, increased costs across the board by 5% in relation to CPI and  8% in relation to the mining inflation respectively, or 13% in total compared to the first half of 2007.</p>
          <p>In the face of these considerable headwinds and as a result of those unit cost savings which I've just referred to, our commodity businesses mitigated the full impact of the mining sector and CPI inflation, and contained our cost increases to 9% in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Now against a background of rising industry input costs and parts supply of key equipment and consumables, our devolved businesses adopt a reflexible entrepreneurial price to procurement and they work together with other group businesses to secure economies of scales on negotiating leverage where that makes sense, such as the cooperation between the Australian businesses to obtain economies of scale in negotiating procurement contacts with Tile and other key equipment manufacturers.</p>
          <p>In other instances our commodity business teams have sourced second-hand equipment, such as the low cost expansion in Mount Isa zinc-lead concentrator, or supplemented construction contractors with permanent employees to ensure that deadlines are met within budget as in the construction of the Lion ferrochrome smelting complex they commissioned last year. These initiatives together with our focus on improving volumes and productivity of our fixed cost base, and on bringing on-stream low cost capacity have ensured that real cost savings are achieved year-on-year without any decentralized drive to hold back investment or cut resources at the operational level.</p>
          <p>I am confident that our businesses will continue to deliver real unit cost savings in the second half, as a result of improved productivity, higher volumes and the commencements of new lower cost production at the Perseverance zinc-lead operation, the expansion at Mount Isa zinc-lead concentrator, the expansion at Collahuasi, Lomas Bayas and Altonorte copper operations and a number of brown and greenfield coal expansions just too numerous to mention. But I'm sure if you ask Peter later, he'd be happy to give you a long list.</p>
          <p>Growth has been at the heart of our strategy, because it delivers superior returns and is built on three key pillars as you know. The first are ongoing delivery of significant value from existing and new operations through NPV-driven expansions, cost efficiencies and mine life extensions.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we will continue the opportunistic pursuit of potential value-adding transactions in the industry that continues to consolidate whether at the company transforming or business unit level. And in late 2007, you'll know that Vale, Brazilian mining company approached Xstrata to initiate discussions on the potential combination of the companies. Whilst both Vale and ourselves believe that a combination of the two companies could realize significant value for both sets of shareholders, discussions were terminated in late March by mutual consent following quite long and protracted negotiations, which unfortunately did not lead to an offer being tabled before the Xstrata Board.</p>
          <p>While I continue to believe strongly that Xstrata offers shareholders enormous potential for further value creation as a standalone entity, our engagement in these discussions clearly demonstrates our willingness to explore dispassionately any proposal that can deliver superior value for our owners. That is our job as managers and that is the job we will continue to do.</p>
          <p>The third pillar of our growth strategy is the delivery of our organic growth pipeline, representing a capital expenditure over $37 billion over the next eight years. The successful realization of this portfolio, will deliver double-digit compound annual growth over the next five years. Despite industry-wide constraints in the delivery of projects, we have already achieved significant advances in delivery of these projects.</p>
          <p>The ramp up of the Elandsfontein PGM mine and concentrator to reach steady state production ahead of schedule in June, marks a single achievement and demonstrates the operational capability of the Alloys team in rapidly developing our nascent platinum business. Key equipment has been ordered for the second phase expansion to increase capacity to 600,000 ounces per annum of PGM production by 2013.</p>
          <p>A further landmark in the development of Xstrata's platinum business has been reached today with the agreement to acquire an option over 50% interest in the five platinum properties on the Eastern Limb of the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa owned by Nkwe and Genorah. This option agreement provides Xstrata with a meaningful foothold in the prospective Eastern Limb region and access to one of the few remaining continuous PGM blocks in the region, with the potential for significant growth in mined production and the development of a downstream processing operation.</p>
          <p>So these impressive developments have been achieved well within one year of the acquisition of Eland Platinum, which formed the cornerstone and base of our new PGM business. Together with the Mototolo joint venture and additional exploration in the region, Xstrata Alloys is targeting annual production of one million ounces of platinum production over the next decade from organic growth alone. Now naturally, our intensions with the offer for Lonmin is to accelerate Xstrata to become a leading PGM producer, a bit more of that later.</p>
          <p>In our chrome business the ramp up of the energy efficient Lion ferrochrome smelting complex, and the Bokamoso pelletising plant boosted production volumes and have rebased Xstrata's ferrochrome unit costs at a lower level. Critically, these developments also significantly improve energy efficiency by over 30% compared to industry peers and provide Xstrata with a key competitive advantage in an environment of constrained and expensive electricity supply.</p>
          <p>The Boshoek opencast reserves have been successfully developed and commissioning of the Waterval Mine commenced during the first half, to provide supply to our ferrochrome smelting business. Nonetheless, our growth in ferrochrome production will be tempered by restrictions to South African power supply and uncertainty over additional mid-term generation capacity.</p>
          <p>An extensive suite of brown and greenfield growth projects has long been the key characteristics of our coal business and will deliver compound annual growth in coal production of 11% over the next five years. Several milestones in the delivery of these projects were achieved during the first half of this year.  These include the upgrade to the Mount Owen coal handling and preparation plant, and the construction of the new Liddell coal handling and preparation plant.</p>
          <p>In South Africa the new Southstock five-seam underground mine, which enters the underground from the opened cut pit high wall, commenced in the first quarter of 2008. Five other projects are on track for commissioning or ramp up later this year, including expansion of the mining operations in Liddell, and the new Glendell thermal coal pit which will ramp up to full production late in the year.</p>
          <p>In Columbia, the Cerrej&#xF3;n coal asset, which as you know is entirely world-class, is set to reach an annual production of 32 million tons per annum by the end of 2008 and studies into further expansion to 40 million tons will be completed we think during the third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Back in Australia, the second stage of Wollombi's development is on track to commission within budget in late 2008, opening up the main shovel pit and increasing production from this operation to 1.5 million tons per annum. The new Blakefield South longwall is on track to start up in the first half of 2010 to replace production from the Beltana longwall operation.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, our 12 million tons per annum Goedgevonden project is due to be in production in the second quarter of 2009, a great suite of projects, which are going to deliver a great amount of value.</p>
          <p>On to copper, now significant milestones were reached in the development of copper substantial portfolio of major organic growth projects in the first half. The strategic alliance, which we referred to in previous announcements, which we entered into with Bechtel in December and further long-term alliances signed with FLSmidth and Siemens for our technical support and the procurement of major components secure highly sought after technical skills and equipment to ensure the timely and sequential development of our major growth copper projects.</p>
          <p>The development of a standard concentrator design is an important element of these alliances and will enable the early ordering of long lead-time items; it'll reduce engineering time and costs and facilitate the rapid construction of high quality infrastructure. Design work has already been completed for primary crushing, grinding and flotation circuits and in the first half, orders were placed for the first two primary crushing and grinding lines.</p>
          <p>The announcement in early 2008 of over 1.6 billion tons of copper resources at Xstrata Copper's newly established southern Peru division, which comprising the Tintaya operation, the Antapaccay, and the Coroccohuayco and Las Bambas projects, herald the development of a new major copper-producing region. And in partnership with Bechtel, parallel feasibility studies have been formerly initiated on the Antapaccay deposit situated 10 kilometers from the existing to Tintaya operation and its infrastructure and as well as the Las Bamas project, which is approximately 130 kilometers from Tintaya.</p>
          <p>Completion of these studies is expected in mid 2009, in the view to confirming the potential of this region to progressively increase production to an excess of half a million tons per annum over the next five years. And that's very exciting.</p>
          <p>In Chile, the feasibility study to the El Morro project has been completed and a decision on the submission of the social and environmental impact assessment is expected during the second half as a prelude to the final development decision.</p>
          <p>The extended pre-feasibility study at the significant Tampakan project in the Philippines initiated following Xstrata's take over of the management control is progressing well and is scheduled to be completed by the end of this year. Tampakan is located in a challenging region for mining investment, there's no doubt about that.</p>
          <p>The difficulties experienced by the industry as a whole in realizing large infrastructure projects at a time of rising costs and key equipment and skills and constraints and also a potential increase in the scope of the project, which I think is equally exciting, have extended the timeframe for Tampakan.  The commissioning I expected in 2013 ramping up to full production in 2014.</p>
          <p>In the next six months, the expansion of our Lomas Bayas mine and the delivery of intermediate debotttlenecking &#x2013; the intermediate bottlenecking project at Collahuasi will add further immediate production growth and improve unit costs at these operations. At Collahuasi and a capacity expansion to 650,000 million annual tons of copper is on track to commission in 2010 and conceptual studies are being advanced to increase capacity to one million tons per annum from 2014.</p>
          <p>So in total these power plant and growth projects will be the principle driver in enabling Xstrata profit to achieve its growth objective of doubling mined copper production to some two million ton within the next five years.</p>
          <p>Xstrata Nickel and its partner SMSP awarded a number of major construction projects during the first half to progress the flagship of 60,000 ton per annum Koniambo nickel project, which will commence production to be recorded in 2011.</p>
          <p>Large-scale development work has now commenced including the bridging, mass earthworks, manufacturing and all the major technology packages which include the metallurgical plant and power station and the modular construction program project commitments now exceed $1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving to Canada, ore-treated and Raglan during the first half to reached targeted first phase expansion rate of 1.3 million tons per annum. The further expansion to 1.5 million tons by 2011 is well supported by the high grade Zone five to eight, which is the largest mineralized area identified in Raglan's history.</p>
          <p>In Sudbury, the low cash cost Nickel Rim South mine, which benefits from significant copper, cobalt and precious metals by products and the Fraser Morgan mine are on track the commence commissioning in the late 2008 ramping up to full production next year. Approval has been granted also for the expansion of the Strathcona mill to accommodate the increased feed from Nickel Rim South and other production in the region.</p>
          <p>Following the acquisition of Jubilee mines in February, which marked Xstrata's entry into nickel into Western Australia, significant attention has been devoted to reconfiguring the mine plans, converting resources to reserves and investing in development work to sustain future growth in these assets. Production is expected to reach 30,000 tons of nickel by 2012. One of the largest programs, exploration programs in Australia is now underway to further realize potential from the prospective land position acquired from Jubilee. The Sinclair nickel project is on schedule to start production in 2008 in September and will boost volumes from Xstrata Nickel Australia from the final quarter, and nickel and zinc.</p>
          <p>Since 2002, the Xstrata Zinc portfolio has been transformed from a single smelter operation in Spain into integrated business, which is effectively self-sufficient in zinc concentrate production and manages smelting capacity in excess of one million tons per annum. This transformation has been achieved through the judicious use of capital to invest in productivity improvements, incremental expansions both at existing operations and those acquired through the MIM and Falconbridge transactions.</p>
          <p>The second stage of the cost effective and low risk Mount Isa, a zinc-lead concentrator expansion is on schedule to commission with an annual capacity of eight million tons in late 2008, more than doubling annual capacity at a total capital cost of only $160 million. The expanded concentrator will be fully utilized with the increased feed from the Handlebar Hill and Black Star operations.</p>
          <p>And at McArthur River, the open pit expansion is well advanced, with over one million tons of ore produced in the first half and development works on track to be fully completed in the final quarter of 2008. The concentrator expansion to 2.5 million tons for a capital cost of less than $40 million is also on track to commission in the second half of the year. And the zinc team continues to investigate the construction of an Albion atmospheric pressure leaching plant to enable us to process McArthur River's concentrate at an even greater level.</p>
          <p>Further near-term growth will be achieved in the second half from the new Perseverance mine in Canada, which commissioned ahead of schedule in July.</p>
          <p>As anticipated in my preliminary report in March, slowing economic growth in the Western world, in particular the US, has had a moderate impact on Chinese economic growth, trimming back the annualized GDP growth to a very respectable 10% in the first half, primarily due to the slowing of exports from China to western economies and tightening fiscal and monetary policy by Chinese authorities.</p>
          <p>The Olympic Games and further weakness from the export sector are expected to have a temporary impact on economic growth in the third quarter, due to enforced slowdowns or suspensions of manufacturing and heavy industry surrounding Beijing. However, demand for commodities will continue to be supported by burgeoning domestic consumption, the earthquake reconstruction program in the Sichuan province and the infrastructure construction to support urbanization and industrialization.</p>
          <p>These factors, coupled with the Chinese government's apparent readiness to take a real pragmatic approach to monetary and fiscal policy in order to promote growth and employment and continue urbanization, lead me to expect demand for metals and energy commodities to remain strong for the next few years, albeit at a moderately slower rate of demand growth until the global economy recovers at the end of 2009 and early 2010 stronger for longer is still the name of the game.</p>
          <p>So the resilience of commodity demand has been particularly evident in negotiations around some of our key bulk contracts during the first half. Term thermal coal contracts to Pacific customers have settled at prices of up to $125 per ton, with a contract year ending the period &#x2013; with a contract year period commencing April 2008, 125% higher than the previous year. Contracts for Xstrata's premium quality hard coking coal have recently settled with the majority of term customers at an average of $362 per ton, $362 per ton not $300 per ton, 277% higher than prior year settlements.</p>
          <p>Semi-soft coal prices have also benefited in the exceptionally tight coking coal market, breaking the traditional nexus between semi-soft and coking coal and thermal coal prices. Xstrata's semi-soft coal price has now recently settled at an average price of $258 per ton, including the benefit of some of the cancellation of carry-over tons at the prior year's prices.</p>
          <p>So the full benefit of these settlements will now be seen in the second half of 2008, and into 2009, delivering significant earnings growth and margin expansion. So to put this into a little bit of context, second half earnings from the coal business are expected to represent around double Xstrata Coal's first half EBIT.</p>
          <p>We expect these conditions to continue and this together with our full exposure to stronger prices will go well for substantially higher earnings from the coal business in 2009, over the whole of 2008.</p>
          <p>Ferrochrome prices have also continued to rise, with third quarter prices settling at a record $2.05 per pound. And the fundamentals for copper prices remain robust on continued concentrate shortfalls.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, while nickel and zinc prices have fallen sharply, current industry prices are now at or below marginal cost of production &#x2013; average marginal cost of production for the industry.</p>
          <p>These factors, coupled with improved volumes and lower cost of production from a number of new coal, copper, nickel, zinc operations will ensure the group is well positioned to enjoy margin expansion and improved profitability from the second half &#x2013; for the second half of 2008 and into 2009.</p>
          <p>So I'm now going to hand over to Trevor, who's going to deal with the financial results in more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mick, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As you have come to expect by now comprehensive detail on our financial and operating performance is set out in the interim report published this morning. And given that I'm sure that you're all waiting to hear more about our other announcement, I'm going to limit my presentation today to the highlights of the last six months' financial performance.</p>
          <p>At last year's results, the first in which I reported on a full year post-Falconbridge, I highlighted the benefits of the diversified mining model as the significant contributions from Falconbridge's nickel and zinc businesses, supplemented by strong copper profits, more than made up for a generally weak performance from the coal business.</p>
          <p>The results for this first half have again reaffirmed the benefit of earnings diversification across commodities and geographies. And this time it is the coal and alloys businesses, together with another good result from copper that have more than compensated for markedly lower zinc and nickel prices, and have underpinned the 13% increase in revenues to $16.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Off the back of another excellent cost containment performance across our businesses, and despite significant inflationary pressures, earnings before interest and tax from operations rose 5% after adjusting for the one-off benefit in 2007 from the sale of our nickel inventory in terms of the Glencore marketing agreement.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate for the period fell from 31% to 27%, mainly due to a decrease in nickel earnings which are generally earned in higher tax jurisdictions. The main exceptional item relates to the closure costs associated with the high cost Lennard Shelf zinc-lead operation, which has been rendered uneconomic due to lower zinc prices and poor grades.</p>
          <p>Minority interests are higher due to an increase in earnings on the back of higher copper prices at Alumbrera, where we are a 50% shareholder. And finally attributable profit, before exceptionals and discontinued operations, increased 2% to over $2.8 billion. Earnings before interest tax and depreciation, or EBITDA, was $5.7 billion for the half in line with last year's result. The alloys business unit benefited from higher prices across all its commodities, a 3% increase in ferrochrome production on the commissioning of the Lion project and higher PGM volumes flowing from the ramp up of the Elandsfontein and Mototolo operations.</p>
          <p>Given the headwind of energy constraints experienced in South Africa, this is a performance of which Peet and his team can feel justifiably proud and it reflects the benefits of the strategic decisions taken some years ago to invest in energy efficient technologies and expansions. The improved performance of the coal business unit reflect higher realized prices, increased production and sales volumes together with lower demurrage costs, which were offset in part by energy and rail constraints we experienced in South Africa.</p>
          <p>The fundamentals for thermal, semi-soft and coking coal continue to be extremely robust due to supply constraints and high demand, particularly from Asia. And having concluded almost all our contract negotiations, at the record pricing Mick referred to, we can expect a significant acceleration in earnings in the second half and well into 2009.</p>
          <p>Our copper business unit delivered another strong performance, with received prices up 20% period-on-period, resulting in a 15% increase in EBITDA. Production volumes were down as a number of operations mined through lower grades, but, as we experienced last year, we expect volumes to increase in the second half of this year, both as a result of improvements in grade and the early benefits of a number of organic growth projects.</p>
          <p>The nickel business unit enjoyed record prices in 2007 following the acquisition of the Falconbridge Group. Prices this year have moderated considerably from their peak, and the average received price was 39% down on last year. This price fall comes at a time when the nickel business is in a state of transformation, as some of the ageing Sudbury mining operations are nearing end of life, and we await the commissioning of the low-cost nickel room and Fraser Morgan operations over the coming year.</p>
          <p>In Australia the Jubilee mines are also being transformed. And as we expected, operational performance has been hampered by a mine plan that is currently mining through a low grade transitional ore body, between the old Cosmos mine and the new Prospero ore body. The completion of the transformation of these businesses, together with a number of other growth and efficiency programs, will see Xstrata nickel emerge as a far more robust player over the next period.</p>
          <p>In addition to significantly lower prices, a weaker US dollar adversely impacted the earnings of the zinc business unit, partly offset by production capacity improvements in Australia, and significant cost reduction benefits flowing from Xstrata's zinc continued focus on improving productivity and efficiency at all its operations.</p>
          <p>Now after adjusting for the impact of the Glencore marketing agreement in the first half of 2007, operating earnings for that period were circa $4.6 billion. Operating earnings in this period rose 5%, or $200, million to $4.8 billion. The increase in coal, copper and ferrochrome prices added $2.2 billion to earnings, while falling zinc and nickel prices reduced this benefit by some $1 billion.</p>
          <p>The continued strength of the mining industry across the globe, which competes with the infrastructure, construction and energy industries for raw materials, skills and consumables, has resulted in exceptional cost pressures, which in Xstrata's case trimmed profits by more than $500 million.</p>
          <p>It is noteworthy, however, that once more our commodity business units have delivered an outstanding cost containment performance, with operational efficiencies and improved productivity contributing a real cost saving of $166 million.</p>
          <p>Lower volumes in the copper and nickel business units contributed to a net negative impact of $130 million on the Group, while a significantly weaker US dollar reduced Group profitability by a further $329 million.</p>
          <p>Other income and expenses includes the impact of the introduction of export duties at Minera Alumbrera, which have been paid under protest and which remain a topic of continued and vigorous negotiation with the government of Argentina.</p>
          <p>In these times of strong prices there is always a risk that mining companies relax their grip on controllable costs and allow such costs to become embedded in their operations. And it is again pleasing that no such complacency is evident at Xstrata where the operational teams have delivered an exceptional cost performance in the first half. As Mick pointed out, we restricted cost increases to 9% across the Group against equivalent industry inflation of some 13%.</p>
          <p>This net 4% real cost saving, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate, continues on Xstrata's unblemished record of real cost reductions in each recording period. Xstrata Zinc led the way in cost management, achieving a nominal decrease in costs of 5%, which represents a real cost saving of nearly 12%. Now this was achieved primarily through efficiency gains from the expanding Australian zinc-lead operations. And if I think back, I can still recall the discussion we had at the executive committee meeting after the MIM discussion -- acquisition, where we contemplated carrying out the former MIM's management team's intention to close down these assets. And it's all credit to Santiago, that under his stewardship these assets have not only delivered significant profits over the last years, but now represent a real platform for future growth.</p>
          <p>Coal, alloys and nickel also delivered real cost savings of between 5% and 9% against their specific inflationary benchmarks through a combination of efficiency programs and scale benefits from increased production. As we mentioned, production challenges within our copper business unit resulted in a 5% net increase in costs above inflationary benchmarks, but cost performance is expected to improve with higher grades and volumes in the second half.</p>
          <p>Driven by doubling of the oil price and higher electricity costs globally, energy and fuel accounted for one-third of the inflationary increase across the Group, and for more than 75% of the cost inflation at Xstrata Nickel due to the reliance of the Falcondo operation on crude oil as a power source.</p>
          <p>Initiatives are being implemented across the Group to improve energy efficiency and reduce power consumption. And some of these measures include the commissioning of the energy-efficient Lion smelter, based on our proprietary Premus technology which significantly reduces the electricity consumption per kilogram of ferrochrome, and also a large project to convert Falcondo's energy source from oil to coal.</p>
          <p>The increased cost of raw materials and consumables, including reductants and explosives, was another key component of the inflationary pressure on our cost base, accounting for just over one-quarter of our cost increases.</p>
          <p>Despite an EBITDA result in line with last year, cash generated from operations declined to $4.4 billion as a result of an increase in debtors balances at the period end, largely due to higher prices achieved for sales and a number of one-off items in 2007, such as the LionOre break fee, which was $275 million, and the sale of our nickel inventory which I'd referred to earlier. And also we, obviously, had the earnings from the Falconbridge aluminum business up to its sale in May 2007.</p>
          <p>You'll see that sustaining capital expenditure of $700 million was incurred in the first half and was approximately half of last year's full expenditure, while expansionary capital expenditure increased by almost $1 billion to just under $1.5 billion as our pipeline of greenfield and brownfield growth projects began to gather momentum.</p>
          <p>Following the conclusion of the acquisitions of Jubilee and Resource Pacific at a total cash cost of $3.7 billion, net debt increased by $3.2 billion to $14.8 billion. Consequently, gearing on a debt to debt plus equity basis increased 2% to 34%. Given the significant EBITDA generation over the past year and the robust outlook for earnings going forward, I am comfortable that we remain well within our ratings ratios.</p>
          <p>Today we announced a proposal cash offer for Lonmin at a price of &#xA3;33 per share, which reflects a total consideration of some $10 billion. We intend to fund this consideration from existing cash and facilities, together with new debt facilities. From Xstrata's initial public offering in 2002, I have consistently reiterated our commitment to retaining an investment grade credit rating throughout each transaction.</p>
          <p>Now, if the Lonmin transaction had been concluded today, and based on analyst consensus estimates, net debt would increase to some $25.8 billion, call it $26 billion, which would bring our gearing to 47%, and with gross debt to trailing EBITDA marginally in excess of two times. As I said, our robust outlook for earnings and cash flow give me confidence that these numbers will improve from now until conclusion of any transaction. And following preliminary discussions which we've held with the ratings agencies, we fully expect to retain our current ratings on this basis. We will, as in the past, seek further opportunities to refinance and restructure debt as appropriate post conclusion of any transaction.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the dividend payment. As you're aware, Xstrata maintains a progressive dividend policy, and we take into account the underlying growth in earnings while seeking to grow cash returns to shareholders. Interim and final dividends are generally paid in the approximate ratio of one-third and two-thirds to the total annual dividend.</p>
          <p>A final 2007 dividend of $0.34 per share totaling $327 million was paid in April. And the Directors have approved a 2008 interim dividend of $0.18 per share amounting to $173 million, which will be paid on October 10, 2008.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, Xstrata benefits from significant exposure to thermal, semi-soft and coking coal, and in an environment of strengthening spot prices and flat forward curves, all market indications are that the tight coal markets are expected to continue for some time to come. Xstrata's significant exposure to coal and ferrochrome prices is demonstrated in the table behind me. And given the contractual settlements we have already achieved for these commodities, coupled with a projected increase in production for most of our commodities, I expect, like Mick, a material increase in profitability in the second half.</p>
          <p>On that positive note, I'll now hand you back to Mick, who can talk about the other announcement we made this morning.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the signs of a company which is in control of itself is when the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer are in agreement about the future. And we're also in agreement about the fact that we announced today a $10 billion all-cash offer for Lonmin at the price of $0.33 per share. This is a compelling proposed offer and represents a premium of 42% on to Lonmin's share price of &#xA3;23.19 at the close of business yesterday. And we have already acquired just over 8% of Lonmin's issued share capital last night after the market closed. We are currently engaged in attempting to buy more shares in the market today and we will make announcements on that at the appropriate times.</p>
          <p>Lonmin, as you know, is the third largest platinum producer in the world, with a very significant resource base and growth potential. However, over the last two years Lonmin has experienced significant production and operational issues. Our proposed offer fully and fairly values this potential, but we recognize the inherent risks, time and investment required to restore production to historic levels and will provide an opportunity to Lonmin shareholders to realize a significant cash premium at a time of operational challenges.</p>
          <p>Now you know that we've long stated an ambition of becoming a meaningful player in this attractive platinum industry. And our proposed offer for Lonmin accelerates Xstrata's PGM growth strategy and adds further diversifications. We have the relevant mining, smelting and refining expertise, I think an exceptionally good operational and project delivery track record across our South African chrome and platinum business and our businesses in alloys are located in very close proximity to the Lonmin operations in the Bushveld Igneous Complex.</p>
          <p>So this gives me complete confidence that we are well positioned to deliver the turnaround required within the Lonmin business, although that may take some time. Lonmin is a FTSE 100 listed platinum producer, its head office is in London and they have integrated mine to market operations in South Africa on the Western and Eastern Limb of the Bushveld Igneous Complex.</p>
          <p>Lonmin has also published mine of life from current reserves in excess of 30 years at current production rates. The existing Marikana and Limpopo operations and the Pandora JV are supplemented by growth projects such as Akanani and a further expansion of the Limpopo and equity interest in other developing projects. Lonmin's broad-based empowerment partner, Incwala Resources, holds an 18% stake in the operations. Lonmin is in the seat of a new -- of new order mining and prospecting rights for all its key operations and projects as a result of this relationship.</p>
          <p>Now over the past two years, Lonmin's operations have consistently underperformed even its own forecasts of expected platinum sales, resulting in declining sales and production profile at a time of robust PGM prices. The operational challenges are evident throughout the production chain, but, in particular, in the execution of a rapid and complex shift towards mechanization.</p>
          <p>The centralized organization strategy is at odds with Xstrata's approach to devolving authority and accountability to the operational level, and integrating activities, such as safety, into operational responsibilities.</p>
          <p>Current guidance of 765,000 to 770,000 tons of platinum per year to September 30, 2008 indicates an anticipated 18% decline in platinum sales from the 939,654 ounces in the 12 months at September 30, 2006. This guidance has been reduced four times in the past year, reflecting ongoing, unexpected operational difficulties and lower than anticipated production.</p>
          <p>Now, we believe, I believe strongly, that Lonmin can be returned to its former production levels and growth trajectory. But this will require a fresh approach to the operational and organizational strategy to realize that value over time. We are uniquely positioned to realize the full potential of Lonmin's long life, high quality, but underperforming asset portfolio. And we have developed significant mining and smelting skills through the South African chrome business, with a direct application -- which has direct application, let me say, to the mining and extraction of PGMs.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, our rapidly growing platinum business includes personnel with significant management operational experience gained within the South African platinum industry. Our proprietary technology business has also direct experience in resolving operational issues at platinum base metal -- at platinum and base metal concentrators, smelting and refining operations and suppliers. Its proprietary IsaMill fine grinding technology is also supplied to the platinum industry with very good results of the productivity.</p>
          <p>Xstrata Nickel has extensive PG and processing expertise at the Nikkelverk refinery in Norway, they recurrently refine over 500,000 ounces of PGMs annually.</p>
          <p>The Xstrata Alloys business is also located in very close proximity to the Lonmin assets. Its head office is within 40 kilometers of Lonmin's Western Limb operations and our chrome operations mine, the same geographical &#x2013; geological at least, Bushveld Igneous Complex.</p>
          <p>Any combination of Lonmin will also provide significant access to chrome-rich UG2 tailings material and enhanced power optionality across our South African portfolio. Our technical operating skills together with their complementary geographic location of assets substantially reduce the risks inherent in an acquisition and turnaround of this scale and nature.</p>
          <p>So, as Trevor has indicated, we expect to fund today's proposed offer through cash at hand and in bank debt, whilst maintaining our usual commitment to investment grade ratings. Any offer will be conditional on the usual terms and conditions, as well as obtaining the relevant regulatory clearances, the longest of which is expected to be the South African competition approvals. But we don't expect to -- we don't anticipate any regulatory impediments to our proposed offer. We intend to submit the relevant documentation, in fact, as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>In summary, therefore, I see today's announcement as the natural next step in delivering against our platinum growth strategy to further enhance Xstrata's commodity offering, adding immediately and meaningful PGM exposure to our existing world-class base metals and bulk minerals portfolio, whilst maintaining a well diversified geographical exposure.</p>
          <p>We recognize that it's going to take some time to realize the full potential of this asset base, following operational challenges which I've outlined, but I believe that no company is better placed to deliver this turnaround than Xstrata. We have consistently shown our ability to extract value from underperforming assets. Mount Isa, Tintaya, Raglan and Collahuasi are a few notable examples.</p>
          <p>I am confident that this offer provides Lonmin shareholders the compelling opportunity to realize a significant cash premium at a time of ongoing operational issues and some uncertainty over short-term platinum demand. However, it certainly gives us an opportunity to add value for our shareholders as well.</p>
          <p>Now we've scheduled a further investment conference call at 4.30 UK time this afternoon to discuss the Lonmin offer, and to take questions from investors who weren't able to join us at this morning's presentation. Details of that call are highlighted in this morning's press release and on our website.</p>
          <p>So, in conclusion, I am pleased that our first half 2008 results provide a solid platform to continue our strong cost performance and to deliver significant volume and earnings growth for the full year and beyond. Our multifaceted growth strategy remains on track to deliver superior shareholder returns, though ongoing NPV enhancements, disciplined M&amp;A and the delivery of our attractive pipeline.</p>
          <p>So this brings us to the end of this presentation. As usual, we'll be happy to take questions. And just, again, for the sake of good order, if you could just wait for the microphone to come to you when you put up your hand, state your name and company for the record, before asking your question. Thank you very much. There's &#xA3;10 for the first question.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Will do. Have you actually spoken to Lonmin's management yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I made a call last night after close of business to tell them that we intended to make the offer as a courtesy, but we haven't had any extensive discussions, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you previously discussed a potential merger between Xstrata and Lonmin, and what was the outcome of those discussions if they took place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've never had discussions with Lonmin prior to this announcement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you talk a little bit about your vision for turning the assets around? At the moment the big drive at Lonmin has been for mechanization. Is that something that your platinum team believes in, or would you be looking to go for a more conventional type turnaround?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that mechanization is a great medium-term strategy. I think that, however, one extracts value from assets in the best way possible. And, from our point of view, what we need to ensure, and not dissimilar to the situation we found at Isa in the copper mine, we need to ensure that the full potential to actually mine ore is there. And that requires the reinitiation of development in the mines where mechanization is not a feasible option, and that we should have no fear of going back to conventional mining and to spend time on that development.</p>
          <p>So the timeframe to start picking up production portfolio is going to be governed by the extent and the amount of time that Peet and his team will have to spend on reinitiating development. I don't think we have to take a very pragmatic approach to the balance of mechanization and conventional mining. And I think a very important process is the thrust of operational responsibility and accountability in decision making back to the operations, that they become empowered without any burden of overhead and without any second guessing from a center as to how they should operate.</p>
          <p>I am convinced, as we've found in every other operation that we've bought, any other company that we bought, that the talent to run great world-class operations exists in those companies. We don't have to bring in new talent. We just have to liberate that talent. And I think that is just the most fundamental key to a turnaround. So that's the philosophical side. If you want to go into more detail, Peet and Ben, who's going to be -- who's in charge of our platinum business, again, they can talk on that in more detail.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tobias Woerner from MF Global. Three questions if I may. The first one relates to Lonmin again. They've obviously rejected the offer this morning. You've shown a very disciplined approach to your acquisitions in the past in as far as when prices moved up because of others interfering. I suspect that's what we expect from you here again. And also will you talk to their shareholders directly? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question, when you look to your peers, your larger peers, you seem to, in terms of the margin, have a slightly lower one than them. In an environment where I still believe in the stronger for longer theme, but there's cycles within cycles and commodity prices are coming off, you will, on the back of that, probably be a more sensitive one to slowing or falling commodity prices. How do you intend to mitigate that, if I may ask?</p>
          <p>And then the last question, you've highlighted that you're open to further deals. And you mentioned Vale in that context and the discussions. But aren't you, by going into platinum, limiting your options on the one hand, and also increasing your EEV making you less digestible in a sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well your first question, I think, relates to the way we would approach Lonmin. We have put a price on the table, which we think is the right price to pay for the company. The management and Board of Lonmin must make the decisions that they think are appropriate. We effectively are talking directly to the shareholders. The offer has been made to the shareholders. That, to my mind, you can't have a more direct discussion than that. So if and when this proposal turns into an offer, that will be directly to the shareholders.</p>
          <p>And we spoke to shareholders late yesterday evening. They sold us 8.5% of the company. We are speaking directly to the shareholders in the market today. So that communication will be ongoing. I haven't heard any transactions that've been done. Their management hasn't initially told us that they don't want to do the transaction. This is nothing new. And as I said, it's really -- it's not for me to advise in any way, the Lonmin management and Board how they should respond. I'm sure they will do the right thing as regards to their shareholders as I would in similar circumstances.</p>
          <p>In relation to the issue of margins, I think our actual margins against our competitors are quite competitive. And if you look at the circums that we've received on coal prices and the impact that coal and ferrochrome will have on the results in the second half of the year, I think that the margins will reflect those very significant increases well beyond the industry average. This is one of the power of the diversified mining company. Like when you have, as you say, cycles within cycles. So our exposure to nickel and zinc at the moment is leading to a reduction in revenue and profitability. Our exposure to copper at the moment is exceptionally solid. Copper remains to be at a very strong price. And, in fact, I think the future of copper is exceptionally strong. In fact, we have this massive thrust and growth in our bulk commodities. So from my perspective, we're a diversified mining company. That is what diversified mining companies are all about. That's what they deliver. And that's what we will deliver.</p>
          <p>With respect to how does this transaction have an impact on anybody out there who might want to buy us, but I guess the universe of people who can buy Xstrata even today is relatively small. I don't think that universe changes by this transaction. I'm not out there trying to sell Xstrata. I'm out there trying to create as much value for my shareholders as I can. I think this transaction is potentially value-enhancing for my shareholders, at the same time delivering significant value to Lonmin shareholders. That's what my business is, that's what I'm about and that's what we'll continue doing.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's James Fairweather from UBS. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the financing for the proposed or potential acquisition. Obviously you've got cash on the balance sheets and facilities. Can you give any indication as to how big the facilities you're negotiating with your banks and an idea of the price of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not currently negotiating with the banks. I said we are going to raise facilities to pay for the acquisition. Given that we wanted to maintain anonymity and also given that we wanted to negotiate on the most competitive basis. We've chosen to now start negotiating with our banks. I have to say that given the response on my BlackBerry it looks like we're going to have no problem in raising the requisite facilities. So we haven't gone into any specifics of pricing, but it is a $10 billion acquisition. We have some limited facilities available for draw down. But substantially all of that will be refinanced in new facilities, of various tenors which will be determined according to our expectations of cash flow and repayment.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sam Catalano from Macquarie. Two questions, not on the Lonmin bid actually. Just on Tampakan, you talked a little bit about some maybe slight delays in development of that, change in scope potentially. But how does the outcome of the Indophil bid sort of affect that in terms of the priority within all the copper projects that you have, particularly within the context of the desire for potentially a local partner there to take some ownership? And the second question is just on the cost base. If you throw in the FX impact, obviously, the cost increases are going to be significantly higher. Have you thought about doing anything to mitigate that in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll ask Charlie to answer your questions on Indophil, and then let me first deal with the issue of ForEx. Yes, obviously, the FX impact adds additional costs this year. It depends how the exchange rate changes. It would increase our -- if you add FX to the 16%, it increases the US dollar base terms -- sorry, the FX impact of 8% increases to around about 16% in total, which against our peer group is still very competitive. We have always adopted the view that our business is to generate revenues through the mining and processing of metals and bulks. At any time that we've tried to enter into and hedge these exposures, we create new exposures. We don't take the risks out, we just change the nature of those risks. We don't think that we are best positioned to manage that, and that we should rather stick to this situation because we feel we have a natural hedge in the fact that our prices are basically denominated in dollars. So any long-term shifts in ForEx will be reflected in the price of the commodity, and that's the position we've adopted. Charlie, can you deal with the Indophil situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Sam, in relation to Indophil, as you know, we have -- we already have management control and significant interest in Tampakan with our 62.5% share holding. And early last year when we took control, we brought in the project trying to undertake the review of the pre-feasibility work that had been completed to that point in time. And we undertook to then do some further work, which we call a extended pre-feasibility study. Now that study is being completed in the coming months. We're completing that before the end of this year. And then our expectation would be that we should be able to then take the decision to go into the feasibility study.</p>
          <p>So our timeframe in terms of undertaking the evaluation work in pre-feasibility and feasibility study hasn't changed. We still see the feasibility study being completed by early 2010. What we were referring to in the presentation was the quite complex environment that we're operating in. And I think that was evidenced by two attacks on the Tampakan site, by the NPA in early January and more recently within the last month. Also our expectation of the complexity of the submission of the environmental and social impact assessments during a time when we'll see the presidential elections in the Philippines in 2010. So there's a number of risks there which are outside of our control. But certainly in terms of project management and control of SMI and the work that's being undertaken, we're very pleased with progress to date.</p>
