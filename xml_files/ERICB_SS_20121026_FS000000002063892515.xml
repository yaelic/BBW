          <p>Welcome to the Ericsson Analyst and Media Conference Call for the Third Quarter Report. To use the visual aid for this call, please log on to www.ericsson.com/press or www.ericsson.com/investors. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, a replay will be available one hour after today's conference call. &#xC5;se Lindskog will now open the call. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and hello, everyone. You're all very welcome to our call today, where we will comment on our third quarter report. And with me here today I have Hans Vestberg, President and the CEO of Ericsson; Jan Frykhammar, Chief Financial Officer; and Johan Wibergh, who's Head of our Business Unit Networks; and then I have Magnus Mandersson, Head of our Business Unit Global Services.</p>
          <p>And then to start with, I have to make the usual reminder that during the call today, we'll be making forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our current expectations and certain planning assumptions which are subject to risk and uncertainties. The actual results may differ materially due to factors mentioned in today's press release and discussed in this conference call. I also encourage you to read about these risks and uncertainties in our earnings report and our annual report.</p>
          <p>And so with this said, then, I hand over the call to Hans Vestberg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, &#xC5;se. Let me start to summarize a little bit about the key developments in the quarter, some little bit longer term and some shorter term. It's of course quite difficult to boil them down. It's happening quite a lot in the industry for the moment. But let me start with that we see a growing interaction with our customers when it comes to folks on network performance as a key differentiator.</p>
          <p>This, of course, driven that consumers expect a very good experience when it comes to using their smartphones all around the world and this is also very important for us because this is what we have been focusing on as a company, both from technology and from a services point of view to support the customer in. Johan will talk a little bit more about that later on.</p>
          <p>We also passed in the quarter 1 billion smartphones and it was &#x2013; I'd just say that is a remarkable, of course, development on that type of evolution. We also saw some flagship brands coming out with 4G phones, which also is, of course, solidifying that this is an industry where smartphones will be extremely important in the future.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the macro economic situation, as we all can see and read there are, of course, some early slowdown and projections for the future. We have the same patterns as we've had before. Part of Europe being slower than some other markets, especially the ones that has some political unrest or impacted and investing lower at the moment. But it's just that you need to highlight this. We are close to our customers and see what's happening, but obviously more important is of course the fundamentals in industry, the long-term and the usage of the networks, how is the usage happening? And the underlying usage of the networks that is continuing to be an important parameter for us.</p>
          <p>We are also seeing in this quarter consolidations, maybe not in Europe where it might be even more important, but we're seeing in the U.S., cross-border and in country. This is, of course, an important parameter for us as we are main suppliers for many of these consolidators. I would say the most recent ones we are the main supplier to all of them. So, this is important for us to be part of that. And if they approve these transactions to support them in that transition and to get the benefits they're expecting.</p>
          <p>If I then dig down to our financials, SEK54.6 billion in sales, down 2% compared to last year and 1% sequentially. That means that we are fairly stable on the top line between both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>As we know, the shift then inside sales is growth in Services and Support Solutions and declining growth in Networks, very much the same patterns as we had in the second quarter. There are some markets that have developed favorably. I would say in the quarter on Networks, North America sticking out on the positive side, we saw the same pattern for Europe and China and Russia. Korea is somewhat new here. There is more about that. We had a strong last year.</p>
          <p>CDMA, can just confirm that we &#x2013; what we have said before. The plan that was sort of the expected decline has happened and we're down 50% in this quarter as well.</p>
          <p>Profitability, our focus on OpEx are paying off, we are for comparable units down 7%. Net income down compared to last year with 42%, down to SEK2.2 billion, but if we look sequentially, it's up 81%. And of course here we are driven of both improvement in Services, and somewhat in Network and of course the JVs is helping us as well, whereas the Ericsson had less of a loss in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Well, I said it before, we are not satisfied with the profitability, but we have &#x2013; we constantly come to the situation where we have invested in market share and also both geographically in R&amp;D, and we are now in the sort of in the process of executing on all those projects we have.</p>
          <p>So, it's basically no surprises, we are in the midst of a modernization and we have a high degree of coverage projects. <mark type="ph" /> Now I choose (6:32) to continue the work and in that sense we all continue to look for &#x2013; for actively for efficiency gain, cost reductions as we have done all this year, but we'll just continue with that because that we believe we can control ourselves. The market around us, of course, we will see but definitely we will continue with the cost reductions as we have done before.</p>
          <p>But next I hand over to Johan to talk about Networks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hans. So, let me briefly then go through Q3 here. So, overall on top line then, the net sales were down 17% year-over-year. Looking on quarter-over-quarter development, it was down 3%, which is in line with normal seasonality. We saw a good development on top line in North America, despite the head reduction on CDMA.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we have lower sales impacting both by modernization but also, of course, on the economic &#x2013; general economic climate in Europe. China, then, we had lower GSM sales among other things, as China Mobile has communicated a focus on 3G investments instead as well as we had lower 3G sales in Russia. In 2011, we had a huge 3G rollout project that ended last year and hence we had then a decline in our third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>As said, CDMA sales were down 50% year-over-year in line with what we had expected and it amounted to SEK 1.6 billion in the quarter and now also then being dilutive to the operating margin.</p>
          <p>Overall then, we had an operating margin of 5% in the quarter; it's down significantly compared to a year ago, 13%. However then it's a stable quarter-over-quarter development. It was, of course, impacted by a seasonally low OpEx and also a lower software sales share.</p>
          <p>Overall then, sales were down, this also has an impact. We are top line sensitive, even though we had a very high activity level overall in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (9:02) project. It's operating margin was also negatively impacted by the underlying business mix and there are still more coverage than capacity projects. And as we've said many times before then, European modernization is still having an impact.</p>
          <p>Moving down to the next slide. The &#x2013; as Hans was discussing earlier then, it's really encouraging then to see that the increasing interest from operators on superior performance and also what we can see on some independent research showing that superior performance of Networks gives a superior return to the operators on that. And this is really how Ericsson competes today on providing superior performance. So this is driven both by, I would say, a general trend by operators, also by new devices coming out and new apps being launched, that really requires a good performance of the network.</p>
          <p>This is not only leading to LTE even though but maybe most of the headlines come around LTE. We see then an increasing interest and need for investment in HSPA, both increasing speeds but also more capacity, coverage in areas. And this is very much then driven by that 3G smartphones are significantly cheaper than LTE smartphones. It's also extremely encouraging to see then that more and more operators are introducing tiered pricing plans, i.e. leaving flat rates for data which gives them an increasing top line and profitability around wireless data which is really healthy change in the industry, so that is quite encouraging.</p>
          <p>Another interesting development during the quarter has been then LTE in Latin America. And several countries now, some in the Caribbean, we have Mexico, Chile, Brazil, have awarded contracts during the last month and we feel really encouraged to see that we have gained more than 50% market share in LTE in Latin America. But keep in mind, then, that we have been in the range of 60% before when it has been decided in countries like U.S., part of Europe, Korea and Japan, Latin America is traditionally a very competitive area and we feel really encouraged by getting more than 50% in that area.</p>
          <p>Another thing that feels very good is the positive feedback we have received from customers on our Smart Services Router. I mean, that's our investment in IP. It's a product we launched end of last year. It has gone into commercial operation this year. It has been evaluated by many operators. We announced after the second quarter that we had secured seven commercial orders. I can now say that we have 20 commercial contracts &#x2013; orders, and we have several more in finalizing. So this is extremely good, we think it's extremely encouraging and it's clear that we have the most &#x2013; the biggest capacity on a mobile packet core equipment. And the architecture we have chosen for handhelds, mobiles and fixed has been extremely well received.</p>
          <p>One internal change is that we have had two business units, one for CDMA, another one for the rest of the Networks unit. They are being merged from 1 of January. These do not change the external reporting, since we have been reporting it together as the Network segment, but we just wanted to make you aware about that.</p>
          <p>Finally, then, I feel extremely good about our overall position in the market. The portfolio, the performance, the improved quality, I think we're executing extremely well on that reduction of capital tied up in the supply chain. The area where I'm not happy is on the &#x2013; our profitability. It's a strong focus and I will come back on the Investor Day on some of the activities we are doing to work on that one.</p>
          <p>And with that, over to you, Magnus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and hello, everybody. Yes, we ended the quarter with SEK 24.3 billion in sales, which is a 19% growth in the business. Currency adjusted, it's 16%. I would say that we have a strong momentum across our business lines, very good &#x2013; very well driven by the Professional Services increasing 11% year-on-year. Managed Services continues to have a strong momentum and we concluded with 11 new contracts in Managed Services, going up 19% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing a strong development in network rollout. We have very heavy activities in North East Asia, in Europe, North America and Sub-Saharan Africa. So, we are seeing there a strong increase and high project activity. And we're also seeing, of course, that we are getting better and better in industrializing our data network rollout and taking care of the data explosions that's happening out in the networks.</p>
          <p>When it comes to our margin improvements, we can see then a year back we had about 9%. We are now doing 8% on Global Services, however it's &#x2013; sequentially we are going from 6% up to 8%, so we are concluding a better quarter sequentially and that I think is encouraging.</p>
          <p>Professional Services continues to gain momentum, excluding the restructuring. We are actually delivering 16% operating income. We had a high activity on restructuring, 2% takeaway, so 14%, which is in line with a year back &#x2013; sorry, a quarter back.</p>
          <p>Network Rollout, I think, Q-on-Q here, we decreased the losses from 11% to 6%. And again, the industrialization is paying off in the progress that we are delivering. And, of course, we have somewhat a better project mix there.</p>
          <p>So, all-in-all, I think we have a good momentum and I will come back with more details on the Capital Market Day, how we will continue to drive our efficiencies in the business and continue to improve sales and profitability. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Magnus. I think, Support Solutions, we had 14% growth in Support Solutions and excluding or making it organic, it was 4% driven a lot about from the BSS area, the charging area, but of course, it was where the sales from Telcordia are.</p>
          <p>Operating margin, 14%, that has one-time effect there or divestment of IPX. If you exclude then we're on 7%, still clearly a shift in the profitability of Support Solutions as we now have had a good profitability both in Q2 and Q3.</p>
          <p>We are in transformation here in this business. And we have done an acquisition in the third quarter, which was ConceptWave that is adding together with Telcordia and our own assets in the OSS area, A very strong position together with Services to be the IT provider of the IT Networks of the operators to really be in there and support them in the transformation for this mobile broadband and mobile broadband shortly where that we're going Into. So that concludes Support Solutions.</p>
          <p>Quick on the regions. We'll not go through all of them. We have highlighted North America, 16% growth despite the CDMA, but it's not only in infrastructure it's also services. Sub-Sahara growing 11% coming back from having been down for quite a while, even though from lower levels, we've now seen a growth there.</p>
          <p>China, North East Asia was mentioned. Johan mentioned China. I mentioned Korea. Those are the two important regions there. On the other hand, of course, we have also high activity in this region for example in Japan.</p>
          <p>The best growing segment is Other and the reason is that we have here we report Technicolor that we acquired in the quarter, so they are reported in Other.</p>
          <p>Other things included here is, of course, IPX which resides in Support Solutions, but from the fourth quarter that's divested, so we will go out from the other column.</p>
          <p>And then we have the IPRs and licensing in there as well, which are the stable development in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So, I'll leave it over to you, Jan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Hans. Good afternoon, everyone. So, let me now talk about the P&amp;L and the balance sheet before we open up for question and answers. So, we have on the P&amp;L side, important again to remind everyone that the business mix is the key to the gross margin dynamics. We have three very important elements that &#x2013; for &#x2013; to understand our gross margin development, one is the business mix. Again that has to do with coverage and capacity project. We also have the modernization projects in Europe and the Services share.</p>
          <p>During this quarter, if I compare with the second quarter or third quarter of last year, we have seen an increase in our Services business which has an impact on the gross margin, also in this report we disclose how big that impact is, which I think is important for you to understand.</p>
          <p>Overall, Global Services adds to the stability of our operating profitability and overall as Magnus said, before you can see how that operating margin and EBITA margins have improved and also been &#x2013; so, it's an important enabler for stability on our operating earnings.</p>
          <p>If we then look at the underlying business mix, I know we have said this before, but we will continue to say this to you until we see that there is a change happening and that is that the current business mix with higher share of coverage than capacity projects, is expected to prevail short-term.</p>
          <p>We also have the restructuring charges in the quarter of SEK 0.6 billion. Main amount of this restructuring charges has to do with the service delivery transformation that Magnus mentioned and that he also will talk more about in the Investor Day. We also then say that our estimates for the full year of SEK 4 billion of restructuring charges remains. So this means that we estimate to have a higher restructuring charge in the fourth quarter, but we also think then that that will be more evenly spread between operating expense and cost of sales.</p>
          <p>If we look at the operating expense, so if we compare apples-to-apples operating expense is down 7%. Also in absolute numbers, it's down slightly. We have reductions in both R&amp;D and selling and G&amp;A. All-in-all our operating margin in the quarter was 6.7% compared to 11.3% a year ago, but if we compare with the second quarter in absolute numbers and in percent, our operating margin has improved.</p>
          <p>If we then take a look at ST-Ericsson we have the joint venture is still in a challenging situation, but we have seen an improved performance in the third quarter and we start to see impact now of the ongoing transformation work, aiming at lowering the breakeven point, and that's also visible in the numbers. We also continue to believe that the ST-Ericsson has a strategic position in the industry to enable the device ecosystem.</p>
          <p>On this line, we'll also highlight the exposure, if you will, that we have towards the joint venture. And you can see that the investment in ST-Ericsson in the quarter, then, is SEK 195 million and the loans to ST-Ericsson is SEK 4.5 billion.</p>
          <p>If we then go to the balance sheet, we have the &#x2013; as expected, a good development on collections in the quarter, because we had, if you remember, we had a good end of second quarter, meaning a strong sales in June; those money were collected. So, we have now an operating cash flow in the quarter of SEK 7 billion. When we look at operating cash flow, we look at this on a full year basis and that we have mentioned before, quarters may vary.</p>
          <p>We have also had some &#x2013; some headwind &#x2013; some tailwind on the balance sheet here, thanks to FX. Overall, I want to say that the inventory level continues on a high level and that has to do with the project activity. So, I think that's important to note.</p>
          <p>If we look at the gross cash we had, thanks to the good cash flow from operations, we managed to deliver a net cash improvement in the quarter of SEK 3.1 billion, gross cash SEK 2.4 billion. In the investing there you see, slightly more than what we usually have and that is related to two of the acquisitions we have made. Then we continue to diversify our re-funding sources and we have announced a new loan from Nordic Investment Bank and also after the closing we have &#x2013; of the quarter, we have announced a European Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>So, we continue to prolong the debt maturity profiles, and this was &#x2013; so this year, we have really succeeded in prolonging the debt maturity profiles, and at the same time, not increasing the gross debt, which I think is work well down.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Now to Hans again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll do a quick summary. It will be basically &#x2013; or it will be the same slide as we showed last quarter. This is the focus for the executive team and the whole Ericsson. The strategic execution we're into with the investment well done to make this to a profitable growth. I think we all are committed to that and working very hard to do it, but, of course, leveraging our strength in the mobile broadband, in the Managed Services, in the OSS/BSS, where we'll have great positions, and we are really seeing that we are executing well on those projects and those footprints well again.</p>
          <p>We will, as I said before, continue to proactively look for cost efficiency gains. That's part of our daily work, and we have done it so far this year and we will just continue; that's the part where we can control. We will &#x2013; Jan has already talked about what we have as expectation or forecast for restructuring charge for the year so will &#x2013; so, we have some more to do here.</p>
          <p>And it all boils down to the two pillars of our strategy, that's the technology leadership and a service leadership and that we really are emphasizing and anything we do when it comes to customer engagements, how we invest, how we execute on our strategy.</p>
          <p>So, all-in-all, that's a short summary. We'll have the focus and as you see on the last slide, and Magnus mentioned it well &#x2013; as well. We have the Investor Day November 6 and I hope that many of you will join that.</p>
          <p>By that, I hand back to &#xC5;se.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, all of you. And after these presentations, we're ready to take questions. So, operator, you may now open up the line for our Q&amp;A session.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we shall begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Also, please limit yourselves to one question at a time and please keep your questions at a broad level. Detailed information is provided in the report and Ericsson's Investor Relations and Media Relations team will be happy to take additional questions and discuss further details with you after the call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Pierre Ferragu from Bernstein is on the line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. I'd just like to have some clarification on CDMA. So you have SEK1.6 billion reported in the quarter, and I assume that includes your two CDMA clients in the U.S., and I would like to understand how directionally your gross margin for CDMA has been evolving over the last couple of quarters because I would assume that you had a ramp up of the modernization project at slightly low margins and a run down of more like a great types of works at a much higher margin. So, is it fair to assume that the CDMA gross margin contribution came down a lot in percentage terms over the last six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, just to conclude the facts, you are right, our turnover on infrastructure from CDMA is SEK1.6 billion in the quarter and that's a 50% reduction. We also say that operating margin is lower than the average in Networks in the quarter. So, your conclusion is right that we have come down in the gross margin on CDMA, due to what type of projects we're delivering I have to say.</p>

          <p>Alexander Peterc from Exane BNP Paribas is now in line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. First one, is just a small one regarding seasonality. Do you expect a more normal seasonality this year in Networks in Q4 compared to last year's Q4, which was quite abnormally low? And then, just a more fundamental question, gross margins, I understand that you had quite a few completions closing in the just reported Q3 and that had an impact on the gross margins. Were any of these European modernizations deals, and if so, would you expect in Q4 a bit less than the usual gross margin seasonal decline? In other words, do you expect a slight relief from less modernization in the mix already in the current quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Alexander, it's Johan here. I will try to answer your two questions. If we look at the Networks business, excluding CDMA, we have &#x2013; if you look at it from last year's point of view, we basically did not have any seasonality in that business. We had a big business mix shift between first half and second half. Then when it comes to seasonality in the Networks business this year, excluding CDMA, I mean, I think that it's &#x2013; as we have said several times in the report, in the third quarter, he we had quite normal seasonality. Let's see what the fourth quarter will bring. We will come back in January and report that.</p>
          <p>Then on the gross margin overall, we have &#x2013; we've said and it's also visible in the &#x2013; in the Network Rollout sales growth that we have a good or high project activity in this quarter. Typically &#x2013; you are right in that, typically our fourth quarter contains a bigger portion of project completions. I want to be clear that we feel also that we have had a significant amount of project completions in this third quarter, and then let's see what the fourth quarter brings. But again we have a high activity level in Network Rollout, and we had quite a big amount of project completions already in the third quarter this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Another question on the gross margins and the competitive environment. Historically when we've seen Ericsson's gross margins dip, we've seen other wireless network OEMs struggle, maybe even exiting the market, be it bankruptcy or consolidation. This past quarter, Nokia Siemens improved its margins though, while your margins are still suffering especially in Networks. So the question is, what's going on with the competitive environment right now? Do you think this is just a short-term dynamic, or is it really a longer term where NSN's may be caught you? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a hard time to comment on the competition what they are doing or not, I can only come back to what we are doing, and remember, on the gross margin, we need visibility for a few quarters, when we analyze that because the mix here is so important with a higher degree of service as well that it's taking down the gross margin. But it's clear that our gross margin even in Networks is down, given the modernization and higher portion on coverage. I think that the competitive landscape for me, I mean if you look five to 10 years, it's dramatic changes. If you look quarters, it's not much changes for us. I think the &#x2013; on five to 10 years, basically all competitors has been changed out and we have new ones. And if you look the last quarter it's pretty much the same. Then they're coming back in different strengths in different quarters. The focus on this executive team is to run our strategy and our execution because we have learned now during the years that it will change who is competing is strong and weak in this industry. We just need to see that we continue to excel in what we are doing so we can extend our leadership. That's really where we are focusing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on follow up, you'd say that overall structurally in the marketplace, gross margins and Ericsson's gross margins in particular, the dynamics really haven't changed for you guys over the last, we'll call it, 12 months or so on the networks, hardware side? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; of course it has changed and that's what we're commenting on that. We have a much higher degree of modernization. We have, number two, with the networks. We have much more coverage than capacity. And number three, we have a decline in CDMA. So we have those three of course impacting our gross margin but on the overall business models that we have been talking on before when you got in, you go into a network and of course that's when it's the highest competition and then over time, of course, then you should be able to leverage on that installed base. That business model has not changed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks so much. Simon Sch&#xE4;fer, Goldman Sachs. I actually had a bigger picture question. You started talking to us about some of the margin dilutive effects from a mixed point of view. I think in Q1 2011 and at the time you cited that that mix effect would last probably 18 to 24 months. I guess we're in month 18 now. So does that still mean &#x2013; does this still think that in the next six months you're going to see a meaningful fade of those mix effects, or is the timing of that changed? I guess I'm just trying to get an understanding as to apart from the revenue environment, of course, which perhaps is tougher, just because of your &#x2013; some of your customers' cash flow and so on. But aside from that, has anything changed in the timing? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Remember, we started to talk about these in Q4 2010 that this will happen and we were a little bit overestimate to how quick it could start so of course they were distributed over time. In average, we talked about that they are 18 to 24 months. That is still valid. We just kicked it off a little bit slower. It was a little bit complicated in the beginning there to set-up the project. So the 18 to 24 months still is valid and what we say right now that by year end or end of fourth quarter, we will see a gradual those project decline. But of course some were started in the second quarter or the first quarter this year so some will also continue. But we will now see from a full base that there will be a gradual decline. But of course some were started much later than in the beginning of 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Makes sense. Thanks so much. And my second question would be actually along the same lines of what was asked previously in terms of competitive dynamics. I guess in this sort of land grab environment that the industry is finding itself in, from your point of view of the competitor, how aggressively are you willing to price? And what sort of margin discounts are you willing to take in this environment? I think you called out LatAm very specifically with a 50% market share plus. But how aggressively are you willing to be from an incremental margin perspective? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as we said before, we had the targets of increasing our market share in the European modernization. We were clear on that. We started talk to the market in 2010. We have achieved that. And last year Johan reported increased market share in Networks to 38%. So we have a good market share. So that means that we are in execution phase on that market share. And that also means that we will be a little bit more cautious of taking new market share but I think if you have a good product right now and good performance on it, you will have the possibility to take market share, but not of the extent of any raise in margin.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Again, sort of a pricing-driven question. A lot of your competitors seem to be talking about stepping back on pricing and saying the pricing landscape has become a bit easier and in services you see in Alcatel and Nokia Siemens walk away from their commitment to Managed Services. So I was trying to understand whether you've seen any of that evidence yourself? And if so, how long it might take for those sort of pricing dynamics to actually show up in your underlying margins?

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the last two years we've gone through a big change in the industry. I mean if you go back two years, you had a &#x2013; you had new entrants that wanted to get into the worldwide markets and there were some tough ambitions from the different vendors, and of course, that's been a very competitive climate. And from our side, and we decided to take certain market share that we reported on last year, and it came with &#x2013; at the certain costs.</p>
          <p>We also then have seen how the competitive climate have changed. I think the best prices you could get in the industry you could get them in 2010 and 2011, they don't exist anymore. And also I'm, therefore, encouraged with a market share we have achieved in Latin America. That's why we choose to highlight that as one thing which, of course, is not taken at those type of price levels that you had in 2010 and 2011. And we still have secured a significant market share, and I think that also shows overall our competitiveness.</p>
          <p>As I said, we think we have a very competitive product portfolio and services portfolio as a total company. We are competing and we are performing well and we are also being much more stringent on pricing point.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>On the service side, we think we have a good model on our Global Services, Magnus and I here, so of course we believe it's &#x2013; we can continue to grow that and has done so with good margins. Then you're right, there are different vendors that are acting different about that can go from one quarter to another, so I wouldn't comment on anything like that. We think we have a good model to grow in Services &#x2013; in Managed Services.</p>

We are seeing good cross-knowledge sharing in between the regions and the global centers, which drives out cost and at the same time, drives the completion rate higher than we have seen before. So we feel that we are on the right track.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; this is Johan, so I mean we will see a gradual improvement. I mean, you should still remember that this business is still a lower volume in the overall Networks business. I mean we don't today disclose the various parts. But it's &#x2013; I'll kind of say that we have had a positive contribution of margins already during the year on our IT business. And of course, we &#x2013; it will continue to improve during the coming times, coming quarters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hans, on modernization, the thought has been that there will be some short-term pain for some long-term gain. Are we mostly finished with network modernization projects in Europe? And is there the same confidence from before that eventually margins will improve? And is your market share protected after your &#x2013; after you modernize? And is there some assurance that competitors won't resort to a similar strategy down the road to modernize what you already modernized?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. First, I think <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:54) quite a lot over the modernization. As we stated with 18 to 24 months for the projects and they will, starting end of Q4, gradually decline. That means they will continue, some of them, into &#x2013; that we have not changed. We have the same thing we've said from the first and the second quarter this year. So there's no change in that timeframe.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the business model you ask about, I would say that if you perform, of course you have a great chance to stay in there for a long time because the market rate standard we're deploying right now is of course having a great opportunity for optimizing frequencies, et cetera. But again, you need to perform. That's for sure. So it's not for granted. But definitely the dynamics has not changed for the business model that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could ask just on Europe where you are modernizing these projects, now the carrier environment there is actually more difficult than it used to be. These carriers are resorting to cutting their dividends, leaving very little for CapEx and network upgrades. Does financing for competitors now becoming an increasing concern? And how do you respond to that? And how do you kind of combat that? Because, clearly the carriers want cheaper alternatives.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's Jan here. On the customer financing, you can see that we have &#x2013; we have about &#x2013; a little bit more than SEK 4 billion on on balance sheet customer financing. We work very close with several export credit agencies, and we have very good offering, total offering when it comes to customer financing following all the consensus rules and so forth. So I would say that our customer financing offering that we work very close with the export credit agency in Sweden, in Canada, and also in Germany makes our way of working here I think very competitive too that we can use to win more business.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thank you. My question was on the Network Rollout side of things. You've indicated in your comments that this is amongst the busiest time that you guys can remember in terms of the level of coverage projects and clearly we can see that in the 38% year-on-year growth in Network Rollout. But as we look to next year and some of the modernization projects and coverage projects draw to a close, what can you see that's going to replace that nice growth that we've had in this revenue this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's not for us to guide on it, but of course, as we now are in a midst of all these activities and as you've seen in Magnus figures, the 38% growth in Network Rollout and probably the highest activity that we ever had in the third quarter, one might believe that it's not going to be on that type of activity level during 2013 in totality. So I think that we are in an unusual time. We are delivering more things than ever. We have larger projects than ever. And these are not small things. There are thousands of people as Jan Frykhammar said on the conference call today pulling together, rolling out not only technology but putting together also everything around the site that it works with antennas and everything. So this is huge works that is undergoing right now. And we should probably not expect that it will be on that activity level on Network Rollout in 2013.</p>

And where we could be by the end of 2012? Any indication around that would be helpful. And also, how is the ramp of these projects going on? Is it accelerating or slowing as we move from Q2 to Q3?

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So then, Johan will take this answer then, because I think Hans has tried three times. We will &#x2013; so what we have said all the time was that all projects that were won was in full execution in the fourth quarter of last year. In average, all of these projects have a duration of between 18 to 24 months. As Hans mentioned before, it was a gradual start of the project, starting some projects in Q1 of last year, a few more in Q2 and even a few more in Q3 and then all were in execution in Q4. So &#x2013; and that's the timeline that we are following and we do not &#x2013; we have not seen any slowing down in progress that would make us change the timeline. So that is still valid.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then &#x2013; and a follow up on the mix in &#x2013; we've talked about the mix in U.S. and in Europe. How should we see the mix evolve in parts of Asia and Latin America as we go into 2013?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I think that &#x2013; so first and foremost, if we talk about the fact that we have now for a couple of quarters, and I'm aware of that we have said that, we have said that our business mix with more coverage than capacity projects will prevail short-term. And when we define short-term, we define that as between three to four quarters. And, of course, it seems we have decided to keep that statement in this quarter. We see that that's the case. And, of course, if you see examples of LTE coverage projects now being rolled out in Latin America that is the reason why we make &#x2013; keep this statement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you for taking my question. I've got a question about the cash because for once it's pretty good this quarter. And I was wondering you have this target of 70% cash conversion for the year, how do you feel about this target for this year, given that you are at 50% today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we look at this over a year, of course, cash conversion is a yearly target and then individual quarter, of course, can go up and down a little bit, what's happening. We are on 52% cash conversion right now. As we said, even after the second quarter, the target for this team is to get to 70% cash conversion. We said in the second quarter. We'll say it of the third quarter. We are not giving up on that. There are challenges. But we will, of course, do everything we can to meet that target.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Thanks for letting me on. Couple of questions from me. Hans, can you possibly talk about China and the developments in TD-LTE? I mean you didn't take part in TD-SCDMA. So next year as China ramps up TD-LTE, you did in GSM have substantial share in China. How do you see your prospects in TD in China starting next year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the modernization, just to clarify, as I thought that some of the modernization projects would start rolling off end of this year. Now you're talking about new Latin American modernization. So will there be improvement in margins starting first quarter of next year year-on-year? Or is the Latin American or other modernization going to impact that improvement in margin year-on-year starting the first quarter of next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think we need to clarify that immediately. There's no modernization we're talking about in Latin America. We have won LTE contract. There's European modernization is one thing and that we keep separate. Then we have, of course, phases where we do more hardware and software in certain regions all the time. That is our normal business. We've always had that. So we don't mix those two.</p>
          <p>And you say it correctly that the decline at the end of the fourth quarter we will see a gradual decline of this modernization that we have in Europe. Then it's another thing what type of mix we have, if we have more hardware than software, if I make it simple between coverage and capacity, that more is depending on how our customers are purchasing at the moment. We don't confuse that with modernization because that was something special when we went for market share in a very competitive environment. I hope that clarified it.</p>

          <p>But &#x2013; sorry, Hans, I mean what about &#x2013; I mean so are you saying that what you have in Latin America is essentially new LTE contracts and so that should not have any impact on the long-term trends of your overall margin, which should start showing improvement as modernization rolls off?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Everything equal. If everything is equal and they start roll-off the modernization, then of course it should be best result, yes.</p>

          <p>Then you asked about TD-LTE. I guess you want that answer on that one as well. I just started with the other one. That the China TD-LTE then &#x2013; remember now, Ericsson has already been awarded commercial TD-LTE networks. We are running one in Hong Kong for China Mobile and we have in Australia. So we are well into this process of trialing and testing in China, and, of course, we have high ambitions to see that we get the market share there. Right now, it's still trials and still test bed, so we will see how it comes out. We have a good position on 2G on GSM, as you know, but on TD-SCDMA we have a slow &#x2013; low market share I would say.</p>
          <p>So we will be there. And we &#x2013; I think our testing is going very well. We are very satisfied with our product. So we are going to see how that turns out when the market shares are sort of distributed. I know that many of our competitors has gone out in market and talked about their fantastic market shares, but we have been instructed from the customer to not talk about any of this. So that's why I'm quiet. I'm following what my customer tells me.</p>

          <p>Richard Kramer from Arete Research is now on line with a question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hans, you said earlier that the business model for Ericsson hasn't changed and it's hard for a lot of us to look at the last year as anything but sort of a lost year with sort of very low sales or negative sales growth and decline in profits and share price and whatnot. And with Ericsson still depending on telcos for 90% plus of sales then they seem to be in increasing difficulty, have you considered from a strategy point of view whether you need to take actions to diversify your revenue base outside of the telco sector? Again, it's not just consolidating but many of them, as alluded to earlier, are really struggling.</p>
          <p>And a question for Jan, if we're seeing such good growth in smartphones, I think you cited a 1 billion unit figure in your statement, and Ericsson has such a healthy IPR position, why are we seeing only stable development in licensing and why isn't this IPR business that you've created as a separate business unit at strategy day last year growing and driving much higher earnings in networks and also partly in some of the other divisions? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First &#x2013; the first question was diversify outside of mobile operator or telecom operators. I think we already saw in the third quarter when we acquired Technicolor that we are going into other areas. We have defined three areas which we are going straight for, utilities, public safety and broadcasting. Those are using our sort of strength in technology and services. So that is happening, as we speak. How much we want to do that and in what pace, we're going to see, but definitely we're already doing it.</p>
          <p>Then the second question was about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>IPR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>IPRs. Okay. We haven't said the development; of course, we would like to have an even better development, but I think that we have a good sort of cross-licensing business because we also have many peers that also have patents. So I think we have a good cross-licensing model and that we have been working on for quite a long time. So, of course, there is going to be growth in all this. We also believe we can grow that and that's why we broke it out in order to have more focus on it.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can take one final question then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Kai Korschelt from Deutsche Bank is now on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, gentlemen, thank you, for giving me the opportunity to ask a question. I just had a quick one on Q4 on more on revenues and Networks. It looks like some of your peers are guiding for sort of flattish or certainly a sub-seasonal Q4. If I then assume that maybe some of the European activity starts to slow as well, just wondering, should we look at Q4 directionally as maybe a sub-seasonal quarter, or do you think that some of the emerging markets can compensate for that? That was my first question.</p>
          <p>The second one was just on the services business. If I exclude the network rollouts, it looks like you had very strong revenue growth double-digits but it looks like the margin is kind of stuck in a sort of 16% range. I'm just wondering, is there no operating leverage in the business and we should just assume that the margin stays around the same level, even as you continue to add contracts and business here, or are there any temporary levers that impact this? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I have a very upset Magnus here to the left of me. But anyway, Kai, if we talk first about the seasonality there, I think earlier I answered the seasonality question quite well. I think typically if we look at our company and not our competitors, if we look at our company, typically we have the fourth quarter being our biggest quarter in terms of revenue. And let's see if this quarter will be like most other quarters have been. We'll come back to that. On the services side, I think we see significant operating leverage because what we have is obviously a good growth in Managed Services and despite that we managed to keep the operating margins in Professional Services stable and also somewhat improved, so I think that the services business is really performing well, and it's also proof point that our service delivery transformation that has been ongoing for a few years but even somewhat more accelerated this year is delivering good savings and really gives us scale leverage.</p>
