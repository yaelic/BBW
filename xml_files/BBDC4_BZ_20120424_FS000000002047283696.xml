      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. After the highly unstable international scenario during the last quarter of 2011 caused by uncertainties and fears of a possible rupture of the European banking system, the first quarter of 2012 was marked by acceptable improvement in relation to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (03:20). Thanks to the measures taken by the European Central Bank to the improving liquidity.</p>
          <p>However, there is slowdown in China's growth base with fresh concerns in addition to the continuing uncertainties surrounding the domestic banking systems and the real estate sector. Economic activity in the United States turned in a surprisingly positive performance. But this was not enough to definitely dispel the uncertainties regarding the sustainability and pace of growth in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Given these risks, global growth remained weak and two significant impacts are worth mentioning here. International decrease remained high, and average commodity price has also been solid during the course of the year, despite the short-term pressures, especially agricultural commodities and oil.</p>
          <p>In this global scenario, the Brazilian government has been implementing measures to accelerate a common rule, notably continuation of the cycle of interest rates swaps which started in the second half of 2011, partial to that of the prudential &#x2013; market prudential measures adopted since December 2010, fiscal and tax entities for construction and industry, and interventions in the foreign exchange market to help the domestic industries face the fierce competition from abroad and to contain the reduction in demand. Considering all this, we believe the Brazilian economy will respond positively. With this growth that is picking up in the coming periods, which should be even in the most ahead. Bradesco's first quarter results <mark type="ph" /> decidedly (05:33) reflect this macro-economic scenario.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide two, we recorded adjusted net income of BRL2.845 billion, 3.9% more than in the same period last year. We consider these results <mark type="ph" /> self-supporting (05:54) and <mark type="ph" /> lean (05:56) expectation. Our total assets came to BRL709 billion and adjusted net interest income increased by 14.2% over the first quarter of 2011 to reach BRL10.695 billion.</p>
          <p>On slide three, we'd like to draw your attention to assets under management, which ended the quarter at BRL1.087 trillion, an 18.3% increasing over March 2011. It is also worth noting our efficiency ratio which remains flat over March 2011 at 42.7%, and recorded up 30 basis points over this December 2011.</p>
          <p>On to slide four, we show the reconciliation between our book net income and adjusted net income in their respective periods. This quarter the only nonrecurring event was the provision for civil contingencies which totaled BRL86 million. Adjusting for this event, our book net income increased from BRL2.793 billion to an adjusted net income of BRL2.845 billion. Also on this slide, you can see that our return on average assets came to around 21% in both the booked and adjusted net income <mark type="indiscernible" /> (07:46).</p>
          <p>Slide five shows our historical proceeds of our quarterly net income. Income growth in the first quarter was mainly due to a higher net interest income as well as a reduction in personnel and administrative expenses, due to the stabilization of investments in the organic growth cycle, partially offset by the increasing in the provisions for loan loss as a result of the expected increase in delinquency.</p>
          <p>The increase of our net income over the first quarter of 2011 was also mainly due to upturn in net interest income, in turn due to the higher volume of operations, higher fee income and increased revenues from our insurance group, partially offset by a higher operating expenses. Personnel and administrative came mainly from the investment in the organic growth cycle. It is worth nothing that our earnings per share for the last 12 months increased by 8.8% from BRL2.72 to BRL2.96.</p>
          <p>Slide six show our efficiency ratio with improvement this quarter. In addition to our continuous efforts to control expenses and stabilization of investments in the organic growth cycle, this improvement was boosted by the reduction in administrative expenses, in turn due to lower expense from third-party services, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (09:49) maintenance and repairs, and advertise.</p>
          <p>The reduction in personnel expense loss primarily due to the higher concentration of occasions in the first quarter, and lower expense from management and employee profit sharing. Other events that helped into our efficiency ratio were the upturn in the net interest income and fee income. Thanks to the higher volume of business resulting from the investments in accelerating organic growth.</p>
          <p>As we can see on the slide seven, our total assets came to BRL790 billion, a growth of over BRL114 billion or 17% over March 2011. Return on average assets came to 1.5%, while adjusted return on the average assets stood at 21.4%. The Basel Ratio closed the period at 15% <mark type="ph" /> slashing (11:08) both the quarterly and 12 months comparison. If we included the subordinates financial bills ratified by the Central Bank in April, the ratio would be 15.5%.</p>
          <p>Slide eight shows the relative share of our main operations in net income. The highlight in the quarter was the increase in the relative share of securities, mainly due to higher trading gains. In regarding to loans, the reduction was caused by increasing delinquency. The NOL comparison, the highlight was the increase in the relative share of our insurance group to 32% of our net income due to the good performance of segments this quarter. Concerning loan provisions, the reduction reflects the increase in delinquents.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide nine, unrealized gains total a substantial BRL16.130 billion in the first quarter, an increase of BRL5.512 billion over December 2011, basically due to the appreciation of some of our investments, especially Cielo's shares, fixed income, securities and assets. Once again, I would like to remind you that these figures do not include the potential goodwill from our <mark type="ph" /> on-off (12:55) profits in the total amount of BRL3 billion.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, we show the evolution of our net interest income from both non-interest and interest earnings operations. The interest earnings portion increased by 2.4% in the quarter, largely due to the upturn in average business volume. The non-interest earnings portion recorded higher trading gains made in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 11, as I already mentioned, the interest earnings portion of net interest income increased by 2.4% in the quarter. Most of this growth came from the higher volume of business, which maintains the annualized net interest margin at 7.6%, as in the previous quarter. We believe this net interest income will continue to record nominal growth, given the addition of new business, although the net interest margin should suffer a slight reduction.</p>
          <p>Slide 12, these are the breakdown of the interest earning portion of the net interest income. Securities recorded most growth in the quarter, including gains from derivative financial instruments used in the management of our fixed commercial portfolio. It is also worth mentioning the performance of insurance activities which recorded period growth of 10.5% partially due to the improvement in the stock markets. In the comparison between the first quarter of 2012 and the same period last year, gross margin growth was mainly due to the increased volume of business, in turn reflecting the expansion of the customer base.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, as we can see, this quarter the gross credit margins, the gray area, increased by 0.3% to BRL7.181 billion, sustained by higher business volume, but partially offset by the reduction in <mark type="indiscernible" /> <mark type="ph" /> expense (15:49). The red area shows the provision for loan loss which increased to 43% of the gross credit margins due to the period of time in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:05), thus substantially reducing the net credit margins. In the annual comparison, the 7% increase in the net credit margins was mostly a result of the higher business volume, partially due to the expansion of the consumer base.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 14, we can see that our expanded loan portfolio totaled BRL351 billion in March 2012, 1.5% up in the quarter, then there are 14.6% increase when compared to March 2011. These increases were mainly due to the increase in loans to micro business and SMEs, which moved up by 2.4% in the quarter, and 20.6% in the ad hoc comparison.</p>
          <p>The slight quarterly variation in the large corporate portfolio was partially due to the appreciation of the real against the dollar, which impacted foreign currency loan operations, and to a <mark type="indiscernible" /> <mark type="ph" /> March- (17:25) related operations with <mark type="ph" /> spreadsheets (17:28), including debentures and promissory notes. In the ad hoc comparison, the highlights were mortgage loans, overdraft accounts, export financing and capital market related operations, with credit risk basically comprising debentures and promissory notes. In relation to the other segments, individual loans growth was constrained, partially as a result of macro-prudential measures adopted at the beginning 2011.</p>
          <p>On slide 15, this quarter our total delinquency ratio for loans overdue by more than 90 days went up 20 basis points over December 2011 to 4.1%, mainly due to increase in loans to micro-business, SMEs and individuals.</p>
          <p>Delinquents in the large corporate segment remain stable in the last 12 months. As we mentioned last quarter, an increase in delinquents in beginning of each year is expected, primarily due to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:51) in the individuals loans segment as a result of concentrated <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:57). We believe that this indicator has virtually reached its peak, and we expected it to remain stable in the second quarter, given the expected increase in the pace of economic growth, and in the second half of the year. And also taking into account the reduction on the SELIC base rate, we anticipated a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:27) liquidity in delinquency.</p>
          <p>Slide 16, this slide shows our delinquency ratio for loans overdue by between 61 and 90 days. If you look at the graph, you can see that this ratio increased by 20 basis points in terms of total delinquents in the quarter, which is partially due to beginning of year seasonality in the individuals portfolio. When we look at our short-term delinquents between <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:06) times of reductions in overdue loans.</p>
          <p>The slide 17, despite the slight upturn in delinquency in the quarter, provision revenues have remained comfortable. In fact, we have a surplus of forbidden in relation to the amount required by the Central Bank, assuming the maintenance of 12 months to us in net loss ratios as from March 2011, we have booked provisions in excess of BRL9.6 billion in relation to expect gross growth in this next 11 months, the noted part of the blue line. We are keeping BRL12.6 billion in relation to loss net of the coverage, the dotted part in the purple line for the events.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 18, reinforcing what we mentioned in regard to the digital slides, here you can see the coverage ratio of the allowance for loan loss in relation to press over gain by margin 90 and 60 days which remains very profitable.</p>
          <p>In the month, the height for Brazilian bank, on the graph overdue by more than 60 days the ratio 147% and credits overdue by more than 90 days the coverage ratio is 182%.</p>
          <p>Look at the slide 19, we can see that the first quarter fee income total BRL4.118 billion, 0.8% up on the industry most mainly due to the higher revenue from asset management, underwriting operations and brokerage operations. The annual comparison highlights where revenue is coming, cards <mark type="ph" /> reaching basis point (22:47) by 3%, underwriting operations, consortium and checking account.</p>
          <p>Fee income moved up by 17.2% basically due to the increase in customers cards portfolio, the net addition of around 2 million new account holders and the increase our card base with 12.4 million new best interest cards.</p>
          <p>Slide 20, operating expense fell by 8% over the fourth quarter of 2011. The huge reduction in personnel expenses was mostly due to the non-residual portion which was impacted by lower expenses from management and employees profit sharing. The 12-months increase in personnel expenses was primarily due to the impact of <mark type="indiscernible" /> <mark type="ph" /> corrected by gain (23:53) agreement. The demand increase in the workforce of 8,300 employees. It is always worth mentioning that expansion for our workforce is concentrated in our sales force due to both organic growth and improved segmentation.</p>
          <p>Slide 21, administrative expense fell by 7.6% in the quarter, primarily due to the reduction in expenses from third-party service, transports, and maintenance and repairs, and also to the seasonal effects of advertising expenses in the fourth quarter. These reductions was due to the stabilization of investments in organic growth cycles and the termination of the partnership with Brazilian postal service, Banco Postal in the compares with the same period last years, the upside was compatible with the expansion of the first network and the consequent increase along in recent quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 22, this slides shows revenues from our insurance, pension plans and saving bond activities, which fell by 15.4% in the first quarter mainly due to the concentration of contributions reported by the pension finance segment in the previous quarter. General comparison overall growth came to 20% led by the life and pension plan helped in savings bond segment. First quarter net income totaled BRL905 million or 0.2% growth on the previous quarter, is 18.9% as in the last 12 months, mainly due to the upturn in revenues, the reduction in the claims ratios and the improved financial position.</p>
          <p>Slide 23, this slide shows the main figures from our insurance activities. A combined ratio recorded in the first quarter was 85.6%, 200 basis points over the previous quarter, basically due to the increase in the claims ratio and reduced revenues resulting from the concentration of pension plan contribution in the previous quarter as I have just mentioned. Financial asset totaled BRL122 billion, 19.4% fell from the last 12 months. Technical provisions stood at BRL107 billion, BRL94 billion of which related to life and pension plans.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we believe we have a quarter of good results, many thanks to the upgrades in net interest income, due to the higher volume of operations and increase in the customer base and the higher rating gains and the reduction in the operating expenses, which once again had a positive impact in our depreciation ratios.</p>
          <p>Despite the uptrend in delinquency ratio this quarter, we had maintained high <mark type="ph" /> coverage (28:04) levels. We also keep our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:07) high on the <mark type="ph" /> clutch (28:08) of our loan portfolio, supported by our policy of appropriate and consistent process, guarantees and <mark type="ph" /> impressive (28:17) evaluation instruments. While we're still on the subject of loan operations, we expect a much higher loan growth for the second quarter. However, we expect a more accelerating expansion on the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Despite the times of the global economic slowdown, we remain focused on leveraging our operations in both the banking and insurance segment and are responsible in the near contributing to the democratization of spread and sustainable development. Bradesco Brazil's is positive long-term expectations for Brazil, representing by its strategy of increasing investments with an organic and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:15).</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question comes from Mr. Mario Pierry, Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions. One is with regards to delinquency ratios. I think you said that you expect delinquency ratios to have peaked in the first quarter. And you expect the gradual improvements now through the end of the year. I wanted to understand what makes you comfortable you're saying this, if you can give us any color, in which segments have you seen stronger deterioration in delinquencies. Was that in vehicles or credit cards or what segments? And why do you feel confident that delinquencies will start to improve because today, we just got data from one of your competitors showing that early delinquencies for them has too risen.</p>
          <p>And then my second question has to do with the recent announcements that the bank has been making in regards to reducing credit spreads, probably following what the state-owned banks are doing. I'd like to hear from your perspective then what will this mean for the bank? Does it mean faster loan growth? Does it mean lower profitability in the future? If you can just give us an idea then why are you following the state-owned banks. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for the questions, Mario. About delinquency, we understand that our delinquency ratio for the next &#x2013; for this quarter, the second quarter, we expect that probably would be stable. It's near of the peak. We understand that if we have an increase to 0.1%. And we expect for the second half, considering the economic environment, the actions that our government did in reducing the SELIC rate and probably the economy will be more &#x2013; increase the volume. We expect that our delinquency ratio for the second half will start to have a gradual decrease. We understand this because we're looking for our portfolio, was the behavior in the last quarter that the individual segments was &#x2013; we had a zero increase because the seasonality. And now we understand that the delinquencies starting to be stable and then probably will start decrease.</p>
          <p>The SME segment that we had a little more increase in the last quarter, the impact was the mix of the portfolio in the last &#x2013; we did a huge investment in our <mark type="ph" /> structure support (33:11), improved our participation in this segment. And the more <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:20) SMEs, the SMEs that has revenue less than BRL30 million, we increased our participation in this segment. And now the average of &#x2013; the significant part of this segment is a little higher than the average of the portfolio. Then, we had a little increase, but when we analyzed the numbers, the short delinquency ratio is reducing and we expect that probably we are now very close to the stabilization in SMEs in the same way. And looking for the corporate portfolio, it is stable. The delinquency is stable, it is at 12 months.</p>
          <p>We don't have any specific problem with any products. In credit card now it's more stable. And the car loans portfolio, since 2010, Bradesco is very select or very &#x2013; we were very conservative in this segment because the margins was very thin, and sometimes for us it was not possible to do the operations and the &#x2013; because the risk was too representative or was more &#x2013; for us, we understand that we only added risk and not profitability for the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Then, we understand now that this &#x2013; the <mark type="ph" /> percentage (35:37) for the delinquency ratio for the <mark type="ph" /> outer (35:27) portfolio is this quarter the stabilization, and for the second half it probably will start a gradual reduction. And about the expressed reduction &#x2013; or about the recent measures that we're <mark type="ph" /> busy (36:07) for reducing the rates for some product lines, we understand that the additional volume that we expect in these products, with the new rates, they will compensate the reduction in the markets. Then we expect that the effects in the revenue, in the profitability will be probably in there also. The volume will gain a compensation for the reduction in the rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me just follow up then. When you mentioned the NPLs in the individual segments increased a little partially due to seasonality, but can you be more specific in which segments did you see a worse deterioration? Was it like personal loans, credit cards, mortgages, or vehicles or even payroll loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, normally, the credit card and car loans is a little higher than the other products. But the &#x2013; we understand that is near stabilization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Mr. Daniel Abut with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Luiz Carlos, a couple of questions. One, on loan growth which you have posted in the first quarter, it touched below 15% year-on-year. You said in your closing remarks that you expect this to pick up slightly in the second quarter and more pronounced in the second half. Do you think that the pickup in pace in the second half could be strong enough to still allow you to keep your guidance of 18% to 22% loan growth or that guidance is looking a little too optimistic? That would be question number one.</p>
          <p>And question number two, the pace of SELIC declines has accelerated; we are now at 9%. And you &#x2013; and your economists are expecting that this will continue &#x2013; I think you are forecasting 8.5% by the end of the year. The speculations surrounding the need to modify the pricing of the Poupan&#xE7;a is back on the table. So could you comment on any information you have, any negotiations that the Banking Association have been participating as part of deciding with the government &#x2013; together with the government what the future of the pricing of the savings account will be? And in connection with that, if there's also discussion around the <mark type="ph" /> direct (37:48) lending rule that affect the savings accounts in the sense that you have to dedicate a big portion of them to mortgage lending also at a pricing that is related to the same current pricing of the Poupan&#xE7;a.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Daniel, for the questions. About the loan growth, our expectation for the loan growth in the first half was that the year will start in a more slow movement. It was the effect that we had in the second half in 2011 in the European crisis. And the Brazil economy start the year in a more slow movement.</p>
          <p>And the growth that we had in the first quarter is very close in our expectations. And we expect that during the year, the growth in the economy will increase quarter-by-quarter and we are maintaining our guidance for the year. We understand that we can match the guidance because we did a huge investment last year, including our network around the country, bringing more than 1,000 new <mark type="ph" /> deals made (39:22) and we increased our employees in more than 9,400 new employees, most of &#x2013; the majority in the sales force. And we understand that we can maintain our guidance for this year.</p>
          <p>About this SELIC rating, this continues the decline &#x2013; probably something needs to do about the saving account because the competition with other products. But we do not have &#x2013; Bradesco, no, we are not having any discussion about that, and probably this is something that the Central Bank or the government is thinking about. But we are not having any negotiations.</p>

          <p>And our next question comes from Mr. Jorge Kuri with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Jorge Kuri from Morgan Stanley. I have two questions, as well. Can you be a bit more specific in explaining the mechanics of the rate costs that you have implemented to March, what the state banks are doing? What percentage of the clients are going to be able to access these new rates? What percentage of the loans are going to be priced under the new rates? What is the average reduction in spreads that you expect from this, and &#x2013; at the end of the year? And then, what is the corresponding additional growth that you need on loans in order to fully offset the impact? Just trying to understand what the breakeven is, and to the extent that these are going to be widely offered to clients.</p>
          <p>That's the first question. The second question is, on your SME asset quality and I know you alluded to it earlier, but, I guess we also, this picture play out at one of your competitors where they accelerated the SME business quite significantly last year, only to end up with a significant NPL increases. And if I look at how things are playing out for you, your SME volumes are up 21% year-on-year, which is very significant by all measures, especially considering an economy that over the last 12 months probably grew 3%.</p>
          <p>And your NPLs in that product are up from 3.5% a year ago, to 4.2% now and thinking that the math actually works against you, right, where when you're accelerating the volumes, you would expect the NPL ratio to look better just because the math the way it works, however it's actually looking worse. So losses are running at, in my view, at kind of like very scary levels. And again we saw this picture with one of your competitors. So can you help us understand exactly what's happening and what level of confidence you have that &#x2013; this is the right thing to do and that we're not going to see NPLs continue to rise in the SME business? Thanks</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Jorge, for the questions. About the rate cuts, something &#x2013; is a new thing that's seen in the market, the Brazilian market, in the competition between the banks is something helps for system. And Bradesco decide to adopt some measures. It started yesterday the new rates in some products. We feel like some products, that we understand that &#x2013; we could offer good opportunities for our clients but we don't have now what will be the level of the expectations &#x2013; the acceptance of the products. But we expect that this &#x2013; probably the reduction in the rates that we are offering will be &#x2013; will have a compensation with the volume that we're expecting in this product. Then we understand that probably the effects for the measures that we adopted will be neutral in the results.</p>
          <p>About the SMEs, <mark type="indiscernible" /> <mark type="ph" /> delinquents (45:52), we understand that the increase that we have in the ratio is because the mix that we have, if you look only the portfolio of SME loans, we &#x2013; during these, the last two years, we are improving our participation in the SME markets. We maintain our aggressive policy and a very strong control, our credit department and <mark type="ph" /> investment (46:26) department. We never flexible-ize the deposit for to acquire more market share.</p>
          <p>And we understand that the increase that we are having is because the improvement in the participation of the SMEs that has less than BRL30 million revenues that we say the Brazil SMEs portfolio. Then this portfolio has the delinquents are a little more higher than the other SMEs companies, the bigger SME companies. Then this movement is increasing the delinquency but with only this segment.</p>
          <p>We understand and are analyzing what the portfolio, what happened in the last quarter and what's happening now. The short delinquents, the 15 days, 30 days is reducing. Then we understand that same the other segments, as compared with the individuals, we expect that probably we will be near the peak. And it's like we say, we said that, we expect that we are near taking the total ratio for delinquents and considering the economy for the next half, the goal that we expect and the effects of the decline of the SELIC rates in the system, probably we will have some effect of this, to such a gradual reduction in the NPLs ratio. And this is &#x2013; I'm talking about the Bradesco numbers, not to talk about the systems. And this is why we understand that the SMEs had a little increase, but considering the &#x2013; what we have in the portfolio now, probably we're near to the stabilization, the delinquent ratio in this segment, for us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the explanation on the asset quality. That was very helpful and just to push a little bit on the first part. And what &#x2013; I mean at this point, I'm assuming all of this is very preliminary and maybe you don't have the specific answers, but your best guess today is, over the next 12 months what percentage of your new loans are going to be originated under the new rates that you've published?</p>

          <p>And our next question comes from Mr. Carlos Macedo with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning, Angelotti. Good morning, gentlemen. I have a couple of quick questions. One is a follow-up on Daniel Abut's question on loan growth. You were mentioning that you're confident that you're going to be able to deliver within your guidance. That would imply 6% to 7% growth; 6% at the low end, 7% at the high end, for the next three quarters. You haven't really done that since 2008 and I was just wondering would this be you gaining market share because of your new presence? Would you be able to tell us what kind of &#x2013; what exact products you would be more aggressive in and what would enable you to grow as fast as was basically four years ago, five years ago when the conditions were significantly different?</p>
          <p>And the second question is related to your expenses which were surprisingly good that is, I guess &#x2013; the question I had is how much of that is related to ceasing payments for the Postal Bank since the franchise went to Banco do Brasil, in the beginning of the year? How much of the improvements related to that and how much of your expenses are related to the amortization of the purchase of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:19) in Rio last year, which presumably start &#x2013; you start amortizing early this year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for the question, Carlos. About the loan growth, we maintain our guidance that we expect that we can reach the &#x2013; our targets. If the markets grow around 15%, that the total 15%, probably will grow &#x2013; probably we can have a little increase in our market share, which is the &#x2013; we have the targets, but something that we are working hard for to reach.</p>
          <p>We are &#x2013; some products that we expect or we are not aggressive but we are investing in increasing our market share, our participation is mortgage, it's something that we expect to grow higher. And payroll loans, another higher growth that we expect. And in our guidance, we estimated the highest growth that we expect to have because this is a very interesting product for us, talking about the costs, the reduction that we have, considering the effects of the Postal Bank, is around BRL350 million, was our expenses which is last year.</p>
          <p>Then this year, since January, we don't have more these effects. But one party of these clients that in the past used the Banco Postal, now they can use Bradesco base or the Bradesco correspondence.</p>
          <p>Then probably we are paying now, one part of our extension with fees is for &#x2013; because the immigration that these clients for the Bradesco correspondence. But the fee that we pay now is cheapest to them that we pay for the Banco Postal in the past.</p>
          <p>This is one effect. The <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:19) amortization is the effect of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:22) the BRL60 million, is the total effect <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:27). The amortization is paying millions now, we start with BRL10 million per month. It's the effects of that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:39) that we have now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so essentially the BRL170 million reduction you had in outsourcing fee expenses in the first quarter in regards &#x2013; with respect to the fourth quarter around, you're saying roughly around BRL70 million, BRL$80 million were driven by lower payments made related to the Postal Bank, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we had a reduction, but we needed to improve our &#x2013; the 1,000 new branch that we did the investment last year. One part of that was to cover the Banco Postal agreement. Then one part of the cost that we have, are with personnel and now with the structures of the new branches is because this Banco Postal agreement that finish it. We understand that the effect, considering all the Banco Postal agreements, it has been giving this year is probably neutral but we expect that the new branches now will start to improve their revenues. And we will have more &#x2013; a better efficiency ratio until the end of the year and with the maturity of these investments, we expect that for the next year, we will continue in improving our efficiency ratio considering this new structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and just one question with the strong growth that you had in building out the structure, now you have over 104,000 employees here in Brazil. Ita&#xFA; reported today they have 96 with a similar structure maybe not as many small points of sales as you have. Do you think the general structure that you have, the size is well-portioned to your business? Do you think that you might see some cutting of expenses as you go forward and then try to &#x2013; and basically grow with this business and find that maybe you don't need as many heads or the head count might be too big. Is there any kind of cutting that you see in the future or do you think it's just ongoing from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did a huge investment the last two, three years, in our organic growth, because for us, we don't have opportunity to buy other banks. And with the fact, is that we only in our own structure. And now the organic growth cycle is capitalized &#x2013; the structure that we have, we need to consider that we have, one part of this <mark type="ph" /> influence (57:44) is they're working the insurance company that is the biggest insurance company in the country. Then one part of our structure is our <mark type="ph" /> provisions (57:55) in the insurance company. And in considering our structure, we did a huge investment in the segmentation and we are improving our structure. Then now, our organic cycle is stabilizing and the structures that are in place that we have now more &#x2013; will be more stable and you need to consider that our sales network is bigger and is broader than the other competitors.</p>

          <p>Hi, hello everyone. My question is concerning banking fees. We have seen local news commenting that public owned banks are about to announce or now planning to announce or have already announced a reduction in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:59) of management fees. I was wondering if you could comment on that and what would be Bradesco's strategy to react if this movement really happens? And what would be the impact for fees growth in &#x2013; during this year, I mean 2012. Thank you.</p>

And the Bradesco, try to maintain a competitive players in the market for all times. And any new changes of you analyzing this <mark type="ph" /> problem (59:55) issue, we understand that we need to change our policy adopted.</p>
          <p>And about the fees, if they grow, we are maintaining our guidance for this year. We understand that we can reach the &#x2013; what we expected and we understand that probably the guidance that we have is 18% to 12% (sic) [22%] (01:00:26), probably will be next to the right level for this year.</p>

          <p>Yes, my questions have been answered but I think there was one question outstanding which wasn't answered, which was the question that Daniel asked about the potential changes to Poupan&#xE7;a, given that SELIC is going much lower. I think it would be interesting to hear if you had any comments on that, in terms of what you think had happened. Would you expect this to maybe change to a function of SELIC? Or would you expect this to be taxed or how do you see this issue going forward given that SELIC is now approaching the critical point of 8.5%?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a quick question kind of as you mentioned the insurance business has been a big driver of like employee growth and whatnot. I just kind of wanted to get your insights into the ROEs and earnings in that business unit going forward, that'd be really helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. We understand that we have a lot of opportunity in the insurance business here in Brazil because if you analyze, normally, the relation between GDP and premiums is very similar. Then if you look to Brazil compare with other countries, U.S. is the first in premiums and first in GDP. Japan is the third in premiums and second GDP. And Brazil, the position that Brazil has is still number six in premiums &#x2013; number six in GDP and it is 15 in premiums. Then, we understand that probably in the future, the position in premiums will be more close of the position in GDP. Then Bradesco Seguros is the biggest insurance company in Brazil. And we understand that we have a <mark type="ph" /> deeply show (01:04:25) if you consider the synergy that we have between the insurance company and the financial <mark type="ph" /> embedded (01:04:35) in the bank. We have a lot of opportunity inside of our client bases. And the synergy between the companies, we try to increase our operations or our penetration in our clients, offering more products. And Bradesco Seguros has the &#x2013; a complete portfolio of products that we can offer package as part of the companies, considering products that they can offer for their employees here, because normally companies offer for their employees additional backshop benefits, and the Bradesco Seguros has a very good products and pension plans, health and the dental care, dental <mark type="ph" /> and life (01:05:34).</p>
          <p>Then we understand that Bradesco Seguros can maintain their position, that is around 25% of the total premiums in Brazil insurance comes from Bradesco Seguros. And then now the ROEs are around the 26%. Probably we'll maintain this level for this year. Around 26%, 27%, probably this will be the level that we will maintain for 2012.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Hello, everyone. I have two questions. The first one, can you tell us what your economists say about the &#x2013; his forecast in terms of consumer leverage for this year and for next year, particularly with regards to debt service into income ratio? Do you know if he sees that improving or still deteriorating or stabilize at current levels?</p>
          <p>And my second question is regarding your ROE trend. I mean, in the quarter you had a 20% return on equity. Considering that we have margins coming down or interest rates lower for longer, probably delinquency is structurally higher than what it used to be, a potential for some spreads compression. Do you think that your ROE trend is upwards, flat, or downwards from these levels over the next two years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. About the consumer leverage, we understand that &#x2013; our economist &#x2013; we understand that probably we'll consider the consumer commitment that we have here is stable. And we analyzed this number that this is stable until now, around the 20%, <mark type="ph" /> a little (01:08:08) increase by 22%. We understand that we will maintain stable at this level. Considering what we expect for the maturity of the loans, the average maturity for the loans, that's probably will continues increasing in the &#x2013; for the next periods.</p>
          <p>And the rates, the interest rate is declining and it will continue declining for the future. Then these things will help to maintain stable, this is a commitment of the <mark type="ph" /> families (01:08:57) or the leverage. And this is something that we analyze and we maintain in a constant analysis. And we understand that we are not having any problem or any risk now considering this environment that we have. And if you look for the <mark type="ph" /> better (01:09:18) future <mark type="ph" /> today (01:09:19), then the financing rates in Brazil, we are in the best level in our history and we will continue. And we expect that for the next five years the unemployment ratio will maintain a similar level.</p>
          <p>About the ROE, the trends for this year, we understand that probably we'll expect to maintain around the 21%, 20%, and for the next year probably we will be similar. But if you consider more long term, we expected that the competition, the more capital requirements that we had for the &#x2013; considering the rules that we have for the future, the Basel III and the reduction in the margins, depression in the margins, probably the ROE will be around 18%, 20%, then we will start to decline for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a follow-up on the first question. I mean, the &#x2013; I think the issue that I struggle with is the fact that it seems that you are not assuming that debt service to income can actually improve in the coming years, and so it sounds like we're actually having a sort of a structural upward shift in delinquency. For your guys in the Brazilian market, of course I do acknowledge that I think you're doing much better than peers in terms of your asset quality because of the profile for loan portfolio and quality of origination. But &#x2013; so is it fair to say that Brazilian banks have reached, let's say, a new level of delinquency, that probably we are not going to see the levels that we used to see like two years ago and the system might have to get used to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will talk about Bradesco. We maintain our price policy very consistent and we analyze or we try to maintain the quality in our portfolio in a best level and the whole time we are analyzing the markets and the <mark type="ph" /> basis (01:11:47), trying to anticipate any base movement or any new risk that we can have in the system. We understand that the growth that we are having in the last three years, we had a zero increase in our delinquency ratio. But if you're looking 2008 or 2009, the ratio was higher than what we have now.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:12:24), if you're considering in the future that the economy will continue growing, the SELIC rate will decline, the unemployment rates will continue to stable. We understand that probably the delinquency ratio for the future will start to reduce plus the economy will be more stable, it will continues growing. We expect for the future that probably the delinquency ratio will be lower, considering the expectation for the declining &#x2013; the SELIC rates for the future and the margins. And probably, in our <mark type="ph" /> final debt (01:13:15) we will have a reduction in the margins and we will have a compensation with lower delinquency ratio and with additional volumes in the portfolio, then this is how you expect to &#x2013; the volumes will give a compensation for the reduction in the margins and it's in additional probably with the lower SELIC rates and this delinquency ratio probably will start to decline.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Ms. Regina Sanchez with Ita&#xFA; BBA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions. The first one is that when we looked at changes in shareholders' equity during the first quarter, we note that there was a positive impact of BRL639 million related to adjustments for the available for sale securities portfolio. And we also noticed on slide nine that you show in the presentation that there was unrealized results <mark type="ph" /> that were on top (1:14:37) also in the quarter of more than BRL5 billion, and a part of this is related to investments. But also in securities, I mean, it went up by more than BRL2 billion.</p>
          <p>My question is this gains, if at some point, they will be applied in shareholders' equity, if you expect to see that, for instance, in the next quarter because we already see this increase in shareholders' equity in the insurance business. And will this help the Basel index of the bank and how much this would be impacting the capitalization ratio of Bradesco? And then I'll ask my second question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you, Regina, for the question. One part of the strength that we have in the equity is sort of <mark type="ph" /> straight (01:15:36) that the treasury operations and the bonds, they are classified in the <mark type="ph" /> &#x2013; as able for sales (01:15:47), then they have all the <mark type="ph" /> impaction (01:15:51) on the equity. And according in the future the periods of the maturity of these bonds, we will recognize the gains during their life.</p>
          <p>This is about the bonds that &#x2013; the effect that we have in the bank. The effect that we have in the insurance company is we &#x2013; the impact, we don't have it now in the bank. It is only in the insurance company because we have different accounting procedures because the Bradesco Seguros is subordinate to the SUSEP, is the regulator for insurance in Brazil. And their accounting principles, they now classified &#x2013; Bradesco is an insurance <mark type="ph" /> with a (01:17:05) new classification for a portfolio of bonds that were in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:17:13).</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> How to maturities (01:17:18), they changed the classification for available-for-sale and the Bradesco Insurance had a zero increasing in their average. In the next quarter, in June, Bradesco Bank will adopt the same classifications in our balance and these effects of the &#x2013; that we have in the Bradesco Insurance equity will be reflecting Bradesco Bank. Then we expect probably around a 0.5% in the tier 2 we would expect 0.5% increase in the tier 2 ratio, Basel ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And my next question regarding this recent announcement of lower interest rate for loans made by the most large Brazilian banks, including Bradesco, do you think this means that competition is increasing? And because banks who used to pay I mean huge amounts in bidding offers during auctions to acquire payroll accounts? I mean do you believe that the amount paid in these auctions or to acquire their loans will reduce from now on as a result of this higher competition, I mean, offering lowering rates directly to clients? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The competition is very high here in the system, but in our system, for a long time and probably the effects for the future will continue increasing and probably we will have some pressures in the margins for the future. This specific effect for the payroll loans portfolio, we're considering that is up, competition effect and probably we'll &#x2013; we expect that will continue increasing and this is what we understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on Regina's question. So in the second quarter, we should expect a corresponding decline in the stock of &#x2013; I mean, less capital gains in held to maturity that in this quarter was around BRL6.5 billion equivalently increase that you are going to record in your shareholders' equity and the tier 2. So in effect, there's going to be a reclassification because it appears that there is a discrepancy between the timing at which of these two recognitions had been taking place between insurance and the bank. And I just wanted to make sure that this increase in the equity in the insurance is already reflected in your unrealized capital gains and the held to maturity that you report in the first quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Boris, I was only checking the information. Remember that we gave you the BRL16 billion unrealized gains, not considering the additional number that we classify in available for sale in the insurance company will be reflected in the next quarter when we have the alignment in &#x2013; for the accounting procedure, then probably we will have then increasing the unrealized gains in June. And the effects in the Basel ratio will be reflected in the bank in June, it will be 0.5% in the tier 2 capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. Thank you. And maybe just a follow-up question regarding the issue of the rate cuts that you have announced. And one of your competitors apparently is awarding the rate cuts to borrowers that have had certain problems either paying their loans or had higher rates of utilization of their credit lines.</p>
          <p>Now you seem to be cutting rates at a point where you still acknowledge that your non-performing loans in SMEs and also in consumer are at relatively high levels. What safeguards are you putting in place for these rate cuts not to attract as a magnet for un-creditworthy clients given that you don't have a positive credit bureau on Brazil because there is a risk of moral hazard associated with these rates cuts given the point in the cycle where these cuts have taken place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This reduction or this cut in the rate is a new changes in the system is &#x2013; but considering that the measure that we adopted there is we have the minimum rates for a specific conditions in the &#x2013; that considering the term and the risk or return. We have attended these new changes in the system and we expect that probably the effects that will have as far as these measures, the reduction in the margins, we will have a <mark type="ph" /> compensation (1:23:35) with the <mark type="ph" /> form (01:23:34) and in the operations that we expect more volume and will &#x2013; probably the effects will be in the <mark type="ph" /> autumn (01:23:43) in the results.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a quick follow-up in terms of the insurance business. I mean you mentioned after I've put myself in the queue for the question that do you expect insurance returns to stay at around the 26%, but is there not going to be a headwind here if we have a lower for longer SELIC rate? How do you expect to compensate for the lowest SELIC rate? Surely that will impact your insurance returns negatively, so what do you foresee as a way to offset a lower for longer SELIC rate. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Victor, wait a little minute. I was talking to Marco Rossi. Expected &#x2013; has a compensation lower <mark type="ph" /> payments (01:25:37) ratios, more &#x2013; and increased the productivity and with cost control and increase the sales, more &#x2013; high sales and revenues, we expected to improve the efficiency ratio of the company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, we all time try to improve the synergy between the companies and we understand that we have a lot of opportunity inside the bank for improving the participation of the product &#x2013; the insurance products in the Bradesco clients base.</p>

          <p>And our next question comes from Mr. Jorge Kuri with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Sorry for taking too much of your time, but just a follow-up on &#x2013; I think a couple of people have raised an issue about their Poupan&#xE7;a and I just wanted to get some clarity on this. I was under the impression that in 2009 when SELIC rates got to 8.75% and we started to see some movements in &#x2013; out of time deposits and into savings deposits. The government changed the rules of the game by taxing savings accounts, specifically those accounts that <mark type="ph" /> are high enough (01:27:09) to move from time deposits to saving deposits, so the large accounts, the smaller accounts don't really have access to it. And the taxation depends on the level of SELIC. If I remember correctly, the accounts were tax <mark type="ph" /> absent (01:27:26) at SELIC above 10.5% and then as SELIC came down, there was a gradual step-up in taxation until you get to full taxation with SELIC at 7.25%. That is to be in place, right? I mean doesn't this solve the issue of the low SELIC and the dynamics between savings in Brazil? Am I correct in this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:27:55) probably when we have a little more space, probably around 8.5% is the level that we will have stabilization additional at the lower level that we can have for the SELIC ratio, but don't have any cannibalization between the product if you're considering saving accounts and <mark type="ph" /> funding accounts (01:28:21) and the other products. Then probably, our &#x2013; something will be adopted for to avoid this problem. But we don't have now how to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:28:39) &#x2013; what will be this new measure is to be a new banks or something, we don't have now how to give you this information. But probably something will be adopted for to avoid this problem because the changes is probably is that the SELIC rates will continue to decline <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:29:04).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess that's my point. I'm asking you &#x2013; I mean my point is that the government already did something to avoid that. In 2009, they introduced taxation on Poupan&#xE7;a and so my question is, I mean you didn't mention this in your response to the previous two questions, so I was just wondering if that is not in place anymore and that was just in 2009. But as far as I remember, that was a permanent change on the taxation of Poupan&#xE7;a, so there is already a solution in place, which is Poupan&#xE7;a is taxed. So my question is am I correct in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably now, in the sense in 2000 &#x2013; we had a &#x2013; we are rising the lower level but we retained it with increasing the SELIC rate. And the problem now they are looking for some new procedure that will be more sustainable for the future. But we don't have now how to give you what will be the new products or what will be the new measure is something that is probably the Central Bank and the government, they are taking care of &#x2013; or they are having this discussion about that for the &#x2013; about the measures for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, and this I promise is the last time I ask this. Just to be very specific, in 2009, the government introduced taxation on Poupan&#xE7;a, that taxation is a gradual taxation as Poupan&#xE7;a moves from 10.5% to 7.25%, that is in place today. Right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taxation <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:30:45) more. We don't have this taxation now. We don't &#x2013; we understand that the 8.5% is the level that's decreased the <mark type="ph" /> continued (01:30:56) decline in the SELIC rates, but probably something new will need to be adopted. We don't have the effect of the taxation that's in 2009, we don't have these measures. Probably something new will be adopted, we don't have now the information what will be the new &#x2013; what will be the new measures, we don't have that information.</p>
