      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone, and welcome to our Results Presentation. For those of you in London, I'm sorry that we changed our plans at the last minute and are not with you today, but we thought the most important thing was to be sure that we were in touch this morning, even if only by webcast, rather than to have the risk the event being disrupted, either due to transport or other issues.</p>
          <p>As usual, we will take you through our performance and key events of the year before opening things up for discussion. As ever, I will start by taking the Safe Harbor Statement as read. Nestl&#xE9; continues to make progress in an environment characterized by volatility and subdued consumer confidence, particularly in the developed world. And at the same time as delivering in the short-term, we have again demonstrated our commitment to building the business over the long term, in line with the strategies that we have previously discussed.</p>
          <p>Our consumer-facing marketing spend is up in constant currencies. We have continued to build the innovation pipeline while launching many new products and systems. We are on our way to a record year for capital investment, with a lot going into emerging markets. And we have been able to announce some exciting partnerships and acquisitions, again, often in emerging markets. Nestl&#xE9; Health Science has become operational and new and exciting growth pillars of growth have been established, including the soon-to-be-inaugurated Nestl&#xE9; Institute of Health Sciences. We have increased and held market shares in over 70% of measured sales; we obtained real internal growth momentum and are seeing increased pricing.</p>
          <p>2011 has certainly been an extraordinary year for our company, with activities in every corner of the world. We have people managing our operations and making progress in those countries that have been making the headlines, whether Egypt, C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire and the Middle East, or for other different reasons, the Euro Zone and North America. Equally, we have been confronted by record prices for raw materials, extreme volatility in currencies and a seemingly unending increase in the strength of the Swiss Franc.</p>
          <p>Many of you came to our seminar in June or listened to the webcast. You heard that we have processes in place that enable us to manage through turbulent times and that we have further increased our procurement capabilities since the last period of high input cost pressure. The result is that we can report today a performance that demonstrates our ability to deliver on our key objectives, even in the toughest of times. As I go through the different business areas, there are some that have had a strong start to the year, and some less so, but of importance is that we have delivered at the group level. Accordingly, we are well set to achieve the Nestl&#xE9; model again in 2011, bringing an improvement in margin in constant currency and organic growth at the top end of our 5% to 6% range.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have unprecedented opportunities to invest in future growth, particularly in emerging markets, both organically with CapEx and through bolt-ons. With that in mind and with an eye on the uncertain economic environment, we will retain financial flexibility to drive our strategic priorities with confidence. Now, let's have a look at the headline performance. Organic growth for the first half was 7.5%, a meaningful acceleration from the first quarter with an outstanding second quarter of 8.5%. In line with what we had said at the time, growth from pricing is up from 1.5% at Q1 to 3.8% in Q2, giving 2.7% for the first half.</p>
          <p>The real internal growth continues to be strong, at 4.8% for the first half. The trading operating profit is up by 20 basis points, to 15.1%, and by 40 basis points in constant currencies. Trading operating profit before other net trading operating expenses and income, EBIT as previously reported, is flat in constant currencies and down 20 basis points as reported. Please note, that at this margin level last year, we had a 60 basis point improvement. The consumer-facing marketing spend is up 6.2% in constant currencies. As a reminder, this was 14% in constant currencies up in the first half of 2010. So, this is a further increase on top of a big increase last year.</p>
          <p>The net profit was CHF4.7 billion and the margin was 11.5%. In constant currencies, the net profit margin was virtually unchanged compared to the first half of 2010, which included Alcon. The underlying earnings per share for the group are up 5.2% in constant currencies. On the next slide, we have created our usual margin bridge for trading operating profit. The benefits from Nestl&#xE9;'s Continuous Excellence and other actions by the organization help to address the significant impact of escalating input costs on costs of goods. In particular, the positive evolution of pricing has also contributed, as well as growth leverage and the benefits from restructuring in prior periods.</p>
          <p>On input costs, I reiterate our June guidance that we expect the impact at the upper end of a CHF2.5 billion to CHF3 billion range. Distribution costs were up 10 basis points. Efficiencies played a part in the gain, but also mix and mitigating the effects of increasing energy costs. Marketing costs were down 20 basis points; this follows a meaningful increase in the first half of 2010. As I said, our consumer-facing marketing spend increased in constant currencies, even after we have achieved efficiencies through a more global alignment of campaign messaging, as well as through the use of media mix.</p>
          <p>Administrative costs were down 150 basis points. There are number of factors at play here. First, we are rolling out Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence beyond operations and, as part of this, we have targeted for admin costs to grow much slower than organic growth; this creates leverage from growth. We were already achieving significant savings in the second half of last year and, consequently, will not expect the second half evolution to be as dramatic. R&amp;D costs increased by 10 basis points.</p>
          <p>Next are the other net income, net trading income and expenses. These improved by 40 basis points due to lower restructuring costs as well as lower level of costs for litigation and other expenses. You can expect the full-year restructuring costs to be 30 basis points to 40 basis points, this then gives you the trading operating profit improvement of 20 basis points, or 40 basis points in constant currencies. I've already mentioned the phrase constant currency several times, so let's have a look at the currency situation. Half year on half year we have a 17% decline in the U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc and a 12% decline in the euro. All other currencies are also weaker against the Swiss franc.</p>
          <p>The impact of a strong Swiss franc is clearly significant on translation of our financial for reporting purposes: 13.8% on sales, 20 basis points on trading operating margin, 15% on underlying earnings per share, between CHF600 million and CHF700 million on operating cash flows and CHF5 billion on the balance sheet. But importantly, there is no meaningful impact on our underlying operating performance, which as you have seen, has remained strong in the first half.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at our sales performance, starting with our traditional sales evolution chart. I've already discussed foreign exchange; divestitures net of acquisition was negative 6.6% due to the August 2010 sale of Alcon, which in itself impacted our sales evolution by over 8%, but the sale of Alcon and the exchange rates should not overshadow the very strong operating performance reflected in the organic growth of 7.5%. RIG for the first half was 4.8%; this maintains our momentum from Q1 and is a truly differentiating level of performance. There was also a step up in pricing in Q2, to 3.8%, giving 2.7% for the first half. I believe this half year number will gradually increase during the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>I'd like now to pass over to Roddy to do our usual run through the business segments. Roddy?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with the total group sales by region. In each region, the numbers include the relevant zone and the globally-managed businesses, which are Nutrition, Waters, Professional, Nespresso and now, Joint Ventures. We show this to give you a good read across with our peers. It is once again the picture of broad-based growth, strong relative to the various markets.</p>
          <p>Europe has accelerated from 3.9% organic growth in Q1 to 5.8% for the half, with RIG up a 120 basis points to 4.6% and pricing up 70 basis points to 1.2%. And this is growth-on-growth coming on top of 3.6% organic growth in the first half of 2010. The Americas achieved 5.7% organic growth, with RIG of 2.2%. Pricing has accelerated but RIG was lapping a tough second quarter in 2010. Asia, Oceania and Africa achieved 13.3% organic growth; the RIG remained double digit, pricing was up to 3.2%.</p>
          <p>The key reason for our broad-based growth is that we've been able to deliver growth, both where you would expect strong growth and where you might not. Where you might expect strong growth, the emerging markets and the BRIC countries, both growing at 13.3%, and where you might not, the developed markets, growing at 4.4% and Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain growing as a group at 3.9%.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the operating segments and, first, here is the currency impact by reporting area. Normally, this slide would be in the appendix, but I think it merits being shown up front this time. The currency impact on sales will most likely remain double digit; it could lessen a bit due to the relative comparison versus 2010, as you can see on the two graphs. As Jim said, the currency impact should not take away from our strong operating performance. On this slide, you can see how broad based our RIG has been and our organic growth, which ranges from over 4% in zone Europe to over 11% in zone AOA. There was increase pricing in the second quarter in all reporting areas.</p>
          <p>The RIG evolution remains robust, and I'll go through this in more detail starting with the Americas. The RIG in Zone Americas improved marginally from Q1, but there has been a strong acceleration in pricing, up 360 basis points in the second quarter from the Q1 level. With weak consumer sentiment in the USA, the North American business continued to experience tough trading conditions, as demonstrated by moderate growth but a reasonable market share performance.</p>
          <p>The frozen aisle continues to be under pressure generally; the Lean Cuisine and HotPockets segments are slightly down, whereas the Stouffer's Regular Meals segment is flat. We had success in frozen with launches under the Market Creations and Farmer's Harvest banners, as well as range extensions in Lean Cuisine, such as spring rolls and dips. The frozen pizza category is growing. Our Pizza Plus launch, being frozen pizza packed with another product, such as Nestl&#xE9; Toll House Cookies or chicken wings, is performing well. Overall in frozen, DiGiorno, Stouffer's and Lean Cuisine have gained share.</p>
          <p>The pet care business is flat but showing increased market shares. New products such as Purina ONE beyOnd, Fancy Feast Delights and Frisky Tasty Treasures are performing well. Confectionery is lapping the tough comps caused by last year's WONKA launch, but shares are stable in a market that is up by a high-single digit percentage. This year, we have launched the successful ice cream brand, Skinny Cow, into confectionary; the early take up is promising, In Chilled, Nestl&#xE9; Toll House is performing well. The ice cream business is continuing to face pressure from private label and premium take home and has seen volume impacted by pricing. Our strongest performance is in the snack segment and then super premium. Innovation has included launches of shakes and smoothies as well as H&#xE4;agen Dazs Cones and the Skinny Cow More to Love pack. Nescaf&#xE9; and Coffee-Mate had a positive first half. The Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto launch is building momentum with, importantly, high capsule consumption per machine. The Caf&#xE9; Collection and Natural Bliss variants of Coffee-Mate have been well-received. Latin America has had a strong first half, both for RIG and pricing, and continues to deliver double-digit organic growth.</p>
          <p>Mexico, most of the regions are growing double-digit whilst Nestl&#xE9; Brazil is celebrating its 90th anniversary with high-single digit growth. The big three categories in Brazil, being dairy, chocolate and biscuits, all accelerated in the second quarter partly due to Easter. Looking now at Latin America categories, the big five, being ambient dairy, chocolate, soluble coffee, ambient culinary and pet care, are all growing double-digit. The rest of world positive, ranging from mid-single digit to over 20%.</p>
          <p>PPPs are growing in the teens, with particularly strong performances in dairy, powdered beverages and soluble coffee. The Zone's trading operating margin fell 10 basis points. This reflects a significant increase in raw material costs as well as some relative weakness in volumes in North America, all mitigated by Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence. The Zone did, however, increase its brand investment in the first half and is continuing to invest to build its brands over the longer term.</p>
          <p>Next, Zone Europe. The Zone had a strong second quarter, when the uneven quarterly trading pattern created by Easter, rebalanced itself. RIG accelerated from 1.9% at the first quarter to 2.7% for the half. Pricing also picked up by 100 basis points to 1.4%, to give organic growth of 4.1%. This first half performance is a good reflection of the underlying growth in the Zone. Perhaps most impressive in Western Europe was the continued positive growth in Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy, despite the tough economic environments in those countries. As a group, those countries achieved about 4% organic growth.</p>
          <p>Maggi Juicy Roasting is performing well in these markets, as are Nescaf&#xE9; and ice cream. PPP has grown high-single digit in Europe, where growth was about 20% in Spain, for example, demonstrating the benefit of our strategy of rolling PPP's into the developed world. It also confirms our belief that it is possible to generate growth with the right innovation even in the most difficult markets. Germany saw a meaningful acceleration in Q2, where 80% of sales are holding or growing share. Most categories are performing well in Germany. Growth in the GB region was flat, but shares were up overall. The confectionery business had a strong Easter and has gained share.</p>
          <p>In soluble coffee, there was a good performance from Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto and the mixes variance. Dolce Gusto is now the market leader in the U.K., both in machine and capsule sales. Maggi Juicy Roasting had a successful launch in the U.K., even despite Maggi not being a particularly well-established brand in Britain. This demonstrates the strength of the Juicy Roasting concept. France continued to perform well, with mid to single-digit growth and share gains in all categories. Ice cream, soluble coffee and frozen food were particularly strong.</p>
          <p>In Eastern Europe, we are continuing to see subdued sales growth in Russia, particularly in the big chocolate category. But we are enjoying good growth in a number of other countries, including the Ukraine and the Baltic region. Looking at the categories for the Zone as a whole, all of the categories were positive, their performance reflected both in our strong market share performance by country and in the achievement of above category growth for the Zone as a whole. As you'd expect, the category story is one of continued momentum from Q1, with strong performances from ambient culinary, frozen pizza, chilled culinary, soluble coffee and pet care. Equally, the key innovations continue to perform well.</p>
          <p>Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto has gained over 400 share basis points in the machine market, further expanding a sales base as growth continues above 50%. The other Nescaf&#xE9; launches, Green Blend and Crema, also continued to perform well. Maggi Juicy Chicken has evolved into Maggi Juicy Roasting, and the range has expanded into other meat and fish dishes as well as into new markets geographically. This is one of our fastest growing innovations. Innovation is a core aspect of our strategy and we are accelerating our efforts here. We are making a real difference in driving growth and creating value for our consumers.</p>
          <p>This Zone has delivered a strong operating margin performance in a particularly difficult operating environment characterized by weak consumer sentiment in some markets and by an exceedingly tough competitive environment. A key driver of this operating performance was a strong delivery of savings due to Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence in addition to the benefits of previous restructuring of facilities, of businesses and of employee post-retirement programs.</p>
          <p>Next is Zone AOA. This Zone had a very strong first half, especially when one thinks of the news headlines from the region dominated the first few months of the year. This performance is broad based, as we are seeing good growth in Africa, the Middle East and a number of Asian markets. In Japan, we are the first food and bev company get back to full supply to the retailers, a great effort by our people. We are now seeing our performance at normal levels and we are gaining share in soluble coffee, chocolate and ready-to-drink beverages.</p>
          <p>The Greater China region is accelerating with over 20% growth. Our milk business is now back to previous levels and building strong momentum. Our ice cream business in China is also growing well following its relaunch last year, including a strong PPP portfolio the growth is over 30%. The ambient culinary business had a strong second quarter after a slow start to the year and is growing in the teens.</p>
          <p>Nescaf&#xE9; is also performing well, both in its soluble and ready-to-drink variants. The Central West Africa region is another highlight, even though it includes C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire, where we are reestablishing supply chain networks. Growth in the region is being led by ambient dairy and beverages. The South Asia region, which includes India, is growing over 20%. All the region's categories are growing double digit, with ambient culinary and chocolate both above 30%. These growth rates explain our increased investment in region.</p>
          <p>PPPs were accretive to the Zone, at 18% organic growth. The Zone's trading operating profit was up 50 basis points. The increased raw material prices have been offset by savings, growth of leverage and pricing. The rest of the raw material pressure for the Zone is in H2, and there is also a greater benefit to come from the Zone's pricing actions. Next is Nestl&#xE9; Nutrition. Nutrition has had a strong first half growth performance, driven by the infant nutrition business which is achieving double-digit organic growth and has gained 60 basis points of share on a global basis. The infant nutrition performance is well balanced across all divisions, baby food, infant cereals and infant formula, and all regions, including some markets where we have seemed to be having a tough time more recently.</p>
          <p>For example, France is achieving double-digit growth and we are gaining share in every category and channel there. The emerging markets are growing dynamically whether in Europe, Asia, Africa or Latin America. Infant cereals continue to perform very well. The North American business is also performing well relative to its market. Our formula market share in the USA is now 17% up from below 15% three years ago.</p>
          <p>The infant nutrition performance is built on a number of pillars which have come together over the last couple of years, including successful innovation in formula and cereals, improved communication where rules allow, expanded distribution, rigorous 60/40 testing, increased competitive intensity and closer working relationships to leverage the scale of other Nestl&#xE9; businesses in the markets.</p>
          <p>I'm also pleased to say that our BabyNes launch got off to a good start in Switzerland. The French and British launches of Jenny Craig and the business in Oceania are doing fine, but we have some issues in the U.S., our biggest market. It is clear that the weak economy has played a role in impacting the business. We are making some changes, including to our marketing strategy, and we should start to see an improvements in the coming months, particularly in rebuilding new client needs which are the key to longer-term growth in the business.</p>
          <p>Nestl&#xE9; Nutrition's operating margin is down 90 basis points versus a tough comparison last year. This partly reflects the raw material environment, in particular the contrast with the low-cost H1 2010, but also the performance of Jenny Craig. We expect to see an improvement in the Zone's operating margin in H2, as pricing taken already this year works its way into the numbers.</p>
          <p>Nestl&#xE9; Waters is next. The organic growth of 5.8% reflects continued strong performances in many markets where the appropriate brands are bought. It is also immeasurable that the pricing has turned positive in the second quarter, after over a year of reducing price. Highlights included double-digit growth and share gains in France and Belgium, strong performances globally for Perrier up 14%, and S. Pellegrino up 9%, as well as Vittel, Acqua Panna and Nestl&#xE9; Pure Life, and double-digit growth in the emerging markets, both in Asia and in Latin America.</p>
          <p>The North American market has been challenging. Pricing taken earlier in the year has impacted volumes, as others have been slow to follow. We have retained shares in North America on a year-to-date basis, where it's slipped in recent months. In Europe, there is positive growth in many markets including France, Germany, Italy and the U.K. The trading operating margin fell 140 basis points. This was due to increased oil-related and PET costs not offset by good delivery of efficiencies and gradual price realization.</p>
          <p>Nestl&#xE9; Professional is continuing to build positive momentum, notwithstanding the fact that economic conditions remain subdued. Growth was double-digit in emerging markets, as much as 20% in China, for example. Whereas, positive growth, too, in North America, where beverages are performing well, and in Europe. The 2010 launches of premium and super premium Nescaf&#xE9; machines have been well received by customers and sales momentum is building.</p>
          <p>Nespresso has continued to grow at a high rate, slightly above the Q1 level. This is an investment year for Nespresso. In the first half, we've seen a very high level of marketing spend supporting the successful launch of the PIXIE machine in 50 markets simultaneously. This was the first machine launched by Nespresso to be done globally. They've also opened new boutiques, including in St. Petersburg and Stockholm. A further development at Nespresso is the launch of new machines for the out-of-home channel.</p>
          <p>Nestl&#xE9; Health Science achieved double-digit RIG. The company, only created on the 1st of January, is now fully operational and has already been active in M&amp;A, as you will have seen, creating future growth platforms in strategic areas. The decline in the trading operating profit for the whole segment is down mainly due to investments in Nespresso and Nestl&#xE9; Health Science. Next is the product group review. I have already touched on most key messages, so I'll go through this quickly, only making a comment if I have any additional value to add. On this slide, you can see that all are delivering positive growth. Let's now go through them individually.</p>
          <p>First, is powdered and liquid beverages. Soluble coffee has had a strong first half both in terms of growth, which was double-digit, and in terms of operating margin. The performance was good in all three zones and in Nestl&#xE9; Professional. The markets have been very focused on their key innovations, aligned with our growth drivers, with good execution and appropriate brand support. For example, in Europe, these include Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto and Nescaf&#xE9; Sensazioni, both examples of premiumisation, Nescaf&#xE9; Green Blend, an example of nutrition, health and wellness, and Nespresso 3-in-1, an example of a PPP that we're rolling out in Western Europe. We are seeing growth well into double-digits in all of these products, as we are globally in PPPs with our foaming mixes, such as cappuccinos. Pricing is increasing as the year goes on.</p>
          <p>Powdered beverages also had a strong growth in the first half, particularly in Milo. Milo is performing well in Asia and is building its presence in parts of Latin America, such as Colombia and Chile. Nesquik also achieved positive growth and highlights included Russia and Italy. The powder category has experienced significant cost pressure, sugar and cocoa in particular. Accordingly, we are also seeing pricing increasing period-on-period. Marketing spend was up the category.</p>
          <p>Liquid beverages performed well, with high-single digit organic growth and improved margins. I would highlight excellent progress by Nescaf&#xE9; and Milo in a number of markets. The trading operating profit margin is down due to innovation and launch costs both at Nespresso and in other segments of the product group. The milk business has again delivered double-digit top-line growth in all zones and has accelerated from Q1, both in RIG and price. It has also been able to leverage this growth due to an improved operating margin performance.</p>
          <p>The business is heavily weighted to emerging markets and has continued to perform at a high level, driven by aligned global product priorities, aligned communication themes and a focus also on increased leverage of our marketing spend. It has achieved market share gains in many countries. Among our growth drivers, nutrition, health and wellness, for example, in Growing Up Milks and PPPs, which are also nutritionally enhanced, are key drivers. I've already touched on Coffee-Mate in my Zone America comments.</p>
          <p>The ice cream business has had a good start to the year in all three zones. Particular successes include China, France, Germany, Switzerland, Egypt, Latin America, Indo-China, amongst others. The great drivers and innovation are key contributors here, whether out of home or in-house business, the PPPs, including our peelable ice creams, which are now in 11 countries and doing well in all of them and also are now available in new variants, nutritional, health and wellness, such as Slow Churned, or premiumisation, such as H&#xE4;agen-Dazs and Nescaf&#xE9; Frapp&#xE9; Latte in Spain.</p>
          <p>Next is prepared dishes. The frozen food business in Europe continues to be driven by the strong performance of pizza, both under the Buitoni and Wagner brands. I've already discussed frozen in North America. Culinary chilled, particularly Herta, continues to perform well in Europe, especially in France and Germany, even if part of this business exported from Switzerland is suffering due to the franc-euro exchange rate.</p>
          <p>The ambient culinary business, primarily Maggi, has had a strong first half, both in emerging markets and in Europe. The recent acquisitions in Eastern Europe and Latin America are performing well. We have new capacity coming on-stream in India and China. Our biggest markets are all increasing market shares. The product group's margin increased 30 basis points. There are good performances in most businesses, which compensated the integration costs for the pizza business and high input costs such as cheese, whey and meat for U.S. frozen. There are also lower restructuring charges than in 2010.</p>
          <p>Next is confectionery. I will start by reminding you that we had over 8% organic growth in the first half last year. So 4.2% in the first half of 2011 demonstrates good momentum over a tough comparative. The business is performing well, with over 70% of sales gaining share, including key markets such as the U.K. We had a successful Easter season around world, demonstrated by a strong pickup in growth in the second quarter in each zone. Both China and India are growing over 20%. The growth would be even higher but the capacity constraints that we are addressing in both countries. I've already discussed the U.S.</p>
          <p>Pricing was increased during the year, driven by increases in milk and sugar costs. This pricing is a contributing factor to the improved margin performance but, equally, there are higher contributions from some of the faster growing markets as well as benefits from the European restructuring in recent years. Next is pet care. Overall, we have seen a building of momentum from the Q1 growth numbers, we're at growth in Q2 at twice the level of Q1. Europe has continued to grow at a good level, driven by the success of innovations for cats such as Purina ONE Actilea, the expansion of the Felix brand in Central and Eastern Europe and the launches of Felix Sensations and Gourmet &#xE0; la Carte.</p>
          <p>For dogs, we have enhanced our leadership in older pets with the successful launch of Pro Plan Senior Seven Plus. We've also launched Beneful Little Enjoyers, taking Beneful into the small dog market for the first time in Europe. I've already discussed the stronger pets performance by the North American business, which achieved share gains in most segments. Growth was double-digit in Latin America and in the emerging markets as a whole. Globally, Purina outpaced the growth in its category by a 184 basis points.</p>
          <p>The trading operating profit was impacted by commodity prices. This is not just because of the 2011 impact, but also because we were very successful in 2010 in the first half with our commodity hedges. You might remember that the H1 2010 margin was up 190 basis points. Effectively therefore, it made a difficult comparative. We have seen an improved margin performance in the second half, helped by a more normal comparative and by the benefit of pricing taken in April.</p>
          <p>That concludes my run through of the business performance. I'll now hand back to Jim.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Roddy. On the next slide is the rest of the P&amp;L. I have shown both the 2010 comparison against the continuing operations and the group performance. A reduction in net financing cost and lower tax expenses contribute to a 60 basis points improvement in net profit for the continuing operations. A comparison with the 2010 group numbers, including Alcon, shows a marginal decline of 10 basis points in net profit as reported.</p>
          <p>The group's underlying earnings per share are up 5.2% in constant currencies. Turning to cash flow and net debt, the operating cash flow is CHF1.7 billion. This is a good performance, albeit lower than the first half of 2010, recognizing the impacts of the sale of Alcon, currency weaknesses and working capital. First Alcon, Alcon's cash flow was about CHF1.4 billion in the first half of 2010. Now currencies, you may assume a conversion impact on our cash flow broadly similar to the impact on our sales. On top of this, we made an investment in 2010 to protect foreign currency assets. This was already reflected in the full-year 2010 cash flow. These impacts created a negative comparison from first half 2010 to first half 2011 of about CHF1 billion.</p>
          <p>Third, working capital, which increased about CHF1.2 billion but improved slightly as a percentage of sales. We made a tactical decision to increase inventories in order to manage capacity constraints in some of our fast-growing emerging markets and a disruption in our supply chain caused by external events. As a whole, working capital has improved as a percentage of sales. Turning now to our net debt position. Half-year net debt was CHF14.5 billion compared to CHF29.6 billion in the first half of 2010. The big impacts include the sale of Alcon, the dividend payment in 2011, the share buyback and the medium to long-term investments in treasury shares and other long to medium-term investments.</p>
          <p>The 2010 dividend payment, which was up 15.6% per share in Swiss francs, resulted in a payout of CHF5.9 billion. We bought about CHF4 billion of shares in the first half and continued in July to nearly complete our CHF10 billion program started last year. We have increased our medium to long-term investments from CHF2 billion to about CHF4 billion. These investments are blue chip, we have made them because we needed to manage the proceeds from Alcon beyond those which were used either to restructure a debt or for the share buyback.</p>
          <p>The benefit of treasury shares on mid to long-term investments beyond their inherent investment characteristic is that they enable us to maintain an appropriate degree of financial flexibility. With CHF14.5 billion of net debt, we are approaching the level that we had at the end of 2009, which we told you was an appropriate level for the group at this time. If our medium to long-term investments are included, then net debt would be CHF10.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, let's have a look at our priorities for our use of cash. As you know our clear priority is to invest in our business, either internally or externally. We have stepped up the level of capital investment. You can assume it will about CHF5 billion in 2011. We have also stepped up our M&amp;A activity, though we remain focused on bolt-ons. I will come back to both these areas on the next slide.</p>
          <p>After investment in our business, the next priority is to return cash to our shareholders through our dividend. The priority for us is the actual Swiss franc amount of the dividend, not necessarily a ratio. We would expect that, all things being equal, to continue to enhance the dividend we pay to our shareholders. Buying our own shares, whether as part of a buyback or to hold as treasury shares, is optional. We see this as a tool from managing excess cash, assuming that the share price is at an appropriate level, therefore, our announcements of the share buybacks having been part of a disciplined approach to managing our balance sheet whilst retaining financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>On completion of the current program, we would have returned CHF39 billion to shareholders since 2005 through share buybacks at an average price of CHF48 per share. At the same time, we would have paid CHF31 billion in dividends. In the first half of 2011, we have committed to about CHF10 billion to the dividend and share buyback. This had to be paid in Swiss francs from cash flows generated in significant weaker currencies. We have also committed about CHF10 billion Swiss francs to total capital and acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Given the current economic environment and the consequent need for financial flexibility, given the fact that we use foreign currency cash flows to buy our shares in Swiss franc and, importantly, given the fact that there are potential alternative uses of our cash such as investments in capabilities and bolt-ons that provide greater long-term strategic value for our shareholders, we believe that today is not the right time to be launching a new share buyback program.</p>
          <p>However, buybacks will stay on the board review on an ongoing basis as an option to address excess cash built up by our company. On this slide, you can see some of the capital investments that we have announced recently. It is not exhaustive, however. The projects include confectionery and culinary in India and China, pet care in Hungary, powdered beverages, cereals and milk in Indonesia, cereals in Malaysia and Turkey, infant formula in Germany, milk in Brazil, culinary in Nigeria and South Africa, and so on.</p>
          <p>On this slide you can see some of the recently announced and/or completed acquisitions. These include our two proposed acquisitions in China, now under consideration by the authorities, as well as three deals for Nestl&#xE9; Health Science, culinary in Eastern Europe, beverages in the U.S., dermatology in Sweden, among others. By now, you know our strategic roadmap well. Our performance in the first half has been coherent with our strategic priorities. I would like to touch briefly on brands and innovation, which are key areas of investment for us.</p>
          <p>First, a quick look at our Billionaire Brands. As you have heard during Roddy's presentation, these brands have contributed greatly to our first half performance. In total, they achieved over 8% organic growth compared to 7.5% for the group as a whole. Their growth is reflected in strong market share performances. All the brands in beverages, nutrition, waters and confectionery are achieving positive organic growth. In frozen, Lean Cuisine has returned to positive growth in a declining frozen food category.</p>
          <p>Stouffer's is marginally in negative territory, but it has gained share over the last year. Pet care continues to be a generally good picture, despite the slower growth of the category as a whole. Friskies, ONE and Purina are positive and the growth of more than 10% for Dog Chow. In ice cream, the Dreyer's brand, which is heavily present in the U.S. premium take-home segment, has been under pressure from private label and regional brands, but is only marginally down less than 1%.</p>
          <p>One of the reasons for the strong performances of our Billionaire Brand is our continued high level of innovation. Innovation is a value-added growth driver for all our categories. The great benefit is as we enhance value for consumers at each consumption moment, we also enhance value for our shareholders. Making this more tangible, here are a few of the innovations from last year that have contributed to strong first half improvement in our performance.</p>
          <p>Nescaf&#xE9;, with a clear segmentation strategy for its innovation, super premium with Dolce Gusto, premium and nutrition, health and wellness with Nescafe Green Blend and PPPs such as Nescaf&#xE9; 3-in-1, launching successfully in Europe. We're seeing strong growth in all these segments, from well over 50% for Dolce Gusto, to about 15% for our premium range. In ice cream, we also have a range of PPPs, the peelable PPP ice cream has been one of the most successful launches in this category.</p>
          <p>On this slide, we have captured just some of the innovations launched in the first half. In ice cream, we have launched a new shake concept in developed markets as well as H&#xE4;agen Dazs Smoothies in the U.S. The dairy business has expanded Coffee-Mate out of the non-dairy creamer market into dairy creamers. It also has a raft of launches and extensions in the emerging markets included value-added liquid milks such as Nido Protectus.</p>
          <p>In prepared dishes and cooking aids, the Maggi Juicy Chicken range, the leader in its segment, has evolved into Juicy Roasting, now for beef, pork or fish, for example, and its international rollout continues. In the U.S. frozen category, we have responded to the tough environment with new lines and extensions such as Lean Cuisine Snacks. In pet care where I mentioned our improving market share performance on a global basis, there is a strong roll call of innovations, a few of which are listed on this slide.</p>
          <p>In chocolate, we are building on the WONKA extension into chocolate and are now extending Skinny Cow into the category. We launched Aero Biscuit in the U.K., we took Kit Kat into Brazil and launched Kit Kat Black in Japan with a special type of wafer. These were just some examples of recent launches and extensions and our pipeline has much more to come. The future will not just be bringing new products, but in addition, also new routes to market, new technologies, new system capabilities, as well as a range of innovation in nutrition and Nestl&#xE9; Health Science.</p>
          <p>Next, the slide that I showed at the full-year conference call early this year. We said then that we understand the challenges we faced in 2011 and that we would be taking a holistic approach to managing that. I think these first half numbers demonstrate that we have done that. We have compensated input cost pressures, not just through savings in those areas that have been directly impacted, but also through savings in administrative costs, for example. We also talked about a rich pipeline of innovation and about growth momentum; we are seeing the benefit of both in our continued strong level of real internal growth. This is growth on top of growth year after year.</p>
          <p>But we also have momentum in extending Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence and with our growth drivers such as nutrition, health and wellness, PPP, premiumisation and out-of-home. Our growth momentum is contributing a positive mix effect due to the faster growth of our emerging markets, which are benefiting from increased capacity investment. We also said then that we would deliver the Nestl&#xE9; model again in 2011. We're confirming this guidance, with organic growth at the top end of our 5% to 6% range. We continue to run the business with a mix of long-term inspiration and short-term delivery and we believe that in today's environment these qualities will really help us outperform.</p>
          <p>So, to conclude, it has been a challenging first half but we need to separate the foreign exchange impact on the reported numbers from the underlying solid operational performance. The foreign exchange movements on our numbers are a big impact on translation, no question, but it have only a small impact on our underlying operations. We are fundamentally a conglomeration of local currency and regional currency businesses that are leveraging our global scale to compete successful. I believe that we have demonstrated our operational strength in the first half by delivering a strong performance in all KPIs. Organic growth is strong, the operating margin is up and our underlying earnings are improved in constant currencies and we have continued to invest in the future.</p>
          <p>The real differentiating highlight of the first half of 2011 is that Nestle has not only delivered where you would expect us to deliver but we have also delivered against the odds, as our businesses have demonstrated their ability to perform in the toughest of times. Whether it is in Central West Africa achieving double-digit growth despite the unrest in the region or the Japanese business disrupted by natural disasters, or whether it is our business in the troubled economies of Southern and Western Europe that continue to deliver positive growth.</p>
          <p>These achievements not only differentiate our performance in the first half, they also give us confidence in our ability to deliver for the rest of the year and beyond. Finally, as I said, we have unprecedented opportunities to invest in future growth, particularly the emerging markets, both organically with CapEx and through bolt-ons. With that in mind and we an eye on the uncertain economic environment, we are retaining financial flexibility to drive our strategic priorities with confidence. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Now, let's open up for discussions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, your question-and-answer session will now begin. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from David Hayes [Nomura International Plc]. Please go ahead, your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you. Just asking quick on the buyback, wonder if you can give us any kind of background as to whether that decision on the policy was changed or taken in the last few weeks with the, obviously, the market and the economic uncertainty that we've seen? And whether also with where the Swiss franc moved in last few weeks, you've delayed actually some dividend pay through from subsidiaries which is part of that decision process as well, as you watch that play out.</p>
          <p>And then I guess still just focusing on cash flow again. You kind of eluded to maybe some of the points in the presentation, but I'm just noticing that the variation in other operating assets and liabilities is an additional outflow of about CHF1 billion in the first half versus last year and then other investing cash flows about an additional CHF1.5 billion. I was wondering if you could give us any more color as to what those outflows actually relate to and why they're quite a big difference to the first half of last year. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's come back to the share buyback program. David, we have always said the share buyback program is optional given the priorities we have laid out. The priority has always been to invest in building our business. I believe that this year, as we have communicated to you, that we have several opportunities to invest in CapEx for organic growth in the areas where, especially in the areas today where we are constrained because of very demanding utilization of existing capacities. And you have seen what we have announced in terms of possible M&amp;A transactions this year.</p>
          <p>In addition, our commitment to the dividend, you see the dividend increasing year after year. Those are really our priorities. I think you're right, given the economic environment in which we operate plus combined with the opportunities we have to invest the cash flows, we believe it is a point in time where we have to focus on driving the business with confidence. We are not saying that share buybacks will never occur, as we said, share buybacks will continue to be under the watchful eye of the board and they will make a decision on that from time to time. But I think at this moment, as we have communicated, our focus is really driving our internal priorities.</p>
          <p>On the cash flow, yeah, just on the cash flow, David, I think generally I don't want to get into the specific lines. If you look at our cash flow, CHF1.7 billion in operating cash flow and about CHF300 million in free cash flow, which is about just under CHF3 billion down for what we reported last year. First of all, we said Alcon, the impact on the disposal of Alcon in our free cash was about CHF1.4 billion. Working capital increased about CHF1 billion. The carry of the foreign currency on financial assets, the impact and our funding, the negative impact was about CHF1 billion and minority and associates was positive about CHF500 million. When you add those up, you basically explain where we were half year versus half year.</p>
          <p>Now, you also realize that the impact on the cash investments, et cetera, from the Alcon proceeds, most of those occurred in the second half of last year. So, they are more or less in this half year versus last half year. So, the comparisons are a bit different, the base is slightly different. However, I would say those three or four items explain the movement in cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Just quickly on back on the buybacks, from what you're saying the decision on the buyback policy today, which you say may be reviewed, but that could well have been the same decision three months ago rather than today effectively. It was kind of a long-term plan rather than a reactionary to the marketplace. Is that fair?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is. And as we said, David, when we announced our first half year results, we said that we will not make any decision on the share buyback while we are continuing to execute the existing program.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning, Roddy. Good morning, Jim. I also have two questions. First is about the working capital increase in H1. Is it a strategic one just for this year or is it also for 2012 given that the coming guidance remains difficult. Maybe you can elaborate a little bit on that <mark type="inaudible" /> (59:34).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on working capital, Alain, thanks for the question, the CHF1.2 billion was significantly influenced by inventories and the inventory build in the first half compared to the first half last year, as I said, related to some specific circumstances. There are markets, especially in the emerging markets particularly in Asia, where we have had to build our inventories to overcome certain capacity issues that exist at that point in time. We are addressing those, as you noticed on the chart, by accelerating our investments in several factories to address these issues.</p>
          <p>And the other issue is that we have had severe disruption in certain parts of the world because of high-impact events that have been announced from time to time. So, I think our objective over time is to manage our working capital relative to the evolution of our sales. And in spite of the increase &#x2013; this increase in working capital, working capital as a percentage of our sales is trending down, so I think that trend will continue, at least that is our objective.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Patrik Schwendimann, Z&#xFC;rcher Kantonalbank. Hi, James and Roddy. First, regarding the statement about the dividend. You were mentioning that you will continue to enhance it, so does that mean that you're hopeful to increase your dividend for the current financial year, besides probably the negative effects of the Swiss franc? And secondly, regarding the margin improvement, <mark type="inaudible" /> (1:02:22) in the first half, it will be 40 basis points in local currency, in the second half, you were already mentioning that the second half of 2010 has already these admin cost improvements in it. So, does it mean that in H2 that the margin could more or less be stable in local currency? That's the second question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Patrik, the dividend, as we said, assuming everything else being equal, that it is the intention to enhance the dividend in Swiss franc. That's the intention. And that is how we've approached the dividends in the last four or five years. Every year you have seen a substantial increase in the dividend. But that's the level, you know, it is our intention that we will improve the dividend payout in Swiss franc to our shareholders. How much will depend on the particular circumstances. The margin improvement, we said also that our margin, including the whole EBIT margin, the model is that we will improve in constant currencies. You notice that at the EBIT level we were flat in constant currencies. So, we are expecting that margins will improve also in the second half.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>You will remember for 2010 we had a sort of reverse of 2011 with a very tough H1 comp and an easier H2 comp. So, it's the reverse this year, there's opportunity for the margin from to improve, as Jim says.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, just one question actually. There's a big decline in your litigation and onerous lease costs in the first half, about a CHF100 million swing. I was just wondering what the driver of that was and whether you can give us any help on what we should expect for the full year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Jamie, and thanks. Yes, there is a decline in the other, what we call other trading expenses and income. You know, the litigation expenses are triggered depending on different circumstances. This year so far, it has been very low and I'd love to give you guidance, but I really don't know, because I don't want to tell you we're going to spend more in litigation when in fact so far we have spent very little. And so, I really can't give you guidance. We have given you guidance more or less in restructuring, which we said will be 30 to 40 basis points. We will have to make decisions with respect to making provisions for litigations, depending on what's there today. We don't see any particular material litigation currently, but we have to manage that from time to time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just, sorry, on the onerous leases, presumably you've got a bit of &#x2013; you can see for the full year, is that a big number? Is that a big swing factor?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not so far this year. Last year we had some arrangements with respect to certain contractual arrangements with the supply chain that we have had to sort out. This year we don't have any of those so far. There are always going to be litigations and on onerous contracts, et cetera, but I really can't give you any guidance on that. But let's say we do our best to manage our business in a way that we avoid those costs.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Fialko from Redburn. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Good morning. Jeremy Fialko, Redburn here. Couple of questions. The first question is on your Europe, your Zone Europe margins. You mentioned you had a pension cost benefit within the half. Can you quantify how much of a contributor that was to the region's margins and what you see the impacts to be in the full year? And the second question is on your coffee business, seeing that's one which has had some very significant input cost inflation in it, can you say how much of that you hope has been priced through and kind of how the volume reactions have been so far and what you'd expect to see in the second half of the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the coffee question. As we said, the soluble coffee business had a good year, both in terms of price and in terms of margin. So, we've clearly been successful in recovering the cost pressure that we faced. The same is true in the Nespresso business. The weaker H1 related to 2010 is simply a result of the launch of this, our first-ever global launch of a coffee machine, the PIXIE machine.</p>
          <p>So, we have been successful in protecting the margin. We have priced up, clearly. And we have not necessarily always been followed as quickly as we would have hoped by the competition. And soluble has had some share pressure as a result of competition that has since followed and we are seeing the share coming back. So, I think the soluble business is in good shape. The strength in the Nescaf&#xE9; brand helping us to get the necessary pricing.</p>

          <p>Jeremy, on the pension question. First of all, I think the first half we have seen some good results from our pension plans. Or especially in Europe the pension, the funding ratios have been up. We have some benefit, of course, by virtue of foreign exchange translation. But over the last two years, we have done a lot of work in trying to restructure benefit plans for post-retirement benefits and we have started to make some good progress last year in some markets and this year we continue to do that.</p>
          <p>Last year, we had about CHF125 million for the whole year. This year we would like to get close or slightly above that. But what I must caution is that most of the benefits that we got last year was towards &#x2013; in the second half whereas this year the benefits are in first half. So, that will sort of average itself during the course of the year but we expect around that as a benefit from the restructuring of our post-retirement benefit plans with a big focus in Europe, where we have not done that for many years, but now we're doing this. That's &#x2013; I hope that I answers your question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions if I may. In terms of the margin bridge and how we think about second half, I remember guidance was for margin to be stronger delivery in the second half weighted. Can you remind us in terms of input costs that would be first half weighted from memory, what do you think the impact would be second half? And then, two, in terms of A&amp;P, consumer-facing it was up in first half, can you illuminate for us how it will be in the second half?</p>
          <p>And then, second question, you mentioned unprecedented opportunities to invest in the business, both organic and inorganic. Can you remind us in terms of what opportunities you've been looking for in terms of deals, sizes, categories and regions, perhaps? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just let me deal with the input costs. Yeah, we did say that &#x2013; we did say that the input costs this year, the impact would be somewhere between to the upper end of the range we had given, which is CHF2.5 billion to CHF3 billion in terms of price and mix. We have seen slightly more than half of that impact in the first half of the year. So, we do expect that there will be a marginal decline on impact on the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>On A&amp;P we continue to spend to support our brands. You'll see in constant currencies our consumer-facing marketing was up 6.2% in constant currencies and this was on top what we spent the same time in 2010, which was up 14% in constant currency. So, it is an investment priority for us. And you have seen that &#x2013; you have seen the benefits of that, primarily through the improvement in market shares on a global basis and the strong real internal growth of nearly 4.8% for the first half.</p>
          <p>On capital, so, by the way just coming back on the input cost guidance, I want to maintain &#x2013; I want to reiterate our guidance on input costs this year for price and mix to be somewhere at the upper end of the CHF2.5 billion to CHF3 billion range. On capital expenditures, we have announced and that's portrayed on the slide, we have announced several major capital expenditure programs around the world, primarily in the emerging markets, where we are experiencing very good growth. So, that of course, has always been a priority for us and this year we will spend about close to CHF5 billion, I mean, that recognizing that there is also an impact in the exchange. So, we had said CHF5 billion to CHF5.5 billion. Given the exchange impact, we'll be closer to CHF5 billion this year.</p>
          <p>On M&amp;A, we also have included that on the slide. Those are deals that have been completed and announced, not yet completed. And those are the projects we are working on to make sure we bring them to a successful completion. I, unfortunately, will not give you any specific targets but I would say that we are looking for M&amp;A opportunities all over the world, in the developed world, in the emerging markets and in categories that are of strategic importance to our future. So, we are focused on bolt-on acquisitions and that's what we will continue to do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On those deals, do you see more opportunities now than, say, a year ago? Should we expect the activity to increase? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say in our industry, I have seen a little more activity this year than last year and it's not only in emerging markets, it's all over the world. But we are going to be very discriminating in terms of what is strategically compelling and with good financial logic and that's how we are pursuing these deals. Some maybe we will win, others we won't. But that's how we have always conducted our M&amp;A &#x2013; executed the M&amp;A strategy for the group.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, James. Good morning, Roddy. Two questions if I may. The first one, just on the raw material guidance the CHF2.5 billion to CHF3 billion. Given the strength of the Swiss franc effectively as the underlying increment, but just a little bit surprised of that, given what we're seeing in a number of commodities. I know there's a little hedging, et cetera, but we still have seen a number of new material inputs coming down quite significantly over the last quarter. So, I'm just a little puzzled as to how on the sort of underlying basis you're effectively increasing the commodity guidance. And so, if you could shed any color on that, that would be great.</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the long-term financial investments, could you give any color as to what's actually in there and also the rationale? So, you're effectively using your favorable short-term borrowing costs to buy longer-term investments on the asset side or if you could just clarify a little bit the thinking behind it. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On raw materials, yeah, I mean, in the guidance towards CHF3 billion impact does include the benefits of transaction exchange costs in the markets. So, yeah, there is &#x2013; if the question is, if everything was okay in the world and will this number increase or go down, but unfortunately, it is not, and there continues to be significant volatility in the markets.</p>
          <p>So, given where we are and we have spent slightly more than half that number already, it's difficult &#x2013; I don't think it's advisable to change, because of volatility in currency and commodities. We have more or less seen some offsetting impacts and we're confident the guidance to the upper end of CHF2.5 billion to CHF3 billion is what we will likely experience this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also, Jeff, it's worth remembering that our guidance was not based on prices at the time. It was based on our expectation for how our prices were going to evolve over the course of the year. So, the guidance was &#x2013; incorporated a view on the various commodities as well as on the currency impacts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the long-term investments, this is &#x2013; what we did is really the overflow of the income from Alcon disposition and the timing horizons of our debt obligations. And we had &#x2013; the excess cash was invested in equities, a lot of it is in European equities where we are spending a lot of &#x2013; making a lot of investments in capital and also some of our M&amp;A deals and in bonds. And then, of course, we also have some treasury shares which we are holding. So, as I said in the discussion that this &#x2013; the nature of these investments are good from a return point of view, but also give us the flexibility in the event we need cash in those parts of the world.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> (1:19:38) I have couple of questions for you. First on the guidance &#x2013; your 5% to 6% will be towards the top end this year and obviously, in the half in Q2, when you saying that pricing will actually increase as we go through the year. You seem to be guiding that you're only going to be somewhere around 4%, 4.5% in the second half of the year. It's all going to be volume, I'm sorry, it's all going to be pricing and actually volume will go negative. Is that a correct, sort of, extrapolation of what you're saying or are you just being slightly cautious as we still have some way to go for the year? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, Jim, previously you said you don't want Nestle to go back to a AAA credit rating. You said that you need probably CHF25 billion net debt on your balance sheet to avoid that. My calculations at least including your investments you will be probably around CHF7 billion at the end of this year because you've stopped the buyback program. Is it still your aim, I can understand what you're saying about the M&amp;A and you probably have a bit of a pipeline. But can you still see that you're going back to the CHF25 billion net debt just on the M&amp;A? I just wanted sort of a bit more guidance on that, if possible. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, John. Thanks and good morning. First of all, on the organic growth guidance, I think, yeah, we are cautious because of the environment in which we are operating. And by the way, to get even to 6% we have to do more than 5% for the rest of the year. We're not saying that is what we're going to do, but our guidance, yeah, you can say we are being cautious. I think at this time, this is what we believe is prudent to do. We are not letting up in the organization to do less.</p>
          <p>We will do and we will be competitive, as we have done in the past and as we need to be, to make sure we get fair share of growth and continue to drive our market shares. But at this time, yeah, we are guiding towards the top end of our 5% to 6% range. We've looked at it in the third quarter again. But, we feel comfortable with this and we think that's a good challenge to the rest of the organization to keep driving our competitive performance in the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I think also the Q2 is perhaps not the right start point from which to base your expectation for the full year, because the Q2 RIG was clearly inflated by the late Easter. So, probably the half one is a better start point than the Q2 number if you're thinking about your full year. We told you back in the Q1 that Q1 was impacted negatively, Q2 would be impacted positively on the RIG side and it clearly has been. So I think the H1 number's a better start point than the Q2 number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And the other thing, John, is that the first half price was 2.7% and that's what we said that that average will increase as the year progresses. Now, coming back on the AAA and the debt ceiling and the debt level, we had said in London and during our subsequent discussions that we were targeting by the end of 2012 that we will be back to a net debt position as to where we were at the end of 2009. And at the end of 2009 with Alcon, we were about slightly over CHF15 billion, without Alcon we were about CHF18 billion.</p>
          <p>So, somewhere between those two numbers is where we think we will be at the end of 2012, 2013. So, we've never mentioned the CHF25 billion number. There must have been some miscommunication, that is or in &#x2013; that's what we said at that time and that's still our objective. With respect to AAA, we said we believe that our current credit quality of AA, AA+ is a gold standard that we strive for. We know as a company, we are AAA quality company and but we are very happy with where we are from a credit quality and a credit rating point of view. AAA is not an objective for our organization.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I wanted just some clarification on the pricing. I seemed to &#x2013; I understood when you were talking about the Q2 pricing of 3.8% would actually rise as we went through the year. You're basically saying now actually it's a 2.7 average?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But even so, taking all that into account and, obviously, you have 4% on pricing in Q2 and I presume that H2 will be similar to that. You seem to be implying that there will be a serious deceleration in volume or you guys already working on the assumption that the volume will decline, close to zero by the end of the year? Is &#x2013; am I being too pessimistic about what you are saying there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't necessarily agree with you. I think we are not &#x2013; we believe that a performance guiding at the top end of our range is a prudent one. We have no expectation that our volumes are going to be negative, because as I've said, we will continue to compete and we will drive a combination of RIG and price, albeit maybe price is going to be a slightly bigger part of the mix going forward. But we were not expecting to have any kind of negative real internal growth numbers for the balance of this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, two questions from me. One, Jim, on the currency impact for the year, I thought I heard you say that for the full year you didn't think the currency impact would be as bad as the sort of 13%-odd decline in the first half, is that correct? My numbers looks as though it will still get worse by the time we get to the full year? And secondly, just back on this long-term investment, can you tell us how much of this CHF4 billion is invested in your treasury stock? And presumably the right way to think about this is that your net debt is really CHF10.8 billion rather than CHF14.5 billion at the moment, if we try to sort of look at how you're going to get to your CHF15 billion to CHF18 billion eventual target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think on the currency, Julian, I think you may be right. If you look at the U.S. dollar in the first six months this year compared to the first six months last year, we move from an average of about, I don't know, 1.08 to about 0.90 over 16%, 17%. As we've said in the same thing for the euro. It's difficult to predict, it could be slightly better, it could be slightly worse. But at the end of the day, we have to find a way to manage through this as you seen we have done in the first half. So, it's really difficult to give you guidance on currency impact given what we have seen over the last two or three days, especially Swiss francs relative to other currencies.</p>
          <p>The last time I looked, the Swiss franc relative to the euro was about 1.05, 1.06 and 0.73, 0.72 &#x2013; 0.73, same thing to the dollars. So, but it is a reality of our world and we have to manage that. Now, the impact in terms of the margin was 20 basis points and that's also something we have to manage and that's why we gave our guidance in constant currencies while also making some important underlying improvements in our performance. Now the long-term &#x2013; as I said, our net debt as of the end of the first half was CHF14.5 billion and if you did deduct the long-term investment, that would be CHF10.8 billion. I think that's a number we use. So, you're absolutely right there, Julian.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Just coming to back on the currency comment since I made it in my speech. What I said was that it could lessen a bit due to the relative comparison versus 2010. In other words, the deterioration of the currencies was already happening in the second half of last year. So, the current comparison is easier. Clearly, if the currencies continue to deteriorate, then the situation will get worse. But simply, the point was that the relative start point is easier in H2 than it was in H1.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, gentlemen. Sorry, just a couple of follow ups again. Just getting back to that point earlier about the investments that you're making on the securities. I guess two things, just in terms of where that comes through, sort of, thinking about the cash flow, when that comes through, is that included in the CHF2 billion of other investing cash flow, then? I'm just trying to reconcile that with the fact that short-term investments were an inflow of CHF3.9 billion in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>And I then, guess also just in terms of mark-to-market of those investments, do you mark-to-market of those investments at the end of each period? And is that appearing as a profit or loss item on the P&amp;L and where does that appear? And I guess related to that as well, if an investor said to ask why are you investing in Asian securities rather than Nestl&#xE9; equities, does that not mean you think Nestl&#xE9; offers more upside? I just wonder what you would respond to that. Thanks very much.</p>

We have about just under CHF1 billion in Asian equities and we have about CHF2 billion in Nestl&#xE9; shares. And yes, if we'd likely continue to do some more Nestl&#xE9; shares depending, of course, on the price. Now, I'm sorry, what was the other question, David?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It goes into the, it is mark-to-marketed, the period end as you say and it goes into the comprehensive income statement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But not through financial income or any other &#x2013; not through the main -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not through the operating income.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And then, sorry, one other operational question as well, just in terms of the confectionary margin, obviously a big movement there. You kind of explained some of the moving parts. Is that the new norm margin-wise the confectionary or is that kind of a higher level than you would expect it to hold? Or is that now what we should be looking for confectionary should be able to sustain as a margin point? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think confectionary, as we said, has gotten some benefits primarily in the administrative cost reduction. And that will start to normalize during the course of the year. So, it's not a target. I expect the margins will sort of flatten out for the balance of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it's more in line with last year or frankly in terms of the first half -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't give guidance on the margin, but just to say that it did get a benefit, as we talked, for this important reduction in the administrative cost in the first half. It will start to normalize itself, not normalize, but it will not it will be less impactful in the second half or the full-year comparison.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a lot of moving pieces going on in confectionary, both the seasonality issue also, we are seeing very strong growth in some of the emerging markets where we have very good margins. So, there is, as you've seen, over now I think three, four, five years even there has been a continuing trend of improvement in terms in that business. So, there is also an underlying clear improvement going on over time.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Pablo Zuanic [Liberum Capital, Inc.]. Please go ahead, your line is now open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. <mark type="inaudible" /> (1:35:00) but maybe just structural questions. Roddy, can you talk about your baby formula users in China. You know, from outside we hear that Mead Johnson competes mostly in the premium segment than on apparently across the board in all the segments. Obviously, the value in the low end of the market is not growing, so they tend to be losing share. Can you just talk about your business in baby formula and remind us of what your market shares are in China and baby formula versus Mead Johnson, Wyeth and Danone.</p>
          <p>And then just a follow-on on Nespresso and Dolce Gusto, just give us some more color there. In the case of Nespresso, you said sales are likely to grow more than in the first quarter I guess that means more than 20%. Just, how much of this is Nespresso at the moment is coming outside of Western Europe? What's the provision making in the U.S., particularly with Nespresso? And related to Dolce Gusto, what's the progress of that business in the U.S. and other European markets, say versus Tassimo, or say versus <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:35:55), particularly in Western Europe? A little bit of a color would help. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pablo. Thanks, Pablo. Just on China, I mean, as you I think know well, it's a relatively small business, it's only a few hundred million, so it's not exactly material to the results discussion. So, I haven't got a lot of information there. But I mean, the market shares, the Nielsen market shares, are around mid-single digit. They probably understate our true market share because we are very present in rural areas where Nielsen isn't. But the business is growing very meaningfully in double-digits, performing very well. We've seen a very material acceleration in traction across infant formula all the way through the Growing Up milk business as well in China. That whole business is absolutely flying at the moment. So, it's doing really, really well.</p>
          <p>The market share, as I say, is not really a great &#x2013; is not in itself particularly accurate. And also, we haven't &#x2013; the reason that we would also say that market share is not accurate is we've been growing that business double-digit, I mean over 20% for couple of years. And the market share data point hasn't moved. And there aren't that many babies being born in China. So, we're clearly doing well, coming back from a difficult period two or four years ago and we're very excited about it, but it's not a material part of the Nestl&#xE9; Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:37:39) the material market right, it's one of the largest markets for formula in the world. I mean, you're big in Latin America for baby formula, not in China. That's my point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and that's why I'd say fantastic we're doing so 're well in that business at the moment in China, it's absolutely a key market for us and we're growing, as I say, well over 20% and it's going really well. On Nespresso, the performance is as you said is, I haven't got the percentage that the Europe relative to the rest of the world. It wouldn't have changed very much from the last number we gave you because Europe is, as you know, over 80% growing double digit. So, it's not going to change materially from the last number we gave you.</p>
          <p>The business is continuing to deliver double-digit growth in its big markets. It's growing much faster in the U.S., as you would expect of a smaller base. Again, similar levels of growth that we saw in the first quarter and we provided you number then of around 50%. Dolce Gusto, as we said, is growing over 50% globally. Again, it's a predominantly European business, so the growth in Europe continues to be very, very strong.</p>
          <p>We provided you &#x2013; I forgot the number now, 420 basis points, 480 basis points in market share gain in system sales in Europe. So, that business clearly has real traction. In the U.S., for the U.S. launch which is primarily in Wal-Mart, that launch is going fine, and the really good news about the launch is that where we have sold the machines, the capsule consumption is higher than we're seeing in most other markets. So the take up, once machines are sold, is very, very strong and that that is the reason why we are very bullish about that project going forward in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just have a follow on? I mean obviously, you know it's very early days and you're doing well in the U.S. with Dolce Gusto, but given the explosive growth of Green Mountain and their huge size in single-serve coffee, will it make sense for Nestl&#xE9; to actually make Dolce Gusto take us for the Green Mountain, or that would be <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:39:50)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our strategy on Dolce Gusto is clearly one that is focused on our total control and execution. We're doing &#x2013; that's a strategy, that's a strategy we are executing around the world, and that's the model we have in the U.S. and elsewhere. We are not going to change that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also, I want you to remember the U.S market is growing &#x2013; well, indeed the global market is growing, but also the U.S. market is growing very rapidly in systems. So, it's not about having all to be in one system, those driven for number of players in that market and we clearly intent to be one of the leaders. We are, we are the leader at the moment globally.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Cox [Kepler Capital Markets SA (Switzerland)]. Please go ahead, your line is now open.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Hi, Jon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on your own shares &#x2013; the investments you have in your own shares and running parallel to the buyback program, I'm just wondering when you actually investing your own shares, I guess you're not using that straight from trading line, you're just coming into the market when you feel there's an opportune moment. Or are you saying basically you won't cancel the CHF5 billion worth of shares that are to be completed in the next, I guess in the next couple of weeks? You won't cancel them next year, that's the first question. Just secondly, just on the BabyNes, you said it's going very well in Switzerland. Just wondering, does that mean you will do a sort of more of an international launch? Should we expect that over the next couple of months and quarters? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jon, thanks. The shares, yeah, the treasury shares are bought in the normal market, whereas the share buyback is done on the second trading line. Yes, the intention is what we do in share buybacks will be cancelled. So, hope that deals with your first question. I think, BabyNes, we had a very successful launch based on our criteria for the project and maybe as we progress later on in the year we would like to give you an update, Jon.</p>
          <p>But right now, the focus is trying to get the launch right in all the dynamics that included in making such &#x2013; taking such an important innovation to the marketplace. So, we're very focused in getting the Swiss, which is the first market right, and building and using the learning's there to build the program for the other markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just to come back to this &#x2013; you investing in your own shares. You know, how should we think about that going forward then? Will you just act opportunistically if you think the share is looking interesting from however you might want to value it and you just come in and buy the stock in every tier of that every half year when you announce? Or which you announce in the stock exchange in the normal way depending if key ratio are hit on the Swiss Stock Exchange regulations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you &#x2013; I don't think we will get to a level where we have to make any disclosure. It is an activity we engage in from time to time. But as I said, it's not a priority for us, it's one way of managing the cash flows in the short-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before we did our &#x2013; before we did our share buybacks, the share buybacks through cancellation, we &#x2013; I think if I remember well back in 2004, we had only ever announced a treasury share amount annually, not biannually. So, I don't think you can expect to have regular updates on whether we're buying or selling our treasury shares.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Marshall-Lockyer [Jefferies International Ltd.]. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning Roddy, good morning, Jim. Just two questions, one with the machine-based systems, can you just update us on specialty and the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:44:10) machine and could you give us some indication as to the approaching deadline in respect to the IP losses around perhaps 2012, I think I'm correct in saying?</p>
          <p>And the second question is could you give us some more granularity in perspective in Eastern Europe, including Russia, but particularly on Poland, Russia and Ukraine, how this part of the business trended in the first half and what you're expecting there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On specialty, to start specialty has continued to perform very well. It's to our expectations. We're not going to give you any numbers because it's so clearly not material at this stage. The clear focus now, obviously, is to have a very successful Christmas season as with the other systems machines, the big sell-in for the machines is during the Christmas season with gifting. But so far, we're very pleased with how specialty is going.</p>
          <p>On what you call the capital 2012 issue, I mean, fundamentally we have a whole series of protections around the Nespresso systems. So, there isn't one issue that's going to be material to us. I've got no update to give you because it's &#x2013; there is nothing new that happens. It's just a situation that we will have some patents come off of protection in 2012, but all the other patents will continue to be on protection. And there's no material business risk to Nespresso.</p>
          <p>Russia is bit of a mixed picture. The &#x2013; we'll start with the zone, the impulse business, primarily chocolate, which is our big zone business continues to suffer from poor consumer sentiment. The other less impulse, more fundamental businesses like the soluble coffee business, the soup business, are doing very well. If you go &#x2013; and ice cream is also doing okay. If you go out of the zone into nutrition, the nutrition business is doing terrifically well, double-digit growth now for a number of years and no let up there. Going very well. And also, I mentioned in my presentation pet care also performing very well in Russia.</p>
          <p>Ukraine, equally &#x2013; well Ukraine, especially, performing very well indeed across the business. We've been quite active, as you know, in recent years in acquisitions in Ukraine. We have a super business in Ukraine. We've also recently opened up service &#x2013; our shared service center for Europe in Ukraine and that business is performing very, very well indeed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Poland, where I think we're having reasonable progress in the first half. So, we're quite happy with the markets that you mentioned. Russia continues to improve, albeit, a bit slowly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other news in Russia is that we're opening a Nescaf&#xE9; factory imminently, maybe just opened. So, that's a big benefit for us in terms of leveling the playing field, having local manufacturing in Nescaf&#xE9; in Russia. Okay. Any -</p>
