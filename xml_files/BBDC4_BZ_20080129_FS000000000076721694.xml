        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and welcome to our conference call. Since the middle of 2007 we have been passing through a period marked by strong turbulence in international markets, generating substantial volatility, uncertainty regarding the impact of the subprime crisis, the credit squeeze in the United States and indirectly in the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>In this scenario, Brazil remains relatively immune, even obtaining an upgrade on its rating by Moody's. With that, Brazil is sustaining just one notch below the investment grade, which we expect to achieve after the middle of this year by at least one of the three leading rating agencies.</p>
          <p>The Brazilian economy grew close to 5.3% in 2007 and should evolve at 4.5% in 2008. By saying this, we conclude that the Brazilian GDP will be impacted by around 1% in the current year due to the global instability.</p>
          <p>Our Economy Department projects an inflation of 4.5% in this year, virtually the same percentage reached in 2007. In other words, the Central Bank should manage to get very close to the annual inflationary target despite the pressure in demand in some sectors. On the other hand, in 2008 the base rate, the SELIC, should remain the same level up to the end of this year. It implies that the gradual reduction in interest rates should be postponed to 2009.</p>
          <p>We are not noticing this same pressure from the market regarding interest rates as we had in the past. Our economy is growing at a faster and more sustainable pace. We forecast SNI with relatively stability for the FX rate, with an average 1.75 reals per U.S. dollar rate during the year.</p>
          <p>Loans should increase by approximately 24% in 2008, very close to the growth of 27% in 2007. Therefore, the credit to the GDP ratio is expected to rise from the current 34.8 to 40.8%. Our projections also point to the maintenance of the current delinquency ratios in the banking system. As a result of all of these, Bradesco registered an all-time record net income of more than R$8 billion in 2007, 58.5% higher than in the previous year.</p>
          <p>The Insurance, Pension Plans and Savings Bond Group contributed with R$2.4 billion to the bottom line or 29% of the consolidated net income. Premiums reached R$21.5 billion, 14% higher than in the previous year, surpassing the growth in the markets. Our 86% combined ratios is a benchmark in international market. Bradesco stockholders' equity surpassed R$30.4 billion, 23.2% jump compared to 2006.</p>
          <p>The efficiency ratio accumulated over the past 12 months stood at 41.8%, an improvement comparing to the 42.1% recorded in 2006. It is worth to mention that in 2008 we are going to launch an internal campaign called Performance and Excellence, which should stimulate our branch network to be even more efficient. Taxes and contributions accounted for 85% of our adjusted net income, totaling R$6.8 billion. The return on the average stockholder's equity reached 31.4 % in 2007.</p>
          <p>On the operational front, we would particularly like to draw your attention to the 36.5% growth in the loan portfolio in the year and to the 12.8% in the fourth quarter 2007. Bradesco's performance in loan book growth surpassed the industry's.</p>
          <p>We point out the 45.2% adjusted on SMEs, the 35% growth of individuals and the 29.5% evolution of large corporates. If we include sureties, guarantees and credit card receivables, Bradesco portfolio surpasses R$161 billion, an evolution of the 38.9% in the year and of 15.2% in the fourth quarter 2007. The strong increase in the loan portfolio was followed by an improvement in asset quality, since the AA to C-rated operations represented 93.3% of our book, better than the 92.1% ratio in 2006.</p>
          <p>As we did last year, we will continue to foster partnership in private label cards and we highlighted the deals in 2007 with the retailer <mark type="inaudible" />, adding relevant customer base. In mortgaging we originated more than R$4 billion in operations along 2007, a 91.1% jump over the same period of 2006, financing more than 33,000 homes.</p>
          <p>We had a challenging target in 2008, since we intend to originate R$5.3 billion in mortgaging operations. As a demonstration of our strengths in this product, Bradesco is the leading private banking mortgager, with a 22.1% market share according to ABECIP, the Brazilian Association of Mortgage and Savings Entities. Regarding BNDES Onlendings, we had been 45th consecutive year the leading bank in the market with 19% market share. Our investment bank, BBI, participated in more than 60 deals in 2007 with Brazil's most important companies in a total volume of R$25.4 billion.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter we took an important step forward in establishing a brokerage firm in London, which will be in charge to support our clients distributing &#x2013; distributing fixed income in active deals throughout the European and global market. The process of internationalization of our asset management operations is starting in 2007, with an important operational agreement signed with Banco de Chile. The so-called green and yellow fund focused to the Chilean retail market raised a sum of $160 million in October, consolidating this product as the largest guaranteed capital fund in Chile.</p>
          <p>In Trade Finance, Bradesco increased the volume of export contracts, surpassing the equivalent of $39 billion, a 20.5% market share. The volume of $17.4 billion in important transactions allowed Bradesco to reach a 16.1% market share. In Export Financing, Bradesco reached $14.7 billion in important financing, surpassed the mark of $1.8 billion. We also conclude our studies for the expansion of our export and import customer service platform and we intend to aggregate six new offices, which we will be located in places with the highest potential of growth.</p>
          <p>Speaking about quality of services, we are proud to inform that Bradesco is not being included in the Brazilian Central Bank's list of banks with the most complaints by its customer for 23 consecutive months. And in order to improve the quality of our customer service network, to attain the needs of our 36 million customers and taking into consideration that we should raise our client base by 1.75 million, 2008, we are continuing to strongly invest in technology.</p>
          <p>As part of our IT improvement project, hardware, software and communications will be enhanced by state-of-the-art equipment. This big replacement expansion project will be concluded by the end of the year, benefiting all our branches and mini-branches. Meanwhile, we have installed a new high-speed communication network in our headquarter and in the most important buildings of the Bradesco Group.</p>
          <p>We have recently concluded the construction of our new IT site. In this month we began to install computer, equipment and system. We have initiated our first processing activities, which will be gradually speeded up along 2008. We continue to invest heavily in Information Security, especially as related to Internet, ATM, call center transactions of our customers.</p>
          <p>In line with what has become a Bradesco tradition, we would now like to go over some of the year's highlights in sustainability. The maintenance of Bradesco among the select group of 318 companies worldwide composing the Dow Jones sustainability index. The inclusion of Bradesco for the third consecutive year in the S&#xE3;o Paulo Stock Exchange Sustainability Index, with a growing participation in the portfolio from 15.8% in 2006 to 19.6% in 2007.</p>
          <p>Concerning the Bank of the Planet concept and according to what was announced last November, we establish a partnership with the Government of the State of Amazonas, becoming a co-founder of the Amazonas Foundation, which aims to protect one of the biggest natural resource of our planet, the Amazon rainforest. We are in this project committed to invest R$70 million along the next five years to support this foundation through the launch of a new products.</p>
          <p>We are also very proud of the work done by Bradesco Foundation for more than 51 years, providing free education with a high quality to more than 2.5 million students, of which 660,000 just over the last 10 years.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would also again like to thank our employees their dedication and commitment to our goals. After Jean's presentation we will be available to answer any further questions you might have. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>We will be following a 32-slide PowerPoint presentation with the content similar to the previous quarters in order to facilitate your analysis.</p>
          <p>Slide number 2. In the slide Number 2 we are summarizing the main items of Bradesco's performance, as mentioned by Milton in his speech. We would like to inform that Bradesco received the ISO 9001 certification concerned to the publication of its financial information, which is a proof of our dedication with the quality of information and the processes we are adopting.</p>
          <p>Slide number 3. The non-recurring events that affected net income in this quarter and in other periods are disclosed in this slide. In the first quarter of 2007 we fully amortized goodwill in the amount of R$140 million. Additionally, as one can see, we built R$232 million in supplementary provisions for severance and 74 million provisions for economic plan. In 2007 as a whole we provisioned R$274 million for economic plans.</p>
          <p>As disclosed in our press releases, Bradesco recorded R$405 million gain, referring to the partial sale of the Bovespa Holding, R$178 million and BM&amp;F, R$227 million. We also booked a gain of R$64 million in this quarter relative to our added investment of Indiana Seguros. As a result, our adjusted net income for the fourth quarter totaled R$1.85 billion.</p>
          <p>Please note that all the comparative analysis and ratios you are seeing in this presentation, in the press release and in the fact book, take into consideration the adjusted net income by non-recurring events.</p>
          <p>Slide number 4. In this slide one can see our net income evolution in recent quarters, as well as in a year-over-year comparison between 2007 and 2006, which shows that our annual net income increased by 13.3% from 6.36 to R$7.21 billion. Annual EPS raised by 12%, closing the period at R$3.57. It is also worth to mention the improvement of our efficiency ratio, moving down from 42.1 to 41.8%. This reduction in ratio was motivated by several improvements in processes Bradesco is benefiting.</p>
          <p>Based on our projections we believe that our efficiency ratio should remain in the same level over the next two to three years due to the solid expansion in distribution and to the IT improvement program, which will be concluded in 2010. Investments related to the acquisition of public and private payrolls also affect the calculation of this ratio. We project that after the end of 2010 we will be able to gradually improve the cost-to-income ratio again.</p>
          <p>Slide number 5. Total assets reached R$341.2 billion, a 7.4% increase in the quarter and a 28.5% jump in the year. The increase was mainly due to the R$35 billion loan book growth and the R$17 billion increase in security, including guaranteeing assets of technical provisions. Considering the adjusted net income, the average annualized ROE stood at 29.4% in the fourth quarter and at 28.3% for the full year. Meanwhile, annualized return on average asset stood at 2.4% for the year.</p>
          <p>Bradesco's Capital Adequacy Ratio stood at 14% by the end of 2007 before the capital increase or 300 basis points above the required by the Brazilian Central Bank. This BIS ratio allows Bradesco to increase its loan book by R$80 billion. In simulation with numbers of December 2007 and considering the capital stock increase in March 2008 and under the terms of the Brazilian Central Bank's circular number 3367 relative to hedge of foreign investments our BIS ratio would be standing at 16.6%, of which 12.1% in tier 1. By the way, taking into consideration simulations under the Basel II rules, we believe Bradesco's capital adequacy ratio to be very comfortable.</p>
          <p>Slide number 6. Annualized gains mainly derived from the mark-to-market effect on the securities portfolio of available for sale and held to maturity securities, Bradesco surpassed the mark of R$4.7 billion. Annualized gains should be realized either when the bonds mature or if we see the convenience to proceed so remembering all that those annualized gains do not take into consideration participations we hold in companies that are not listed at Serasa and Visanet. In the case of Visanet one should remember that Bradesco holds a 40% stake in the company.</p>
          <p>Slide number 7. On this slide, we present Bradesco's net income breakdown. As you can see, the relative participation of fees and loan operations increased in the year-over-year comparison. Most of the fees and commission generated derived from the solid expansion of Bradesco's client base and the increase in the volume of transactions. The share of insurance Pension Plan and Savings Bond stood at 31%. Our expectation points out to an increasing participation of these businesses, as for example, health provisions will no longer be billed, and health insurance will begin to contribute to the insurance group's bottom line.</p>
          <p>Slide number 8. We present here in this slide a summary of our financial statement, showing the main variations in the result, which will be analyzed on a more in-depth manner in the following slides. The negative variation on the insurance operational result draws our attention and is due to one, the higher constitution of technical reserves on pension plan products vis-&#xE0;-vis issued premiums, a variable and seasonal effect depending on the type of product sold; two, the seasonal increase in claims in the fourth quarter; and three, lower premiums in the fourth quarter based on the dis-investment in Indiana, which no longer is consolidated and impacted premiums by close to R$155 million in the three month period.</p>
          <p>Slide number 9. Our adjusted net interest income in the quarter increased by 7.5% in the fourth quarter, despite a decline in the average SELIC from 11.7 to 10.8%. The growth was mainly fueled by higher gains from interest earning assets, which grew by 5%. The increase in volume of R$476 million more than compensated the 211 million decline in strength. Gains relative to non-interest earning assets grew by 25% if compared to the last quarter or 152 million and are mainly derived by larger credit recoveries, which traditionally occur in the last quarter of every year.</p>
          <p>On a year-over-year comparison and taking into consideration that the average SELIC fell by 3.2% from 15 to 11.8%, the gains in interest earning assets grew by 11% or by R$4.1 billion in volume, more than offsetting the decrease of the margin due to the spread contraction, which corresponded to a R$2.2 billion effect. Our projections for 2008 point out to a stability of the net interest margin close to 7.5%.</p>
          <p>Slide number 10. On this slide we present net interest income and margin derived by interest earning assets. The conclusion is that the adjusted net interest income has been following a gradual nominal growth. The evolution of loans to individuals and SMEs were fundamental to the net interest margin income.</p>
          <p>Slide number 11. This slide shows the breakdown of adjusted net interest income. It is worth noticing the increasing relevance of loan operations, which accounted for 67% of the net interest income in 2007 vis-&#xE0;-vis 63% in 2006. The drop of the relative participation of funding and insurance in the year is relative to the reduction of the average base rates from 15 to 11.8%.</p>
          <p>Slide number 12. In this chart we have a summary of Bradesco's net gains in loan operations. The blue line shows the evolution of the growth gains in loans deducted by the cost of opportunity. The red line shows the evolution of the allowance for loan losses deducted by discounts and added by the recovery. The black line, the line in the middle, shows a consistent nominal growth in the numbers, climbing by 14.3% vis-&#xE0;-vis 2006. This line basically shows that our strategy for loan book expansion is correct.</p>
          <p>Slide number 13. Bradesco's total loan portfolio reached R$161 billion in 2007, 15.2% higher than in the previous quarter and a 38.9% year-over-year jump. The loan books breakdown remains relatively the same, with a growth in all the business segments, SMEs, large corporates and last, but not least, individuals.</p>
          <p>Slide number 14 and 15. On these slides we show a breakdown of Bradesco's main credit line for companies and individuals. In the corporate segment one can see the main growth of the following products: Working capital, leasing, mortgage and credit card. It is also worth noticing that in the corporate segment we had a substantial growth in sureties and guarantees, with a 64% annual growth. For individuals, the main credit lines were agriculture, leasing and mortgage. Leasing by the way mainly of brand new cars.</p>
          <p>Slide number 16. On this slide one can see the behavior of our asset quality and the adequacy of our provision. If we compare total provisions, the first line in red, with those required by the Brazilian Central Bank criteria, the second line in gray, one can conclude that Bradesco has an additional provision for loan losses of R$1.1 billion. In addition if you look at the historical behavior of effective losses, which are the write-offs of loans overdue by more than 12 months compared with the year before, the line in purple, and a curve of non-performing loans classified at E to H, the line in green, we conclude that those two lines are strongly correlated.</p>
          <p>Therefore, one can assume that in one year from now our effective losses should be close to 4%. We may also conclude that our effective additional provisions for loan losses are standing at R$2.6 billion and not so much R$1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide number 17. One can notice the delinquency ratio above 90 days is declining in all the curves we are seeing in this slide since the second-half of 2007. We would draw your attention to the third line in gray, depicting the behavior of the delinquency of loans to small and middle-size companies, which has been declining steadily and reached one of its lowest levels over the last two months in 2007. Even though the acceleration of the demand for loans helps to improve the delinquency ratio, if we strip out these effect we notice a better asset quality trend for 2008.</p>
          <p>Slide number 18. The acquisition of BMC has been a success, as Bradesco's own origination of payroll deductible loans totaled 104% growth in the year. Together with vehicle financing, credit cards and mortgage, payroll deductible loans is one of the credit lines we expect the most growth in 2008. As we have mentioned before, Bradesco is focusing on generating its own loans in this segment.</p>
          <p>Slide number 19. Mortgage is expanding at a very strong pace and reached record high origination in the last quarter of 2007, surpassing the R$1.3 billion mark. The 2007 origination target of R$3 billion was exceeded by 35%, reaching almost R$4.2 billion. In 2008 we are planning to originate R$5.3 billion in operations, which shows Bradesco's confidence in the Brazilian economy. According to ABECIP, the Brazilian Association of Mortgage and Savings Entities, Bradesco is the leading private banking mortgage with a 22.1% market share.</p>
          <p>In order to increase our business in this area we created a new website called Bradesco <mark type="inaudible" />, focused on providing services to help homebuyers and on strengthening partnerships with real estate developers and brokers.</p>
          <p>Slide number 20. Regarding fees, Bradesco is focused on expanding even more volumes of operations based on the client-based growth in all the different lines you can see in this slide. Bradesco's segmentation had already been concluded and we have no doubt that this process aggregated and will add more businesses and revenues, helping to leverage our fee generation.</p>
          <p>The behavior of our expenses are shown in this slide. Despite Bradesco's expansion, the ratio comparing operational expense and total asset sale on a year-over-year basis and remained flat in the quarter. The increase of non-structural expenses in this quarter regarding higher profit sharing of Bradesco's management and employees is due to the strong performance achieved in the period. In the fourth quarter we were impacted by seasonality with additional expenses in advertisements and third-party services relative to the partnerships we have with several retailers.</p>
          <p>Slide number 22. Over the last two years fees increased by 47% vis-&#xE0;-vis administrative and personnel expenses, which increased by 29%. As a result, Bradesco reached a coverage ratio of 80.2% by year-end. This underlines Bradesco's constant concern to always improve its efficiencies, while increasing volumes and maintaining strong cost control.</p>
          <p>Slide number 23. Funding growth has been outstanding in demanding and savings deposit, which increased by 29% and 9%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2007 and by 40 and 19% in 2007 full year. We noticed a seasonal increase in demand deposits in the last week of December 2007, influenced by the extension of the CPMF tax, which made clients maintain proceeds in their checking accounts for later investing. And if we consider average balance of demand deposits, the amount in 2007 stood at R$20 billion vis-&#xE0;-vis R$16 billion in 2006, a 28% increase.</p>
          <p>Bradesco keeps the leadership in these types of funds amongst private banks and no longer we will have a competitive advantage of those fundings because they are going to grow over time.</p>
          <p>In asset management, investments in equities were the best performers, recording a solid jump of 47% in the quarter and of 176% in the year. In order to provide a better understanding, this would be slide Number 24, of our Insurance Private Pension Plan and Saving Bonds operations, we are presenting a summary of our Insurance Group income statement on this slide.</p>
          <p>In 2007 Bradesco's Insurance Group showed a growth of 9.1% in its net income, reaching a total amount of almost R$2.4 billion compared to R$2.1 billion in 2006, posting a 29% return on average equity up to November 2007. Bradesco's Insurance Group held a 23% market share in net income. By the way, I would like to point out the improvement in our press release concerning insurance, as we are opening more disclosure, new breakdowns and more detailed information.</p>
          <p>Slide number 25. Annual premiums and revenues grew by 13.7%, reaching R$21.5 billion, equivalent to 25% of the whole insurance market based on the available information as of November 2007. Bradesco is the leading company in the property and life insurance segment, as well as in open pension plan.</p>
          <p>Slides 26 and 27. Financial assets and guaranteeing assets relative to technical reserve reached R$67.7 billion, representing 37.8 of the total market. It is worth remembering that 80% of these assets correspond to the pension plan and VGBL investment portfolios. Total assets grew by 21.1% vis-&#xE0;-vis December 2006. Technical provisions reached R$58.5 billion or a 35.9% market share if we take into consideration the numbers of November again.</p>
          <p>We would also like to draw your attention to the volume of technical provisions in the health segment, more than R$3.2 billion, of which 1.3 billion were billed just over the last 12 months. Relative to Bradesco's health provisions, I would like to point out that assuming current market conditions, especially regarding levels of loses and the capacity of adjusting premiums in-line with the medical inflation, we believe our provisions are enough appropriate for the identified risks in terms of the respective technical loans.</p>
          <p>Slide number 28. As one can see, personnel and administrative costs improved both in terms of the quarter and in terms of the year.</p>
          <p>Slide 29. The combined ratio shows the real operational efficiency of an insurance group, focus in claims and allowing the market to analyze if the underwriting policy is appropriate. We would highlight the 6.1% improvement over the last 12 months. The growth in the fourth quarter of this ratio was seasonal.</p>
          <p>Slide number 30. In 2007 Bradesco opened 152 full-size branches and expects to reach a total of 3,500 branches in three years from now. In the case of Banco Postal, we plan to increase the number of mini-branches from 5,700 to 8,000 within the next 18 months. In the same period the number of corresponded points should increase from 11,000 to 15,000.</p>
          <p>We added 1 million new clients in the year of 2007 and the number of current account holders rose from 17 million in December '06 to 18.9 million in December '07. In addition our market capitalization increased by 29% in 2007.</p>
          <p>Slide 31. Even with the turmoil in the market we are experiencing since the middle of last year, Bradesco achieved all its forecasts, as can be seen on Slide number 31. I would like to emphasize that the loan portfolio figures on the slide, as mentioned, do not take into consideration credit cards, sureties and guarantees.</p>
          <p>Slide number 32. In this quarter we are presenting a more detailed breakdown of our 2008 guidance, particularly for the loan portfolio, which is now broken down by segments: SMEs, individuals and large corporates as before and now open products that we believe will record the largest growth in 2008, like vehicle financing, credit cards, mortgage and payroll deductible loans.</p>
          <p>Slide number 33. This slide shows our economic department's forecast for 2008 and 2009 regarding GDP, base rate, inflation and the FX rate. The highlight here in the end of the year forecast would be the base rate maintaining the same level as now a days.</p>
          <p>Finally, highlighting the effects relative to recent and expected changes in taxes and contributions, we would like to inform that based on the 2007 figures, the effect of higher social contribution will be of around R$380 million, offset by the R$252 million of CPMF tax we no longer have to collect. Additionally, deferred tax assets will be growing by around R$1.1 billion, compensating higher expenses for social contribution in 2008 and in 2009.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. My question is related to your guidance, specifically for fee income growing between 5 and 10%. And as we can see in your presentation you were conservative last year in most line items. But you're looking for a very substantial slowdown in the growth rate from over 20% to this 5 to 10% range. Can you help us understand, is this more competition, are you planning on lowering prices, particularly given the much higher increase in operational expenses that you're looking for, as well as the branch expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jason. Basically, this guidance actually has been standing at a much lower level than years before, based on &#x2013; not from increasing competition, which is already very strong. It's basically an impact on fees caused and derived by changes in the Brazilian Central Bank criteria. Actually we are obliged to disclose more to the customers all the packages, the bundled packages to our customers, and based on that we are basically expecting a smaller growth in the fees &#x2013; which by the way, Bradesco has been the only bank able to continue to grow over the last quarters. But definitely it's not so much based on competition, it's much more based on the changes in the Central Bank. At least it's a guidance, it's a perspective, but I would say we are working with much lower levels of fee income growth for 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean, is this more than just the transparency of disclosing fees, because that to me would be more of a competitive nature to reducing the outlook for fee growth, but is this related to removal of, let's say, prepayment fees? Is that the hit to the expected growth in this line item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, we definitely consider that the level of competition in Brazil is already very strong. It doesn't mean that 2008 will be intensified much more. It is already very intense, and this fee that you are talking about is one of the fees that actually impact the lower growth expectation for 2008. It's included in our estimate.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everybody. First couple of questions, first on your insurance and pension plan business, I want to dig into the numbers a little bit deeper. You've indicated, Jean, that you expect the proportion of earnings from the insurance businesses to increase from 31% going forward, largely because the absence of the premium deficiency reserves in the health business, but you also have a lot of moving parts there. You sold Indiana. I think you had some non-recurring gains like the sale of Indiana, Arcelor that were booked in the insurance business. Can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of how much that can grow? Could it go to 35% over the next couple years, and how should we think about the earnings growth momentum in the insurance business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Before passing the floor to Samuel Monteiro, the CFO of the Insurance Group, I would say we are working with a relative participation of insurance within the bottom line at close to 35%. So let me just move to Samuel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, how are you, fine?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm good. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the 35 represents the increase of the cost from the health, because the health business would be the best in the past almost zero as a result. And now we &#x2013; I would say to project for 2008 a little bit about 35 million for each &#x2013; monthly would be achieved a R$500 million as a profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I understand that, but let me ask another question. The 31% that you indicate in your release, does that include gains that you booked from the sale of Indiana Seguros, and also does it include the gain of over R$300 million from Arcelor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because it would imply that the recurring number is much lower as a percentage of earning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. No really, the Indiana results is very small amount.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very, very small.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the non-recurring &#x2013; you did have 65 million of non-recurring gains, is that in the 31%? Also the Arcelor sale, the sale of Arcelor, I thought was booked in the insurance company, if I'm not mistaken. Also is the 31% of total net income for 2007 &#x2013; does that include that sale, the gain on that sale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That sale &#x2013; the sale of the shares of the company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It includes about net of income tax about R$40 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Maybe we can go offline, but I guess the question also was Arcelor, which was a R$350 gain. Was that included in the insurance results in '07?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that &#x2013; so if you strip that gain out, is it really 31% of earnings that the insurance company is generating, or is it much less than that?</p>

And then secondly you mentioned, just a quickie, you mentioned, Jean, that if you did a simulation of your capital adequacy ratio under Basel II, you would be comfortable. Can you expand on that? Does that mean you would have a higher or lower Basel rate than 14%?</p>

          <p>Excuse me; our next question comes from Mr. Mario Pierry with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning. I have two questions. First is on your forecast for net interest income in '08 for growth of 16 to 20%. I wanted to know if that is before or after provision charges? If it's before, what are your expectations for provisions? You have clearly shown a significant improvements in asset quality. I was wondering if you expect that to continue into '08, especially given the strong growth in lending? My second question has to do with the level of interest rates in Brazil. If we look at the futures curve, it's indicating about a 200 basis points increase in the SELIC by the end of the year. What impact would that have on your loan growth forecast if the SELIC did indeed rise 200 basis points this year, and in particular what impact would that have on your housing originations? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mario, I didn't get the second question. What was that related? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To market rates or the SELIC rates in Brazil. If we look at the futures market, it's pricing in a 200 basis points increase in the SELIC this year. So what impact would that have on your loan growth forecast, if indeed the SELIC increased by 200 basis points this year? We know that from what you've shown us that you expect this SELIC to stay stable, 11.25%, but what if the SELIC does rise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mario. Basically responding your first question, I would say we don't give the guidance about provisioning, but what we can say is that if you at the slide number 17, where we highlight the delinquency of more than 90 days, I would say the expectation for 2008 would be a number of 3.3% for the whole book of Bradesco being relatively maintained over the year.</p>
          <p>And for your second question, actually we are strong believers that the SELIC rate will be basically the same as we have nowadays, but let's suppose that the SELIC rate goes up. I would say the expectations would be of more impact maybe on the GDP than on the potential of the loan book growth. If you increase, for example, the SELIC on the rates for individuals, actually the implication is not so high. When you look at the loans with SMEs, the implication is a little bit higher, but I would say the idea that we have is that it should not affect substantially the bottom line of the company. Even if you have a small increase in the SELIC, which is what you expect, the impact will not be so high.</p>
          <p>To give an idea, if we make a sensitivity analysis, for every 1% increase in the SELIC, we would have a bottom line decline of &#x2013; increase, sorry &#x2013; of R$250 million. So if SELIC goes up by 1%, you have an impact of R$250 million in the bottom line, up and not down. This is taking into consideration all the balance sheet, all the operations, not only loans on a standalone basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jean. Couple of questions. One, I'm curious to know why you decided for this quarter not to apply the Bacen Rule 3367 and reported a higher BIS ratio. You do the pro forma analysis, but you are still not using that rule. Any reason why you're not? And the second question is, if you could elaborate more on your guidance for loan growth and net interest income? If you are assuming that net interest income will grow a bit less than your assumption for the loan portfolio, it is implicit that you're still assuming some additional &#x2013; much less so than in the past, but some additional compression in spreads on margin. Why is that if you're expecting SELIC to stay flat throughout the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Daniel. I would say we didn't apply on this possibility for the letter to the Central Bank because if you apply, you have to continue and to keep the same strategy on your positioning in FX during six months. So actually as we have capital to finance our growth, we believe to be free and then to do the strategy of our FX positions the way that we want. If we apply the rule, we move up in terms of the BIS ratio, but we have to keep the same strategy.</p>
          <p>It doesn't mean that we will change the strategy, but it would effectively make Bradesco more committed to keep the same positioning strategy, and this was not so much the case as we have plenty of capital, more than R$80 billion of loan book growth, considering if the equity doesn't change.</p>
          <p>So let's suppose about the profit growth that we expect, actually we have plenty funding to finance our growth. In terms of the guidance, actually one thing that you have to keep in mind is the fact that the loan book growth is growing, the loan book growth is growing more for individuals. But on the other way around, what has been growing a lot are credit lines where the spreads are a little bit lower; for example, pay deductible loans, vis-&#xE0;-vis for example, what you gain in a overdraft account.</p>
          <p>But on the other way around, the risk is also much more limited. So at the end we are seeing a lot of individuals, for example, moving more into payroll deductible loans and some other types of loans where the spreads on a standalone basis are a little bit lower for us. But on the other way around, the risk that we take is also lower.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning. My question is again regarding the insurance business. Could you remind us what the net impact of the sale of Indiana had on the operating revenue? I don't &#x2013; I'm not referring to the one-off gain from the sale, but the impact that not having Indiana had on your revenue in the third &#x2013; well, not just revenue, but net income in the fourth quarter?

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning or good afternoon again. Just a quick question, a follow-up question to Jason's earlier question on fees. How much &#x2013; I'd just ask it I guess a slightly different way. How much of the reduction in your fee income guidance that is related to the Central Bank requirement has to do with greater transparency versus the fact that banks are now &#x2013; have to offer certain services and products related to demanded savings accounts free of charge that previously you may have been charging fees for? So how much of it is related to the elimination of certain fees on demand and savings account and prepayment fees as well and how much of it do you think is related to just greater transparency and the margin pressure that that encompasses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So basically if you were stripping out the effect, you know that we have been growing the fees on more than &#x2013; by more than 20% a year for long period for some years and if you were to strip out the effect of these changes, actually we would be expecting to grow the fees in this year close to 20%. But obviously this is a guidance and we will try as much as we can to compensate the effect of lower fees by selling other products or having additional gains in margins or others. But I would say responding to your question it would be close to 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you are saying that if normalizing for the changes it would be 20% growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But I guess my question is of the impact that you see of the changes in your &#x2013; so now you are assuming 5 to 10% growth, so you are basically saying that these new regulations reduce your fee income growth by 10 to 15%. How much of that is related to just greater transparency and how much of it is related to actual measures that the new regulation imposes, controlling what you can offer, what you can charge for fees for specific price controls that are introduced as opposed to just this encouraging greater transparency and greater competition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, basically what we are saying is that these changes in regulation they basically could impact by half the growth of the fees, which you move from 20 to 10. But the most important part is actually not so much the part of transparency, but the fee that we would no longer have, for example, for loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know that we have a processing fees that we charge for the loans mainly for individuals, but also for companies and actually this is a fact. The idea is to create specific bundled packages for individuals in a way to compensate and also we believe that as Bradesco is more retail-oriented, actually as we believe that Brazil will be growing by some 4.5%, we have in our understanding more ways to compensate the effect.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I just wanted to just confirm on the guidance that you gave in relation to the extra tax for next year, my understanding is you said that it would be an extra R$380 million tax cost, but offset by savings from non-payment to CPMF, that's 252. So the net impact would then be around about a R$130 million, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's correct. But the 380 is calculated for nine months &#x2013; for eight months, sorry &#x2013; and going forward in 2009 you would have basically a higher level because you would basically &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> you divide by 8 and multiple by 12. So it would be a little bit higher and what we have said additionally in terms of guidance is that the increase in deferred tax assets, they should compensate in 2009 this effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And with the deferred tax asset will we then likely see an exceptional gain next quarter of that 1.1 billion as the tax asset is revalued upwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a second. We would be in the quarter recognizing this effect under the stock of tax credit, but the gains will be coming over the next period, so it's not in the quarter.</p>

          <p>Excuse me, our next question comes from Mr. Juan Partida with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I just have a quick follow-up question. Apart from the recent changes to the fee income, to the regulation on fees or to the charging of fees, are you seeing any other potential threat to fee income revenue? I mean just following the example of Mexico where you've had a similar progression, they also had some pressure on credit card fees and merchant fees from credit card transactions. Are you seeing any risk that those fees will also be put under pressure?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you don't see any additional regulatory pressure apart from what was recently announced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Excuse me; our next question comes from Mr. Boris Molina with Santander Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I have a question regarding dividend policy. We have seen that the share of payouts in terms of interest on capital have been increasing as a proportion of total payouts from around 70% in '06 to around 56% in '07. Could you give us some guidance regarding what the mix will be in '08 and '09 and maybe something more specific regarding the total amount of tax benefit from interest on capital that we can calculate that's been around 500 million per year over the last couple of years? So should we expect this to remain at these levels, decline or increase? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually the level depends a lot on the behavior of the long-term interest rate and the long-term interest rate is already 6.5% and does not have a very feasible impact that it should be raising over the coming years. So the idea is basically to look at the equity of Bradesco to compare with the long-term interest rate. We can distribute interest on capital up to this certain level and deduct from the income tax. So I would say nothing very relevant over the coming periods, as long-term interest rate is already standing low, it's standing at 6.5%. So just a calculation that your have to do on your equity base of Bradesco.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I just have a quick follow-up question on <mark type="inaudible" /> question actually. An increase on your deferred tax assets by R$1.1 billion, would that put any pressure on your capital ratios?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a second. Actually the net effect is positive. It doesn't imply on a lower BIS Ratio perspective for Bradesco.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So then &#x2013; okay. So you wouldn't have any problem in doing that. Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So thank you for participating. Just adding to Boris' question, every 1% change in the long-term interest rate has an effect on the bottom line of some R%100 million and the long-term interest rate is already standing very low. So actually even if there is a decline or increase, this definitively should not be substantial compared with the company posting more than $3.7 billion of profit a year. Thank you for participating and anything you need, please just give us a call or send us an email. Bye.</p>
