      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Regina. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. I'm here with Tom Ryan, Chairman, President and CEO of CVS Caremark, who will provide a business update; and Dave Rickard, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will provide a financial review and guidance.</p>
          <p>During the Q&amp;A that follows, we ask that you to limit yourself to one to two questions including follow-ups so that we can get to as many analysts and investors as possible. Please note that we expect to file our 10-Q by end of day today and it will be available through our website at cvscaremark.com/investors.</p>
          <p>This morning, we'll discuss some non-GAAP financial measures in talking about our Company's performance, namely, free cash flow, EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of the non-GAAP items that I just mentioned as well as the reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website at cvscaremark/investors.com [sic] cvscaremark.com/investors .</p>
          <p>As always, today's call is being simulcast on our IR website. It will also be archived there for a one-month period following the call to make it easy for all investors to access it.</p>
          <p>Now before we continue, our attorneys have asked me to read the Safe Harbor statement. During this presentation, we'll make certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Accordingly, for these forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We strongly recommend that you become familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and that you review the section entitled, "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" in our most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q.</p>
          <p>And now, I will turn this over to our CEO, Tom Ryan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Nancy, and good morning everyone. We reported yet another excellent quarter this morning and I'm certainly pleased with our results across the Company especially given the economic climate we're in.</p>
          <p>Let me give a few of the highlights for the quarter. Total revenues increased 18%. Our PBM revenues increased 23%, while retail revenues were up 18. Retail comps up 5.7 and I should point out without any benefit from flu shots, our adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.76. If you exclude the $0.11 tax benefit, adjusted EPS was $0.65, up more than 8%. And we maintained a healthy balance sheet and generated more than 490 million of free cash flow for the quarter. So a pretty good quarter all the way around.</p>
          <p>On the retail side of our business, I'm happy to report that we continue to outperform the industry. We're achieving healthy share gains in pharmacy. Our share in markets in which we operate grew over 100 basis points.</p>
          <p>Total same-store sales increased 5.7% in the third quarter. And when we came into this year, we told you we expected to see comps accelerate &#x2013; pharmacy comps accelerate in the second half and we're seeing it. Pharmacy comps increased a solid 8%, better than the last quarter, and in fact the highest level we've seen in two years, and I guess almost close to twice the industry average. And that occurred even as our generic dispensing rates surpassed 70% on the retail side. Our pharmacy comps will negatively impacted by about 380 basis points due to recent generic introductions and further generic expansion.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier unlike some competitors, our pharmacy comps had little, if any, benefit from flu vaccines, vaccinations, that's because we don't count flu vaccinations administered at MinuteClinic or outside flu clinics as a prescription. We saw approximately 250-basis point benefit in pharmacy comps from Maintenance Choice, that's up 190 basis points in the second quarter and 120 from the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Our integrated products continue to gain traction in the marketplace and they gained traction for two simple reasons. They helped reduce &#x2013; helped clients reduce pharmacy and overall healthcare costs and they help save patients time and money. Comp scripts increased 4.9% in the third quarter. And you should recall that our 90-day Maintenance Choice scripts billed at retail, we count as one script rather than three. If in fact we counted Maintenance Choice as three scripts like some others, then our comp scripts would have been 8.1%.</p>
          <p>Pharmacy growth was also helped by a double-digit increase in flu-related prescriptions which I expect will continue through the fourth quarter. Front store comps increased just under 1% with more customers seeking out promotional prices and private label products in the quarter. Consumers I think continue to be conservative with their spending and they opt for higher value certainly and are looking for better, lower price points and, as I said, more value.</p>
          <p>In fact growth in private label sales during the quarter more than doubled the rate of other sales in the front store. Obviously, this is good for us from a margin standpoint. Excluding Longs in the third quarter, private label accounted for 17% of front store sales, up 120 basis points versus last year. We added about 250 new private-label items and we expect to add over 900 for the full year. We had pretty good growth across most of our categories, and obviously, as you would expect in light of the flu, we had especially strong growth in cough and cold. Conversely, back-to-school was relatively flat while photo and greeting cards were slightly down.</p>
          <p>Like last quarter, our average front store transaction on a comp basis grew slightly in the third quarter. The better news is that this quarter we saw comp traffic up slightly. That's a positive sign that the economy has started to improve. Having said that, we expect consumers to remain value conscious on a go-forward basis for a few quarters at least.</p>
          <p>Let me update you on the Longs integration. We completed the systems integration in May, we closed the headquarters in July and we completed all store remodels in October, we are right on track, we are introducing the stores to the marketplace with a multimedia advertising blitz, as we speak. Even before the promotions however, the early results of store remodels have been very encouraging.</p>
          <p>The post-remodel script performance has shown steady improvement, while the post-remodel front store sales have shown an immediate response since the resets. And as you all know, when you do remodels you have a disruption of service, so the disruption was lower and the comeback was certainly faster and better than we thought once the remodels are completed.</p>
          <p>Since the acquisition, we have surveyed over 125,000 customers across-the-board, we tracked this data pre and post-conversion. Our pharmacy service, neatness and cleanliness metrics have improved dramatically and what's especially encouraging to me is that when you compare this service metrics with other acquisitions that we've done at the same point in time, we are virtually ahead on every dimension.</p>
          <p>We're already exceeding our profitability targets for Longs, driven by strong margin performance as well as good expense management. In the Longs stores many private label products were introduced in the spring, with the initial update of Longs merchandise assortment. The rest of the proprietary products and we'll introduce later. So right now we have, private label is about 11% of front store sales. That's obviously lower than our core business, but up 700 basis points than, since the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, and the Longs acquisition was completed in October last year so the stores will be included in our comps for the first time in November. As we said before, we expect the initial impact of the comps to be slightly negative because of the remodels but we look forward to continuing to narrow the sales productivity and margin gaps between, for the Longs Stores and core CVS Stores.</p>
          <p>As for new stores on the real estate side, we reached a milestone this quarter. Larry Merlo, our President of CVS Pharmacy, opened our 7000th store in Little Canada, Minnesota. Who knew? In total, we opened up 87 new and relocated CVS Pharmacy stores in the quarter and closed six others, resulting in 59 net-new stores in the quarter. Year-to-date, we opened or relocated 256 stores, so we're right on track, they had about 3% retail square footage growth for '09. We also completed 37 file buys in the quarter, and we expect to do about 250 for the year, which is up about 10% versus last year. And it's good to have this obviously, because this is a great return for us and in fact many times the pharmacy staff and the owners actually come to work for us.</p>
          <p>Let me touch on MinuteClinic, which has now surpassed five million patient visits since its inception. We opened up eight new clinics during the quarter and now we have 565 clinics across 25 states. About 100 of those operate seasonally. In the third quarter, we saw better than expected growth in the clinics and this growth was really excluding the flu shot. So we had traffic up 77% in MinuteClinic and that's not counting the flu shot. These are just people coming for acute sick visits. So it was really driven for three reasons, one, the severity of the flu-like symptoms with people just coming in. Second, we're benefiting from increased public awareness, which is one of our goals we had to get the consumer more aware of MinuteClinic and where we are and what we have to offer. And third, we increased third-party coverage. As you know, third-party coverage leads to higher utilization, we added another 4.5 million additional lives to the network in the third quarter so now 80%, slightly over 80% of the visits are third-party paid.</p>
          <p>We're focused on improving the returns at MinuteClinic. One step towards that goal is our recent decision to move the majority of MinuteClinic's corporate functions from Minneapolis to Rhode Island. The move will facilitate sharing of infrastructure function and services and will improve speed to market for CVS Caremark's chronic care and patient engagement and disease management initiatives. The cost of this move is approximately $0.01 a share, which will be primarily in 2010. We remain very enthusiastic about the prospects for MinuteClinic. As you know, we're investing about five to $0.06 in MinuteClinic this year. We expect somewhat less next year, maybe four to five, and we expect to break even in 2011 on an all-in basis.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to the PBM business, which also had a very good quarter, let me give you some highlights. Pharmacy network revenues were up 28%. Mail choice revenues were up 14.8. And recall that mail choice is our metric which includes mail order plus 90-day claims filled at retail via Maintenance Choice.</p>
          <p>Our generic dispensing rate increased 320 basis points to a best-in-class 68.3 versus LY. Operating profit in the PBM was up 13%, and EBITDA per adjusted claim increased 8% to 4.89 on an apples-to- apples basis, you have adjust out RxAmerica, which was not in last year's results.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, our new products are gaining traction. Today, I'm pleased to report that we now have 417 clients representing over five million lives, who have adopted Maintenance Choice or will adopt it in the first quarter '10. That's up from 270 clients in the second quarter and 200 at the beginning of the year, so clearly Maintenance Choice is gaining acceptance in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>The 417 clients adopting Maintenance Choice represent only about 13% of our book, so there's clearly room to grow. Our early adopters of Maintenance Choice are telling us they are satisfied with the implementation process and that their members view the offering as a major enhancement to their benefit since now they have the convenient option of obtaining their prescriptions at any CVS retail store or mail order and they still get the benefit of mail order pricing. Remember this program is just an extension of our mail offering. It lowers cost for patients and payers, that's why it's being so well received in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>One of our next innovations we're working is the consumer engagement engine. It's not a product like Maintenance Choice. It's a data management system with a clinical rules engine, which will combine and analyze data to provide us with a single view of every CVS Caremark patient. Of course, the data analysis and other CEE initiatives are performed in compliance with applicable privacy laws. Whether a patient uses mail pharmacies, our MinuteClinics, our retail pharmacies, our specialty pharmacies, the CEE will further enhance the benefits of our integrated model by distilling data down to actionable messaging for our clients and our pharmacists. It may highlight opportunities for cost savings around formulary compliance or generic substitution. It may improve patient care through better compliance. Patients using our call centers, using our website, receiving outbound letters or interacting with pharmacists will all receive targeted messages to help them save money, save time and stay healthy.</p>
          <p>As an example, CVS pharmacists will be able to restart someone on therapy from a mail order prescription that may have discontinued or help a member at retail get started on mail order. This will provide us with an unprecedented capability to engage patients and to eliminate gaps in care, improve adherence and help drive cost savings. It'll be rolled out to our core channels in mid 2010, and we'll have evidence and drive it in the selling season for 2011.</p>
          <p>Speaking of 2011, we announced on Monday that we renegotiated and extended our $4 billion contract to provide retail pharmacy benefit services and all clinical services for Blue Cross Blue Shield, and known as the Federal Employee Program, FEP. The three-year contract, originally due to expire at the end of '10 has been extended through the end of '11. While it will cost us some margin dollars in 2010, I'm certainly pleased with the extension.</p>
          <p>So let me talk about the selling season. We had some good wins. We had about 125 new clients. We had a retention rate of about 92%.; having said that, we had some big client losses and let me recap those for you, so everybody is on the same page.</p>
          <p>We had $1.4 billion in wins in 2010. Approximately, 600 million of those gross wins came since the last quarterly call. We had 4.5 billion in losses and approximately two plus billion of those came from the last call &#x2013; since the last call, and those would be Horizon, I think you know about obviously the State of New Jersey. This was a bid that the state wanted on a stand-alone basis, so it was a kind of price and carve-out issue. We lost the State of Ohio and the managed Medicare business. It was carved in, which is about 500 plus million. And then we had another 600 million miscellaneous. These were basically smaller clients around RxAmerica or PharmaCare that just really wanted essentially smaller PBMs. So in total, that was about $2 plus billion since the last call.</p>
          <p>And then, lastly, we had $1.7 billion that we lost in Med-D business. This was the 500,000 lives that we lost in the duals, and once again, this was since the last call. So net-net, it's about $4.8 billion in loss -- in net loss for 2010 and approximately almost 3.7 billion since the last call. If you look at the losses, total the losses with Med-D and the $4.5 billion contract losses they really come from four contracts plus the Med-D lives. The two really that I mentioned and then Chrysler and Coventry.</p>
          <p>So, what does this all mean for 2010? As you all know, on our last quarterly call, I said I would -- we were not in a position to provide 2010 guidance at that time, which we weren't, because we hadn't done our budget. But I also said I'd be disappointed if we didn't have an EPS growth of at least 13 to 15% next year for the enterprise. To get to that 13 to 15% growth rate, I expected strong double-digit growth in our retail business, which I still do, and I expected low-to-mid single digit in our PBM business, which is not going to happen. What's changed? Well, as I just said, we lost more PBM business than we expected since the call, $2 billion in contracts. We lost the Med-D duals in 15 regions, which was 1.7 billion, which I just referred to. And we extended the $4 billion FEP contract through 2011 at the client's request. This was an early renegotiation, not at our request, but at the client's request. So we're going to have obviously some margin implications in 2010.</p>
          <p>Given all of that, it now looks like operating profit in the PBM will decline in 2010, perhaps as much as 10 to 12%. I want to point out that approximately 10 basis points of that -- 10 percentage basis points of the change is Med-D alone. While our retail business is still expected to achieve strong double-digit operating profit growth in 2010, which will likely be -- the retail range would likely be in the 13 to 16% range.</p>
          <p>With regards to the PBM, I want to announce the following changes in our organization. Howard McLure, President of Caremark, will be retiring effective November 27. I will be the President of the PBM on an interim basis while we conduct a search, and we'll keep you posted on the progress.</p>
          <p>As you know, Howard was one of the chief architects of our integrated model. His experience has been invaluable to our company. Yet after 30 plus years Howard felt it was right for him to retire and we wish him well in the next chapter of his life. We also announced yesterday we hired a new Senior VP of Marketing for the PBM, Len Greer. Len's knowledge of our industry and strong marketing skills make him qualified to deliver or help deliver our messages in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Now, before turning it over to Dave, I'm also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program for up to $2 billion of outstanding common stock. This reflects our confidence in the future growth of our business and our ongoing commitment to improve and increase shareholder value. We expect the repurchase -- to repurchase the shares from time to time from now through 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn it over to Dave for his financial review and then I'll be back with some additional remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll walk you through our third quarter financial results and then I'll update full-year 2009 guidance. But before I do that, let me highlight some key improvements that we've made to the way we report our segment financials, all of which I mentioned on last quarter's call. These changes reflect the way we look at the performance of our businesses, develop our strategies, and allocate resources. We hope they will make it easier for you to understand what's going on in our operating divisions.</p>
          <p>The first change involves the reclassification of certain administrative expenses previously recorded within the PBM and Retail segments to a new Corporate segment. The Corporate segment consists of certain costs, which benefit both operating divisions equally. These are primarily associated with Executive Management, Corporate Relations, Legal, Compliance, Human Resources, Corporate Information Technology and Finance. Of course, this change had no impact on our consolidated results of operations, but we now report on three operating segments: Pharmacy Services, Retail Pharmacy and Corporate.</p>
          <p>You'll see that our historical segment disclosures have been revised to conform to the current presentation. And we've made available on our website all the quarters going back to the first quarter of 2008. We believe that this change will give better visibility to the operating dynamics of both our retail and our PBM segments.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we made a change to our PBM segment as it relates to our intersegment activity, such as the Maintenance Choice program. This change impacts the gross profit and operating profit lines within the PBM segment. Under the Maintenance Choice program, a PBM client member can elect to pick up his maintenance prescriptions at one of our CVS pharmacy stores instead of receiving it through the mail. When this occurs, both the Retail and the PBM segments now record the revenue, gross profit and operating profit associated with this maintenance prescription on a stand-alone basis, and corresponding intersegment eliminations are created. Previously, only the revenue was recorded by both segments.</p>
          <p>We believe that this new method more clearly portrays the true performance of the individual operating segments regardless of which segment creates the sale or dispenses the product or service. This change is reflected on our segment results for the third quarter and in the year-to-date results. The Maintenance Choice comparative amounts for 2008 were also revised, although the program was still in a pilot phase at that time, and consequently, the amounts were quite small.</p>
          <p>Lastly, also beginning with the third quarter, we're now reporting mail choice volumes and related statistics as opposed to mail order volumes. Recall that mail choice is our metric that includes mail order claims plus 90-day claims filled at retail via Maintenance Choice. We believe that this provides a clearer picture of our business, as it has become more channel agnostic in regard to 90-day claims. Those were previously overwhelmingly filled in mail order facilities. Related to this, since Maintenance Choice is included in our mail choice metric, what we now refer to as pharmacy network is simply the PBM's retail network less those Maintenance Choice scripts that moved to mail choice.</p>
          <p>Now, on to revenues, Tom covered the highlights, but let me add several details worth mentioning. The 24.6 billion in consolidated revenues is net of two billion of intersegment eliminations. The intersegment eliminations as a percent of PBM retail network revenues increased by approximately 400 basis points over the prior-year period from 18.1% to 22.2%. This is up sequentially from last quarter's 330-basis point increase, further tangible evidence that there is an expanding base of our PBM customers choosing CVS as their retail pharmacy and an expanding number of PBM clients who chose to leverage the CVS retail service offerings including Maintenance Choice.</p>
          <p>In our PBM segment, third quarter net revenues of 13 billion increased 23.4%. RxAmerica contributed approximately one billion of that growth during the quarter, while one extra day this year added approximately $136 million. So the underlying growth rate was 12.2%.</p>
          <p>Drilling down a little deeper, the PBM pharmacy network revenues in the quarter rose 28.3% over 2008 levels to 8.8 billion. That was largely due to the change in revenue recognition method from net to gross for the RxAmerica contracts that began in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Pharmacy network claims grew 9%; this growth was driven by the addition of RxAmerica as well as the impact of net-new business. Total mail choice revenues grew by 14.8% to 4.2 billion. Our overall mail choice penetration rate of 23.8% was up approximately 50 basis points from the rate in the third quarter of 2008 on a reported basis. However, RxAmerica's claims mix, which is heavily weighted towards retail and network claims diluted the mail choice penetration rate by 240 basis points. So adjusting for this factor, our underlying mail choice penetration rate grew from 23.3% to 26.2%, up 290 basis points.</p>
          <p>Now what about the retail drugstore side of our business? We saw revenues increase by 17.9% to $13.6 billion in the third quarter. Longs contributed approximately 1.0 billion of that growth during the quarter while one extra day this year added approximately $167 million. So the underlying growth rate was 7.5%. As Tom mentioned, our third quarter comps increased 5.7% with pharmacy comps up a very solid 8% and front store comps up 0.8%.</p>
          <p>Moving on to gross profit, the overall dollars improved by 14% despite percentage margin dropping by 75 basis points. Within the PBM segment the gross profit margin was down approximately 50 basis points. That was expected due to the change in the revenue recognition method for RxAmerica as well as the pricing decisions we made last year for a few key contracts. The gross profit margin in the retail segment declined by approximately 100 basis points in the third quarter to 29.4%, that reflects pressure on third-party reimbursement rates as well as a higher mix of promotional sales, which more than offset the positive impact of new generics.</p>
          <p>And what about expenses; overall, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues improved by approximately 10 basis points. The PBM segments percentage stayed flat at 1.8%. That was despite the impact of the elimination of the Universal American joint venture, the income from which was historically an offset to expenses. We also saw some integration expenses for RxAmerica flow through in the third quarter, so excellent expense control there.</p>
          <p>In the retail segment, the improvement was approximately 20 basis points to 22.7%. We saw good spending discipline at the store level as well as favorable timing of advertising spending in the quarter. Of course partially offsetting that were the one-time expenses from the Longs integration. Within the corporate segment, we saw expenses rise by approximately 20%. The larger than normal increase was due primarily to the addition of Longs and RxAmerica corporate expenses as well as some compensation and benefit costs. So with the gross margin decline only partially offset by improvements in SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales, operating margin declined as expected; it was down approximately 67 basis points to 6.4% of revenues.</p>
          <p>Moving to the consolidated income statement, we saw net interest expense in the quarter increase to $123 million, largely reflecting the increased debt position due to Longs. Our effective income tax rate was 29.1% in the third quarter. The large improvement was due to the recognition of approximately $155.7 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits relating to the expiration of various statutes of limitation and settlements with tax authorities. Excluding the impact of this reserve release, the effective income tax rate for the third quarter would have been approximately 39.8%.</p>
          <p>Our weighted-average diluted share count was $1.44 billion -- excuse me, 1.44 billion shares. Through the end of October, we have repurchased 57.7 million of our shares for $1.99 billion at an average share cost of $34.66 including commissions. So we nearly completed our $2 billion share repurchase authorization and we expect to complete the remainder this month. And then as Tom said, the Board of Directors just approved a new two billion share repurchase program and we expect to purchase shares from time to time between now and the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.76. Excluding the $0.11 tax benefit, it was $0.65, an increase of 8% over last year's third quarter and just above our guidance. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations came in at $0.71 for the quarter or $0.60 when adjusted for the tax benefit. That's also approximately an 8% increase over last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet and cash flows, we generated over $490 million in free cash flow in the third quarter. That compares to $386 million in the prior year's third quarter, so we've made some nice progress there. Net capital expenditures amounted to approximately $416 million in the third quarter. This was the result of offsetting the 661 million of gross capital expended with approximately 245 million worth of sale leaseback proceeds. Barring any new and currently unforeseen financial market problems, we still expect that we'll be able to complete the sale of the remaining 900 million or so in properties we had planned when the year began.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in September, we issued 1.5 billion of 30-year unsecured senior notes that were well received by the market. We used the proceeds primarily to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings, as well as a $650 million senior note that was due in September. So we ended the quarter with total debt net of cash and cash equivalents of $10.8 billion. That's up approximately $400 million from year-end and largely reflects normal swings in our working capital.</p>
          <p>Now, onto guidance for the year, for the Retail segment, we continue to expect revenue growth of between 12 and 14% for the year, with total same-store sales in the range of four to 6%. For the PBM segment, revenue should be up between 16 and 18% for the year. For the total Company, we expect revenue growth of around 12 to 14% of the full year after intercompany eliminations of over $7.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Gross profit margins still are expected to be modestly below 2008, with Retail flat and the PBM segment down. We expect total Company operating expenses as a percent of revenues will be modestly up. That reflects the integration and one-time cost of Longs, the increase in litigation reserves we saw in the first quarter, as well as the first-year economics of a large amount of new PBM business. All of that will lead to operating profit margins for the total company, which are moderately below the record levels of last year.</p>
          <p>We expect EBITDA per adjusted claim to be down slightly on a reported basis, but up mid single-digits when normalized for RxAmerica and the increase in litigation reserves. We forecast net interest of about 530 to $545 million. We expect our tax rate in the fourth quarter to approach 40%. Keep in mind that the full year rate will be impacted by the tax benefit we recognized in the third quarter. And we're forecasting approximately 1.45 billion weighted average shares for the year.</p>
          <p>We expect total consolidated amortization for 2009 to be a little shy of 450 million. Depreciation should be just under $1 billion. Net capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of one to $1.2 billion for 2009. Free cash flow is expected to be in the neighborhood of $3.5 billion. So given our continued strong performance year-to-date, we're narrowing our earnings guidance for 2009. We expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the effect of the tax benefit, of $2.61 to $2.64, up from our previous guidance of $2.59 to $2.64.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn it back over to Tom for some closing remarks.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Dave. Before opening up for questions, I want to update you all on the CFO search. Earlier this year as you know, Dave Rickard announced his intention to retire and we launched an internal and external search for our new CFO. Today, I'm extremely pleased to announce the appointment of Dave Denton to the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective January 2, 2010.</p>
          <p>Currently, our Senior VP, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, Dave brings nearly 20 years of financial management experience with a focus on healthcare and retail drug to his new position. Dave has been with the Company for more than 10 years working almost exclusively for Dave Rickard. He has experience in all key areas of finance, including serving as the CFO of our PBM PharmaCare, as well as in retail and corporate positions. His broad financial experience, industry expertise, and a deep understanding of our customers will help making him an outstanding CFO.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we certainly have had a lot of news today. I don't want to lose sight of the solid quarter we had with great revenues and profits and cash flow and leading comps and private label sales and Maintenance Choice up. We locked in a new important contract for 2011. Longs is in good shape. We had record results for MinuteClinic and obviously we named a new CFO. So while it was a good quarter, we're not in this for quarterly results.</p>
          <p>We're about growing the Company for the long term. I'm pleased with the consistent industry-leading performance of our retail business and the plans we have in place to ensure that continues. While there are a lot of positives on the PBM side of our business, I am obviously not pleased with our 2010 outlook. We will be making appropriate changes to restore the PBM to its appropriate level of growth.</p>
          <p>So with that, I will open it up for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. I guess just to be clear then, Tom, relative to the 13 to 15% for next year that you had initially discussed, when you talked about the PBM being down 10 or 12% on an operating profit, are we looking at something more like 2.75 or 2.80 number on an EPS basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you can -- we're not going to obviously give you the totals, but you can kind of roll it up and get to the number. But it's -- as I said, when we did this and I gave you those projections., it was basically single to mid digit -- single mid digit -- low to mid digit single growth for the PBM. So we were looking in the two to four, two to 5% range for growth when we gave you those numbers. And obviously, it's going to be less than that as I said in the 10 plus range. So you can kind of roll it up and you get in the ballpark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Obviously, the Achilles' heel I think for the stock and certainly it looks like for next year in terms of overall growth is going to be the selling side on the PBM business. Can you give us maybe some more granularity as to why, in the long run, you're still optimistic about sort of the combined model? And maybe sort of what's gone wrong in the last year or two and why you think that's going to get better in the next year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. The reason I still have confidence and we continue to have confidence in the combined model is because of the &#x2013; what we're seeing in the marketplace from new clients. And the money and the time that we're saving, not only the plan, but the members, so there is uptake on it. And listen, this is all about results so I'm not Pollyanna here. We get it. We got to produce better results on the PBM side. Having said that, I think it's important to segment the pieces. We had some big losses.</p>
          <p>We had a lot of wins, we renewed contracts, we're getting more share of the spend from those contracts. But we in fact &#x2013; when you lose &#x2013; we lost Coventry, which -- we lost the Med-D business, and then we obviously expected to lose the commercial business. Chrysler, we lost the retirees. It's the smallest piece of it. It went to where Ford and General Motors were, with Michigan Blues. We didn't lose the actives. And then the Med-D was a really big headwind for us. That was a huge, a huge hit when you look at obviously the spread issue and also the lives. I'm still not happy with it, but if you look at where we were, I mean, we were thinking that we were going to be in the three to 4% growth, three to 5% growth range for the PBM. That was with the kind of Med -- even let's say you back out of Med-D, Med-D was 10 percentage points, right, the spread.</p>
          <p>So we're not going to have that headwind in '11. Obviously, we're going to have -- we believe we're going to have more time in the selling season. Listen, this has taken more time than we thought, right. We developed in these programs in '08. We started selling them in '09, and we got less uptake in '10 and then we got hit with some big losses and then the Med-D. So we're confident, we're making some changes, but it's -- if you look at these contracts that we lost, none of them were because of the model. There were varying reasons some price, one service, there were varying reasons, but none of them because of the model. Having said that, we know we've got to produce results, and we're going to produce results going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. With the growing number of clients that you have on Maintenance Choice, can you talk about the success you're having in growing 90-day penetration with those accounts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we, think about the, I think we said 13% or so of the clients have it now. The issue is clients have to move, obviously, the clients with mandatory mail were the first clients to move. And then, now clients are looking for new ways to save money. They're moving, changing plan design to get, to drive people more to mail and they're willing to do that, because we have the combined offering, right. They can get it at mail or retail. So we're going to continue to drive that. You saw the uptake, I mean, it doubled from where we were. We expect it to geometrically increase going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess more specifically, the clients that have adopted it. How much more mail penetration is taking place as a result of them or coincident with them putting the program in place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's significant. I mean, typically, the one &#x2013; obviously, the mandatory mail clients. It's -- there's no change, essentially. But they doubled their mail share. I mean, it's, and that's on the low side. They move up a significant amount of mail share, sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then secondly, on the retail gross margin where the trend was weaker this quarter than we saw in the first half of the year. And I know you talked a little bit about promotions, but can you or Dave, just provide a little bit more color on what took place there and if this is something that is the one-quarter phenomena or if it's likely to sustain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's really Rx reimbursement. I mean, that's kind of the main focus, what you'll see across the board. We expected a little more &#x2013; it's around, especially around the state Medicaid issues, some private payers, but more around the states. So I don't think it's any significant trend. You got anything to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that's right. I mean, clearly the percent from on promotion in the front of the store is well up and I think that must relate to the economy and so you tell me when the economy gets better, I'll tell you when that gets better. So I think that's economically related. The rate pressure is what it is. I mean it's always been there. It's been there for the last 10 years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks very much and good morning. Tom, can you talk about the strategy on the PBM side, naming Len Greer. You said that you didn't feel that you lost business because of the messaging, but do you feel like maybe you didn't win your fair share of business, because of the messaging coming out of the PBM?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First off, can you maybe talk about that? And then secondly, can you talk about benefit design changes for 2010? We talked about Maintenance Choice, but what else are you seeing as far as benefit design changes go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I think it's fairly common knowledge that our message early on was not clear, to be honest. It was not simple for managers -- benefit managers to understand. It focused a little too much on the retail side of the business as opposed to a coordinated effort. And Len has PBM experience. He has disease management experience on the marketing side. So yes, he's brought in to help change that message on a go-forward basis. And we've had a lot of discussions with clients and consultants around that, so that message has changed as we speak, and he starts in about a week.</p>
          <p>As far as plan design, we're seeing people reaching out to &#x2013; for step therapies, for high performance formularies, for generic first, and obviously move to the Maintenance Choice, because they obviously can save money. But we're seeing more people thinking about high-performance formularies and obviously any way to get faster uptake on generics, whether it's through full-pays or step therapies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just one follow-up. I mean what are your plans for the PBM with Howard retiring? Are you looking outside of the Company for someone to come in and replace that role?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to do a complete search, and obviously we know the internal candidates. We're going to do -- but we want to do a complete search outside. So it'll be comprehensive inside and outside and we have started the process. So we've done some groundwork and we'll be on it shortly. We will give you an update.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Tom, I guess how do we look at the revised PBM outlook as anything but proof that no real clear synergy does exist here? You speak about improving the business, but I mean, what are the credible data points we can put forward that this can happen? I just don't see how you can restore growth given the performance over the past couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we had $9 billion of new business in '08, and we have new clients. I get the question, but the issue is you have to back out kind of the big losses. And the losses really, really weren't related to the model. And you can go through the loss of the four big contracts this year and then obviously the significant impact on Med-D, both lives and spread, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess without a PBM management team in place, does it make more sense to spin the thing now while there's still more value there or you are committed to this business to the end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, listen, you know &#x2013; the PBMs are not performing at the level. So you wouldn't spin it. I mean the issue is &#x2013; if you're getting &#x2013; if both the groups are performing at the right growth rate and you're not getting &#x2013; then you're not getting the multiple, then one could talk about that, right, but, and then we'll look at shareholder value, but you have an issue right now that the PBM is underperforming the peers. And so to spin it, what does &#x2013; that doesn't really do anything.</p>
          <p>And we still believe that the combined Company is the right approach for payers and plan participants. And so we had some stutter starts. We had some marketing issues. We acknowledge that. We had the Med-D issue which is separate, and we had some contract losses. So we're certainly not happy with it, but it's not the model. And I certainly don't think spinning off a PBM that's not performing the way it should be is right for shareholders.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>I'm sorry about that, we have technical problems here. Just needed one qualification on next year, is it fair to say because obviously the CVS retail business is larger than the PBM that, if the large one is growing at 13 to 16 that overall EBIT would be up next year because of that mix?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly, when you think about your free cash flow for next year, I think, you said $2 billion of buyback through the end of 2011. I mean given where the stock is today or trading today, I mean you would think that you would complete that relatively quickly in 2010, is there anything that would prevent that from happening?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, we'll obviously consider the stock price as well as the ebb and flow of cash within our business, but those decisions will be made weekly and monthly as we go. So I don't want to give you an indication that we're going to front load or middle load or back load right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But is there anything in terms of CapEx next year or anything in the cash flows of the business that would preclude you from doing the two billion if you wanted to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there's anything unusual about next year's CapEx expectations or anything else. So I think we will have a degree of flexibility and then it's a question is how we use that flexibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally, you guys had not &#x2013; you sort of referenced the flu for the fourth quarter. At this point, including both H1N1 and seasonal, how difficult is it to get your arms around not just the fourth quarter benefit but I assume there probably will be a first quarter benefit as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's absolutely right. Yes, and different knowledgeable people are talking about how long this thing is going to go on, but it could go on for a quite a ways. Let me back up though to the share repurchase question and answer that we just had and add one other thing. I just want to be clear that the Board authorization is from now to the end of 2011. So it is entirely conceivable that some of that activity will be yet in the year 2009.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. If I just think about the industry on the PBM side and you know on the pricing environment, I mean, it's pretty clear to most in the industry that pricing was fairly aggressive last year generally. This year it seems to be a bit more benign. But I was hoping to get your thoughts on next year. I mean it's obviously very important for you to go out and end the year next year with net wins. So doesn't this almost ensure a more aggressive pricing environment as we look out into next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think so. It's &#x2013; this is all &#x2013; pricing environment is relatively rational, save a few big contracts. And I think that has been the policy of the programs for PBMs for the last 10 years. And on a go-forward basis, we're certainly going to be appropriately aggressive on price and where we should be for appropriate contracts. But the wins are really around the service level, and the clinical opportunities and savings that we can provide our clients. So no, I don't see &#x2013; this is not going to be a case of CVS Caremark out in the marketplace just lowball pricing to get contracts. We are going to be appropriate. We're going to look &#x2013; you have to look at this from a return standpoint, and we'll be &#x2013; we'll measure our pricing appropriately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And just my second question for you is on the retail business. What's your level of confidence in this 13 to 16%? I mean the business itself in this given quarter, this current quarter was up 5%. Q4 is probably going to be strong with the flu, so you obviously have to start to anniversary that. Is there any risk to the retail side of business? I know there's a lot of time being spent today on the PBM, but your thoughts there would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, listen, we've been fairly consistent in our performance in the retail business even in this climate. PBM is helping the retail business. The retail business is taking share from other players in the business. The quarter was obviously depressed a little because of Longs, which is obviously going to change in 2011. So I feel, as I said earlier on the call, when we did the projections, when I talked about the 13 to 15, I talked about where I thought the retail business would be, and that has not changed. That has not changed from the second quarter call to now and obviously we're further along in the planning process and we have more confidence in the numbers. So I'm confident in the retail number not only next year, but on a go-forward basis on what we have in the hopper. Obviously, the issue was the PBM side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I guess, on the PBM, the 10 to 12% decline for 2010. You broke out one part &#x2013; the 10% I think you said was coming from the Med Part D. Can you break out the other components? Is anything coming from a decline in Maintenance Choice &#x2013; maybe profitability leaving the PBM going to the retail, pricing and contracting. Can you just kind of give me what is driving the 10 to 12% besides the 10% from Medicare Part D?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; contracts that we've lost. There's no negative effect of the shift of Maintenance Choice business, that's incrementally positive for us. So really it does come down to those contracts.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And secondly, I guess going back to the question that just asked on the retail business, 13 to 16%. I guess I question how comfortable you are with that given the economy, I mean it seems front store same store sales only grew 0.8%. And I think when we look into 2010, I don't think anyone is really projecting a economic recovery. So on the front store sales of that 13 to 15% I guess what's your assumption for front store sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we haven't, we won't give out the individual assumptions, but we've always said that even if the front-end sales were 1% comps, we could certainly make the numbers I'm talking about.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So Tom, you know it seems like, it's kind of good news and then I guess very bad news, But this Maintenance Choice, I know you had a real big acceleration there. I know on the last conference call, I was asking you questions about that. And you said, really it's going to be a lot slower as we get to Jan 1, and then low and behold we have a huge amount of more lives coming in. Which is suggestive that something is working right here.</p>
          <p>But then you look at the PBM numbers, and it gives everyone heart palpitations. So number one is why are people kind of shying away from Caremark's PBM? If it's not the combined model, and you kind of said maybe it's &#x2013; there must be some reason that you're not proving that you're good enough to stand alone PBM to keep those business. How do you change those people's minds? And so I guess that's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Execution and performance, it's not the products. Believe me, the products that we're offering are accepted in the marketplace. Now, we have to tweak the marketing message a little, which we're doing to make sure that it's clear about how those operate and what those actually are and when they hit and what the savings are, and the benefit to the payers. So there's clearly receptivity to the new products.</p>
          <p>It's &#x2013; there are some &#x2013; there were some stand-alone issues. I mean I hate to keep harping on it, but listen, the Coventry piece, when we lost Med-D, we knew we were going to lose the commercial business. There were some service issues on that one. The VEBA, Chrysler, we still keep the actives. We lost the retirees. The Med-D I talked about so I don't want to go through it all again. But there were a variety of issues, but none of it was &#x2013; we didn't lose anybody. I will tell you this, we didn't lose anybody that said, well, because you guys are combined with a retailer, we're leaving. None of that.</p>
          <p>And there's actually a lot of uptake in the marketplace as I said for the products. And we're obviously taking retail share. We're gaining some retail share. We're increasing the free cash flow. We got new products. We got the synergies, but at the end of the day, we got to have the clients, and we've lost some big clients. We gained a lot of clients, new ones, smaller ones, and I think on a go-forward basis, there'll be stickiness to those clients as long as we're obviously giving them the price, saving them money and producing the right service. And which we have had, and intend, and will do on a go-forward basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So another, I guess, a little bit kind off of Bob's question, but maybe a little different question, earlier on, say you know, getting &#x2013; breaking the Company back up. I guess the question really is how confident are you that you're going be able to do all these silos well? We were out in and we've done a lot of store walking at Longs and it's clear to us that the conversion there, you can tell you're spending less money. That doesn't mean you're a bad retailer all of the sudden., but how confident are you that you can maintain, I mean, optimal performance in retail and a stand-alone PBM and in a combined Company that this isn't just going to end up being very messy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, we're not going to let it happen. I mean, there &#x2013; we're not shortchanging retail because of this combined Company. In fact retail is benefiting from the combined merger. What we it did in Longs, we would have done even if we didn't have and didn't do the Caremark deal. It's just, we've done acquisitions enough, we know where the savings are, we get better each time at it, we get better returns on it. Longs is outperforming where we thought it was going to be. And each acquisition we've done on the retail side we've done better and better, so we are very happy with Longs.</p>
          <p>We brought &#x2013; anytime you have an acquisition, anyone who's been involved in these &#x2013; there's 500 stores, you go out to some stores you'll see some things that aren't right. But in the long run, we're very confident in what we're doing at Longs, how the team is working at Longs and where the performance is going to be.</p>
          <p>So there is no distraction, let me make this clear, there is no distraction on the retail side of the business. We have a retail group that's focused on retail, we have a PBM group that's focused on the PBM and then we have a separate group that's focused on the integrated offering. And we have some work to do on the PBM side as you indicated and that, which is obvious and we're on it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just trying to clarify, I guess I don't have a good understanding of the impact of the loss of the Med-D lives due to the different bidding in the low-income subsidy in 2010 versus 2009. The press release, you guys put out maybe a month ago, you talked about a three to four cent hit. Is that number still good, or is does this kind of &#x2013; what you're talking about is a 10% &#x2013; 10% of the deterioration coming from Part D. Just trying to square those two things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The three to four cents relates to the revenue loss, and it's on top of the five to seven cents of lack or spread loss that we had before. We lost about a half a billion lives, sorry, half a million lives and that represented about 1.7 billion of revenue. And yes that's about three to four cents.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the combined kind of swing in earnings from Med-D is still the -.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; combination. Okay. 8 to 11. Okay. And then maybe you can talk about, I mean, I guess PBM segment renewals next year. How much of the current book is up for &#x2013; will be up for renewal?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For next year. I mean, maybe give us a sense of how much of the business is potentially at risk. Is it a lighter year for renewals than this year was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, well, we obviously we had a big renewal with the, with FEP. So that will obviously impact it, there will be less renewals and less out there. As far as 2010 goes, 85%, almost 88% of them our decisions have already made. And in 2011 there's some fairly large opportunities for some new business in 2011. And as I said, renewals will be slightly less because of the big FEP renewal already.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just want to make sure I understand, the 13 to 16% EBIT growth in the retail side, that doesn't require any kind of economic recovery. Is that right?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. I would like to actually talk a little bit more about the Med-D business. You had &#x2013; earlier in '09, you had said that the business was going to be less profitable because it wasn't underwritten properly. Would it be fair to say that you went to an opposite extreme when you bid for low-income subsidy business for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we didn't go to an extreme. We actually &#x2013; we used the same approach that we've used in the past. And as you know, Meredith, these &#x2013; we've had, as David said, it was about 500 million lives. And half of those -</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>500,000, excuse me, 500,000 lives and 1.7 billion. But half of those lives, you'd lose it on a premium that's 50 to $0.75 off. So obviously, we thought we made a good bet on the premiums and it's a balance, depending on the region and we used the same approach with our actuaries and we lost those lives. But we didn't get &#x2013; we didn't really raise the prices significantly, because we just &#x2013; we thought we'd appropriately bid them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my understanding of the Med-D business is that once you lose those numbers, it is fairly hard to get them back. Just because of the way the math works, if you hit the benchmark for the following year, you're still not going to get all those numbers back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There's going to be some other members &#x2013; there are some regions that others lost that we're still in that we may pick up business in. But you're right, it's hard once they move to get them back. We think we got some uptake on some regions that we're in, where there'll be few players so we might have some upside there. But you're right, it's hard once they make the decision.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I want to go back to this guidance you're giving. I'm not exactly sure why you gave us earnings per share guidance for 2010 earlier, that was for the entire company &#x2013; 13 to 15. And then you're not giving us a comparable revised guidance. I'm coming up with earnings per share of -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't give &#x2013; we didn't &#x2013; let me be clear on that. I did not give guidance then. I said I would be disappointed if we weren't in that range. And I said it was too early to give guidance from a budgeting standpoint. But now, I'm just giving you full disclosure. I'm telling you what we were thinking about on the 13 to 15, and how one could get there. And one could get there very easily with a PBM growth rate in the two to 4% range. When you look at where the retail side was growing, the interest rates and share buybacks, etcetera and all the pieces, it was pretty straightforward.</p>
          <p>Obviously, when we lose significant business that we lost, almost $4 billion of business since the call, that two to 4% changes on the PBM side. So, I want to be clear, we were not giving guidance. We never really  haven't what I'm doing now is telling you that &#x2013; I wanted to make it clear in the marketplace that I am not comfortable with that 13 to 15. I'm telling you where. And one of the pieces is the PBM side of the business is going to be down 10 plus and for the reasons I cited.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then just another question about the front end in the retail business. I'm under the impression that you guys chose not to be particularly aggressive in terms of your own promotional activity. You got the ExtraCare card, it helps. Is that fair to say? And would you do it any differently? Are you thinking about doing it any differently to drive front-end comps say into the holiday season or next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're pretty happy with our promotional spend, the way it is I mean, you look at our numbers for the last few quarters all during this 2010, our front stores as well as our pharmacy are growing significantly. So we got two more quarters and we think we're in a pretty good shape. We have obviously a good holiday plan in place for Christmas. I think our folks have done a good job. Good news, bad news, we're getting more private label business and which is obviously helping margins, lowering some front end comps. But we're in good shape, we feel good where the front end comps are now and our promotional plan.</p>

          <p>And then I guess a second question, in terms of the PBM expectations for 2010, what are you contemplating around sort of operating expense changes or potential resizing if anything on the PBM front?</p>

          <p>That's really what we're doing in the budgeting process right now and we will comment more specifically on that in the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>Our last question comes from the line of Neil Currie with UBS.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. Just wanted to ask a question about your approach to the last couple of selling seasons because I think you're probably right in saying the integrated model per se is probably not putting people off the business and in the longer term I'm sure Maintenance Choice and other programs are going to be an enhancement to employers but at the heart of this deal between CVS and Caremark, you created the biggest buying organization around generic drugs possibly in the world, why did you not go to market on the basis of being able to offer people lowest possible costs and almost be the Wal-Mart of your industry? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This was not just about price. We obviously had a fair amount of synergies when we did the deal and you're right, we are in the right spot from a purchasing standpoint. And &#x2013; but this deal wasn't just about being a price-driven model, right? Price gets you in but it's service, it's the relationships, it's the clinical offerings, it's lowering overall healthcare costs that keep you there.</p>
          <p>So you know that we did obviously invest some price &#x2013; in some large clients, which we talked about, and which is similar to what other PBMs would do and have done in the past and I think all PBMs will continue to do in the future on selected clients, but this was not about putting these two companies together and then coming in and just have a nuclear explosion on price. That's not what the returns will be for this business.</p>
          <p>So it's about getting the appropriate price, a competitive price in the marketplace; one, on new business and two, on retaining business. But then growing the share of that business and getting that client more profitable going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it seems to be that you're being out priced by others who have less scale than you. I mean is that the right way to look at it? Or why are you losing contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we can go through the individual pieces, but as I mentioned on the $5 billion that we lost, one was service on one of the health plan side, and we lost on the Medicaid &#x2013; Med-D business last year and it was just a natural move to move their commercial business. The Ohio Medicaid was a regulatory issue, it was a carve-in. Med-D we explained; Chrysler, VEBA we explained.</p>
          <p>So, I guess the Horizon one, from the standpoint of the State of Jersey, they wanted a stand-alone PBM model and there was some price issues there. I guess that was more aggressively priced from a competitor than we would have done. So this much business Neil, it wasn't &#x2013; the majority of their business was not lost on price.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you all. I know this was a &#x2013; obviously a difficult call and there's going to be a lot of questions and we will be having answers for you on a go-forward basis. So we're committed to turn the PBM performance around, we're committed to this model, and in the long run, this is going to be right for the payers and the shareholders. So thank you very much and we'll talk you later.</p>
