          <p>Now back to you, Dr. Vasella.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, John. We used the old titles. In the new era, obviously we're going to give up all these CEO titles because we will only have one, which is Joe Jimenez. And with that, let me start my presentation.</p>
          <p>And start on slide number four. If we look at our 2009 results, I think we had an exceptional year where we gained market share with all divisions and achieved a great &#x2013; the great top-line growth. And especially in the fourth quarter was strong. Also from a point of view of innovation, there's more than 30 major regulatory product approvals, we did well. And based on these results, we're able to increase or propose an increase of the dividend by 5% at the next shareholder meeting. And last but not least, we have announced a leadership change for taking care of the next growth phase in which Novartis will enter, marked of course most vividly by the intended acquisition of Alcon.</p>
          <p>On slide five, you see the key numbers in local currencies of the Group grew by 11% and you see the headwinds in the first three quarters of the currencies. In the fourth quarter, that turned around. Operating income 11%, Net four, EPS three, and as announced previously we are now reporting the results also as so-called core operating income, core net income and core basic EPS. In there you can see already the big influence of amortization and one timers.</p>
          <p>Slide six shows you how the different divisions did perform. Pharma, I don't comment because Joe will go into more details. Then Vaccines had an exceptional year. I do not anticipate that 2010 will be the same. This was so heavily positively impacted by the H1N1 rapid supply of the very strong demand we saw in a number of countries when the pandemic started. And Sandoz, which improved its performance in the course of the year, and Consumer Health, we'll come back to these divisions.</p>
          <p>On the next slide you'll see that our growth has been very balanced across all geographic regions, growing at double digits. In slide nine, really it's a recap of the forces which drive on one side, the demand and on the other side the challenges which the high demand, mostly driven by an aging population is triggering and which we tried to navigate around and we did so successfully the past year.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 just summarizes some of the achievements in 2009 which correspond to the priorities we had set for the last year in the field of innovation, the portfolio and the markets. And of course we also worked hard on the organizational productivity while we want to really keep, hire, attract the best talent, to invest into learning and development of people. And last but not least to contribute to society in which we work and live.</p>
          <p>Slide 11, demonstrates that we were able to keep also in 2009 the leading position in new drug approvals by FDA. And in slide 12, you can see that it's unlikely to change dramatically in the future as we have a very rich and highly valued pipeline with many novel compounds addressing a number of diseases which can only be treated unsatisfactorily today. Like for example, uveitis. And I anticipate and we anticipate that in many of the these instances these drugs will demonstrate that they don't only work in a small indication, but that we will discover more effects as they are being used in the clinics.</p>
          <p>In slide 13, you see how our business portfolio evolved over the last 14 years and how we divested the majority of our activities we had in 1996 by divesting chemicals, agribusiness, and nutritional businesses. And on the other side, strengthening the generics business, buying the whole of Chiron and strengthening the pharma businesses &#x2013; business with many individual smaller deals and product licenses. And last but not least of course the Alcon transaction, which is in the doing and hopefully will be completed this year.</p>
          <p>In slide 14, you'll see how Alcon would be positioned in this new portfolio. In fact, it would be the second largest division of all our divisions and we will be able to strategically integrate our activities with the ones of Alcon, which makes a lot of sense from a market point of view, also from a product development point of view. It would be an even stronger leader, world-wide leader, in the eye care business.</p>
          <p>Slide 15. We had set an objective of 1.6 billion of savings over three years. We achieved 2.3 billion in two years. We closed the program, but that doesn't mean we will close our eye on productivity. This in fact is more an ongoing exercise now, but especially in procurement it's quite amazing how much we could achieve in a relatively short period of time and there's more to do.</p>
          <p>Page 16 details the access to medicine programs we have. We supported almost 80 million patients in 2009 and the various programs between Coartem, Leprosy program, the Glivec program and the research centers. We contributed almost 3% of the net sales and the programs are valued at 1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Next slide shows you that not only since it has become fashionable are we really engaged in the environment where we want to leave the least possible impact, but we since many years have invested notably in carbon absorbing initiatives like planting trees, now also by generating power with solar panels as some of the examples. In the yearly, in the annual report, you can see that every year we have set targets and we have measured the outcome, which I think makes it a trackable system, which in our understanding is the basis for achieving progress.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to hand over to Raymund.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Daniel. I can complement now the assessment that you have heard from Daniel Vasella by some comments on financials. I'm on slide 19. The takeaways for 2009 are, one, of strong currency headwind for the first nine months. Is reduced the reported numbers, so from double-digit growth numbers were then reduced to 7% sales growth and 11% operating income growth in U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>Despite this currency headwind, we achieved record earnings and we had an excellent performance for our free cash flow initiative. Free cash flow before dividend is up 24%. We achieved the purchase of the <mark type="inaudible" /> specialty generics business and we announced our intention to gain 100% ownership of Alcon. Finally, total shareholder return in 2009 was 12%.</p>
          <p>On the next page I show again the overview of the key financials because I want just to comment on the increase of EPS and net income, which are at four and 3% are slightly below normal. There are only two reasons for this, two major reasons for this. One is the higher financing cost related to the Alcon transaction and a much reduced income from the associated company Roche because of the Genentech transaction.</p>
          <p>Underlying coordinating can reach correct for this Roche effect but not for the financing. Underlying core net count is then up a solid 8%. On the next slide we show the same numbers for the fourth quarter. It's very visible and striking that the year ended on a strong note with very high growth rates in the fourth quarter for sales, operating, and net income, as well as free cash flow. These reflect progress in operations and acceleration in all divisions and it also reflects the 1 billion sales in the Vaccines and Diagnostics division related to the pandemic H1N1.</p>
          <p>And finally, it reflects a positive currency impact in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>I have to say that the numbers are very strong in operating income despite an increase in the provision of 318 million that we made in relation to the U.S. Federal investigations into the marketing practices of Trileptal.</p>
          <p>You saw that we introduced at the end of 2009, now core figures. We have finally accepted to do this to be more or less in line with our peers who are all using this infamous set of performance metrics and in order to provide you with more guidance or more insight, I should say, into the underlying performance of our businesses.</p>
          <p>When we go from IFRS earnings to core earnings, we eliminate unusual acquisition accounting impact such as amortization of intangibles, of purchase price allocation impacts. We eliminate all impairments and we eliminate the same items for associated company income and finally we eliminate other exceptional items exceeding 25 million dollars on a case-by-case basis.</p>
          <p>On slide 23, we provide an overview of the margin development of operating and net income productivity improvements account for the 0.9 percentage point increase of the operating income margin. The net income margin is actually down 0.6 percentage points but this is all related to exceptional items. Correcting for these the core net income margin is also up 0.2 percentage points, despite the Alcon financing.</p>
          <p>On slide 24, the productivity gains that I've mentioned are mostly focused on two expense areas, Marketing and Selling and General and Administrative. Marketing and Selling, as a result of these programs could be reduced as a percentage of sales by 1.5 percentage points and General and Administrative by 0.2 percentage points. These two cost categories grew only a 2%, clearly at the much lower pace than sales, which was up 7%.</p>
          <p>And you can see that we didn't cut investments into Marketing and Selling or Research and Development, but rather used part of the productivity gains to finance the necessary investments in emerging gross market, sales infrastructure or late-stage development projects in Pharma, Vaccines and Sandoz.</p>
          <p>Slide 25, core net income grew 8%, less than core operating income, which was up 11%. This is entirely due to the financing of the first 25% stake in Alcon, which cost $10 billion and related to $8.5 billion partial pre-financing of the now announced additional 52% stake.</p>
          <p>Financing, as a result dropped from a 94 million income in 2008 to a 353 million expense in 2009. Core taxes on the other hand grew only 7% and they are virtually at the same rate as in the comparable period in 2008, so they stood at 15.4%.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 26, cash flow management clearly is a success story of 2009. The projects implemented across the divisions to improve cash flow from operating activities and reduce investments in capital and intangible assets had a very positive impact. Free cash flow before dividend improved 24%, from 7.6 to $9.4 billion. Demand is now to 21.3% of sales versus only 8.4% of sales a year ago.</p>
          <p>As a result, the 9.4 billion free cash flow easily covered the 18% increase in dividend related to the 2008 dividend of 3.9 billion and allowed us to return from a net debt position of 1.2 billion at the end of 2008, while net liquidity position of 3.5 billion at the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>Finally, on slide 28, a few comments about the Alcon financing. We recently announced transaction to gain full ownership of Alcon will obviously have a significant impact on our financial standing. Overall the acquisition will cost some $50 billion or roughly 40% of our market cap. The second 52% stake which amounts to 28 billion will be financed by a mix of cash and debt. And as you know the $11 billion for the 23% public share holding we intend to finance via the issuance of Novartis shares. This mix of 7% cash/debt and 23% equity financing for the entire acquisition of Alcon represents a balanced compromise. Paying, we could have paid everything with cash and debt. This would have been feasible, but would lead to a downgrading of Novartis from AA to A and it would restrict our flexibility for future acquisitions <mark type="inaudible" />. Given the very strong free cash flow, we expect to be able to pay down our extra debt within four years.</p>
          <p>The impact of these transactions on EPS will be 9% dilutive in 2011 to EPS as reported under IFRS and immediately accretive to core EPS. Then I hand over to Joe.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Raymund. Okay, starting on slide 30, the Pharma division had a good fourth quarter. Our sales were up 13% versus year ago in local currency. Our core operating income was up 23% in U.S. dollars behind the strong sales growth and also the productivity gains and we had some good pipeline news that I'll talk about in a minute.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the full year results. If you look at the bar on the right, 28.5 billion in sales, that is up 12% in local currency and core operating income up 10% for the year or 16% in local currency. Showing some nice margin improvement.</p>
          <p>The best part, though, is that the strength is broad-based, as shown on 32. All therapeutic areas are up double-digits, as you can see on the chart. The new launches, as shown on the next slide, 33, delivered 1.4 billion in the quarter, this is 18% of our total. So the transformation of the portfolio ahead of the Diovan patent expiration is underway.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows that we had some very good pipeline news in the fourth quarter starting with Lucentis and the filing for diabetic macular edema. We had very strong Phase III results and just for perspective, there are 500,000 DME patients outside the U.S. that are treated and that compares with 600,000 patients for what AMD. So you can start to dimensionalize the opportunity that we see in DME.</p>
          <p>We also filed FTY720 as shown on slide 35 in both the U.S. and the EU. And I would say that our move into MS started last year with the commercialization of Extavia and we're getting very good experience on the commercial side of the business in this disease area, which I think will benefit us when we launch Gilenia. Next slide shows that we launched QAB in Europe under the Onbrez brand name and the early feedback in Germany is positive. We are targeting submission in the U.S., resubmission in the second half of the year, following the completion of some additional dose finding optimization studies.</p>
          <p>Now we also filed Tasigna for the first line indication in CML. Tasigna is turning out to be an even more potent compound than Glivec or CML. So, we are looking forward to having this first line settled.</p>
          <p>Now other news for the full year, if you flip to slide 38, you can see that we continued to be one of the fastest growing Pharma companies in 2009 at growth rates IMS growth rates of about 12%. I also wanted to call out one of our regions that's driving this growth on slide 39. In Europe, IMS shows us up 11% versus year ago. This is three times faster than the average of the top 10 Pharma companies in Europe, so it's a great performance.</p>
          <p>We also had very a strong performance in Development. Slide 40 shows that we had 25 key approvals in our major geographies and this is important because it didn't benefit 2009, but it will benefit '10, '11 and '12 as we go forward.</p>
          <p>We also had a record number of in-license compounds, as shown on slide 41. So six new compounds, as supplement to the internally developed pipeline. Compounds like Elinogrel, our new anti-thrombotic, and also down at the bottom, Relaxin, which is a compound from the Corthera acquisition that we announced in December, for acute decompensated heart failure.</p>
          <p>We've been able to grow our margin on the next slide while also investing heavily in the launches. And I think this is a story that the market has not yet fully digested. You can see over the last two years, core return on sales up 220 basis points and reported up 410 basis points, at a time of pretty significant investment. So the outlook for 2010 is mid to high single digit sales growth, so I believe that the momentum that we have will continue into 2010. Now the pricing environment will be less certain, which is why the guidance is mid to high-single digit, so with U.S. healthcare reform, with Japan biannual price cut and with some European cost containment measures I think, you know, given the momentum of the business, this will be a very good performance.</p>
          <p>Operating income growing ahead of sales, so margin improvement in 2010 and strong pipeline news flow. And I'll turn it back to Dan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joe. So, we are coming to slide 45, I'm going just to comment briefly on the other divisions and things. My colleagues are here if you have then further questions we can go into it.</p>
          <p>But slide 45 shows you the acceleration of growth in the Generics business, Sandoz. And the 10% obviously have been also positively impacted by the acquisition of the EBEWE, but I think that creates a new growth platform, which is very promising and important.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the free cash flow generation and how well Sandoz did contribute in this area with over 770 million dollars. The Biosimilars on the next slide also grew dynamically by over 70% and are proving now their position in the market place and gain more and more acceptance and I think that is a train which cannot be stopped anymore. In the future we have a leading position and we will do the utmost to keep that leading position in the future.</p>
          <p>Consumer Health on the next slide was really facing a market where we saw that the recession had a major negative impact. You see the negative development of the growth rates in these three industries in which we compete and really contrasting our own performance, which is a positive and shows how we gained market share in all three businesses.</p>
          <p>End of the year OTC had its most important project realized, which is Prevacid 24HR, at the launch sold over 120 million and had a blitz campaign and also the uptick in the market place has been good. So we are optimistic that this brand can reach a very substantial number, maybe in a few years, up to half a billion.</p>
          <p>The really big challenge last year was to respond to the high demand of H1N1 vaccine. We had numerous demands by governments who pressured us to deliver more and faster than we could. But that said, Novartis Vaccines was the first one to get the approval of a H1N1 vaccine, the first one to publish large studies and expand their clinical trials. And by year-end had sold 116 million doses and was &#x2013; have been paid for most of them. So going into the New Year, I think we have limited exposure. Obviously the demand in 2010 will not at all match the one in 2009. I hope that this pandemic is broadly over. It's a little bit early to say because we have now the southern hemisphere and there's still a risk of new patients, but we hope for the best.</p>
          <p>As more important, it becomes that in view of the cyclicality of the flu business, the Vaccine division builds a much more solid base. And we believe that the MENVEO and MenB franchise will offer this opportunity, covering really, kids with a very effective vaccine and creating a basis. We also in the recent years have invested much more into R&amp;D than in the previous history of the Company. And I think that in the future will pay off, but as we know it takes a long time to show.</p>
          <p>What we can show in slide 53 is a continuous growth over the past years of the top-line and the bottom-line. And in the next slide as a result, we were able to increase dividends continuously over 13 years by an average of 12% in Swiss francs and over 14% in U.S. dollars. Of the total shareholder return, slide 55, was better than pharma Novartis peers in the world market in the recent past, but also if you look over the entire 14-year period since 1996, total shareholder return reached 9% per annum and did exceed the other comparators clearly.</p>
          <p>Slide number 57, the Board decided to introduce a few new things as we went through this whole succession planning. The &#x2013; first of all, in the wake &#x2013; in the context of the financial crisis, we decided to introduce claw back clauses in all contracts, which will be implemented now across the world. Which really means if anybody has received its incentive, thanks to loading the trade or misdating the financial results or making the sales by unethical business behavior, he or she will have to pay back the incentive. Secondly, the Board did create a new risk committee last year and we are going to propose to our shareholders at the next AGM to a vote in a consultative mode, prospectively on our compensation systems and to incorporate that in our statutes. That is something which is not yet being done. It's different from current practice where retrospectively shareholders express their view on the compensation system or absolute compensation and we don't believe this is a really productive discussion. It's much more important to be able to integrate the view of the shareholders in the decision-making process looking forward.</p>
          <p>Slide number 58, shows you the new organizational structure. Joe Jimenez becoming CEO as of February 1, 2010, all changes are effective by February 1 or at February 1. Secondly, you see that succeeding to Joe, David Epstein has been appointed as Global Division Head of Pharma, that Jon Symonds has been appointed as Global CFO of the Group. And this gives me opportunity to formally thank Raymund. I think it's your last analyst call after many, many years. So, Raymund, I'm sure not only my colleagues, but many of the analysts would congratulate you and thank you for the way you have handled them. So in their name, I'm expressing my thanks.</p>
          <p>And then we have no changes in the Division and the leadership of research, but two colleagues are missing on the chart. As we went through this whole planning, we meaning the Board, we decided to eliminate the position of Chief Operating Officer because it would layer &#x2013; create too many layers, so delayering was right if we separate chairman and CEO. And secondly, we redistributed some of the responsibilities which were under Thomas Wellauer and Andreas Rummelt into the divisions or as it relates to control and risk management or risk systems, really I should say, to the auditing compliant function.</p>
          <p>So I'm extremely grateful to the colleagues who have now decided to leave because their jobs were either eliminated or they didn't want to take what was available. I fully understand and the Board understands their decision. I think they have a good track record in all cases. Joerg Reinhardt has led our development organization successfully for many years before taking over Vaccines and Diagnostics and then becoming the COO. So with that, I think we complete the chapter in the Company history and are happily looking forward, full of confidence that the next team will lead us to new horizons and new successes.</p>
          <p>With that, I come to the priorities and you see there's not a lot of change. The executive committee has discussed these priorities so it should be no surprise that there's no &#x2013; not much change. Certainly in the short term once we get approvals and agreements, the integration of Alcon will be crucial while continuing to invest into innovation.</p>
          <p>And finally, in the outlook we are projecting growth at the Group level at mid-single digit; we believe we can improve the operating margin on the Group level. We haven't put a projection on net income because the question about Alcon and the impact of Alcon is so important that we will know that as we move forward in the course of the year. But I would say excluding Alcon of course, we could be very confident to have a record bottom-line result.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll open just for the Q&amp;A. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Given your strong free cash flow improvement and your, the large upcoming acquisition, can you just detail what you view as the optimum of gearing level, maybe in terms of net debt to EBITDA. And how you want to use the free cash going forward apart from acquisitions, obviously. Secondly, on Gilenia, do you still see a chance to get priority review in the U.S. and what does that depend on? And then lastly, on MenB, can you just remind us what the latest discussions with the FDA are about exactly? Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>First, Jon Symonds here. If I can take the first question on financing and cash flow. I think as Raymund has already announced, particularly strong feature of this year's performance was the growth of cash flow which was <mark type="inaudible" /> the rate of earnings, which is clearly part of a set of initiatives that have been established in the last two years and one that will become either more important as we think about going forward. Raymund has also talked about how we selected the financing of Alcon through the mix of cash and equity. Indeed we could have funded the entire purchase with cash and debt, but judged that it was right to introduce an element of equity, thereby preserving the AA rating, which we believe to be very important going forward in order to ensure that we have the right disciplines around financial management, but also are able to avail ourselves of opportunities that arise and obviously are within that rating.</p>
          <p>There are a series, although they are different by depending on rating agencies, a series of financial metrics and characteristics that enable us to keep in that range. So that is where we will be targeting our financial performance going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just follow-up on that? I probably meant more like how quickly are you going to pay down the debt? What's your target there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think again, Raymund said this, that we should be able to pay it down within four years based on the cash flow as we foresee it, of course, you know, how we use that cash flow will depend on the opportunity mix as it comes forward. But the underlying cash generation within the business should enable us to move through the current debt burden very quickly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Gilenia, so we will get feedback from the FDA in February on two issues. One is around acceptance of the file and the other is on our request for priority review. On the front of the file we've been careful with this so I think that there are no issues with the file itself. And in terms of the priority review, I think we have a very strong position, being the first oral therapy under review with the FDA at this point. So I think that is very likely to come in February.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on MenB, to recap in Europe we have enrolled all our patients in our Phase III trials. We expect the results mid-2010 of this year and then we aspire to file at the end of the year. In the U.S., the FDA had asked us for two things before we could discuss our Phase III program. One was incremental safety data in addition of what we already had for -- in our Phase II program. This has been collected and is available. Secondly, they wanted us to develop a more scientific model by which we could prove that this vaccine would really cover most of the about 500 different MenB strains who are circulating in the United States.</p>
          <p>And we have developed that model. It was quite an impressive scientific effort and we have now requested the end of Phase II meeting with the FDA, which will happen in the next few months and there we will discuss our proposal and how to start the Phase III.</p>

          <p>The next question from Mr. Kevin Wilson, Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. First question is also related to cash generation, but thinking about the opportunity to be more efficient going forward. Relative to what you have achieved so far with Project Forward, perhaps Jon, you could give us some sense of whether you can see the same again coming from the &#x2013; from other areas. And secondly, how you use that cash in terms of reinvesting in the business and some philosophical discussion about revenue growth versus margins because you have clearly indicated that margins, Joe's indicated that margins would improve in Pharma.</p>
          <p>Do you think that's gradual progression providing better revenue growth, so we're perhaps underestimating your opportunity for top-line growth in the business in the medium term? Secondly on Afinitor, could you give us some sense of, if you have a sense, of where &#x2013; what market penetration you've achieved in second, third line renal cancer and whether there's any inventory issues there? It seems a very strong quarter. And lastly on the Lucentis versus Avastin trial, the CAT trial. 12 months data due in February, when might we hear the results from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Kevin, on the first batch of questions. I think Project Forward has significantly exceeded its original targets and as Daniel has said, is now being closed. There won't be a new program opened because what Project Forward has enabled us to do is to embed the philosophy and the principles around efficiencies and productivity in business as it goes forward. And that's the right place it should be. But the fact that we are not announcing a new program does not mean that we are not taking the opportunities that we see for further efficiencies seriously. Indeed the cost base still is somewhere 30 billion and so there are still plenty of opportunities.</p>
          <p>You are right in saying that the objective of improving profitability is to give ourselves more options in the business, one of which is to invest in sales and marketing and improve the top line going forward. That will always be a high priority as indeed will be investing in good scientific opportunities. The third manifestation of it will be improved profits and I think we need to keep in balance all of those ingredients. And the fact that we are continuing to going forward with productivity improvements does not mean that we are stating profit maximization as an objective, it is not and it never will be. Is part of this three-pronged approach to ensuring that we're sustaining the business over the longer term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Kevin, this is Joe Jimenez. On the Pharma part of that question, if you think about the trade-off between revenue growth and margin improvement, the &#x2013; this is a business that is fundamentally about innovation and that we must continue to invest in the top line to continue to drive revenue growth. That doesn't mean that that's going to come at the expense of margin. I think over the last two years you can see that we were able to improve margin at a time of very heavy investment to create best in-class top-line growth at the same time. And it's the productivity opportunities that we have, you know, down to the territory-by-territory level across the entire globe that will be continued, continually mined to show that we are able to provide the top line and also drive margin improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of Afinitor, thanks for recognizing the very good start. We are very happy with the direction <mark type="inaudible" />. Just remember that the sales are still predominantly coming out of the U.S. and just the first European launches. In terms of your specific question, we only have data right now for the U.S. and it is fairly dated. It goes back to really the end of the summer. At that point in time, we had a roughly 20% of the third line patients, renal cell patients <mark type="inaudible" /> drug and roughly 15% of the second line patients. I suspect that is significantly higher in the U.S. by now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the CAT trials, we expect some data from the CAT trial to come out in 2011 and also from the corresponding small study in the U.K. Just remember that these studies are <mark type="inaudible" /> to show any definitive differences between Lucentis and Avastin. But nevertheless it does raise the priority and that has been our focus on the DME indication and the RVO indications, which are two new indications where some of the risk associated with the use of Avastin certainly favor one's tendency to use Lucentis.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mrs. Alexandra Hauber, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. My first set of questions targets Raymund or Jon and maybe I should start with saying thank you to Raymund for the last 14 years. I've always enjoyed immensely your discussion since '96 and since creation of Novartis. So, the question is, you have significantly reduced your inventory just during the fourth quarter and you're now down to five months inventory on-hand. And I was wondering whether you could specify the impact that had on the cost of goods either on the Group or Pharma level? And also specify I think the effect was most pronounced in Pharma, but it seems like Sandoz was also affected by that.</p>
          <p>Second question on the same line is, how do you expect this to play out going forward? Do you think you can reduce inventories further? Inventory benchmarks seem to suggest you may be able to squeeze out another month. So is that going to happen in the next one or two quarters? Is the corresponding hit to the COGS? And how do you generally approach this whole issue? Do you maximize cash at this stage or do you sort of balance the trade-off of cash generation versus possibility targets?</p>
          <p>And finally, just taking again a shot at a question I sort of asked earlier, could you just give us a rough idea how much debt you intend to raise for step two? In other words, or just give us an idea, I mean how much &#x2013; what's sort of the minimum level of operating cash you feel comfortable running the business with? I have also just a question on Vaccine and Diagnostics, and that is if I just look at the fourth quarter costs, it's quite hard to say how much of those cost backs are related to H1N1 and how much is sort of the underlying run rate. So I was just wondering whether you can give us any color on that, on looking at things like the marketing and sales and the R&amp;D charge. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alexandra, this is Joe Jimenez, I will start on the inventory question, because most of the impact was in Pharma. We did see a significant reduction in inventory over 2009 and particularly in the fourth quarter. You know, I think in great Novartis tradition when we get focused on something we really go after it and we took 69 days of inventory out of the system from the beginning of the year to the end of the year and there was a corresponding hit regarding margin due to that.</p>
          <p>Now we do expect to continue to reduce inventories going forward. I won't say, you know, it's in the first two quarters. This is going to be a longer term continued inventory reduction so that we can do it on an orderly basis. And if you think about the productivity initiatives that we have behind the technical operations group, expect to be able to offset additional inventory reductions with improved cost reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any way how you can give us some color about the margin impact of those 69 days? In -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I will tell you that it is included in our margin improvement year-to-date, so we &#x2013; I guess the point is that we're more than offsetting that hit with productivity elsewhere. Our cost of goods year-on-year if you look at the hit was about a point and a half and that inventory was most of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Alexandra, I take the question on step two financing. As you rightly noted, it depends a bit on the free cash flow generation as we go forward and it depends on the closing date for the step two. You know, the later the closing, the more free cash flow we accumulate. At the moment we think that approximately 12 to 16 billion could be financed by debt. Obviously we hope that it will be more at the lower end, given the free cash flow generation.</p>
          <p>The financing, the term of the financing is still very much open. We obviously monitor market developments very carefully in order to decide whether we should take out three to five year debt or whether we should rely more on the commercial paper market in the U.S. Obviously at the moment, the rates at the shorter end of the curve are much more attractive but that will have to be <mark type="inaudible" /> while this develops. So this mix is still very open, the mix between commercial paper and term financing of bonds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So no level of sort of minimum operating cash you need, which you want to disclose?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I can give you a hint there, Alexandra. I think we currently have a target of approximately 8% of sales as a minimum operating level of cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Can we go to the next &#x2013; next is Vaccines, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so with regards to your question on COGS, we indeed -- if you look at the different line items in COGS clearly the incremental spend is for the <mark type="inaudible" /> of H1N1 production. On marketing and sales we had no incremental significant spend over the previous year with the exception of the preparation of the MENVEO launch <mark type="inaudible" /> that we have built up in the U.S., and on R&amp;D it is a combination of two things. One, our of course the significant trial for H1N1, but also incremental spend for our late stage meningitis pipeline, as well as the early development projects that we're now moving ahead. If you look at the total year and the profitability that we had this year then I can say that the majority of the incremental profit over 2008 comes from our flu franchise.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Graham Perry, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks for taking my questions. Question for both Joe and Jon, just as you are moving into your new roles. I think Joe, you've previously said you would really like to target sales and marketing ratios and you talked and I appreciate this is in the forecast, but you talked about &#x2013; I think about an ambition of heading into the mid to low 20s as a percentage of sales for Pharma. Now, based on your comments before, do you still think that's a realistic long-term target and do you think you can continue to grow margin through Diovan and Zeneth patent expiries?</p>
          <p>Second question on Onbrez, you're now indicating discussions with the FDA related to what clinical trials are needed. Can you just confirm you will definitely need the lower dose in the Phase III trial and give us update on what you have done with the combo products? So have you actually started Phase III trials there yet? And then just a quick update on the minority Alcon offer, could you just give us the latest expected timetable for the Alcon shareholder and Board vote on your initial proposal? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting with the sales and marketing question. As you can see from the full-year results, we were able to reduce our sales and marketing expense as a percent of sales 150 basis points this year. So we will continue in the years ahead to pull that ratio down as we &#x2013; what we call geo-tailor our field forces in ways that we're looking down to the territory level and improving profitability, redeploying and as markets also become more restrictive we are pulling total number of reps out. So I think you can continue to see that going forward.</p>
          <p>Regarding that aspiration, obviously I must have been very bold to say that because that is quite a low number versus where we are today, but if you just look at our progress that we've made in the last two years and project that we believe that we can continue to become best in class from a sales and marketing efficiency standpoint, I think that is where we'll end. Regarding Onbrez?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so Graham, as you indicated, we have this short duration package of work that it does involve lower doses, in particular 75 microgram dose that we'll be resubmitting in the second half of 2010. In terms of the combination programs, the QVA program is going to start on track or maybe even a little early in May of this year, the Phase III program for QVA. And the doses there are the doses that we've been successful with ex-U.S. and that program should be fine, but of course the read-out from this dose program that is going forward now would fit into the QVA program for the U.S. going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, can I just clarify that, so you would potentially start an extra 75 microgram combination once you get feedback from the FDA or that you are starting that win in May?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're not because we have the doses that we've already successfully registered ex-U.S. at this point. It remains to be seen what the efficacy is of the 75 versus the already registered doses. The 150 and the 300 doses, which were approved in Europe, look to be highly effective. So, we will see what the outcome is of this short program that we have in the first half of 2010, before adding anything to the QVA program at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I get it. There's flexibility in the trial to add an extra dose, further down the line should you need it.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Graham, on the timing for the merger transaction with Alcon, first I have to tell you that the step three transaction obviously is subject to a regulatory review in the U.S., in Europe and in a number of other countries. That's why we expect that this step two transaction will close some time in the second half of 2010. The merger transaction is contingent on the closing of this second step that is why I mentioned. You will appreciate and understand that at this point in time, we do not comment on or do not speculate on the timeline for this merger transaction because too many things are up in the air.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Oh hi, thanks for taking my questions, just got two. Firstly, on generic Lovenox, what we've been hearing quite a few bits of commentary in the market, both from your sales and a few other people. And it just appears that you are growing more confident versus your commentary last year on an approval in the U.S. of a generic Lovenox, can you give us anymore clarity on this and why are you more optimistic now than you indicated last year? Secondly, just on Pharma margins, just trying to think about this slightly differently. Through the period sort of 2009 to 2013, do you have any kind of aspiration to keep Pharma margins flat through that period with some of the significant patent expiries? I mean, how are you thinking about that to help us shape &#x2013; shape the curve of the margins there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on Enoxaparin, as we've said in the past, we aspire to launch as soon as we get FDA approval. In all candor, we have been wrong in the past and approval timing is often difficult to predict. What I can say is that we believe we've satisfactorily resolved each of the specific outstanding issues we faced in the past: legal, technical, regulatory and we are awaiting FDA's ruling on two remains citizens' petitions and remain cautiously optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Pharma margins, it would be premature to comment beyond 2010. We have said that we expect to grow operating income in 2010 ahead of our sales growth and obviously that would be our aspiration every year. Some years there may be events that would prevent that from happening, but our action is directed towards improving productivity in a way that will allow us to leverage the revenue growth to help us grow margin.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A few questions, if I can. On the meningitis B vaccine, you know if you look on clinicaltrials.gov, you guys are running trials looking at different formulations of that vaccine that suggest you may not have found the ideal formulation perhaps because of tolerability issues. So my question to you is, are you happy or is FDA happy with the current formulation and the tolerability of that product?</p>
          <p>The second question on generic Lovenox, can you either confirm or deny that you may have already shipped product, embargoed product to the trade and are starting to fill the channel? And the last question goes back to I think it was mentioned as part of the Pharma sales guidance, I believe Joe talked about uncertain pricing in the U.S. in 2010 and I guess from my perspective, I don't see there as being hardly any uncertainty on pricing, on pricing power in the U.S., so I'm wondering what you see differently versus what I might see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on meningitis B, I think as we have previously reported we had seen in our Phase II trials a fever rate which we also see in our Phase III trials. Now it's not the fever rate that has led to any adverse events that are worrisome and we are confident that the risk benefit profile based on what we know to date is very positive. And remember it's a deadly disease. I mean that kills children and there is no vaccine available to protect against it. That being said, of course we are looking at all the formulations, by which we will be able to make the vaccine even better going forward. But one has to keep in mind that fever of course is a natural response to immune &#x2013; to create immunity. So to find the right balance having no fever but still good protection, is not that easy, but nevertheless, we are trying.</p>
          <p>It is not because we do not believe in the good risk benefit of the first you know, vaccine now that we have in Phase III.</p>

          <p>Tim, this is Jeff, as you can imagine for competitive reasons we don't comment on any pre-launch commercial activities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just in terms of the uncertain pricing, Tim, what I was referring to was really more on the rebate side with U.S. healthcare a little bit less certain now and the Massachusetts Senate race decided, the point was not pricing power, but really where will healthcare end up in the U.S. regarding Medicaid rebates, regarding the donut hole, regarding some of the other elements that will cost us in terms of net price and really the U.S. is probably the most certain of the regions.</p>
          <p>If I think about Europe and I think about &#x2013; you know that there is a biannual price-cut in Japan. So if you look at the cost containment potential in some of the places outside the U.S. and you compare that with what happened in 2009, that's what led to the comment about the pricing uncertainty. Our 12% growth, about 9.5 points is volume and about 2.5 points was price. And you could see that price maybe flip the other way if there is more aggressive cost containment in Europe.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. I wanted to ask in regards to Sandoz, but can you maybe talk through what the situation is with regards to getting top product sale back onto the market? And then maybe more sort of longer term with regards to Sandoz in terms of for the year in 2010, you are launching Prevacid generic, Prograf generic, you'll include Evevey for a full year. Can you maybe talk through the growth outlook in terms of top line for Sandoz in 2010 and having a sustainable level going forward. And then secondly may I ask about Consumer Healthcare in particular as it relates to Prevacid 24HR. I'm just trying to understand that 20% market share after two months, what would that imply on an annualized basis for sales? I appreciate you've shipped about $100 billion, but just curious as to know what that would equate to already given the rapid uptake it would seem?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first on the question of Metoprolol succinate for Sandoz, the generic for Toprol XL, the &#x2013; there was a supplement that required FDA approval, which we submitted in September of 2009 and the guidance is that approval can take up to 12 months. So we are again cautiously optimistic to bring the product back to market later this year. In terms of the 2010 outlook, we expect continued acceleration of our growth across regions, with the exception of Germany, where the market is projected to decline double digit. We are targeting to outgrow the market in every region and as you mentioned, Evevey will also help accelerate our growth as will the key launches that we had in the U.S., notably Tacrolimus and Lansoprazole, which were two of the temp 25 products that we launched in the U.S. in 2009 versus 17 in 2008. So we continue to look for top-line acceleration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the Prevacid number, we have a 20% market share and that is the proton pump inhibitor market which of course is the competitive product plus private label, so 20% gets to a reasonable number in that market. It is difficult to get accurate data and we would anticipate a higher number as the year goes on.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen, thank you for taking my question. Few quick questions. First on vaccines, excluding H1N1 contribution in 2010, what is your view of the performance of this division? And second question again on vaccines, is it possible there is some depreciation of inventory of H1N1 in 2010? And last one on vaccines, on MenB, will you disclose the Phase III data in 2010 before the European filing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question with regards to the profitability, what &#x2013; or the underlying business performance. What I can say is that it's difficult to exactly say how the year would have evolved given that of course we had some impact on our seasonal flu business because we produced more what with H1N1. I think, overall we saw a good growth in many of our products. We would have expected the growing business, with the profitability probably similar to previous years given that you invest more in our R&amp;D pipeline and into the launch of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>The second question with regards to inventory, we do expect I think inventory to impact in terms of write-offs for H1N1 in 2010. And for the last question with regards to MenB, yes, I think once the data is available and is well analyzed we would expect to publish it.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Couple questions for Joe and Daniel, please. When I look at your business, you now clearly have critical mass in pharmaceuticals and ophthalmology in generics, but the two areas that stand out and particularly the one area is vaccines, where you look distinctly light versus your large competitors in scale. So my question is, are you willing to count on the potential JVs or other routes to potentially gain scale?</p>
          <p>Particularly in the &#x2013; I would argue, the likely event that MenB doesn't see commercialization in the current form in the U.S. So, that would be the first question. The second question on Lovenox, and I appreciate your &#x2013; that you don't address any of the stocking questions that have been put to you. I'd be interested in your thoughts regarding how many &#x2013; how many biosimilars do you think will be approved? Do you think it is an all or nothing phenomenon or are you anticipating that there will be differentiation between the various companies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, I think you should answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously when -- you drew the right conclusion around critical mass. I believe that if you look at the portfolio right now it's broadly right, especially with the Alcon, acquisition which will create a new growth platform for us in eyecare. What we need to do, though, is we need to go deeper with some of the businesses to gain global scale and Vaccines and Diagnostics is one of those areas.</p>
          <p>We will grow Vaccines and Diagnostics through organic growth, through local acquisitions and we wouldn't rule out other strategic options beyond that. And I think Andrin probably could best add to that in terms of ways to gain scale in the vaccines business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you know the priorities that Joe has outlined are exactly the way that we pursue them. We grow internally what we have and I think we have good growth opportunities, also geographically. And then we look at opportunities to expand, you know, with local acquisitions and I think in China, you know, this acquisition of Zhejiang, would give us an excellent platform to advance further in Asia, pending government approval, which we expect in the first half of this year. And we're pursuing such other opportunities while we move along. And on MenB, I would just add one comment, which is that this is disease burden right now that we see for MenB is not in the U.S. So, I would not underestimate the potential that vaccine would have in Europe but also in other parts of the world</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to Noxaparin, again, I can't really comment on competitors' product profiles or the FDA's intentions from a regulatory perspective, what I can say more broadly to the topic of biosimilars, as Daniel mentioned already, we had 73% growth in this business to reach nearly 120 million in sales making us the clear leader in follow-on biologics and biosimilars with three approved and marketed products in Europe and we continue to forecast and target significant growth expansion in follow-on biologics.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Three questions. Looking at Diovan, in particularly in the U.S., one of the biggest elements of debate amongst investors is how sustainable that franchise will be in the face of Cozaar generics later this year. Can you tell us if you have seen any activity by purchasers  to try and encourage patients to start on a drug that will more quickly go generic and whether you've had to respond in any way in terms of higher levels of discounts? On the vaccines business, just looking at the core R&amp;D, that's gone up from 327 million to 465 million.</p>
          <p>Was any of that opportunistic in the sense that you could increase costs on a pretty-much one-time basis because you had some one-time income in vaccines or is that the level of ongoing R&amp;D costs that we should expect? Because if it is, and you haven't got any of the pandemic flu income, presumably we're going to see a pretty poor result for Vaccines and Diagnostics in that division this year. And finally, I wonder if Joe could tell us a bit about his vision for the other businesses, the Consumer Health business. You've got $5 billion odd of sales that we rarely hear about. It's an area where he has perhaps more experience than other pharmaceutical executives. And I wonder if it is an area that he feels is ripe for further expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting with your question about Diovan in the U.S. and how sustainable it is, you know, as we've said before, we think about our hypertension franchise as a franchise. So, Diovan, Tekturna, Tekturna HCT, now Valturna, so many of the <mark type="inaudible" /> combinations, Exforge, and if you look at that total hypertension franchise this year in the U.S. we grew 8% and in the fourth quarter we grew 10%. And so we fully expect Diovan to be impacted by Cozaar once it goes generic. I think you can assume that we will increase rebate levels to maintain formulary access as that occurs, but you can also see &#x2013; you'll also see a significant shift in resources towards some of the other compounds in that hypertension portfolio, so that we can continue to grow it through the Diovan patent expiration. I'll &#x2013; now that I'm still on, I'll talk the third question that you had, which is the vision for Consumer Health.</p>
          <p>I do believe we have a very good Consumer Health business, but if you look at it today particularly the OTC business is sub-scale, meaning from a global standpoint, we have to go deeper and make that a bigger and stronger business. And I think the strategy as articulated by that business unit is smart and that is that we're going to continue to build our key brands in key geographies, we're going to acquire opportunistically as those opportunities provide themselves, but as you know that is a very difficult space in terms of assets that come on the market and then finally, we're going to increase our activity around switching from patent expiry to over the counter. You know, if you look at the number of compounds that are coming off patent over the next five to six years, it's substantial and we believe that will provide a substantial opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to your question on the R&amp;D spend on vaccines, the vast majority of the increase that you see is H1N1 related. That we had beyond the commitment that we made for licensure, significant commitments for post-licensure clinical trials, several ten thousands of patients that we have to execute in over the coming year. And of course we have to approve these costs when we sell the vaccine because it is really linked to of course the H1N1 revenues that we have.</p>
          <p>That being said, I do expect the underlying R&amp;D expense to increase in the coming year because of MENVEO and menB. These are large-scale trials that of course require significant investment in a small division as we are, we cannot compensate that by productivity improvements in one given year. Definitely we would not want to compromise on these promising axis' that we have and we really do what it takes to make them successful as possible.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I have a couple questions if I may. Firstly, if I might ask on the free cash flow generation for Sandoz, a particularly dramatic improvement. I wonder if you might be able to highlight what the working capital component of that improved free cash flow was? Secondly, trade receivables increased by I think $1.3 billion and yet if I heard you correctly, Dr. Vasella, you said that you'd been paid for most of the H1N1 sales. So, I wonder if somebody could just comment a little bit on why the trade receivables rose the way they did? And finally, perhaps your free cash flow increased by 24% this year, or 2009, but Alcon which will surely give you a dramatic increase in free cash flow. Yet the dividend only increased by 5% much more in line with your core EPS. Should we be using free cash flow as a guide for your dividend growth longer term or core EPS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first on the question of Sandoz free cash flow, as Daniel mentioned we saw free cash flow growth of 72% or about 775 million over the previous year on a 5% sales growth. That was driven by three factors. The first was much tighter cost control. We set out at the beginning of the year to achieve operating cost savings of 250 million. We achieved well over 350 million of realized in year cost savings in 2009 as part of Project Compete. So that was quite successful. Secondly, we've been more targeted in our CapEx expenditure. And I think third you alluded to it from a working capital perspective, we've been able to reduce inventories to improve our payable position and to improve our position with respect to days outstanding. So improvement in a number of areas and working capital. On the inventory side, since that was a question from Alexandra I believe earlier, we took targeted reduction in Poland, Turkey and Mexico and we've been working on driving inventory down in the U.S. and Europe, as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think with regards to accounts receivable, as far as H1N1 is concerned, we had of course shaved a significant quantity <mark type="inaudible" /> because of the ramp-up really towards the end of the year, end of December, early January was when a lot of the shipments had happened. And I think at this point in time, we're very comfortable that the $1 billion in sales that we booked for H1N1 is to a large extent in the banks. Now we have shipped in more now than this one. There of course right now it's more difficult to predict what at the end some of the governments will do. And as you may know, we are in discussions with some of them, basically trying to find new win solutions where they feel they have too much vaccine and we of course feel we have the right to get paid for what we've done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe Michael, I can just add here. Of the 18% increase in accounts receivable, the large majority was related to H1N1. This was the year-end number. In the meantime, most of it has been collected already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's a very important point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the third part, Michael, on performance measures and you know recently we've introduced core earnings as a measure because of the significance of amortization and acquisition related charges and obviously that will be even more significant in our reported numbers going forward. Clearly also with the amount of indebtedness that we'll take on, free cash flow will become even more important than it has been. But I think in terms of thinking of the dividend, the dividend is a payment out of profits and so it is the profit measure that we've talked about, the pay-out ratio guidance that was given that is the most relevant measure for future dividend payments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my questions. Just a question firstly on FTY. Have you studied any other lower doses than the half milligram dose? The study that you published just recently does clearly show a reduction in the safety profile at low dose with a reasonable protection of efficacy. So, my question was, are there plans or any preparations for any possible lower dose should the FDA come back and ask for that? Secondly regarding Diovan and the high potential franchise, when will we &#x2013; when would we be able to see the effects of the resources being pulled away from Diovan and on to some of the other combination products in terms of some of those combination products showing an improvement in sales? And lastly, on Elinogrel any just, any timing on when we're going to be able to get to see the first clinical trials on this promising product? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Please, Trevor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on FTY we have not looked at lower doses within the context of this program. As you point out, there is a clear improvement in the safety at the low-dose .5 versus the 1.25 dose. But in the freedom study, and that was different from the first one-year study. So in the two-year study we had placed more emphasis given that was a placebo controlled study. We did see a somewhat of a decrement in efficacy at &#x2013; a slight decrement in efficacy at the low dose versus the high dose. So I think that that puts us with a normal kind of dose response and the utility of studying much lower doses becomes much less than it might have appeared originally.</p>
          <p>As far as Elinogrel goes -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, Trevor, could you say a word about maybe success in &#x2013; rather investing in successive compounds than, you know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So, we are really looking at this S1P as a franchise on a number of compounds because clearly where there's efficacy in one auto immune disorder, there is the potential and we have studies underway in a number of different directions. With the compound that we've talked a little bit about called BAK, which is a more selective S1P agent, where we are looking at a wide range of doses. But beyond BAK we also have a number of other follow-on compounds, all of them with slightly different properties, different half-lives and the half-life being critical to the particular disorder you are looking at. So I think that the use of much lower doses will much more likely come in the successive second generation programs. For this program, I think we have defined the efficacy and an acceptable safety profile.</p>
          <p>As far as Elinogrel goes, we have completed the in-clinic phase of the Innovate PCI study, which is the quite big study that we are executing with Portola and we will be looking at that data in the first half of this year and expect to have results out from that somewhere around the middle of this year, 2010. We are still on track to execute the &#x2013; and to initiate the Phase III program in this year as we've indicated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding Diovan and some of the other fixed-dose combinations that will be accelerated, you can &#x2013; probably towards the back half of 2010 and into 2011, when you would expect to see an acceleration <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
