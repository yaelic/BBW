          <p>Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apache Fourth Quarter/Year-End 2010 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Alfonso Leon, Vice President of Planning, Strategy, and Investor Relations. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Thank you. Mr. Leon, you may begin your conference.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call.</p>
          <p>This morning we reported 2010 net income of $3 billion, or $8.46 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $3.2 billion, or $8.94 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $7.4 billion.</p>
          <p>On today's call, we'll have five speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will lead off, followed by John Crum, Co-Chief Operating Officer and President of North America; Rod Eichler, Co-Chief Operating Officer and President of international; Roger Plank, our President; and Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>We prepared our usual detailed supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations, or costs incurred. This data package can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financial data.</p>
          <p>Today's discussions may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurances can be given those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alfonso, and thank you, everybody, for joining us this afternoon.</p>
          <p>All of you I'm sure have read this morning that Apache announced record production of 658,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day for 2010. That's a 13% growth from the previous year. As Alfonso pointed out, we had record annual earnings of $3 billion, and we also ended the year with record proved reserves around 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. So under any metrics, Apache had an outstanding 2010.</p>
          <p>We delivered major growth oil projects, including Van Gogh and Pyrenees in Australia, and the Kalabsha oil facility in the Western Desert. We advanced our global gas resource monetization strategy through the agreement of an oil-linked off-take agreement for our Julimar field by Wheatstone LNG, and are becoming majority owners of Kitimat LNG project in Canada. And we took some opportunistic portfolio steps that made us even stronger than the portfolio we started off with at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>In the Permian, we more than doubled our footprint to over 3 million gross acres, spanning every play in the basin. In Canadam we gained high-quality properties at an entry price based on low gas prices. In Egypt, we have secured a second major export route for natural gas out of the Western Desert, which should enhance our growth prospects there. And in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, we reloaded our inventory with a new underworked property set from Devon and Mariner. And last but not least, we gained a new long-term growth business in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>Now, those are just some of the highlights. There's much more on a day-to-day basis going on that creates value for us, and John and Rod will walk through that in a moment. But the short answer is we're looking at an opportunity set for many years to come, like none we've ever had. We're organizing an Analyst Day for May 17th in which we will outline in more detail what this updated opportunity set looks like.</p>
          <p>Before I turn to 2011, I'd like to provide you a little color &#x2013; an update on our Egyptian operations. The most important item is that all Apache's staff and families are safe. Like everyone to understand that Apache has not experienced any production interruption as a result of the developments in Egypt during the recent weeks. And following the advice of U.S. State Department, two weeks ago we redeployed all nonessential expatriate personnel and all expatriate dependents from Egypt. We have created an Egypt floor in Houston, and activity is going on as usual. I might add that the general situation in Egypt has improved markedly over the last week. About a third of our ex-pat personnel are already back in Egypt, including most of our field staff. We continue to monitor events closely and will take additional steps if necessary to ensure the continued safety of our staff and operations.</p>
          <p>I'd like to turn now to our plans for 2011. For 2011, it's going to be a very strong growth year for Apache. We're going to consolidate around our larger opportunity set, and we're building our balance sheet strength as we go into the year. So presently we've authorized $7.5 billion of capital expenditures for 2011, which is significantly less than our anticipated cash flow for the year based on strip prices. Apache's balance sheet strength and flexibility is an important strategic asset, and we want to ensure we continue to build them for 2011. And so we've deliberately established an initial capital budget that will enable us to reduce debt, even if prices decline from today's strip. And as been our custom over the years, we'll review capital <mark type="inaudible" /> and should strip prices hold or rise, we'd expect to increase capital later this year.</p>
          <p>We intend to supplement our debt reduction efforts by pursuing approximately $1 billion of property sales in 2011. These are most likely going to come from our legacy conventional properties in Canada. With the BP transaction, we have an opportunity to high-grade and right-size our portfolio up there. We're going to continue to invest in future growth projects. Nearly a third of our 2011 capital program is going to projects which contribute no production in 2011 but will result in later years' production, which ensures our continued long-term profitable growth.</p>
          <p>With this capital program, we expect to deliver in 2011 strong double-digit production growth of between 13% and 17% over 2010. And I want to point out, this excludes any impact from potential acquisitions or divestures. Our acquisitions in 2010 will obviously be an important growth driver in 2011. This is purely a function of our capital allocation. Over the last two years, we've invested $8 billion in additions to oil and gas properties, including future growth projects and over $12 billion in acquisitions. So if we'd have allocated that $12 billion of spending capacity to drilling instead, our growth for 2011 would come from that drilling capital.</p>
          <p>As all of you I know are aware, we are a rate of return driven company, and every year we channel our resources into the projects that provide the best returns and long-term growth for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>I might add that looking beyond 2011, what was a deep opportunity set has become significantly deeper. Our regions have looked beyond now in 2015, and they currently have identified inventory to grow production from 6% to 12% per year, with attractive economics that are <mark type="inaudible" /> assumptions. I want to make it clear that that's not necessarily what we are going to do. That means we have an opportunity set to do that. Every year we adjust our plans to give our shareholders the most attractive returns on a long-term growth basis. And we'll outline some of this inventory in our May Analyst Day.</p>
          <p>The true picture is that our growth in 2011 and beyond is only limited by how much money we spend. We're only scratching the surface of our opportunity set. In the 1.7 million gross acres of BP Permian business, we're starting to get enough data to build a real inventory. In other parts of the portfolio, such as the Gulf of Mexico, we don't have a clear picture of what our capital spending will be, given the regulatory process uncertainty. I'm sure we will learn more as the year progresses, and we intend to put a new plan together halfway through the year to ensure we fund the best opportunities. We may also release additional drilling capital depending upon commodity prices and our balance sheet progress. As most of you are aware, this really isn't unusual for us. Historically, we have allocated capital to our regions on a quarterly basis in any event.</p>
          <p>I'd finally note that we have always been and will remain opportunistic company. We don't have any BP-sized transactions on the horizon, but we are seeing more of the quality assets we like. We never plan for acquisitions, and we will capture those opportunities if and when they make sense based on our experience.</p>
          <p>And with that I'd like to turn it over to John Crum.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve.</p>
          <p>North American production in the fourth quarter was up 26% sequentially. The main positive drivers were the consolidation of acquisitions and the Granite Wash development. The negatives were primarily associated with the ongoing permitting issues in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>With that in mind, I will start with the Gulf of Mexico Shelf. For perspective, in 2008 we drilled 62 gross wells in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf. In 2009, <mark type="inaudible" /> 20 wells due to low product prices and the resultant corporate capital curtailment. Consequently, we started 2010 with an especially strong 59-well inventory on Apache properties alone. That would be excluding the Devon and Mariner acquisition properties we got last year. Due to the moratorium and the permitting process delay, we were only able to drill 36, including the Devon properties. Similar restrictions affected the Mariner assets.</p>
          <p>With ongoing uncertainty around the permitting process, we cannot assume a normal year. And as a result, we're planning 41 gross wells on the shelf, including the Mariner and Devon properties. In spite of, this we anticipate region production to grow moderately in the 3% to 5% range in 2011, with a full year of contribution of the 2010 acquisitions.</p>
          <p>The Gulf of Mexico Shelf remains an attractive rate of return business and a big cash flow generator for Apache. The silver lining of two years of reduced activity is that when we get back to work at full pace, we will have a very robust pent-up inventory of drilling opportunities.</p>
          <p>With the Mariner acquisition, we formed a new Deepwater region and are excited about its contribution potential to Apache's long-term growth. Mariner's Deepwater team constitutes the core of the new region organization, and we know Apache will benefit from their know-how and track record of project delivery. Our Deepwater region brought onstream its first Apache project in late December. The Balboa Field was developed through a 6-mile subsea tieback to the existing infrastructure, with initial production of 6,500 barrels equivalent per day gross. Apache operates with a 50% working interest. During 2011, we expect four other tieback projects to come onstream at Bushwood, Wide Berth, Mandy, and Ewing Banks 998. We expect 2011 deepwater production to average over 15,000 barrels per day, subject to any regulatory delays.</p>
          <p>Looking beyond 2011 we have an attractive pipeline of deepwater development projects, including the world-class discoveries at Lucius and Heidelberg. We also have a broad exploration portfolio across 110 blocks. While we have moderate expectations until there is greater regulatory clarity, the potential for Apache to build a meaningful business in the deepwater is significant.</p>
          <p>We have also created a new region to focus on our Gulf Coast onshore assets, where we control over 700,000 acres, including almost 300,000 acres in South Louisiana, where we own the minerals. We believe the opportunities for growth onshore warrant having a dedicated organization, and based on our recent experience in the Permian since it was create as a focused region, we expect great things from our Gulf Coast Onshore team. In 2011, we currently forecast strong single digit growth for the Gulf Coast Onshore region.</p>
          <p>Moving to the Central region, we will keep about 12 rigs running all year long, with more than 95% of those drilling horizontally. The Granite Wash play will remain the strong growth driver in 2011, where we will keep at least eight horizontal rigs busy during the year. We expect to drill 40 gross horizontal Granite Wash wells and achieve production growth of over 10% in 2011. During 2010, the Central transitioned from vertical to horizon wells almost completely. We control over 1 million acres, primarily in Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, which means that as new horizontal drilling plays emerge, the Central region has the footprint to make those new opportunities material to Apache's growth.</p>
          <p>Moving to the Permian, we now own over 3 million gross acres with exposure to every play in the Permian Basin. The BP and Mariner transactions enabled us to more than double our footprint from last year. Given the excitement about the potential of the basin, frankly we <mark type="inaudible" /> releasing our asset auctions. We are currently running 23 rigs in the Permian and plan to remain above 20 all year long, while drilling 368 wells for the year. Mariner's Deadwood assets will be the largest component of this activity. Our acreage is subject to continuous drilling clauses, so we are now running 11 rigs and will average 10 for the remainder of the year, drilling 130 wells.</p>
          <p>We are primarily drilling vertical wells for Wolfcamp, which get enhanced when we find fossil man and strong fay in the same wellbore. We're developing the acreage with vertical wells costing around $1.8 million. The typical IP is 125 barrels equivalent per day, and produce EURs in the 150,000 BOEs, ultimate recovery, with over 75% of that being liquids. These wells deliver rates of return well above 20% at plan prices, which are currently significantly <mark type="inaudible" />. We have already identified 800 locations in this asset alone, and that is before we include any horizontal prospectivity, which we're just now starting to evaluate. We hold 85,000 gross acres or 63,000 net. It's a great asset.</p>
          <p>The second largest component is our joint venture with Concho in the Empire/Yeso, where we're now running two rigs and will drill 55 wells this year. We have identified over 600 locations already. We expect these wells to be lower cost and generate higher rates of return than Deadwood. In 2010, we also had good results drilling horizontals in four different old waterfloods and continue to learn more about the potential for horizontals in the Permian Basin. In 2011, we will drill 41 horizontal wells across a number of our assets. The Empire/Yeso area is the first piece of BP's 1.7 million gross acres that we acquired where we will have a new regional project. We are currently working through an integration plan which will be completed by midyear. We are confident that we will generate numerous other project opportunities on those BP properties.</p>
          <p>As Steve noted, we're only starting to scratch the surface on our Permian opportunity set. We're in early steps of evaluating horizontal potential in the basin, and still getting our arms around the entire BP opportunity set. We've gone from five operating rigs at this time last year to over 20 today. Half of those are operating on the Deadwood asset, which represents less than 4% of our acreage. We believe the Permian results will purely be a function of how much money we want to spend and how we pace ourselves.</p>
          <p>Outside the Mariner/Deadwood position, almost all of our acreage is held by production, so we can develop at whatever pace is appropriate. We have conservatively identified over 5,000 locations and are poised to double our activity level over the next several years. With over 3 million gross acres spanning every <mark type="inaudible" /> it's easy to see why we're excited about our Permian position.</p>
          <p>All in, we're currently forecasting a moderate single digit growth for the Permian from fourth quarter 2010 to the 2011 average, but again, that will be a function of how we decide to change the pace as we integrate the BP assets. I should note that during the first half of February we have experienced significant freeze-offs in the area due to the unusual winter conditions, and it's going to have a significant impact on first quarter production, somewhere in the range of 4,000 barrels per day for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally in Canada, during 2011, we're going to take advantage of our broad opportunity set, and we will run two to three rigs each in our oil, EUR, and liquid-rich West 5 and Kaybob areas, and in exploration. In addition, we will have two-plus rigs running in the Horn River and Noel areas, for a total of 10 rigs running during the drilling months. We expect Canada <mark type="inaudible" /> 2011 to grow in the strong single digit range from fourth quarter 2010 levels.</p>
          <p>Our Noel tight gas project in the Montney area ramped up to 100 million a day by the end of the fourth quarter. 14 wells were drilled in 2010, with continued development of locations in the Cadomin and Doig formations. This activity will continue in 2011 with 11 more wells. The team's ability to optimize costs by moving to multilateral and pad development will make Noel a profitable project even at current gas prices. We have 75 additional locations identified in the Cadomin and Doig. The Horn River development will continue as wells drilled in prior years are completed. In addition, our partner in Canada will drill one-half of a pad this next year, or in 2011.</p>
          <p>Kitimat LNG continues to move forward. Front-end engineering and design is under way. Last week we and our partner EOG announced <mark type="inaudible" /> gain full ownership and control of the 285-mile pipeline, which will link the Canadian grid to the export facility. We are currently in offtake discussions with several Asia-Pacific LNG buyers. We are targeting an investment decision by the end of the year and would expect to commence exports of 700 million feet of gas per day in late 2015, with significant expansion potential. Apache owns 51% of this project.</p>
          <p>We continue to advance other material need plays in Canada, and we will comment on them at the right time on the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>I will conclude North American highlights by noting Encana's joint venture with PetroChina this last week, which would imply a value for our Canadian portfolio of over $20 billion based on reserve ratios. Combined with the value of our Permian Basin, based on the Permian company valuations, this would imply that these two North American regions <mark type="inaudible" /> over 80% of Apache's entire current enterprise value.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Rod Eichler for International.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John.</p>
          <p>International production volumes in the fourth quarter were down 5% sequentially, driven by facility outages in Australia and the North Sea. In Australia, Van Gogh was impacted by essential maintenance activities on the FPSO turret swivels and turret mooring system. Net fourth quarter production of 6,100 barrels of oil per day was down 17,600 barrels a day from the third quarter. Production resumed on February 7th and was 21,000 net barrels of oil per day earlier this week. Production has been temporarily shut down since last night due to the proximity of Cyclone Diane. We expect production to decline naturally during 2011 as originally planned.</p>
          <p>Pyrenees project's fourth quarter production was 27,000 net barrels of oil per day, achieving project payout in December. Some of the wells at Pyrenees have also been shut down due to Cyclone Diane. The project is expected to enter its natural decline phase during 2011.</p>
          <p>With planned decline in these two projects, and modest contribution from future development projects, we expect average Australia production to decline in the low teens in 2011. However, we expect strong production growth to resume in Australia in 2012, as other development projects come onstream. To summarize their sequencing, Halyard and Reindeer are expected onstream within 2011 and achieving full contribution in 2012. Coniston and Macedon are expected onstream in 2013. Valmage in 2014, and Julimar/Wheatstone LNG in 2016. This project pipeline represents incremental volumes net to Apache of 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2012, 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2013, and 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2014. And that is before Wheatstone brings an additional 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016. All of these projects remain on track toward their first production <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Last week, our board sanctioned development of the Coniston oil field, which will be tied back to the Van Gogh FPSO and will extend the economic life of the Van Gogh production <mark type="inaudible" /> First production of Coniston is expected in 2013 at an average 7,100 barrels of oil per day net to Apache.</p>
          <p>Julimar/Wheatstone LNG project continues to advance toward final investment decision, expected in second half 2011, as Apache or its partners have entered agreements with LNG buyers representing nearly 80% of the project's production.</p>
          <p>The Carnarvon Basin offshore Western Australia is about the same size as the Gulf of Mexico, but with less than 10% of the wells in the Gulf of Mexico to date. We have achieved continued exploration discoveries in the Carnarvon for many years, which we have transformed into a pipeline of large development projects for Apache. During 2010, we expanded our exploration footprint there by 44%, via farm-ins to seven permits representing 2.7 million gross acres. Apache will operate all of these with a 30% to 75% operating interest. In 2011, we'll take the first step to unlocking the resource potential in this large portfolio through the acquisition of 1.3 million acres of 3D seismic and the drilling of seven wildcat wells.</p>
          <p>Turning to Egypt, the region achieved a new production record of 374,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day in November. We currently have 23 drilling rigs running in Egypt. And assuming normal operating conditions, we expect to maintain this level of activity to deliver moderate single digit production growth for the year, while we advance important growth projects, including the upgrading and looping of the Salam to Agadir need to be sealed and sanctioning of the Salam gas plant 5. Asset integrity testing on the existing southern pipelines and acquired BP processing facilities are under way, and upstream projects are nearing completion to deliver additional gas to the Egyptian market via this new second export route for Apache, with first gas during first quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>We plan an active exploration year in Egypt with 65 gross exploration wells, an increase of <mark type="inaudible" /> from 2010. We will also drill our first horizontal wells in the Western Desert. In addition, during first quarter we will complete processing of a new 3D over the Abu Gharadig concession acquired from BP, which had not had any new 3D in over a decade in spite of its location at the heart of one of the most prolific areas of the Western Desert.</p>
          <p>Moving to the North Sea, fourth quarter production was affected by downtime related to well workovers. While this is behind us, first quarter production has been reduced by 11,600 barrels per day outage of the Forties Bravo to Charlie pipeline. About half this daily production will be restored in March, via temporary repair, with full production restoration set for September, upon installation of a replacement pipeline. Due to this downtime, we currently expect North Sea production for 2011 to be nearly 10% below 2010 levels. Nevertheless, Forties remains one of the best investments ever made by Apache, and holds large remaining opportunities for us.</p>
          <p>During 2011, we will advance our ability to realize these opportunities through the <mark type="inaudible" /> Forties Alpha satellite platform, which will be installed in 2012 to give us additional drilling slots. We will also begin production from the Bacchus field during the fourth quarter 2011 as a tieback to the Forties Alpha platforms. We plan a 16-well Forties drilling campaign in 2011, which will benefit from the new Forties survey that has already improved our ability to identify and target pockets of unswept oil. This new 4D recently led to us redirect an Echo target and identified two Charlie drilling locations with very successful results. One of these Charlie wells has been tested at 3,300 barrels of oil per day.</p>
          <p>We expanded our footprint in the North Sea with successful bids for four exploration licenses in the highly competitive 26th licensing round, in addition to farming into the Seagull and Seagull North licenses with a 50% working interest. The Seagull licenses operated by Talisman hold an estimated 44 million barrels undeveloped discovery.</p>
          <p>Finally in Argentina, as of April we expect our gas-plus sales to increase from 10 million cubic feet of gas per day <mark type="inaudible" /> price of $4.10 per million Btu to 63 million cubic feet of gas per day, or the equivalent of nearly a third of our fourth quarter gas production in the country at a weighted average price of $4.84 per million Btu. This is an important step forward for us and supports our strategy of drilling for gas in places that are short of gas. We plan to run six drilling rigs in Argentina during 2011. Three of the four development rigs will focus on gas-plus drilling, and two rigs will drill exploration wells. We currently expect Argentina production to grow by more than 10% in 2011.</p>
          <p>During 2010, we grew via bid round licensing and farm-ins to 1.7 million gross acres of Neuqu&#xE9;n Basin shale gas fairway. This represents 944,000 net acres. A number of major international groups have recently sought to enter this play, and we were able to capitalize on our existing position in the basin and our partnership with YPF to secure an early shale acreage position, which we believe is second only to YPF's. We are currently drilling the <mark type="inaudible" /> shale well in South America in the Neuqu&#xE9;n Basin. We expect to reach target depth March but will complete the well in April due to equipment availability limitations. We will be able to sell production from this well for $5 per million Btu under one of our existing Gas Plus contracts.</p>
          <p>That concludes the international highlights, and I'll now turn it over to Roger Plank.</p>

          <p>Okay, thanks, Rod, and good afternoon, everyone. We've got a long line of speakers today, so I'm going to underscore a couple of quick points about Apache's competitive position before our new CFO, Tom Chambers, finishes up with the numbers.</p>
          <p>The first point is that we are in an ideal operating environment for Apache. Low North American gas prices and high oil prices mean that many gas-weighted competitors are struggling to make ends meet, while Apache turns in record financial results. A related point is that while we have dialed back our initial 2011 capital budget, we are doing it to ensure that we reload our firepower. Not because we are pessimistic about the outlook for prices, and specifically oil prices. Frankly, with less than one-fifth of our revenues emanating from North America natural gas, gas prices could literally fall in half, and the impact would be relatively insignificant to our portfolio.</p>
          <p>So the real issue for Apache is oil. And there we think the fundamentals are very strong. You're no doubt aware that WTI presently trades around $85 per barrel &#x2013; or about $5 higher than last year's average. You may not be aware that Brent is trading at over $100 a barrel, or $20 higher than last year's average. That is very good news for Apache, as well over half our oil production is priced off Brent.</p>
          <p>My point is that things are lining up for what could very well prove to be a banner year for Apache. With oil prices strong and double-digit production growth, we're well positioned not only to bolster our balance sheet, but also be in a position to release more capital should current conditions remain, precisely at a time when opportunities are abundant and the competition is struggling. That's an ideal environment for Apache to continue to execute our profitable growth strategy.</p>

      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Roger. Good afternoon, everyone.</p>
          <p>One more time I'd like to reiterate that we earned a record $3 billion in earnings or $8.46 a share for 2010. It's a great number, and I'd like to reiterate it. And when we adjust for the items too that impact the comparability of those results, we earned $3.2 billion, $8.94 a share, which is up nearly 70% from the prior year's $1.9 billion. Record production, combined higher oil prices, drove cash from operations up 48% over 2010 to $7.4 billion for the year, and just shy of $2 billion for the quarter.</p>
          <p>This speaks volumes for our balanced portfolio, as we've been able to benefit substantially from higher oil realizations and the fact that oil currently sells for over 20 times the price of North American gas. Oil and liquids accounted for 77% of our revenues in <mark type="inaudible" /> but represent just over half of our production. Oil alone accounted for 49% of total 2010 production.</p>
          <p>Our oil portfolio offers another unique feature when it comes to price, as Roger just mentioned. Almost 60% of our total production, which encompasses all of our international oil production, with the exception of Argentina, is sold against the Brent index. Brent is currently running at a significant premium, over $15 a barrel, to WTI, versus the traditional discount. Therefore, we are well positioned to benefit from this pricing situation. In addition to that, U.S. LLS and HLS crude grades are selling at double-digit premiums to WTI. Over 30% of our total U.S. volumes are sold against these indices, giving us an additional revenue benefit from our U.S. oil volumes.</p>
          <p>Our higher oil exposure also impacts operating cost. Cash costs, excluding taxes other than income and merger and transition costs, average $11.73 per BOE in 2010, up about $0.50 per barrel compared to 2009. Our goal was to keep 2010 cash costs flat with last year, and we ended up 4% higher, influenced by the impact of rising oil prices on cost. Recurring DD&amp;A was also up from the prior levels, as you might expect, given the significant level of acquisition in the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to reserves, we replaced current production through drilling by adding 245 million barrels of oil equivalent and proved reserves during 2010. Including acquisitions, sales, and revisions, we replaced 344% of production.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to spend a lot of time on the fourth quarter, since it was pretty noisy due to acquisition timing, change in the mix of the properties due to the acquisitions, and operational issues. And as you've no doubt noted, the financial results bear that out. From a production perspective, the fourth quarter rate of 729,000 barrels equivalent a day was our best quarter ever. Unit costs were up for the quarter because of the combination of planned production downtime, one-time transaction costs, and bringing into our portfolio higher unit cost properties from acquisitions. Now we'll get to work, and coupled with restoring production, we expect our cash costs to come back in line and dropping throughout the year, to exit the year at around the average of 2010 or around $11.75 per BOE, which excludes taxes other than income.</p>
          <p>We'd be remiss if we didn't talk about our hedging program, including hedges assumed for Mariner. For 2011, we have approximately 120,000 barrels of oil per day hedged. Most of our positions were entered using collar arrangements with floors just above $69 and ceilings of around $97. In totaled we've hedged around a third of our oil production. We've not entered into any new gas hedges over the last quarter, but approximately 25% of our North American volumes are hedged for 2011, primarily with swaps at around $6.25 per MMBtu, which should give <mark type="inaudible" /> given current gas prices.</p>
          <p>And finally, we exited 2010 with 25% debt to cap, which is only slightly higher than the 24% we had entering the year, even though we completed over $11 billion in portfolio transactions. As Steve mentioned, during 2011 we'll maintain a strong focus on building our balance sheet strength further, which is our long-term strategic firepower asset, by paying down additional debt.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn the call back over to Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom. I'd like to summarize what I think the three main messages of the call are.</p>
          <p>Number one, 2011 is going to be a good year of strong production growth for Apache. We're going to focus on consolidating our enlarged portfolio. We're going to continue to build our balance sheet strength. And we're going to continue to remain opportunistic in the strategic arena.</p>
          <p>Number two, we had a strong portfolio going into 2010, and after the project licensing and portfolio steps <mark type="inaudible" /> in 2010, we have a formidable inventory that can sustain Apache's growth for years to come.</p>
          <p>And number three, the reality is that we're only scratching the surface of the full opportunity set in Apache's enlarged portfolio. And the challenge in front of our teams now is to scope and prioritize the best rate of return opportunities, and for all of to us get after them while staying true to our principles, portfolio balance, and financial conservatism.</p>
          <p>And with that we're ready for your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Sven del Pozzo with IHS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Where did your U.S. oil reserve additions come from, the organic ones? And also the &#x2013; I saw some revisions in there for the &#x2013; positive revisions for the U.S., whether those were price- or performance-related?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, most of the oil from the revisions were priced in the U.S. And I will tell you, internationally, we get a negative because of the Egypt cost sharing. So price helps us in the U.S. and hurts us in Egypt. Certainly Permian Basin was a big chunk of that, both on the organic side and the buy side with the Permian. And the Gulf of Mexico was a big chunk of that. We also got some liquids help in the Texas Panhandle with our Granite Wash stuff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that leads to a follow-on question. It sounded like you'll be developing most intensively the properties acquired from Mariner. And since the BP properties, you had mentioned in the past that they had not had an operated well drilled on them by BP for four years. I was just kind of wondering whether &#x2013; what are the chances you're going to increase the rigs that you'll deploy on the BP's Permian properties?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well &#x2013; excuse me. I'm sorry. Almost certainly we'll be increasing the rig activity on the BP properties. I think we've indicated to you in the past, BP was running their Permian Basin from <mark type="inaudible" /> so consequently just getting the records in the hands of the guys that are operating these properties out West has been a little bit of a challenge. We're getting there. The Mariner asset we had to get on with because we had bought a lot of acreage out there in the last year with continuous drilling clauses. So it was critical that we go ahead and hold the leases, and then we'll move on to the BP properties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it's a matter of just how much capital you want to allocate to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that might change during the course of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. If there's one place you would expect to get a little extra allocation, it'd be the Permian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then moving on to Australia. I see you've been doing a lot of farm-in deals in Australia. If you could just give me a top-down description for the reason for the farm-ins and how I should look at it in terms of the geological prospectivity of the regions where you're doing the farm-ins. And what are some of the key companies that you might be partnering with, so I could monitor the results of those companies and see how it might affect Apache?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the areas that we're looking at just continue to extend or expand our existing position on the North West Shelf. It's all in the North West Shelf area along trend of our along the existing Carnarvon Basin play areas. Predominantly up to the northeast portion of the shelf, there are large blocks that became available that we pursued this year to farm in with drilling commitments, as well as seismic commitments. So we'll start a seismic survey on one of the blocks earlier &#x2013; this year, followed by drilling probably in the second quarter this year. A lot of small companies are involved as partners in the blocks. Just off the top of head, I can't recall the specifics of the many Indian companies who've been partners of some of these concessions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you guys will be reporting the successes, the discoveries, not another company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's us. We're the operator; we'll be reporting any activities that are significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then just a couple cleanup questions. I noticed a negative oil revision in Canada. What was the reason for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's primarily associated with sliding scale royalties and GCA recoveries. As the price of oil goes up, then we get less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just to address timing issues associated with your acquisitions in the fourth quarter and how that might move over into the first quarter. Can you give me any guidance for how much of the production on average during the fourth quarter was from acquired assets, and what might happen in the first quarter, just to track that movement of the acquired properties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sven, Alfonso Leon. We're going to give others a chance to get on the question queue. I'll be back in my office right after this. We can follow up on this after the meeting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Ray Deacon [Pritchard Capital].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hey. Good afternoon. I just had a question about &#x2013; that you partly answered. It sounds like the first use of incremental capital would be the Permian. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we input capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>

          </p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd like to follow up a little bit on what John Crum said. Because when we talk about increasing capital, we've gone from $400 million in 2010 to we're going to around $1 billion this year. So we're doubling the capital in the Permian, because of the acquisitions and because of the opportunity set. The other one is, and then I want to reiterate what John said, we got 10 or 11 rigs running at Deadwood, and that is to save acreage. The fortunate thing is it's a great play. So we're making great economics at it. But if you have a fixed amount of capital you want to spend in an area and you've got a commitment to make, that's where you're going to spend your money. So if things lighten up, the Permian will be the first place to get it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got it. And one more question. You probably have a better view on this than anybody, but do you still feel pretty strongly about the economics of Kitimat and being able to maintain an oil price base per Mcf number there with all the growth in the Australian volumes over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me put it this way. First of all, we can't make Kitimat work unless it's got an oil-based contract with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second thing is, is that I think what we're seeing is a tremendous amount of interest. Now, and again, and I'd preface that &#x2013; we haven't signed anything yet, but there is some real benefit for anyone that has to import LNG to import it out of the North American market, because the North American market, it has no limit. So it's not field generated. It's not an investment. So once they are into that market, they have gas in perpetuity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you mentioned about $1 billion of asset sales. Could you talk about &#x2013; are you looking to sell some assets, kind of across the portfolio, or is there really a focus in Canada? Because you mentioned specifically about high-grading Canada.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; our first look is Canada, and the reason is that if you looked at our Horn River position already, and then you look at what we picked up from BP and Noel, with the Montney and the Cadomin there, we've got a tremendous asset base there. So it's the easiest place to try to take the bottom layer of that out of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I know you just commented on Kitimat, but could you give us some color on just the marketing that you've done for the offtake of LNG, not just at Kitimat, but any intelligence you have on Wheatstone? You mentioned a tremendous amount of interest. Could you just give us some color on that? Do you think you'll have no trouble marketing Kitimat and Wheatstone? I know you said you have 80% of Wheatstone spoken for. And then, also, just talk about other issues you need to grapple with in terms of permits or anything else at Kitimat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, right now we're just now started market Kitimat. And I think all I can say right at the present time is that we see a enthusiastic market that wants to talk about it. In terms of its position with respect to Wheatstone, of course Chevron is running the Wheatstone sale. They've been very &#x2013; obviously, they've been in that market for a long time and have done a very good job. In terms of the viability of it, in terms of permits, et cetera, it's really going to boil down to market. I mean, this project will go with the market. There's no huge impediments to this project going forward, other than the market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a question again on Egypt. How much of your reserve production &#x2013; I had heard 24%. Am I wrong? And do you have an escape hatch in case something stirs up there where your facilities are in trouble that you would disperse them over other areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question is I think reserves are about 13% because of the cost sharing mechanism. And production's about 24% of that. It may be 25%. But that's round numbers.</p>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; and I assume what you're asking is, do we have a place to spend that money in other projects, or -</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the thing &#x2013; if something happens over there, can you shut down some of the facilities, move money and stuff over, or are you going to be in trouble? I'm worried always about expropriation, things like that, happening after viewing what happened with the sugar in our friends Cuba, and in Venezuela with Chevron. I mean, some of these governments can be very unstable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; first of all, we've been in Egypt for 15 years, and we have a gentleman on the board that was there, Chuck Pitman is our board member that used to be with Amoco, and was in Egypt twice. And as he likes to say, they first discovered oil in Egypt in 1957, and they've never shut production in based on the political situation there. Given what is going on right now, I tend to think that <mark type="inaudible" /> better in terms of investment in Egypt. Certainly the mood is one of &#x2013; much more market-driven, and increasing the standard of living for the people. And I will tell you, we're guests there, so they're the host, whoever the host would be.</p>
          <p>In terms of being able to take that cash somewhere else, we certainly can. I mean, I can't emphasize enough, and I'd welcome all of you to come to the May 17th conference, is going to show you the opportunity set that we've uncovered so far. And that was not a puffing our wares when we say we've got a current inventory to grow through 2015 6% to 12%. And that's not necessarily, again, what we're going to do, but that's the opportunity set that we see at the present time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might comment on your point about nationalization or confiscation. We do carry an insurance policy that gives us about $1 billion of coverage in the event that things were to get that extreme. But if you think about it, you mentioned a couple of countries like Venezuela. It's a little different in a country like Egypt where they really utilize &#x2013; their demand meets their supply. So they aren't a big exporter. Venezuela is a big exporter, so it has a very big cash flow stream. And if you nationalize it, you could argue that at least for the short term, that's in their national interest.</p>
          <p>In a place like Egypt, if you nationalize the production, what are you going to do, just hand it out to the population? You don't get a cash flow stream that gives you the same economic inducement to take such drastic action. I think having operated there for 15 years, people recognize that production wouldn't be anywhere near where it is if not for Apache's investment over that period of time. So we think that helps us in the period ahead.</p>

We certainly &#x2013; going concern means you got to have a lot of &#x2013; in our opinion, you have to have a lot of different ways to win. And we've seen that in every history of every play that's come down the pike, whether it was Russia or the Austin chalk in western Louisiana or East Texas.</p>
          <p>One play does not make a going concern. And I think the important thing that you look at, the way we look at the deepwater, it is an exploration, big reserve play in North America, that we don't have anywhere else. And if it is successful on a risked basis, you get a lot of production and a lot of rate of return out of those projects. So we're going to try to balance that.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think I'd add it really is the last place to find big oil. On the permitting side, I think we're starting to see a little bit of movement, but there's no question it's going to be slow and gradual as we get our regulator completely comfortable with activity out there. You are starting to see some movement; getting the access to the Helix and NWCC containment vessels has been real important. And that's really what's held up the last few months.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then separately, you mentioned in your comments that you didn't expect 2011 to be as acquisitive a year as 2010, but that you did see some attractive opportunities. Can you add some more color as to whether those attractive opportunities are more offshore versus North American onshore versus international, and whether you're seeing better opportunities among corporate acquisitions versus asset acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we generally see better acquisitions in the asset side, because number one, you only have to buy the assets that you're going after. The unique thing about Mariner was &#x2013; and if you look at where we're active right now, we're active in every place that they were. So it was very easy, it was almost an asset acquisition in the guise of a merger. Because we really fit in each one of those asset areas.</p>
          <p>In terms of going forward, each one of the regions we're in, we'd like to get bigger. <mark type="inaudible" /> I'm optimistic about Argentina, I just think given the circumstances of the world today we might not spend the kind of money there that we've spent in other parts of the world. But we're an opportunistic company. Sometimes you buy better things better than you drill them. And vice versa.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Steve, you mentioned the capital budget, $7.5 billion in it. No matter how you slice it, it looks like cash flow's going to be above that, and then you'll have another $1 billion probably come in from asset sales. I know you said you wanted to leave room for debt reduction, but do you have a goal in mind for the debt reduction, so that once you hit that, we can look at any excess then going back into drilling?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>There's been &#x2013; to our knowledge there are no horizontal wells that have been drilled in shales in Argentina. We're drilling the first one. That well's under way. And I really cannot release any information regarding the well at this time as we're not completely to our total depth. Of course, YPS is a very active player and our partner in many of these blocks. They have drilled some vertical wells, as have we, to test the concept of shale richness. It's really a test, proof of concept stage. All the ingredients are there geologically for a robust unconventional resource, and &#x2013; at least the Vaca Muerta shale and the Los Molles shale in the central Neuqu&#xE9;n Basin area.

          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. I'll try and bang out a couple of quick ones if I may. Can you tell us, please, what was the exit rate on production for 2010? And if you could maybe quantify the outages, because obviously there was a fair amount of downtime I guess UK and Australia. That one was my first one. I've a couple of quick follow-ups, if I may.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the biggest &#x2013; I don't remember the December number, and Alfonso can get with it offline. I think the biggest difference between that and what we posted on that <mark type="inaudible" /> is we had Van Gogh off, which is about 22,000 barrels a day, and we also had about 9,000 barrels off in the North Sea. I mean, it was &#x2013; the North Sea stuff probably won't come back until September, Van Gogh's starting to come back up, but it's &#x2013; it was off all of January, and it will be off a portion of February. And then we've had three cyclones in the gulf &#x2013; I mean in the Carnarvon Basin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks, Steve. This one I know is going to be difficult to answer, but I'm going to try anyway. So you're already at just over $8 billion, as Bob pointed out. It sounds as though you're very quickly going to get to your debt target. So how should we think about the sensitivity of your growth numbers to capital expenditure? Like I say, I know it's a pretty tough one to answer. But if you could at least try and frame it, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frankly, and I am going to <mark type="inaudible" /> and I'm going to say that I don't have any numbers to go by; it's just an obvious answer. And that is, we got all the base cost in the base budget. So you've got all your seismic costs, all those kind of costs are in the base budget. So most of the things that you'll be seeing other than some exploration stuff if we add a little program in Australia, or if somewhere else, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, God forbid, if we actually got a permit to drill there, you're going to see performing capital. So you should see a disproportionate benefit out of the incremental capital that we spend based on the overall capital budget that we rolled out there right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's absolutely right. And then kind of mitigating that is the earlier we let that capital go, the more you'll see it in the annual average. So part of the juggling is we want to have some confidence that these prices are going to stay at these levels before we release too much capital. So there's a balancing act, is what I'm trying to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the sooner we can get a package out on the Street and sold, we'll be &#x2013; there's a lot of moving parts going into this year. And the biggest thing I would say is &#x2013; and I hope everybody would recognize what I'm saying. In the last two years, we spent $8 billion drilling wells and that kind of stuff. We spent $12 billion in acquisitions. So our growth for 2011, obviously, is purely capital allocation, is going to come from the acquisitions. But the biggest thing it brought us is, is that if we don't buy another thing for the next five years, we can grow this thing at high single digit numbers, anyway. So we've set ourselves up to some growth going forward that is significant.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's no question there's a lot of running room, Steve. I guess two very quick follow-ups, and I'll leave it to somebody else. Could you give us an idea &#x2013; or contract updates, rather &#x2013; on Australia gas? And the final one is could you &#x2013; I just wanted to be clear, on the 5,000 locations I think John mentioned in the Permian, is that an apples-to-apples comparison with what you gave us at the time of the deal? Or if you could maybe just elaborate on what's happened to the visibility that you gave us with the Yeso and the Sprayberry at the time in terms of drilling activity. I mean, in other words, how much have you been able to evaluate and add to your drilling locations in the BP assets? And I'll leave it there. Thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the gas contracts in Australia, I think we are pursuing contracts that are significantly higher. I think we probably will announce some, but before we do that, I better not comment on that. But that is going to happen. You understand what I'm saying. In terms of locations, John, do you &#x2013; ?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess, Doug, what I'd say is obviously we continue to work the <mark type="inaudible" /> as we go along and one of our key work processes is really developing resource potential across all of our acreage. So we're just getting through all of these, but we're gradually cataloguing what we know are going to be developable assets out there. So that's kind of the number we're at right now. And I think we could get higher than that pretty easily.</p>

We didn't want to risk a potential well-control problem and not have any way of correcting that. That well has since been restored to drilling operations.</p>
          <p>Then we had one or two days where diesel fuel was a little bit short. But that was corrected immediately by the government.

          <p>I don't think we have anything new. That continues to be just a great play for us. We continue to push obviously looking for the ones that have the highest liquid contents. We told you in the past about the Hogshooter/ 10 of those 40 wells we've drilled this year will be Hogshooter. Our Marmiton horizontals appear to be working pretty well. And then we're working the Cleveland, actually, as well, in horizontal sections up north of there.</p>
