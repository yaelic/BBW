        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Here with me are Eduardo Solorzano, our President and CEO of Wal-Mart de Mexico, and Mariana Rodriguez.</p>
          <p>I am glad to report a quarter of excellent results. We delivered strong results in a very difficult environment. Expectation for economic growth continues throughout and the second quarter might prove to be the most complicated one.</p>
          <p>In addition to difficulties with economy, the country experienced a health emergency due to the influenza outbreak, which caused businesses to close their units for several days with the tourists and restaurant sectors suffering the hardest hit.</p>
          <p>In our case, we challenged ourselves to continue winning on our strengths and serve better our customers while becoming an even more efficient operator. Everyday low cost to provide everyday low prices. That is our everyday commitment.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight the following. Total sales for the second quarter increased 11.3% while same-store sales grew 4%. General expenses grew only 7.4% and 6.5% excluding the Bank expense. This year very positively compares to the 11.3% increase in both total sales and average installed capacity. Operating income increased 17.8%. Earnings per share increased 17%.</p>
          <p>Also, I would like to highlight our cash position. As of the end of the second quarter, this is 11 billion pesos. This figure is 31% higher than last year. As you know, our financial strength and cash generation allows us to continue investing in prices, growing, remodel stores, paying dividends, and buying back our own shares. Return on equity for the last 12 months to June was 24.1%, while return on capital employed was 27.3%.</p>
          <p>Now, I leave you with Eduardo to comment on our strategies.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today. I cannot agree more with you Rafael, this was certainly a challenging quarter, and I feel very proud of what we have achieved. We always have said that our people made the difference and this was clear this quarter. We have delivered very good results in a very tough economic environment.</p>
          <p>What encouraged me most is how we are serving our customers. We are becoming more and more relevant for them, delivering what they need at excellent prices. And the number of customers we serve continues to increase each and every quarter. This is what we are here for and what is making us a stronger and what is &#x2013; will allow us to continue growing and improving this company in the future.</p>
          <p>We delivered a strong topline growth, which together with our discipline of constantly searching for efficiencies allow us for operating income, EBITDA, and net income to grow more than sales. In last April as you may remember and as Rafael mentioned, we have flu emergency faced by the country. It was a challenge with no presence in our history of our company or our country.</p>
          <p>However, through the committed work of our associates and in keeping with our sanitary instructions set down by the government, we showed our customer what we are capable of. Our execution capacity allow us to continue operating to guarantee supply and service to our customer.</p>
          <p>Now, before I talk to you about the strategies that our different formats have implemented to better serve our customer, let me give you some perspective on how our growth compares to the rest of the market. As probably you will know or may remember if you were with us in our last Analyst Meeting, we set ourself the target to grow 15% more than the market. And I am glad to tell you that we have exceed that target.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the January-May period as May is the most recent sales figures reported by the industry as measured by ANTAD, the National Retail Association. Same-stores sales for Walmex grew 3% and if we consider only our self-service format, we grew 4.1%, which compares very favorably to the 1.2% growth of the industry excluding Walmex. And in term of total sales of January-May period, our self-service formats grew 11.7%, compared with 7.3% growth of ANTAD excluding again, Walmex.</p>
          <p>Now, our different formats have had different strategies to increase sales, all of them based on better serving our customers and offering great value propositions. Bodega Aurrera for example and Wal-Mart have been the format with the greatest increases in customer count, while Sam's Club and Superama have had some nice ticket growth.</p>
          <p>Let's talk about the specific strategies for each of the businesses. In the case of Bodega Aurrera, in June, we launched a large anniversary sales in Bodega Aurrera offering the best prices for basic products. In addition to having high value items at very good prices, also we try to improve our communications, and you know being very clear about the value proposition that we have for our customer.</p>
          <p>To help communicate this excellent value, we had <mark type="inaudible" /> Mama-Lucha, the big <mark type="inaudible" />, which is a big party as soon an event full of joys and dinners in our stores. We invited our customer to join the dancing &#x2013; to join and &#x2013; to join dancing and singing with Mama-Lucha and we organized some very nice competition among others things.</p>
          <p>For those of you that have not hear the song, you can ask Mariana to e-mail it to you. The song was written by one of our associates and beside it's great written, it reinforce our price strategy of Bodega's and the commitment we have with our customers.</p>
          <p>Also during Easter week, we're launching our retail program with a special product for those customers who will be going on vacation, as well as those who will be staying at home. Our <mark type="inaudible" /> Bodega Aurrera program <mark type="inaudible" /> our female customer by offering a large variety of household items at the very best prices.</p>
          <p>Bodega has also done some changes to improve its brand identity. We changed the logo and we have a new prototype that I will describe as more comfortable, more feminine, it includes more perishables and purchasing rewards, better adjacencies, more commercial, more modern, more sustainable, cheaper and more productive. Certainly, Mariana can share some photos with you, if you would like to see everything about this new four month of Bodega Aurrera.</p>
          <p>In the case of Wal-Mart in June, we launched our <mark type="inaudible" /> Wal-Mart to celebrate customer who have saved money with us everyday. We have more items at lower price points and we volunteered better price system <mark type="inaudible" />. We celebrated Children's Day offering wider assortment of named brand toys at prices of 100, 200 and 300 pesos each, very easy to communicate.</p>
          <p>We launched Have Fun at Home with great savings for our customers in movies, television, series, musicals, video games, and electronics in general. We celebrated Mother's Day by selling over a million roses and more than one million pieces of apparel at 100 pesos each.</p>
          <p>We continue with our successful Fresh Tuesdays and Wednesdays program that we call <mark type="inaudible" /> where our customer find excellent prices in fruit and vegetables, dairy, meat, fish among other things.</p>
          <p>In Sam's Club in May, for the first time we incorporated general merchandise on <mark type="inaudible" />. With the purchase of 10 identical clothes from any category, our customer were able to take an extra one home for free.</p>
          <p>For Mother's Day, we held two events with merchandise sold from three to 18 months interest free and in June we had celebrate that with merchandise sold with 18 months interest free or at 15% rebate. And in term of innovation on improving assortments Sam's opened the first eight Apple stores inside the store. It is the first club worldwide to incorporate a dedicated space in the club for Apple products.</p>
          <p>Superama, we have developed a dynamic merchandising for the weekends. Displaying at the entrance of the store the merchandise that our customer buy more during weekends such as wines, refreshments, sushi, and cold meat trays.</p>
          <p>We also developed at a special weekend publication offering <mark type="inaudible" /> solution for customer who have to host a party, want to enjoy some sporting event or simply do not want to return our publication during the week are focusing on everything necessary for stock it a <mark type="inaudible" /> prices.</p>
          <p>We continue in Superama enlarging our table wines assortment that include 100 pesos &#x2013; 100 product at 60 pesos or less and to <mark type="inaudible" /> we published our gourmet catalogue offering new clause of difference in Aurrera important wine can groups and our wide assortment of wines and liquor for countries around the world.</p>
          <p>Suburbia <mark type="inaudible" /> strategy is to drive sales, for the first time we launched the program called <mark type="inaudible" />, the VAT, value added taxes and we held our special sale for ladies blouses and slacks at the low price of 188 pesos each.</p>
          <p>Vips with the purpose of reinforcing consumption after the influence in our units, we launched a different program such as it's Delicious, is Affordable, the Vips Classics and we re-launched Kids Eat Free in company of <mark type="inaudible" />. In addition, discounts were offered to Sam's Club members and to Wal-Mart Sam's staff <mark type="inaudible" /> and Visa card holders.</p>
          <p>In Banco Wal-Mart we would kick it off our newest strategy for Banco Wal-Mart based on increasing footprint and increasing efficiencies and productivity. We concentrated our retail efforts in the metropolitan area and the city of Toluca.</p>
          <p>We will open between 100 and 150 branches this year. This will be a smaller branches, they will have an average of 16 square meters to 40 square meter for the &#x2013; compared with the 40 square meter of existing ones. We will install also this year between 100 and 150 ATMs and we will establish <mark type="inaudible" /> deposits at our cashiers by the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>An important news that I have to share with you and that has to do with the creation of synergies within the Wal-Mart World is that Mexico was chosen to establish and operate a Global Merchandise Center for emerging consumers. This center will be responsible for product development on stores to satisfying the needs of emerging consumers in all contexts where Wal-Mart operate. We estimate that there are around two billion emerging consumers in these countries.</p>
          <p>For us, this new center represents both a great responsibility and a distinction for the talent we have in Mexico. We have named Simona Visztova, our Senior Vice President for the Global Merchandise Centers that we call GMC for emerging consumers reporting directly to me.</p>
          <p>And finally, on the social responsibility field, <mark type="inaudible" /> community sharing experiences on best practices with all companies and institutions such as <mark type="inaudible" /> to name a few. Wal-Mart de Mexico has provided, say community more than seven million pesos since 2005 in addition to 200,000 pesos that were donated by the <mark type="inaudible" /> to build and equip three sustainable greenhouses.</p>
          <p>In 56 Wal-Mart stores through Mexico we launched <mark type="inaudible" /> in My Wal-Mart and <mark type="inaudible" /> in My Wal-Mart. First to have the right development for small and medium enterprises in Mexico and promoting more than 200 <mark type="inaudible" /> from 52 enterprises offering them also the opportunity to access a strategic market outside the place of origin.</p>
          <p>The Wal-Mart de Mexico Foundation has <mark type="inaudible" /> more than 139 million pesos till today supporting <mark type="inaudible" /> to improve nutrition and developing food communities through the country. More than 17,000 associates, volunteers have devoted their time and talent to the community they serve in 960 different volunteer activities.</p>
          <p>Now, Mariana will give you more details about the numbers. Mariana?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Eduardo. Starting with sales, total growth for the second quarter was 11.3% while same-store sales grew 4%. In the case of self-service formats, total sales growth was 13% while same-store stores grew 5.1%. Though also service formats had strong same-store sales, the best performing was Bodega. The weakest performance were from Vips and Suburbia.</p>
          <p>For the first six months of the year, total sales grew 9.6% and same-store sales grew 2.5%. For the self-service formats, total sales grew 11.1%, while same-store sales grew 3.5%. Sales continue to be driven by customers though with some increase in ticket as well. Customers for the second quarter at comparable stores grew 3.3% and average ticket 0.6%. In the case of self-service formats, customers grew a strong 5.2% and average ticket remained the same as last year.</p>
          <p>As Eduardo mentioned, the formats that had the strongest growth in customers were Wal-Mart and Bodega, while Superama and Sam's had the strongest growth in ticket. We continue seeing discretionary spending and food continues to be our strongest category and a traffic driver to our stores.</p>
          <p>On the other side, customers continue to pull back their spending in non-food areas such as clothing and general merchandise. Gross margin for the quarter was seven basis points lower than in last year's second quarter. Self-service formats did have improvement in gross margin.</p>
          <p>Rafael has already talked about the great work that we did in general expense. They were 50 basis points lower than during the second quarter of last year and 60 basis points lower if we exclude the Bank.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at some balance sheet item. As of the end of the second quarter 2009, our cash position amounted to 11 billion pesos, 2.6 billion pesos more than last year. During the first half of the year, the company invested 3.3 billion pesos in fixed assets. We purchased 24.9 million shares for an amount of 903 million pesos and paid a dividend of five billion pesos. Inventories increased 10.4% versus last year's second quarter, as we opened 186 units during the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll leave you back with Rafael Matute.</p>
