        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call.  With me today are George Paz, our CEO and Ed Stiften, our CFO.</p>
          <p>Before we begin I need to read the following.  Statements or comments made on this call may be forward-looking statements and may include, but are not necessarily limited to financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions.  These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties.  The company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors which are discussed in detail in our SEC filing.</p>
          <p>In addition, the reconciliation of EBITDA to net income and the net cash provided by operating activities can be found on our earnings release, which is posted on our website.</p>
          <p>At this point I'll turn the call over to Ed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David.  Today I'm pleased to discuss Express Scripts fourth quarter performance.  We reported record adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, representing a 33% increase over the $0.51 on an adjusted basis for the fourth quarter of last year.  For 2007 we reported a 42% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.35.  We initially guided that earnings would grow 20 to 24% in 2007, yet our actual earnings per share growth of 42% reflects a very successful year delivering value to our clients and strong results for our shareholders.  For the year we generated record cash flow of $827.3 million compared to $658.6 million last year.</p>
          <p>In 2007 Express Scripts repurchased 23.1 million shares of its common stock for just over $1.1 billion and since 2004, the company has repurchased 74.2 million shares for $2.6 billion.  Based on our stock prices at February 19th, these repurchases since 2004 have resulted in an annualized return of approximately 50%.  As a result of our focus on efficient capital deployment and working capital management combined with strong earnings growth, resulted in return on invested capital, excluding non-recurring items of 23.7% this year, compared to 17.3% last year.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we completed the review of the infusion business and determined that this unit did not fit strategically in our product portfolio.  We are in the process of selling this business and accordingly we have classified infusions' results in discontinued operations for all current and prior periods.  The sale of the infusion business will eliminate a distraction and will allow us to better focus our attention on delivering specialty services to our clients and their patients.</p>
          <p>Strong fourth quarter operating results were driven by the execution of our business model, which resulted in record generic utilization and lower drug purchasing costs.  During the quarter we completed the integration of the specialty operating and administrative functions into the PBM.  The combination of our PBM and specialty platforms continues to drive strong adjusted operating income in the PBM segment, which reached 286.4 million, a 29% increase over last year.  Adjusted EBITDA per adjusted claim was $2.49, a 21% increase over last year.  With respect to 2008 guidance we believe that our 2008 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations will now be in the range of $2.92 to $3.00  Approximately two-thirds of this improvement comes from operating factors such as lower drug purchasing costs, greater generic utilization and some important successful business renewals.  The other one-third comes from interest rates being lower than we had budgeted and had included in our previous guidance.</p>
          <p>Our guidance with respect to generics assumes a limited supply of generic Protonix, so does not include upside yet for any opportunity that might exist there.</p>
          <p>With respect to infusion, until we sell infusion the income or loss from operating the business, which will be recorded in discontinued operations, is expected to not be material, and by that we would mean that if the business hypothetically were sold at the end of the first quarter, the operating income or loss would be less than $0.005 per share.  EPS for the first quarter is expected to be slightly below the fourth quarter level.  Volume we're still expecting to be in the range of 2 to 3% over 2007.  A little later you will hear George talk about some exciting developments there that possibly could push us toward the higher end of that range, but at this point we're holding to that volume increase of 2 to 3% over 2007 actuals.</p>
          <p>EBITDA per adjusted script for the year, we had previously told you would be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60.  You can move that range up a nickel, so from $2.55 to $2.65.  Cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of 875 million to 975 million and we anticipate using the majority of our free cash flow for share repurchases.</p>
          <p>At this point I'd like to turn the call over to George Paz.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Ed and good morning everyone.  As we began 2007 we were facing investor concerns over the Wal-Mart generics &#x2013; Wal-Mart $4 generic program, the uncertainty around AWP and the CVS-Caremark transaction.  During 2007, we consistently expressed our bullish outlook for the PBM space and we maintain that optimism as we enter 2008.  Our model of alignment allows us to outperform in a very competitive marketplace.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we continued to focus on driving down our clients' prescriptions drug costs, while never compromising health outcomes.  We accomplished this by continuing to drive generics as we reached an industry leading generic fill rate of 63.7% in the fourth quarter, up 4 percentage points from last year.  In addition, we continued to drive mail and specialty penetration in our book of business.  These actions resulted in lower costs for our patients and clients, and better value for our stockholders.  While it's great to look back and celebrate our success, we are far more interested in continuing to build a platform for solid growth in the future.  Our differentiated offering and high level of customer service translated into strong client retention and a successful selling season for new business in 2008.</p>
          <p>Our offer is differentiated due to our continuous focus on driving down drug trend without compromising health outcomes.  We do this by focusing on each and every patient.  Our programs are designed in a manner that resonates with the patient.  Through this engagement we can unlock greater value for the client, the patient, and therefore our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Our success in Medicare is not an accident.  We set out on a deliberate course with a disciplined approach to the market that provides a focus on helping our clients achieve their objectives without competing against them.  This value proposition in the Medicare space is being very well received and will continue to fuel our growth.  Clients acknowledge the uniqueness of our best-in-class offering that is aligned with them.</p>
          <p>You may recall that during 2007 we had a larger than normal portion of our business up for renewal for 1/1/08.  During '08, the number of clients up for renewal are only about half of last year's level.  We have every reason to believe that our strong performance around renewals will continue and the second half of 2008 could even exceed our expectations.  With a very robust sales pipeline we are well positioned to focus on new sales opportunities in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Although our SAAS segment has underperformed our expectations, our specialty pharmacy business continues to perform very well.  We are well-positioned in the specialty market to help our clients manage both the cost and quality of care surrounding specialty therapies.  We also continue to take the lead in helping Congress to create a biogenerics pathway.  We are pleased by the renewed interest within the beltway for passing legislation.  For example, President Bush recently called for legislation enabling the FDA to approve generic versions of biotech medicines, which will unlock significant value for our clients.</p>
          <p>Our increased earnings guidance is attributed to our positioning in the marketplace and our ability to continue driving our clients' and patients' costs down, while continuing to create superior value for our stockholders.  This concludes our prepared remarks and I'll be happy to answer questions.  Operator?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Our first question is from the line of Tom Gallucci with Merrill Lynch.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Thank you very much.  Just two quick ones if I could.  I guess first, there has been, you mentioned some highlights about the selling season, I guess what you've got up for renewal, and there has been a lot of talk about the GHI contract in particular, so just curious if you could lend your perspective on that particular client.   And then second question would be on the generics that you mentioned,.  Can you go into a little bit more detail about exactly what's better there, relative penetration and purchasing, and sort of maybe the rate that you are seeing in terms of generic deflation if you will, if you're getting much better purchasing terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Let's start with the GHI situation.  And I do this with out a lot of feeling good about this because I really don't think it's appropriate to talk about client-by-client situations.  Unfortunately there has been an awful lot of noise around this situation.  I know if I was the client of a particular vendor, which I am in many cases, I sure would hate to hear them on their earnings call talking about my business and the impacts it may have.  So, this is not a very positive situation.  We've been very disciplined about not talking about specific clients.  We have a contract with GHI.  They have the right to move business, but we also have very good relationships with the underlying business in that contract.</p>
          <p>As we do our guidance, we take into consideration the business opportunities and risks associated with that client.  If in fact we were able to &#x2013; if GHI withdrew all of their business from us it would not have a material impact on the numbers that we are providing for you in our guidance.  I would really like to leave it at that.  And let GHI manage their business and allow my account management team and sales people to manage that relationship.  With respect to the generic situation, I think I'll take part and I'll let Ed answer a piece of this.  I think as we've said many times in the past it's not just about converting a drug to a generic.  Everybody does that.  As you probably have seen recently, drugs that are about to go generic, the brand manufacturers often put significant price inflation in front of those generic launches.</p>
          <p>There's two reasons to do that as you would probably suspect, one is to make sure you've maximized your profits before the generic launch and secondly, its also to try to move share, especially if you have a meet-to drug in the pipeline or coming, that's already in the marketplace, to move people into the other drug, if you can get the price a little more reasonable.  So, our job is not just to allow those events to occur.  Our job is to work with the manufacturers, try to drive higher rebates in an inflationary period to make sure the members stay on the product before it goes generic, and then more importantly once the product goes generic, its not only to get the full conversion, which everybody does rather quickly, but to do the therapeutic interchanges.</p>
          <p>Our programs, our approach on the web, our approach with our call center associates is not just to convert the drugs as they go generic.  But to look at the other opportunities and where medically appropriate with the doctor's involvement is to switch as many members to the lower cost therapies again, without ever compromising health outcomes.  I believe that's the testament &#x2013; the tribute to our generic fill rate.  I think when you start looking at 50 million &#x2013; 60 million types of books of business, there is no difference overall with the relative makeup of that population.  I think the difference in generic fill rate is not because of some client or some situation, it's the approach to the marketplace and our focus on driving low cost therapies for our membership and that pays dividends to our clients, patients and shareholder value for you.  So, Ed do you want to talk a little bit about the purchasing cost side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Tom I'll just give you a little bit color on it.  I mentioned about two-thirds of the guidance improvement is due to operating factors, purchasing costs and generics.  The generics, there is a little bit of expectation on the inside that we're moving more effectively than we thought, but most of the generic impact, which is roughly half of this two-thirds, is external factors, either an authorized generic becoming available, or a launch moving up earlier than we had thought, so, or earlier than we had in the original guidance.  So, that's roughly half of the two-thirds.  The other thirds will be productivity improvements, purchasing costs with different suppliers, obviously we wouldn't go into who those would be, but, does that help?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, specifically also with respect to upsize, we still do not have any upside for Protonix or Paxor. So, those would not yet be included in our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  We'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.  Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning.  I was wondering first if you could just comment on the guidance around cash flow with bringing up guidance, I am just curious as to why you didn't bring up cash flow guidance as well.  And then secondly, George you alluded to something around Medicare and some opportunities around Medicare, can you just elaborate on currently what's in your expectations and what you're currently seeing in the marketplace, and then just one last thing if I can throw it in there, is just expectations originally around infusion, and do you have a buyer for the infusion business at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed, why don't you go first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry, I didn't <mark type="inaudible" />...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Cash-flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cash flow? Thank you.  Yeah, Lisa we probably could have, because the net income impact probably could have suggested that we could move that range up another 25 million, we're just &#x2013; cash flow is pretty hard to predict and we are just being a little conservative with that.  I thing it's possible we could move that up later in the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we, when we come on to our first quarter earnings release we will revisit the cash flow situation and give you our best thoughts around that at that time.  Medicare is an interesting situation.  My two biggest competitors went into the business to try to sell to the direct marketplace.  We made the decision not to do that.  We thought it was in our best interest to help our clients continue to grow their books of business.  As you know we have some rather large managed care clients, who looked at that as a tremendous opportunity for them.  We did not want to be at odds with our clients.</p>
          <p>We just didn't think that was a right way to approach the marketplace.  So, instead of investing in marketing literature and individual programs we took our resources and our people and devoted them on building best-in-class services to support our clients, and I think we have that best-in-class service.  We've had significant wins in this space, both with Medicare-only plans that have popped up as well as our plans that have gone deep into this space and this is a very important, very significant growing component of our book of business.  So, we're very pleased with our Medicare.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you quantify that in anyway, towards I mean from a script perspective or drugs bend, I mean just to give us an idea of how big it is for you today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have that information readily available.  I'll do that for you on our next call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then on infusion side, if Ed if you can just give us some thoughts around what was originally in the guidance and if you have &#x2013; if you do have a buyer on that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer the first half of that, the what's in the guidance &#x2013; in the original guidance for infusion in terms of operations, we had zero in there for '08.  We still have zero in there for '08.  So, and we expect it to be immaterial.  In terms of the impairment that we took in the fourth quarterly, so since we listed it for sale, we tried to mark it down, basically approximately to market value.  Those things could get tweaked a little bit up or down when we sell it, but if there's a difference either up or down that would be in discontinued operations.  And in terms of buyers we won't speculate on that.  We won't talk about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  Thanks for the comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Charles Boorady with Citigroup.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning.  My question just on the outlook for 2008 of your expected growth in operating earnings, can you tell us what is from same client growth versus growth from new client relationships?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess in general I would say we expect utilization growth still at this time to be about 4% per member.  And so, in terms of same-client growth that's a pretty good factor to utilize and the rest would be net wins and losses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if we take that down to the operating earnings line in light of the high renewals for 2008.  Would that look about the same, or did you follow a similar pattern as in the past where year one was sometimes a reduction in the margins that you then more than make up for over the life of a contract?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, its generally true that year one is lower in terms of the three year contract but all that's been reflected in our guidance.  So, as you can tell we renewed an awful lot of our book of business and still achieved the kind of earnings growth we like to target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so when we look at the bottom line with the same-client growth, can you bifurcate for us sort of same-client versus new relationship contribution to earnings in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we want to get to that level of detail, that's earnings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Based on the high rate of renewals, can we make inferences or can you give us any rough guidance for what to think about longer term, like the next two to three years, given what you've locked in for '08?  You already took the step down, which is reflected in your guidance.  Do you have the same kind of tailwind in '09 and '10 from those relationships or is there something about those contracts that will give you less benefit from the kind of trends that in the past have improved the profitability over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try this.  We've given '08 guidance.  We're not in a position to give '09 or '10 guidance at this time.  We have a gentleman, Ed Ignaczak, who runs sales and account management for us and his compensation is directly tied to his ability to up-sell step-therapy programs, prior authorization programs, mail penetration, specialty penetration and all those programs that drive value for our shareholders.  I think if he was here with us right now he would not want us to go out and tell you what he is going to pre-sell.  I mean obviously he has got a work plan and the goals.  But we will refine that through the course of the year.</p>
          <p>Our job is to make sure service levels are at the maximum levels and that the clients are satisfied. If you don't have satisfied clients it's very difficult to up-sell programs.  So Pat McNamee, who runs our operations and technology, his job is to make sure that we deliver well to the clients, so that Ed Ignaczak can come back and then introduce cost savings ideas.  When that machine is working you can go out with 24% type earnings growth.  It's a very good machine that works very well and the team works together very well.  So, we will continue to focus on that and we'll give you guidance in 2009 late in the year.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, George is there any change in the profile, the kind of accounts you've won for '08, is it more corporate or more TPAs or any comment on that whatsoever?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know our big win, Robert, which we disclosed was the Ohio program called ROC [Rx Ohio Collaborative] and obviously that's a public sector account that was a takeaway from both Caremark and Medco.  The business was bifurcated between the two of them and that was our, the biggest sale we had, but in addition to that we sold many Fortune 500 companies. We had &#x2013; we continue to have a very strong focus in the middle market accounts, the TPA marketplace and in the labor unions, and all those are hitting on all cylinders.  So, I think it's a &#x2013; we will continue to see tremendous opportunities to go to those clients as we up-sell, as I just said and provide additional services and opportunities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we disclose the all-in rate.  But I think you can see from our credit agreements the structure of, the interest rate structure and go from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and just lastly was there any major working...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer it this way Bob.  When we put our budget together, the forward LIBOR curves predicted a very significant drop in interest rates.  And we didn't quite bake all of that into our guidance, because we would never want to come to you all and misguidance and explain it because we took too optimistic of an assumption on earnings rates &#x2013; interest rates, and so the interest rates have in fact moved down even beyond what the LIBOR curve had predicted.  So, that's why we took the guidance up, and if your question is, have we taken the interest rates down as far as the today's LIBOR curves would suggest, again we've hedged just a little bit, penny or two, but no more than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that was the question.  And just lastly was there any major working capital impact from backing out the infusion therapy business, was there a big receivable associated with that or was it all negligible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A fair amount of receivables, but that are typical for infusion businesses, but which obviously carry a more days AR than we see in the PBM, but kind of proportionate to what you'd see in a infusion business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Knowing no infusion businesses directly, is that a 30 million number or a 100 million number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Closer to the former.  Closer to your first answer than your second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That's great.  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  George, you guys have done a lot of good work fixing the specialty business.  Do you feel like the bulk of what you've been trying to do to reposition that business is done and are we kind of coming out of the clouds so to speak?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me address that in two different fronts because what's embedded in our S.A.A.S segment or SAAS segment is several businesses, and I appreciate your comments on specialty.  We've really have had a focus on that. One of the hardest things you do as a manager is to &#x2013; what you want to do is throw all your best people at your problem, and if the problem isn't where your future is, then that's not a good strategy.  So, we've taken our best people and have them focused on specialty pharmacy and making sure it was running on all accounts, so that we could in fact continue to grow our business and be well positioned for the future.</p>
          <p>But still inside of our SAAS segment is two other businesses besides the infusion business which is, one of them is our pharmaceutical manufacturer programs, which are these PAP programs for the most part, where we provide assistance to individuals who are unemployed or don't have access to medications, and we can get those medications from the manufacturers on their behalf, and so we administer quite a few of those programs and that's the business that's been &#x2013; this is by the way a very profitable business with, as you probably know, with Medicare out there.  anybody over age 65 is getting pushed over into the Medicare programs, because that's quite frankly for the manufacturers a better outcome.  The manufacturer now gets paid as opposed to giving away the product.</p>
          <p>So, there has been a tremendous drag on that business as it continued to decline.  It should be close to stabilizing now since we've had several years of Medicare.  The manufacturers had to continually reevaluate whether those programs are still warranted or not.  So, we will stay focused on that business.  But that business has run okay, it's just that it's been in a decline mode.  The other business is a distribution business, and that, there is a couple of reasons that that business may be strategic to us.  We have &#x2013; we're still going through the process of evaluating it.  The ROIC and the returns on that business are nowhere near what we get in the PBM.  So, we &#x2013; that business is still under analysis and investigation, and we will keep you posted on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That's very helpful.  Just two quick questions for Ed, in your guidance do you have any assumptions for share repurchases and what's your remaining authorization on your share repurchase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the assumptions that's in our guidance it's consistent with previous years, where we take free cash flow and assume that the vast majority of that is used for share repurchases.  And with respect to calculating free cash flow, I think if you see on our balance sheet you'll see the current maturities of long-term debt is 260 million, and the way that plays out next year is 60, 60, 60 and 80 in terms of how it plays out by quarters.  So, that will give you an idea of the free cash flow, and in terms of authorizations we have 13.2 million shares remaining under the program.  So we've got plenty of room to get that program done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We now have a question from Randall Stanicky with Goldman Sachs.  Go ahead please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  Thanks very much for taking the question.  Just a couple of short ones for Ed. First it sounded like your authorized generic comment related to Fosamax where there's a little bit more competitive pricing, but it's fair to say you guys assume an AG with every generic launch at this point relative to your guidance, is that a fair comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, it varies by drug, but certainly the trend is developing that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And just to be clear as we think about Q1, I think you talked around this, I just wasn't clear. Do you have any generic Protonix factored into your Q1 outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little bit, as our competitors do. We have a limited supply of the authorized generic for Protonix and then we basically assume sort of brand for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, after Q1, largely brand.  And then the infusion business, it sounds like $0.005 impact would have been the expectations for Q1.  So, it sounds like there is a previous and current expectation that would have turned profitable as you think about the back-half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we were expecting breakeven for the full year, basically.  We were hoping that we are on a positive trend building it towards profitable for '09, but fairly modest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it and then lastly.  I think this question has been asked, but just to be clear, is there any AWP cushion built into the current '08 numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if the AWP risk became zero that would not take us out of our current guidance range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you able to quantify?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No more than I just did.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful.  Thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning.  Quick clarification first for Ed and then a question for George. You're guiding to first quarter, Ed, slightly down from Q4, I guess that means versus $0.65, is that right, and are there any particular costs associated with the startup of ROC that would be impacting the first quarter that would cause it to be down sequentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, Larry that it would be versus the 68 for continuing operations.  So we think of the business now going forward using the continuing operations number.  So when we say down slightly, it would be from that $0.68 not the 65.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And certainly, with the volume that a ROC brings on, there would obviously be some additional call center folks and so forth for some time, but nothing extraordinary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  All right very good.  Secondly, just to elaborate, which is I guess kudos on the selling season.  It seems like as I look back, this is the best selling season you've had since at least '04.  George, I know you've expanded Ed Ignaczak's roles, our head of sales and marketing, and I'm curious besides the obvious value proposition you bring to your customers, are there other specific factors that have really resonated in the marketplace this year that have allowed you to see such an uptick in the growth on selling season?  And along with that is there any &#x2013; are there any particular big accounts that have been known in the market that would cause you to think about some upside in your second half on selling season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that Ed does bring a tremendous discipline to our marketplace.  It's easy to have a salesperson, and I'm not talking about Ed, I'm talking about Laura and the organization, to want to compete merely on price i.e., the competition may have deeper discounts than we do and therefore the logical move is to try to match those rates.  At the end of the day, if you go down on rates you may save the client a few pennies here or there, but the way you really save a client money is by getting the mix right.  And our speech and our talk to our clients and what we put in practice is all about mix matters, and Ed has done a tremendous job of getting the sales and the account management team totally focused.</p>
          <p>I think one of the reasons we do have such a high renewal rate is because we do deliver results in the marketplace.  When we go out to our clients, and I am fortunate enough to get to do this on a quite a few occasions, and we can show what a financial institution's actual drug trends are as benchmarked to that &#x2013; to their industry versus the &#x2013; to the country at large, and those clients as they put in progressive steps and take affirmative actions, it pays.  I think where the real rubber meets the road though, is it's not only driving the programs &#x2013; anybody can put in a step-therapy program.  It's how you administer it with the least amount of noise and disruption, that's the key.  That's what we talk about and we'll get into a lot more specifics as the year unfolds.</p>
          <p>But it's the messaging to the member and it's the way you approach the marketplace.  Because think about what happens if you walk into a pharmacy and you just found out that you've got a disease and that there is a step therapy program.  So, first of all you are not real excited about the fact that your health may not be what you thought it was a couple of days earlier, and now you walk into the pharmacy and the pharmacy can't dispense the prescription because of a step therapy program.  It's aggravation on top of disappointment.</p>
          <p>The whole idea that we take to this is to try to minimize all that through physician outreach, through client contact, through calling members directly, and I think we are the premier company in achieving those goals.  Again, it's not just about taking care of a handful of disease states.  It's each and every member, keep in mind that when you have member disruption or member dissatisfaction, those people are calling the HR department. When the HR department's phones are lit up like a Christmas tree that is not a good thing, that's not what the clients are paying for and that's not what they want.  Of course, they want the drug trend down, but when we can do it in a very meaningful manner without the member disruption, or minimizing member disruption, that's when we get paid our dividends.</p>
          <p>And keep in mind, when we did this for the Statin class two years ago, and were able to prove that we could actually drive up member satisfaction levels at the same time, we drove over $100 million of cost per quarter to our client savings, then the clients become more and more open to more and more programs which enables us deliver better value and creates a stick rate.  That's what I think the reason our model works and what we do provide significant value for our patients, our clients and our shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Larry, this is Ed again, back to your earlier question about the first quarter.  I answered the question you asked, but probably I should have also answered the other question you are asking which is, okay if first quarter its going to be down slightly from fourth quarter then how should I &#x2013; how should I think about how we work our way to the numbers for the rest of the year.  And what I would tell you is that for the third year in a row the generics, again, are much stronger in the second half of the year than they are in the first half of the year, and it makes me wonder if the PBMs should move their fiscal years to July 1st and start the year with a bang.  But anyway, we're seeing the same thing again this year, much generic improvement in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I got it, just to clarify are there any particular larger accounts that are known in the marketplace that are up for renewal in the second half of '08 that you could go after, George?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Second half renewal prospects, large ones that we might be able to go after and win?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For our renewal or for new business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>New business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's significant business out there.  It's not as much for 7/1 though.  The majority of the big accounts we're seeing right now are 11/09.  There are obviously, and of course there are some renewal activity for 7/1, but the big, big companies that are out right now are 11/09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Larry, in terms of mid-year renewals, what we've renewed this year has turned out to be a little better than we had anticipated in our guidance for mid-year renewals, not huge but in terms of renewal in our own accounts for mid-year we've done a little better than we thought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right and a quick clarification, TPharm RFP finally came out and I guess they are using WAC.  It looks like everything else is pretty similar to what's already in the contract.  Is that a fair way to look at it?  Does it look like there's any major changes in that RFP, George?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the only real substantive change, and it's probably not all that substantive, is they've combined the retail and mail program under one contract.  Historically those were two separate contracts which we were fortunate enough to win independently, but this time it's both retail and mail.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>George I just wanted to see if you could expand a little on the biogeneric talk you had.  Obviously a lot of legislation going on right now and there's still a bit of uncertainty.  Do we have any sense in sort of timing, or do you have any thoughts on when we could potentially expect or what the actual sort of road to having a clear plan for approval in that process could be in this year, and do you think sort of with the overhang of the election that that's likely to get delayed probably into '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I'll give you my best guess and that's probably not worth a whole lot, but I can tell you because this is a very &#x2013; these are somewhat uncertain times.  You've got a President who is reaching the end of their term who certainly would love to make some inroads, some big changes on his way out, but at the same time you've had a congress that's run &#x2013; it's a Democratic, both houses of congress are Democratic, so they would certainly like to, if they think they can win the presidency for next year, they would certainly like to move legislation into that situation.  My guess is that there will be a lot of conversation.  The cost of Medicare as you know is phenomenal.  The cost of Medicaid is significant, is very large and so there is a huge need for this legislation.  We are big proponent and backers.  The reality is though, I believe is it will probably happen next year, not this year.  Although Dr. Miller, who is our Chief Medical Officers, puts in significant amount of time in this area and is well seen on &#x2013; well respected and seen often on the Hill because we are trying to move this as quickly as possible, but I think political realities are for next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is actually Brandon Henry for Ricky.  Looking ahead to '08 guidance and possible sources of upside, are there any at-risk launches in '08 that you think could provide some upside for example with like Nexium, Prevacid or Aricept, and if you can may be put some probability around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, as George said earlier, we try not to talk too much about specific clients or drugs because there is always somebody on the other side of that equation, but we do see some upside in terms of launches but probably won't go into which drugs.  But I wouldn't think that'd be hugely material, pennies rather than nickels.  If that helps?</p>

          <p>Well again, I appreciate everyone joining us this morning for our call.  We are very excited and optimistic about the PBM space.  I think what the PBMs do to drive down cost is significant.  What we do in particular is a step ahead and we are very excited about our influence.  I'd also like to say before we get off the call that this is Ed Stiften's last earnings call, and it's with a mixed heart here because I'm glad to see he's probably going to finally break a four handicap.  And so I'm very happy for him to be able to retire.  At the same time he will be sorely missed by this management team.  We will keep you posted on our progress as we are getting close on CFO situations, and we'll keep you posted on that, and again I appreciate everybody's attention to our call.  Thank you.</p>
