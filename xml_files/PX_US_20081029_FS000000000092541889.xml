          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Third Quarter 2008 Praxair Incorporated Earnings Conference Call.  My name is Chanelle and I'll be your coordinator for today.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Sawyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Please proceed sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Thank you all for attending our third quarter earnings call and webcast.  Matt White, Vice President and Controller, and Liz Hirsch, Director of Investor Relations, are with me this morning.  I'd like to begin this call with a few overall comments.  Liz will then review our third quarter results.  After that, I will discuss our outlook and fourth quarter earnings guidance and take questions.</p>
          <p>Before I begin, let me say that today's presentation materials are available on our website at www.praxair.com in the Investors section.  And please note that the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 applies to all statements made during this teleconference.</p>
          <p>We had another great quarter.  We delivered 20% sales growth and 18% earnings growth in an economic environment which became increasingly challenging as we moved into September.  Excluding a help from currency translation of 5% and natural gas pass-through of 3%, sales growth was 12%.  These results validate not only the strength of our business model, but also the ability of our people around the world to respond quickly to changing business trends while flawlessly meeting the needs of our customers.</p>
          <p>Our backlog of projects to come on stream over the next three years grew substantially, moving from 44 projects up to 47 last quarter.  Most notably, we announced a second world-scale 3000 ton per day oxygen feed to a coal gasification project being built by Anhui Chemical Company in China, which will use the syngas produced as a feedstock for making chemicals.  This is our second full gasification project in China.  Our first, with Sopo will come on stream at the end of 2009 and this new project is expected to start up in 2011.  We also announced a very large contract to built two world-scale hydrogen plants which will supply the expansion of the BP refinery in Whiting, Indiana.</p>
          <p>We continue to stick to our financial discipline regarding project returns in order to deliver the highest return on capital in the industry well into the future.  In addition, I want to assure you that we expect to meet our long-term organic growth expectations.  We will surely see a headwind from currency over the next several quarters, as well as a slowdown in base business volumes as a result of macroeconomic contractions.  We are already responding to this by cranking it up a notch and managing our cost structure appropriately.</p>
          <p>Now, Liz will review our third quarter results.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Jim and good morning everyone.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page 3 for a summary of our third quarter results.  Sales in the third quarter grew 20% to 2.85 billion.  Currency appreciation contributed 5% to this growth.  Acquisitions of North American packaged gas distributors contributed 2%.  Underlying organic growth was 10% from higher volumes and higher pricing in all our geographic regions.  Sales growth versus the prior year was very diversified by end market, coming from energy, chemicals, manufacturing and metals.  In energy, sales were primarily driven by strong growth in volumes of hydrogen sold to North American refiners.  Across our other end markets, sales benefited from moderate volume growth and higher pricing.  Overall manufacturing demand remained reasonably strong, but we began to see sequential softening of demand in September in the US and Europe.  Industrial manufacturing was strong in South America and Asia.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was a record $544 million, 18% above the third quarter of 2007.  This increase is lower than the growth in sales due to the pass-through of higher natural gas prices in our sales.  We purchased natural gas as a feedstock for making hydrogen and we pass along higher gas costs to our customers in hydrogen prices.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was reduced by about $10 million this quarter, which is the estimated impact of the two US Gulf Coast hurricanes in September.  The impact was primarily from lost sales, mostly hydrogen pipeline sales, during a period of time that our plants and our customers' plants were shut down without power.  This amount also includes some costs for facility repairs in the aftermath of the storm, but these costs were not significant.  Offsetting this impact was income that we recorded in the quarter from foreign currency hedge gains.</p>
          <p>Our currency exposure is the effect of translating the sales and earnings of our non-US businesses back to dollars for financial statement reporting purposes at changing foreign exchange rates.  The effects on operating profit and net income from foreign exchange translation is about the same as the effect on sales.  We have been hedging forward on a rolling basis the next two quarters of net income in foreign currencies.  We are required to mark-to-market the value of these hedges every quarter, even when the contract relates to anticipated net income in future quarters.  Consequently, we recognized $13 million of net hedge gains in the third quarter and we expect to recognize additional gains in the fourth quarter depending on exchange rates in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Net income grew 16% to 355 million.  Net income grew at a slower pace than operating profit, primarily due to two factors: first, higher interest expense resulting from higher debt levels to finance common stock repurchases, and second, a higher effective tax rate of 28% as compared to 26% in 2007.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share this quarter were $1.11 versus $0.94 in the prior year quarter.  EPS grew 18% from the growth in net income and fewer shares outstanding.</p>
          <p>We generated cash flow from operations of 630 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures were 405 million supporting our growing project backlogs.</p>
          <p>We invested 35 million in acquisitions, primarily three North American packaged gas distributors.</p>
          <p>We spent 537 million repurchasing common stock in the quarter net of issuances.</p>
          <p>Return on capital and return on equity both increased to 15.5% and 26.9% due to strong net income growth.</p>
          <p>Please turn to pages 4 and 5 for our North American results.  Sales in North America rose to 1.56 billion, 19% above the prior year quarter.  Sales growth was 14% excluding the pass-through of higher natural gas prices to hydrogen customers.  Sales from acquired package gas distributors contributed 4% to sales.  Higher pricing and modestly higher volumes contributed to the underlying growth of 9%.  Reported volume growth was 1% year-over-year, but this understates the real growth because of the impact of the Gulf Coast hurricanes. Volume growth would have been about 3% excluding that impact.  What we are seeing in most of our end markets is moderating volume growth on a sequential basis concurrent with slowing industrial production.  We are growing our own business faster than the economy because of new business and positive pricing trends.  Strong hydrogen volumes to refiners and gas sales to oil well service companies continue to drive growth in the US and we expect these to continue to be strong.</p>
          <p>The Canadian economy has been soft for several quarters due to weak auto demand and the strong currency.</p>
          <p>Our business in Mexico is growing nicely, up 22% this quarter, Mexico needs to significantly increase its oil and gas production, and we expect that the energy sector will continue to fuel that country's economic growth as well as growth in our own business.</p>
          <p>Looking at page 5, on-site sales were 18% above the prior year excluding natural gas pass-through.  Hydrogen volumes to refiners were up 9% and would have been up an estimated 27% ex hurricane impact.  Demand for oxygen and nitrogen was also higher driven by demand from steel and manufacturing.</p>
          <p>Merchant sales were up 12% driven by strong pricing.  In the quarter we saw steady demand for merchant products across most market sectors, oil well services, metals, food, water treatment and general manufacturing.  Packaged gases sales in North America grew 13% largely from acquisitions and higher pricing.  Same-store sales for PDI, our US and Canadian business, were up 5% from last year.  US same-store sales were up 6% and Canada up 2%.</p>
          <p>On a same-store sales basis gases were up 8% and hard goods up 1% due to lower capital equipment purchases.  Demand for specialty and rare gases is strong.  Sales of safety products and welding accessories showed good growth.  The trends we are seeing reflect the economic slowdown in the automotive, transportation and construction industries.  PDI announced a price increase in September to recover higher power and distribution costs; this action plus ongoing productivity initiatives and good cost control will give us earnings growth in spite of expected lower volume.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in North America grew 12% to 274 million.  The operating margin of 17.6% is similar to last quarter, but below a year ago due to higher natural gas prices and higher electric power costs contractually passed on to customers.</p>
          <p>Please look at page 6 for our results in Europe.  Sales in Europe were 384 million, 18% above 2007, with currency contributing 13% of this growth.  Underlying growth was 7% from higher volumes and higher pricing including pass-through of higher power costs.  Sales of onsite and merchant gases grew in Spain, Italy and Germany.  Packaged gases weakened in Spain reflecting the slowdown in construction markets.  Overall, growth in manufacturing markets is slowing but we expect our business will continue to grow from new applications, pricing and from markets like food and healthcare which are less tied to the economic cycle.  Operating profit grew 23% to 96 million.  OP included a $9 million gain from net income hedges, applicable to anticipated net income in the next two quarters.  Excluding this gain, the segment operating margin was 23% which includes some severance and other restructuring costs.</p>
          <p>Page 7 summarizes our results in South America.  Sales in South America of 527 million were up 26% compared to prior year, including a 12% boost from currency translation. Underlying growth was a strong 14% consistent, with the growth rates we have been seeing all year. Onsite merchant and packaged gases all show good volume growth driven increasingly by growing domestic demand.</p>
          <p>Industrial production in Brazil remained strong at 5.7% for the quarter, down only a little from 6.3% in the first quarter of this year. The recent sharp depreciation of the real does not reflect economic fundamentals in the country that is more related to a flight to quality in the credit markets which always hurts emerging markets' currencies. We have not seen any slowdown in the business, but are preparing for a slowdown in growth and are managing our cost structure accordingly. Proposal activity is strong and our backlog of new projects is increasing.</p>
          <p>We also continued to see strong growth in our businesses outside of Brazil including Peru, Chile, Argentina and Colombia. Operating profit grew 32% to 111 million. This included $4 million of net foreign exchange hedge gains related to next quarter.</p>
          <p>Please look at page 8 for our Asia results. Sales in Asia grew 26% to 239 million resulting from strong growth in volumes and pricing. Higher on-site volumes were driven by new project startups and merchant volumes grew 10% in the quarter from growth in China, India and Korea. Pricing trends are strong, particularly for specialty gases. Sales growth came from &#x2013; primarily from chemicals, electronics and manufacturing markets. Electronics sales were up reflecting new projects in China and Korea and growing sales to photovoltaic customers. We are seeing a sequential slowdown in electronics due to reduced semiconductor and flat panel manufacturing.</p>
          <p>Project activity continues to be strong in the region. We announced our fourth oxygen plant for Shaoguan Steel to supply their new expansion. We also announced the oxygen plant to supply Anhui Chemical's coal gasification project that Jim mentioned. China is a leader in coal gasification technology due to the country's abundant supplies of coal and shortage of liquid fuels. Our 3000 tons per day plant design integrates well with the prevalent gasification technology, and so we expect more of these opportunities.</p>
          <p>Operating profit grew 27% to $38 million.  The operating margin is below last quarter due to pricing pressure on product sold to the electronics industry. Additionally there was a slowdown in production in China post Olympics, which was not surprising.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page 9 for Surface Technologies. Surface Technologies' sales grew 10% and 3% ex currency.  Sales growth was driven by higher coatings for the energy sector, industrial gas turbines and oil well parts. Overall sales growth was slower than what we have been experiencing due to lower aviation coatings for jet engines. This is due to the Boeing machinists strike as well as to the push out of the new large plane deliveries resulting from production delays. We expect to see the volumes coming to us as production resumes. The lower volumes this quarter resulted in operating profit of $25 million, 4% above the prior year.</p>
          <p>Page 10, shows our global end market trends. We are showing in here our year-over-year sales growth in our major end markets, excluding currency, acquisitions and natural gas price pass-through. So this represents organic growth. We've included the results for this quarter next to the results we showed you last quarter for comparison purposes. What you can see you is that in the third quarter, sales growth continued to be very strong.</p>
          <p>The energy segment reflects the impact on hydrogen sales from the hurricanes, but was still up strongly. We do not expect that the current level of oil and gas prices will impact the strong growth outlook for this part of our business. Hydrogen sales relate to desulphurization of crude oil, not directly to oil prices. Gas well fraccing has continued to be strong for us and should remain so as long as natural gas prices are above the 5 to $6 level.</p>
          <p>We may see some near-term curtailment of activity due to tight credit markets which can impact capital spending for some of the smaller drillers, but most of our customers are the larger companies who thus far have indicated that they do not expect a major reduction in planned drilling and fraccing activity for 2009. Where we probably will see a slowdown is in the development of North American gasification projects, whose economics rest on higher gas prices.  Significant project cost inflation and tight financing conditions will also cause project delays we believe, but we do not have any of these projects in our current backlogs.</p>
          <p>Electronics was up nicely this quarter on year-over-year basis, but we are seeing a sequential slowdown in line with the forecasted drop in semiconductor chip production in the fourth quarter and in 2009 as well as lower demand for flat panel displays. We expect to see growth from solar customers, which is a small but rapidly growing part of the business.</p>
          <p>Sales to the chemical sector were up 13% with strong volumes from US Gulf Coast customers prior to the hurricanes due to exports and helped by a weak dollar and relatively low natural gas prices.  In addition, strong demand in Germany and project starts in Asia contributed to the growth.</p>
          <p>Sales to metals were up 14% in the third quarter year-over-year. The major US steel producers have since announced a number of production cutbacks in an attempt to work down service center inventories and avoid rapid price declines in the face of slowing demand. So, we will see lower US volumes in the fourth quarter, perhaps as much as 20%. This is similar to what we saw in the second and third quarters of 2005. A 20% reduction in our volumes to the sector has about a $0.02 EPS impact per quarter, and this is built into our current expectations.  Globally, we are expecting some impact from this sector in South America and Asia, but not to the same extent, because these regions are global low cost producers.</p>
          <p>You can see that year-over-year growth in the manufacturing sector has slowed a bit.  This is particularly true in the US and Europe.  It has remained reasonably strong in South America and Asia, driven by infrastructure spending. We see the impact of this primarily in our packaged gas volumes, but also in the slower, but still positive growth in merchant liquids.</p>
          <p>Within global healthcare, we have steady growth in our hospital business and in home care in Spain and Brazil. US homecare partially offset that growth due to reimbursement rate cuts.</p>
          <p>Sales to aerospace were lower this quarter due to the lower coating volumes in PST that I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>The food and beverage segment continues to provide good, steady, non-cyclical growth.</p>
          <p>And now I'd like to turn this call back to Jim who will discuss our outlook and our earnings guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>As we just outlined, we had a great quarter, but the world has changed dramatically in the last month with the global banking and liquidity crisis. I want to reemphasize that we do not have any direct impact from the credit crisis in terms of our own balance sheet, cash flow, or financing requirements. So I thought it would be helpful to briefly review our cash flow and debt structure which is summarized on page 11.</p>
          <p>Our business strategy is to maximize the spread between our return on capital and our cost of capital, lock the return in with our customer contracts, minimize risk exposure, and finance as cheaply as possible. So our method of financing is largely A1, P1 rated US commercial paper and 7 to 10 year public debt issues.  We're issuing commercial paper today at 2 to 2.5%, and our paper is backed by $1.8 billion of committed bank credit facilities.  The average interest rate on our long term bonds is 5.2%.  In addition, we have some international debt which we used for tax and currency hedging benefits.  We do no project or structured financing, either on or off balance sheet.</p>
          <p>For the full year of 2008, we're forecasting operating cash flow to be well over $2 billion, or about 20% of sales. This is a high number and is a result of a high return on capital, which was 15.5% this quarter after tax. We're forecasting CapEx to be about 1.5 billion or 14% of sales.  This is at the high end our historical range and is consistent with the large number of onsite projects in our backlog that will start up in 2009 to 2011.</p>
          <p>This leaves us about 6% of sales to pay dividends and repurchase stock.  We have aggressively purchased shares this year because the decline in the stock price has provided a good opportunity. During the third quarter we purchase $537 million of stock.  This will decrease the number of shares outstanding in the fourth quarter by about 3% and it will be earnings accretive.</p>
          <p>Now please turn to page 12 for our earnings guidance.  With the banking crisis now approaching two months, it appears that the damage has been done to the global economy with credit essentially unavailable to small businesses and with businesses in all industries reducing inventories, cutting production and holding off on new spending. So, we are now expecting a meaningful economic slowdown. I think the handwriting is on the wall, even though we have not seen a significant slowdown in our business yet. So, we're preparing for contraction in manufacturing output in the US and Europe.  We're prepared for the US, Canada and Europe to have up to 5% negative industrial production growth in the fourth quarter and 2009.</p>
          <p>In South America and Asia, we expect some slowdown in industrial production, but growth should still be in the range of 5 to 8%. So, although you have not seen it yet, we're going to stay ahead of the curve, plan for the worst, but hope for the best.</p>
          <p>Consequently, we plan to reduce our fixed costs in line with slowing volumes in order to protect our operating profit margin. Due to the rapid decline of the euro, Canadian dollar and Brazilian real of about 30%, it appears that currency will become a headwind over the next several quarters. This headwind will be about 8% on a consolidated basis next quarter based on current exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that currency headwinds and tailwinds of this magnitude rarely last for more than four quarters because they lap each other and currencies don't devalue at these rates year-after-year. But it appears that due to the strengthening dollar, we won't be getting back in 2009 the extraordinary tailwind we got from a weakening dollar over the past year. Therefore, for the fourth quarter, we're expecting diluted earnings per share of $1.03 to $1.08. This represents 5% to 10% growth versus the prior year. This guidance assumes a negative currency translation impact of about 8% on sales, operating profit and net income based on current market rates.</p>
          <p>For the full year of 2008, we expect sales to be about 11 billion, 17% above 2007, which is in lined with our prior guidance, despite the negative currency impact which we now expect in the fourth quarter. We are expecting diluted earnings per share in the range of 4.21 to 4.26 excluding two items: first, the $0.03 pension settlement charge we took in the first quarter, and second, any potential restructuring costs that we may take in the fourth quarter to accelerate our productivity gains. Excluding these items our full year guidance represents 16 to 18% growth versus 2007. 2008 capital spending will be about 1.5 billion, increasing in 2009 up to 1.8 billion purely as a function of our project backlog. Obviously we will carefully manage our maintenance and discretionary capital spending of about 300 million.</p>
          <p>We're confident that our bas business model will continue to deliver organic growth in sales over the long cycle of 8% to 12% and earnings growth in the range of 12 to 16%. In the short term, due to slowing demand growth, you should expect that organic growth will be at the low end of the range, just as it has been at the high end of the range during the up cycle of the past couple of years.</p>
          <p>The negative currency impact of about 8% at current rates could therefore make sales growth flattish over the next couple of quarters and make earnings growth in the mid single-digits. Once the year-over-year exchange rate changes lap each other, earnings growth will be higher.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude by saying that no matter what 2009 brings us in terms of the global macro picture, we expect to deliver growth in earnings and cash flow.  Our revenue model allows us to be more stable and resilient in many of the markets we serve because of our contract structures. We are not immune from reduction in our customers' volume of production; however, we are not impacted by the cyclicality that they may face in their pricing and their margins.</p>
          <p>We have a record backlog of large projects which will come on stream over the next three years and that are contractually locked in. We will stick to our financial discipline and continue to run the business for cash flow and we plan react swiftly to the changing environment and accelerate our cost reduction and productivity initiatives as necessary.</p>
          <p>And now I would like to open the call for questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we basically have steps by startup dates or start up windows in the contracts and so far we have not heard much from customers about interest in deferring or delaying those projects, but we'll wait and see how that goes, but I don't expect any major cancellations of contracts and any major push outs really other than those which are a result of our customers' projects themselves being delayed by delays in construction.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What would your tolerance level would be in terms of those types of delays?  Would you let them push it out for a quarter or two quarters, a year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we have been doing in terms of net income hedging is hedging out usually on a rolling basis, the following quarter or the following two quarters. And as we hedge those out, when you come to quarter end, you have to mark to mark up the hedge which you would put on for the following quarter, okay? And so, that's why we had a gain in the third quarter and we should probably have similar size gain in the fourth quarter depending on where exchange rates end up on December 31.</p>

          <p>Hi Jim. Jim, can you talk about the impact of lower energy prices? I guess a couple of different dimensions to that.  One, what are you seeing in terms of nat gas well fraccing demand?  And then on the hydrogen side, we are seeing lower refinery run rates here which presumably represent some volume rifts to you as well. So, just talk about your view on energy prices and the impact on demand there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, so far we've not seen a decline in fraccing activity, and I don't &#x2013; it's hard to say where those guys are going to go, but what we've heard back from most of our customers is that they don't expect to delay drilling and well completion with gas prices where they are today.</p>
          <p>On the refinery side, yeah, you're going to see declines in refinery output. I believe they will be about 5%, somewhere around that range.  That's what I've heard from the industry and that's just similar to declining output in other end markets that we are probably going to see also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that you've incorporated that kind of decline into your guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and one follow up on your fourth quarter guidance.  So basically you've got a another 3 cent hedging gain in there and what is the potential range of restructuring costs, which I know you said was not in the guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, well we don't to know what the currency hedge gain or loss is going to be.  I mean I think the biggest uncertainty right now in our guidance is currency and the markets have been all over the place and I don't know where they are going to end up at the end of the year, so I can't really answer that question.  And then on the cost reduction programs, we've been generating about $300 million a year of productivity savings annually and we normally expense within our earnings without breaking it out, somewhere in the neighborhood of 20-25 million dollars of severance and restructuring costs, but that's just a cost of normal doing business.</p>
          <p>As we look forward, we are going to have to step it up on the productivity programs and we are going to have probably some additional costs above and beyond that, but at this point in time I'm reluctant to give a range because we haven't really figured out what those programs are going to be.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry about that, I'm curious if you've seen any adjustment in your refining outlook given that sweet, sour crack just sort of come in and that might adjust the crude slate at all.  Do you get any indication from your customer base that that could happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I am not, and I think that our hydrogen volumes will continue to grow sequentially quarter-after-quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How about on &#x2013; you mentioned you've got a lot of projects in the backlog that are for on-sites and presumably you bid those out based on an expected cost, I don't know if you get a turnkey quote from your E&amp;C providers, but clearly the cost of materials is going to be going down. Do you get to harvest any of that cost relief if it shows up on the projects in backlog?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be greater on projects that are at the beginning of construction rather than projects which are nearly complete. But I think most of you know that before we sign a contract with a customer, we try to lock in about 80% of the cost of building a project and that has kept us from having cost overruns over the past couple of years. Going forward, I do expect that with material costs, steel costs and so forth being down, pipe costs being down, and component costs being down and hopefully the current labor shortage going away, that we would get some benefit on the cost of building those projects. But we'll just wait and see. And those would all be capitalized into the projects anyway.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Jim, two questions, the first on North American pricing. How much of the pricing that you are reporting is due to scarcity in argon and helium and molecules like that are in &#x2013; that have tighter supply balances?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's good pricing taking place everywhere &#x2013; and it's &#x2013; there's a couple of categories I would say. First of all, energy, our electricity price is up about 15% year-on-year and so within our price number we actually do include the price which is passed on to on-site customers just as a result of higher electricity price. And then in the merchant markets which are very tight we've been able to get significant price increases because our customers need the product. And then in our argon, helium and specialty gases we've had greater price increases but they are not that big in total size to have that much of an impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I guess the other question, this is more of a longer term question.  Back in 2006 when you set the targets of 8 to 12% for sales and 12 to 16 for earnings, since then there has been more consolidation in the sector, your capital spending has more than doubled. And you've also had tighter supply demand balances in several regions.  If you were rolling out the same five-year plus target now, would the bias be to the upside or do you think it would still be the same targets, and if so, why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well what I think is that those were kind of meant to be a reflection of our business model and how our business model works in terms of getting growth and they were meant to be through in and through out the cycle with some years having strong GDP growth and other years having weak GDP growth, and obviously the currency was not part of that. But we are still in the same business model, we are still doing the same things and so we are still in the same range as the chart I put up in 2006 in terms of 8-12% sales growth and low double digit earnings growth.  But if you look back over the last eight quarters or so, the economy was in an up cycle and we were much higher than that, even above the top of the range, and now we are expecting contraction in the economy and that would be at the bottom of the range, okay?  But I wouldn't really change that picture.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, did you fully offset your energy and other class in Q3 with pricing and productivity programs?  And related to that, what is your outlook for margins as energy costs decline going forward, aside from the rare gases that are in short supply, do you think you can sustain your real price increases given the weaker macro environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do. I think first of all to answer your question, we do offset our costs.  We did offset our costs in the third quarter of higher electricity costs and so forth and we've got more room on the pricing front going forward.  You can't change prices overnight in this business because you've got long-term contracts both in the on-site and the merchant sector, but as those contracts roll over and so forth, you can bring old contracts up to current market pricing and so I do expect the average pricing will continue to go up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and I think you were targeting your solar photovoltaics market opportunity as around a 2 billion opportunity by 2015.  Given the decline in energy prices, have you tempered your expectations for growth in that segment of the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My guess is that there will be probably &#x2013; actually caused by two things or three things.  First of all, lower energy prices than people anticipated.  Secondly, less money available for the government, for government subsidies.  And thirdly, less money from the capital markets for people who want to produce solar panels, so I do expect that what we talked about earlier about a $1 billion market, it's probably going to be smaller than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in PDI, what's your outlook for same store sales in that segment?  Do you still see the potential for a positive number given your acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the same store sales excludes acquisitions and we are looking at a same store sales number of about five; the US is more like six, Canada, the economy's weaker and it's more like two.  I think we can probably sustain that growth rate, but on the downside, if we really do see a big detraction in manufacturing, that would impact the same store sales growth.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, nice quarter again in difficult times. Jim, when you talked about sales growth in the next coming quarters being flattish, sounds like there could be a headwind 7, 8, 9% for foreign currency and the rest would come from organic growth to get the flat, is the bulk of the organic growth sort of the mid to high single digits you alluded to coming off in the backlog?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and let me just add to that.  In this quarter &#x2013; well, there are two things to adjust out; one is about 8% currency impact if the exchange rates stay where they are today.  The second one is we had 3% up from higher natural gas prices and we think that will go away. So, that would be another 3% down; that's how I got to the kind of flattish number for sales growth. And probably the organic growth inside of that which would be in the 8% area, about 5% and that would be coming from new projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then in terms of the backlog for projects that are coming on stream in 2009, I mean, is there any case or precedence that these could be cancelled?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no they are all coming on stream and they are all &#x2013; the ones especially in 2009 are close to completion. But I will tell you that because our win rate has been accelerating from 2007 to 2008, we expect another step up in 2010 and 2011 of projects are coming on stream.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, then last question in terms of merchant pricing I guess in an environment where the economic environment would be very slow as you may &#x2013; as you somewhat suggested. Would pricing remain positive, flat, down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think pricing would remain positive; there is no reason why it should be going down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Looking at PDI and specifically the hard goods growth number of 1%, how much pricing is in that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually &#x2013; their price is a couple of percent and the volume is actually negative and that's for two reasons.  First of all, the part of the hard goods that are like laser welding equipment and capital investment for the customers, those purchases have been deferred and so that's a reduction in the hard goods. The other thing is that we are not really a hard goods company.  We are an industrial gas company and we sell hard goods because our customers do want to have them available when they buy the gases. But we have been over the last five years continuing to manage the number of SKUs and keep the pricing up on the consumables. So that's where that's going, but I think the hard goods is a good leading indicator for slowing industrial production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you talk about what you are seeing with hard goods, particularly on the equipment side as a leading indicator, I mean your competitors seem to indicate that they don't think the financial crisis is going to affect their business too significantly. Are you less optimistic than they are on the packaged gas side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well not as happy as they are, but we are really &#x2013; they are focused on expanding the SKUs and so forth that they sell. And they are going more to save key products.  They're in the hard goods business; that's what they do. So they are expanding their hard goods business while we just kind of run ours because our customers want to buy certain consumables when they buy gases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right and then in terms of the natural gas impact, I think you kind of covered the impact on well fraccing. But what about the conversion of customers to oxygen that's used for combustion with natural gas, is that a significantly harder sell when natural gas is in the $7 range than when it's 10 or $12?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but the thing is on those conversions, customers have to be convinced that prices are going to be in a certain area over the next ten years in order to make those conversions; it's not just a spot decision and so I think customers will generally be looking at 6 or $7 gas as a long term forecast for gas, in spite of the fact that it has peaks up to $12 from time to time and we'll probably see it peak again at $12 from time to time, but that's because there is not much inventory from natural gas in the system. I don't expect that to slow down all that much and also they are converting as much for air emission reasons as they are for energy cost savings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you guys have any estimates for a sort of bottom base price at which those conversions to oxygen make sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really is a very customer specific situation.  It's not &#x2013; there are all different kinds of customers doing all different kinds of things and it's just very customer specific.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it and then the last question I have is on the FX impact in Brazil, obviously the translation impact is negative, but as you look at your customer base, how many of those customers are exporters, who you might expect to see an increase in demand as the currency is weakening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what's going on Brazil is that domestic demand is strong as well as exports and we all can single out Brazil, but when you look at the countries that we operate, the devaluation is about the same, in Europe and Brazil and Canada and Korea, so what it really is, is a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and that remains to be seen where it goes. But I wouldn't expect that there will be any significant impact on the trade balance as a result of the currency changes.  Not that &#x2013; therefore not that much upside in Brazil.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good morning. Jim, you've been in Brazil for a long time and you've seen these kind of devaluations before. But based on that experience, what do you think will happen in Brazil in terms of the underlying economic growth when you see certain currency devaluation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the main thing you're seeing is actually the dollar revaluing and the exchange rate across the other currencies from the euro to Canada and so forth and Brazil haven't really change that much. The dollar is stronger. And by about 8% and it's hard to say why, okay? It's mainly I think a function of capital movements and cash flows rather than investors making long-term statements on where the currencies ought to trade. But clearly a stronger dollar hurts us both in terms of the translation of our foreign earnings, but it also tends to hurt US exporters as well, some of whom are our customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I understand that, the translation, but do you expect the underlying economic in Brazil to slowdown?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Brazil. I think it will probably slowdown. But it's being growing very rapidly and part of that growth has been stimulated by credit availability and there's still lots of credit available in Brazil, but I do think that the credit unavailability in the US will reduce credit availability in Brazil and that will probably slow the growth down somewhat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and just one quick question on project backlogs, there has been a lot of discussion on the call about this backlog; how much visibility do you have on the project timeline and what I'm trying to get at is, a customer can decide to delay a project based on their own outlook, so at what point do they come and tell you that they are going to delay the project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys, a couple questions if I can. One, Jim are you still pricing your projects in Brazil in US dollars as a natural hedge?  I think some of you have talked about years ago with respect to on-site deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and we have been doing that for about five years now, maybe a little longer, but all of the new major on-site contacts in Brazil and in Mexico have been indexed to dollars and those are really customers who make commodities where the world market price is in dollars and specifically PEMEX in the oil business and a couple of the steel makers and so forth in Brazil. So, we are continuing to do that, and what that means is that only about &#x2013; well about 20% of our earnings coming out of Latin America are directly injects to the dollar and then there is a big chunk that's &#x2013; everything else is indexed to energy prices and energy prices tend to follow the dollar as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With respect to the 5% of sales that's free cash flow, the 20 minus the 15 going forward, to what extent do you think you might be able to refocus on acquisitions and not just PDI-type acquisitions? Are there small merchant producers around the world maybe even joint venture acquisitions which would represent a use of free cash flow for somewhat larger deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, that's just re-function of what the availability of those companies is going to be. There are a handful of $50 million, $100 million size independent industrial gas companies around the world, but it's only a handful. And they are family-owned and families decide based on the family's interest when to sell the business. So, we know all those people and we know that if they're interested in selling the business, we'll be talking with them. And at that point in time we'd definitely be willing to spend the free cash flow to buy them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a final question.  You talked about continued growth in refinery hydrogen.  I know it's an old subject, but can you update us on BP Texas City, were they stand now relative to total potential take when they are fully back on line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, they are still taking about 50% of their total potential take.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if they went to 100% in EPS, that would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be a couple of pennies more EPS.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's why I said before, I think that the &#x2013; our consumption of hydrogen will continue to grow sequentially as BP takes more product as well as a number of the other refineries down there.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jim. You talked both positively and negatively about gasification technologies. Could you triage some of those different opportunities, whether it's for chemical production, power, hydrogen, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they are pretty much dead except for the ones in China which are again for chemical production because there's like a triple storm happening.   The cost of building them is escalating rapidly; maybe that will slow down a little bit in the future. Secondly, the price of natural gas doesn't look like it's going to be that high on they're all contingent on what the expected price of natural gas is going to be over time.  And then lastly financing because phenyl loads were intended to be project financed and obviously there's not going to be any project financing available and even amongst the others where you would have an oil company doing the gasification, they're seeing slim refinery margins and don't have a huge amount of cash flow available.  So, I think at this point those projects are pretty much dead, except for the ones in China.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but the Northwest one, the Northwest is part of the expansion of the tar sands, and at this point in time, I think the expansion of the tar sands is going to slow down and that particular deal also requires financing.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Christian Massey actually sitting in for Kevin this morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your portfolio versus 2001 and how it's different this go around.  Obviously there is a more attractive industry structure and FX is more of a headwind this time, but I was wondering if you could just talk specifically about your portfolio and what's changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, a lot has changed. Our portfolio is &#x2013; and let's first of all talk about our existing business and then we have a backlog on top of that. But the existing business is much more diversified in terms of both geography and end-market.  We are much stronger; we didn't have the energy as a sector back then and we're much more diversified across electronics and healthcare and so forth. Secondly, in terms of geography, back then most of our business was in either North America or South America and now we've got sizable business in Europe and a sizable business in Asia that we didn't have in back then. So, we've got that kind of global diversification as well. Then on top of that, we've got a higher proportion of our business in on-site than we did back then and so we've got more take-or-pay type of protection in our revenues. And then looking forward, the backlog of new projects that we've got coming on stream is four times what it was back then in terms of dollars of revenue. So we were able to get through the 2000 to 2003 downturn.  While many companies had 30% reductions in earnings, we continued to grow earnings through that downturn in spite of a large Brazil devaluation during that period and in spite of volumes which slowed down by about over 5% in the US, because we brought on new projects. But this time going forward, we've got four times as much projects to bring on stream to offset decline of the base business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay that's helpful. And then looking at share repurchases, obviously you were pretty active this quarter. Has that continued into 4Q thus far and can you just update us on your free cash flow priorities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're continuing to repurchase stock. We see it as a good value at this price. It's much more earnings accretive at this price than it would have been at 80 or $90. So we're continuing to buy in stock, and obviously in terms of free cash flow, the capital spending average project has a return of about 18%. So that's obviously the priority over anything else. And then the acquisitions are purely opportunistic as when a good one comes around, we'll buy them, but there is probably not going to be that many or that big and then we'll continue to buy back stock above and beyond that because as the operating cash flow grows, our ability to handle debt grows and we have the lowest debt to EBITDA ratio of anybody in the industry and we have plenty of room if we want to, to continue to buy back stock there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'm sorry about that. Jim could you just talk about China and how you see the outlook in terms of growth there if you exclude some of the new projects, just more of the current organic growth there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I mean, there's a lot of reports about China and there was obviously a slowdown during the Olympics and what you've seen generally in industry in China is that a lot of the stuff that slowed down during the Olympics didn't start up again or didn't speed up again. So they are definitely seeing a slowdown in the rate of growth versus what we saw over the past couple of years. And that will probably stay.  I don't expect to see China GDP growth over 10% again for a while.</p>
          <p>But our projects over there are mainly for customers who make things that China is a net importer of, so for example China is a net importer of chemicals and chemical materials and I think regardless of whatever the industrial production growth is going to be they are going to continue to build these chemicals and plastics facilities and continue to build gasification units as a feedstock for them because they don't want to be dependent on imported oil.</p>
          <p>The other main one is semiconductors.  China imports 90% of the semiconductors that it assembles into cell phones and other computers and so forth. And so they'll continue to build fabs as a result of that no matter what the economy does. And then on the steel side you'll probably see less growth going on in the steel side because of less demand.  Most of that would have been going -- was construction steel and if the economy slows down presumably the construction will slow down as well.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Amy Jiang sitting with Bob. Actually I have follow-up question Jim. Can you just give us a little bit more color about your steel exposure probably by region, and also how much of your steel relative to the business are protected by a long term contract. And then lastly if we assume net global steel production growth of 3-4% in 2009, what could be the base case growth for your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I am not sure I can answer all that. But, there is a &#x2013; in terms of the currency exposure there is a chart in the appendix which shows the change in the exchange rates for the four currencies, Brazil, Canada, Europe and Korea, and if you look at that chart, the red line is 2008, the blue line is 2007 and what you see is that when -- in the first three quarters of the year the distance between those two curves was the tailwind we had from currency, and then as the dollar strengthened about 30% at the end of September, it reverses into a headwind for the fourth quarter. And that's just meant to show that, so that kind a shows the currency exposure by region and maybe you could repeat the second part of the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I was asking the color about your steel exposure by region and also how much of your steel exposure is protected by long-term contract. So, if we assume you 3, 4% of global steel production growth for next year, what could be the base case assumption for your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually about 60% of our steel sales are outside the United Sates and for the most part I don't see much exposure there because Brazil is extremely low cost producer of steel with the best and the cheapest iron ore. Tata in India is also a very low cost producer and then we are not expecting any impact in Europe from steel either, so I don't -- I think what we are going to see probably is about a 20% contraction in production volume in the US for a couple of months and then some of that will come back on stream and the 20% reduction in the US will hurt EPS by about $0.02 a quarter, but internationally I don't think we'll have any material downturn or exposure there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, the first is that on a sequential basis, your shareholders equity went from 5.67 billion to 4.89 billion and basically if you net out dividends and stock repurchase and your net income, that nets out to about a negative 300 million change.  What accounts for the other 480 in decrease?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the third thing in there is the currency translation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we consolidate our businesses around the world, as the currency rated change each quarter, the difference goes straight to the equity account, so there are three things in there.  There's the dividend, the stock buybacks and the currency translation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But why would you have a positive currency translation in your earnings but a negative currency translation in your equity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the currency translation in equity is the end of the quarter exchange rates at June 30 moving to September 30 where you had a strengthening of the dollar, okay, but almost all of that change took place in the last two weeks of September, and so the earnings during that period had a positive tailwind because that's calculated on a daily basis going through the quarter, but if you look at the charts, the currency swing all took place in the very end of September.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly I think you said you thought your operating cash flow for the year would be about 2 billion, which is about flat with last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I said it would be well over 2 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Forgive me.  In the quarter your nine months cash flow was flat with the year ago period and there is this other item where I guess &#x2013; that is it looks like there is higher receivables and it looks like there's maybe some higher other items. Can you describe why the operating cash flows are around flat for the nine months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, it's because of that other category, and what is in that other category is also related to the translation gain and loss, so you have the equity going down with the translation loss, but you also have the accounts receivable and inventory going up &#x2013; or going down beyond the exchange loss, and then the other is an offsetting item to that.  It's not actually a cash &#x2013; it not a real cash flow; it's just the way that the accounting world asks to describe the cash flow.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon now.  I can't believe I'm last, but I was a little bit confused on the whole hedging of currencies and what the strategy there is exactly?  So I understand you're doing it on a rolling basis on net income. But is it not just a full hedge?  Is that why there's still this &#x2013; you foresee this still this 8% headwind or do you just do it &#x2013; is it because it was so rapid?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, the hedging strategy on net income is to hedge forward one or two quarters of net income. Okay?  And we were hedged forward two quarters, okay?  And so we can't hedge sales; all we are hedging is net income and so the sales is just going to be a total reaction to what's changed in the current years, okay?  But all we are hedging is actually the cash flow part in net income and because of market-to-market accounting, the $13 million gain that we took in the third quarter really was a hedge of the fourth quarter earnings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see.  Because I had them flowing through as a balance sheet item.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just because they're not allowed to get hedge accounting for net income hedging.  You have to mark-to market the hedges every quarter and so where you have a gain pertaining to the fourth quarter, we had to take that gain in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay that makes sense.  And then do you guys ever give an indication or can you on sort of what maybe across your on-site projects what the sort of level of sales were above the sort of minimum take or pay levels are?  Is there any? Can you give any color around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I mean generally, the sales levels are above the take or pay levels.  It depends on the projects.  On projects where the production capacity is 100% dedicated to a single customer such as the PEMEX enhanced oil recovery project and in other projects, those ones are 100% take or pay, and it doesn't change. But other places and in particular where we have pipeline on plays, we are willing to agree to percentages more like 70% and so forth in the take or pay volume, so in aggregate, you don't really end up seeing &#x2013; you will end up seeing the volumes move with the customers' volumes, unless the customer goes into a shutdown mode or something like that. So the take or pay is actually better protection kind of on a customer-by-customer basis than it is on a macroeconomic basis.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry you said in aggregate, it will move with sort of customer volumes?</p>
        </plist>
