          <p>Good morning and thank you for your time today.</p>
          <p>As our results this morning show, Diageo achieved a number of important goals in F'11. Increased investment in marketing, provided us with the platform to achieve better price mix, as the performance of our super premium brands in North America strengthened and we saw price and mix improvement in international. This positive price mix led to higher gross margins.</p>
          <p>We increased our presence in the fastest growing markets of the world, delivering net sales growth of 13% in aggregate. We've expanded our sales teams, invested more behind our brands with spend up 22% and started CapEx projects, especially in Africa, to meet further demand.</p>
          <p>In addition we've already completed and reached agreement on a number of acquisitions, which we'll see us invest &#xA3;1.6 billion in fast growing markets. We gained share across Asia and in most markets in Latin America and Africa. In the U.S., we knew we would cede some share as we reduced the level of discounting. So a good year.</p>
          <p>However, there were areas where we didn't achieve all our goals. In 18 of our 21 key markets, we achieved positive price mix but in three markets we didn't. And in a number of markets we didn't deliver gross margin improvement in line with our ambitions. So we've made progress against our goals and strengthened our positions in many key markets, but there's still more to do.</p>
          <p>In May this year we announced the review of our operating model which is now complete. We've identified ways in which we can better align our resources with those markets where there is the greatest potential for growth. Decentralize and move resources close to our markets to increase the speed at which we make commercial decisions and create a more cost effective organization. The result is our increased confidence in what this business can achieve. We have finished the year stronger and we have started to implement changes to drive further top line growth and deliver sustained operating margin improvement.</p>
          <p>I'm going to return to these points later, but first I'm going to hand over to Deirdre.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>I am now going to cover the key drivers of our fiscal '11 performance and show how the operating model changes we have made will focus resources behind the biggest opportunities in both emerging and developed markets, while also delivering operating margin improvement.</p>
          <p>Fiscal '11 was a year of improved performance, but more importantly each of the measures shown here highlights the steps we took to build our platform for the future. The stronger price mix we delivered in the second half highlights faster growth of super premium brands and the increasing importance of the emerging markets to our business. Together with supply efficiencies, it drove gross margin improvement of 70 basis points.</p>
          <p>We are investing strongly behind our brands to fuel their growth in the emerging markets and to drive further price mix improvements. And despite a double-digit increase in our investment and infrastructure costs in the fastest growing markets of the world, we maintained our operating margin, which was 29% for the year. Our financial strength was enhanced with free cash flow of &#xA3;1.7 billion. Return on capital increased again, up 110 basis points to 15.9%.</p>
          <p>I am now going to dive further into the fiscal '11 performance to show how we can build for the future. I'll start with the drivers of net sales growth.</p>
          <p>Weakness of the Venezuelan bol&#xED;var was the key driver of the negative FX impact, and it was a net positive movement of &#xA3;38 million on other currencies.</p>
          <p>Strong growth of scotch in emerging markets, especially Johnnie Walker, growth of C&#xEE;roc in North America and our beer brands throughout Africa were the biggest contributors to volume upside. There was little change to underlying volume trends in the year, and volume growth was consistent in the first and second half of the year.</p>
          <p>In contrast, price mix improved in the second half, especially in North America and Asia. For the full year, the U.S. drove over half our overall price mix and the emerging markets delivered the balance. Strong price mix in Korea offset negative price mix in Europe.</p>
          <p>By category, the faster growth of our premium and super premium Scotch and Vodka brands along with the price increases on beer in key markets drove price mix. Diageo's successful innovation agenda played a key role in delivering this price mix, as many of the years successful launches, such as Crown Royal Black and White Horse 1900, sold at a more premium price point than the base brand.</p>
          <p>Our restructuring in the U.S. wine business improved returns but led to a reduction in net sales. We had a part-year benefit from the acquisition of our controlling stake in Serengeti Breweries.</p>
          <p>Over 70% of net sales growth was driven by the premium and super premium segments. This is partly the category dynamics of emerging market growth and partly increased consumer confidence at higher income levels in developed markets.</p>
          <p>The growth of Scotch in emerging markets and C&#xEE;roc in North American drove the growth of the super premium segment, which was the fastest growing segment in each of our four regions. The reserve brands portfolio delivered over 20% net sales growth in both developed and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>The premium segment also grew well, mainly due to Johnnie Walker Black Label in the emerging markets and Crown Royal and Buchanan's in North America. Baileys in emerging markets also performed strongly with net sales up 21%.</p>
          <p>The standard segment was driven by beer in Africa and Scotch and Smirnoff in emerging markets, partially offset by the decline in Smirnoff in Europe and ready to drink, mainly in North America. Standard Scotch growth was hampered somewhat by declines on J&amp;B Rare and Johnnie Walker Red Label in Spain and Greece, as the declines in the on-trade in those countries impacted net sales. This was offset, however, by the growth of Johnnie Walker Red Label in Latin America and White Horse in Russia.</p>
          <p>The value segment comprises just 3% of our sales but it grew net sales 7% with strong price mix from lower discounting in the U.S. and price increases in Africa.</p>
          <p>Moving now to marketing, our reinvestment rate increased by 50 basis points to 15.5%. Marketing spend increased by 8% with over three-quarters of the increase in the emerging markets. As you would expect, over half of the incremental spend in emerging markets was focused behind scotch, principally Johnnie Walker.</p>
          <p>Investment behind the brand increased across all our key emerging markets as we drove recruitment and premiumization. Investment was down in developed markets as we reduced spend in the challenging scotch markets of Southern Europe.</p>
          <p>Marketing spend behind the vodka category increased in both the developed and the emerging markets. In emerging markets, we up-weighted support behind the Smirnoff Nightlife Exchange Project. In developed markets, increased investment in North America was driven by C&#xEE;roc, C&#xEE;roc Innovation and Smirnoff and Ketel One.</p>
          <p>Change in spend in the rum category reflects the weakness of the category in Spain, where we've reduced spend on Cacique. This was offset by increased spend on the launch of Captain Morgan outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>In beer, increased investment behind Guinness across Africa and in Malaysia offset a reduction in spend behind the brand in Europe, given the economic environment and the consequent weakness in the beer category. Similarly, spend on other beer brands in Ireland was reduced, offset by higher spend on local brands in Africa and Asia, and in total, category spend was flat.</p>
          <p>Gross margin improved on an organic basis, up 70 basis points. We are not immune to raw material price inflation, and overall, our manufacturing and logistics costs increased about 2% to 3%. However, the savings from our 2009 restructuring program, which delivered &#xA3;9 million of cost savings in the year, partially mitigated these increases.</p>
          <p>By region, the biggest driver of gross margin improvement was North America, where we achieved a reduction in cost of goods as a result of the 2009 restructuring program and we delivered improved mix. In Europe, gross margin decline was driven by the growth of the lower margin Wine business and the continued shift to the off-trade in Great Britain and the weakness of Scotch is Iberia and Greece.</p>
          <p>In international, price increases on beer and the faster growth of premium and super premium scotch delivered gross margin improvement. In Asia Pacific, gross margin was broadly flat as the strong growth of scotch in markets such as Korea and Southeast Asia offset pricing pressure in China and Australia.</p>
          <p>As you saw in the previous slide, we continued to invest behind our brands, focused by region and category and targeted those opportunities that will drive the greatest future growth. Overheads were up about &#xA3;20 million in total, reflecting reductions in North America where overheads were down 8%, flat overheads in Europe, and substantial increases in international, up 10%. The remaining movement of about &#xA3;60 million is the change in the impact of currency transaction hedging which is controlled centrally and was a charge of 40 million last year and a gain of 20 million this year.</p>
          <p>In summary, we have increased our gross margin and invested in the long term growth of the business, which resulted in flat operating margin.</p>
          <p>The result of our strong price mixed, continued volume growth, gross margin expansion, and further investments in brand and markets was operating profit growth of 5%. This improved performance was accretive across the income statement. Associate income increased by &#xA3;34 million, mainly reflecting the strength of our performance from Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy.</p>
          <p>Net finance charges fell by &#xA3;65 million. The net interest charge was &#xA3;6 million lower. Core interest was down &#xA3;20 million as the effective interest rate was 4.9%, up around 10 basis points from fiscal 2010, while average net debt fell &#xA3;700 million to &#xA3;7.2 billion.</p>
          <p>This was offset by an &#xA3;18 million increase in the IAS 39 impact. Net other finance charges were &#xA3;59 million lower than last year with the main driver being the reduction in the IAS 19 charge for post employment plans. I would expect our interest charge in fiscal 2012 to be about 5% given current forecast of floating rate interest rises. This includes the expected impact of any debt issuance to fund the acquisition of Mey Icki.</p>
          <p>Our further tax rate fell from 21.6% last year to 17.4% this year. During the year, the value of our deferred tax assets increased and this reduced our tax charge. As you know, there are a number of changes to tax legislation taking place in many countries. However, I believe our future tax rate will be below our previous guidance of 22%. I also expect that for fiscal 2012 and beyond our effective tax rate will be more in line with our average cash tax rate. I will update you as soon as we have agreements in place with the fiscal authorities and can predict the ongoing rate with more certainty.</p>
          <p>Profit for the year, at over &#xA3;2 billion, was up 16% as was EPS pre-exceptionals. Ten percent EPS growth came from growth, 4% as a result of a lower tax charge and 2% from lower IAS 19 charges.</p>
          <p>Moving now to exceptional items. In the year, we settled a number of regulatory issues and continued to drive efficiency through restructuring. As a consequence of our strategy to expand our position in emerging markets, in fiscal 2011 we focused on reaching settlement on a number of outstanding issues in these markets, primarily regulatory and customs issues in Turkey and Thailand. In addition, we reached a settlement with the SEC in respective investigations in India, Thailand, and Korea. The total cost was &#xA3;139 million.</p>
          <p>The economic situation in Europe impacted the performance of Ursus in Greece and as a result, we made a further &#xA3;39 million impairment charge for the brand.</p>
          <p>As you know, we initiated a program in 2009 supply operations to reflect changes in the business and to drive efficiency. In 2011, there was a further charge of &#xA3;34 million related to the completion of the 2009 supply restructuring programs and the brewing in Ireland program. These supply programs delivered &#xA3;9 million of cost savings this year, contributing to gross margin improvement.</p>
          <p>For example, in Ireland we were able to reduce year-on-year costs across both brewing and packaging operations as head count reduced. I expect a further reduction in cost of &#xA3;20 million in fiscal 2012 and &#xA3;25 million in fiscal '13. We continue to review opportunities for further cost reduction programs particularly in European supply. In addition, our work on the operating model review has identified new ways of working and cost savings. Let me spend a few minutes on this now, given its importance to our performance going forward.</p>
          <p>Paul is going to talk to you about how our operating model review has sharpened our focus. I want to talk about how we can expand our margins at the same time as we invest for growth. Over the last year, I have spoken to many of you about operating margin improvement. I think you rightly concluded that I am very focused on driving this change.</p>
          <p>The operating model changes will deliver &#xA3;80 million of cost savings per annum. The first &#xA3;40 million of cost savings will come in fiscal 2012. Of this total, 70% will be in Europe and in corporate. In fiscal '13, there will be further savings mainly in corporate and in supply.</p>
          <p>The operating model review not only reduces our cost base, it shifts resources to the fastest growing markets. For this reason, while overheads will be down in North America, in Western Europe and in corporate functions, I expect them to be up 20% in the emerging markets and 70% of our incremental marketing spend will be in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>From the new financial year, our financial reporting will change to reflect the new organization. The main changes are that Latin America and Caribbean and Africa will be reported separately. Global travel will be reported as part of each region and Middle East will be reported as part of Asia Pacific. The numbers I am showing you today are indicative. We will now carry out the detailed work necessary to provide you with a full restatement. However, I do not think that there will be material changes to these numbers.</p>
          <p>In summary, Diageo is building momentum; as Paul said, a strong business getting stronger. Price mix improved in the second half and the return to positive price mix is an encouraging sign. This mix improvement and the efficiency programs in our Supply business to reduce costs of goods per case led to a further gross margin increase.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest in those brands and markets that we believe will drive growth. Primarily, this has been in emerging markets and behind growing categories in North America and Europe.</p>
          <p>Diageo's robust financial base is a source of competitive strength. We generated free cash flow of &#xA3;1.7 billion. This improved performance and the investments we have made give us the confidence to recommend a 6% increase in the final dividend.</p>
          <p>And now I will hand back to Paul.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Deirdre.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, this is a strong business and its strengths are clear. We have leading brands in broad category positions. We have global reach and superior routes to market. Our skills lie in marketing, innovation and customer relations and the role we play in the communities we are part of. These strengths are under-pinned by our financial strength: our industry leading margins, our return on invested capital of nearly 16%, and our strong balance sheet, which we have again improved this year.</p>
          <p>However, I now want to talk about the future and how we will make this business even stronger. And there are two key drivers to making that happen. We will increase our investment in the new, faster growing markets still further and we will sharpen our focus. We're going to deploy our resources even closer to the market, execute even more effectively and drive further cost savings.</p>
          <p>Let me start with our increased penetration in the faster growing markets of the world. The global economic balance continues to move to Latin America, Africa, Asia; and in Europe, to Russia and Turkey. Wealth creation in each of these regions is being driven by different factors, but in each country there is huge growth in the number of middle class consumers. In addition, there has been a rapid expansion in access to information, a move from traditional behaviors, and a rise of new consumer groups adopting new products and services. As a global branded company, this opens up exciting opportunities for Diageo.</p>
          <p>For several years now, we have made significant investments to target this growing number of middle class consumers but F '11 saw an acceleration in the pace and the value of those investments. We increased our M&amp;A activity. In China, further investment in the Chinese White Spirit category will give us effective control of Shui Jing Fang. In February, we agreed the purchase of Mey Icki in Turkey; and since them we have successfully completed our investments in Serengeti Breweries in Tanzania and increased our investment in Halico in Vietnam.</p>
          <p>These acquisitions give us access to the emerging middle class consumer through fast-growing local brand categories. As we go forward, we can grow in two ways: premiumize these local categories and use the enhanced routes to market which these acquisitions have given us to attract consumers to our international spirits brands.</p>
          <p>As well as accelerating M&amp;A activity, we have shifted the center of gravity to the faster growing markets in a number of other ways. We've increased our marketing investment in these markets. In F '11 it was up 22% and in F '12 we will again increase the proportion of our marketing spend which is focused on these markets and consumers.</p>
          <p>At our Asia conference in May, we articulated our aspiration to be a preeminent luxury goods company in the region. And as part of this we have relocated our Reserve Brand group to Singapore as Asia will be a key driver of growth for our super premium brands.</p>
          <p>We've also invested in our routes to market, increasing our sales teams on the ground to build the presence and visibility of our brands. In Brazil, for example, we hired new salesmen to expand our reach into tread accounts. And in South Africa, over the past 18 months we increased our sales force by 500 as we expanded spirits distribution.</p>
          <p>And secondly, we've sharpened our focus. In 2009 I told you how we would protect our business platform through the downturn and deliver a stronger business at the end of it. As these results show, we achieved that; but the global downturn accelerated the trends we had already seen in many markets.</p>
          <p>We now operate in a polarized world with different economic growth across markets and a very broad range of consumer confidence across the world. This is the background against which we are now sharpening our focus and we are doing it in three ways.</p>
          <p>Firstly, our organization by market now reflects the different growth drivers of each market. And in addition, decisions as to where to invest behind our brands and in our routes to market will now be made in the market. Secondly, we aim to be the benchmark for performance in this industry. Our focus is on brilliant execution across each of the growth drivers: efficiency in procurement, manufacturing and distribution; breakthrough marketing; winning relationships with our strategic customers; and sustainable, scalable innovation. Thirdly, we have a high margin, high return business, but it can improve. We can be more efficient and expand our margins over the medium term while investing in growth.</p>
          <p>As I have already described, our fast growing markets have the resources to deliver even faster growth. They will be the sales growth engine of the business and we will deliver increased margin and profitability. As we've previously described, within four years or less they will account for 50% of our business.</p>
          <p>Today, our developed markets represent over 60% of Diageo's business. Here we're focused on category growth opportunities, on superior customer execution, on sustainable margin expansion and on cost efficiency. As a result, most of these markets will deliver top and bottom line growth and margin improvement in F '12.</p>
          <p>To support this sharpened focus, we have changed our incentive schemes to shift a higher proportion of total compensation to be based on individual market performance. Let me spend a few minutes on the changes we have made in the U.S. and in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>The U.S. spirits market presents a significant opportunity for Diageo. This is a highly profitable market and a growth market. Long-term demographic trends are driving multicultural diversity and an increase of one million LPA adults every year. Together with social change, this is leading to an increase in the number of young adults who choose spirits over beer and wine. Diageo is the clear leader with 28% share and with 10 of the top 25 spirits brands in the market.</p>
          <p>We've already built a superior route to market with dedicated sales teams operating at scale, but we can enhance these strengths even further. In June, we announced changes to our route to market and an increase in the resources, capabilities, and efficiency of our dedicated sales teams.</p>
          <p>It can drive improved performance. Alongside this, three of our most experienced senior leaders have moved from Diageo North America to head up sales teams in our three major distributors.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have formed a separate organization internally to manage and accelerate the growth of high potential but currently low volume brands such as George Dickel, Myers Rum and Moon Mountain Vodka. Our aim is to make this a half a billion dollar net sales value business in three years.</p>
          <p>In North America, we have a proven track record as leaders of innovation in our industry and this year we launched a third of the top 15 spirit launches in the U.S. Innovation also supports our leading brands in core categories. For example R&#xD6;KK, Godiva Chocolate Vodka and Moon Mountain Vodka support Smirnoff, C&#xEE;roc and Ketel One, helping to deliver increased profitability in the category this year and we can leverage our scale even further to drive margin improvement. As you know, we've already made the investment which will reduce COGS in Rum with our new SVI facility and we have announced changes in the local production which will create further opportunity for gross margin improvement.</p>
          <p>Our recent performance in Europe has been robust, impacted as it has been by the economic headwinds there. But we haven't delivered on all of our strengths in Europe. The changes we've made create a combined organization for the whole of Western Europe which we believe will enable us to grow sales, operating profit and margin, and gain share in strategic battle grounds.</p>
          <p>Within Western Europe, we'll be totally focused on our customers and consumers and will line up our entire business, commercial, marketing and supply chain, behind this ambition. We've created an organization that enables faster decision making and faster roll-out of our growth drivers. We will optimize what we can at a Western Europe level and create country organizations that are fully focused on the commercial agenda and we will be world class in managing and serving our customers.</p>
          <p>This has wide implications, removing our European hub layer and refocusing on our individual country structures. Country directors are solely responsible for their commercial agenda and wholly accountable for the delivery of net sales and gross margin improvement in their country. They're focused on execution and delivery for the customer, the consumer and the shopper with the Western Europe marketing and innovation functions supporting market agendas.</p>
          <p>Marketing and innovation will be owned and developed at a Western European level. This will drive quicker decision making on a category basis, drive faster roll out of more focused brand investment and drive innovation. Back office functions have also been consolidated, leveraging our existing shared services and common systems platforms. In addition, this new model builds on the category approach already adopted by Diageo so that we are better placed to target opportunities such as the growth in super premium with our reserved brands and the growth of golden rum with Captain Morgan. In combination, this simpler and more consistent approach will reduce operating costs as Deirdre outlined.</p>
          <p>Sharper focus is also about executing the key growth drivers flawlessly. Internally we are all aligned behind our commitment to brilliant execution. For a branded consumer goods company, the key drivers are marketing, customer relationships and innovation. Let me spend a few minutes on each.</p>
          <p>The growth of new consumer groups in the rapidly growing markets and changes in technology, in media and entertainment are changing how consumers interact with brands. This offers us the opportunity to build even stronger consumer engagement with our brands.</p>
          <p>Let me give you some examples. In China there has been a rapid growth in blogs. Johnnie Walker partnered with Han Han, one of the top 10 bloggers in China with 400 million followers and Jia Zhang Ke, China's leading independent film director, to make twelve documentary style short films and to start a conversation online, which makes the connection with Johnnie Walker inspiring personal progress. More than 20 million people have actively engaged with this campaign. Johnnie Walker is now the most talked about whiskey brand in China and has continued to gain share with brand awareness increasing on lower spend than the brands it's taking share from.</p>
          <p>Secondly, consumers are changing their view of entertainment. Smirnoff already has the successful Nightlife Exchange program. And last week we announced the first element of a multifaceted partnership between Madonna, Live Nation Entertainment and Smirnoff. Madonna will be part of both the Smirnoff Nightlife Exchange and the Johnnie Walker Keep Walking project. Smirnoff consumers can experience the best nightlife from markets around the world and have the opportunity to see Madonna as she searches our Nightlife events for the world's best dancer to accompany her on the next tour.</p>
          <p>My third example is about how we stay at the leading edge of these marketing changes. Our business partnership with Facebook was established last year. Since then, joint Diageo/Facebook boot camps have trained over 950 Diageo marketing employees on how to effectively market our brands on Facebook. The communities of consumers following the Diageo brands on Facebook increased from 3.5 million to over 10 million and over the coming year our partnership will see us develop further marketing innovation and consumer intelligence to support our brands. The most innovative of these campaigns will also have a financial contribution from Facebook.</p>
          <p>Moving now to our customer agenda, which you know has been a focus for us over the last few years and has delivered a significant uplift in our interactions with our key customers. Again, this year we have seen sales to our key global customers grow faster than our total sales; indeed up 7%.</p>
          <p>We have built these stronger relationships with our strategic customers in two ways. We have put some of our top sales talent on their business with regular high-level meetings and joint development of our sales programs. We've improved our customer service through cross-functional teams driving growth, for example, through better store layouts and value through reducing inventory days. These enhanced relationships enable us to work closely with our customers to grow the overall category. For example, with one of our global customers we are the category adviser across 80% of its markets, four times the number of markets versus three years ago.</p>
          <p>At a store level, we're delivering category growth through our ease of shop program, which is all about leveraging shopper insight to improve store layout. Ease of shop was introduced in May, 2009 and by the end of fiscal '10 we had rolled this out to 25,000 outlets. Our aim in F '11 was to implement this in 60,000 outlets, which represent 40% of our net sales value in those markets. And by June this year, we had implemented it in nearly 64,000 outlets.</p>
          <p>In addition to extending ease of shop to new stores, we've also revisited the existing 25,000 outlets to leverage our shopper insight to further improve store layout and space. The result is that ease of shop has helped our customers grow the category by a minimum of 5%.</p>
          <p>Over the last few years, we've built a significant innovation function capable of delivering a strong and balanced pipeline of opportunities. As a result, we had another strong year with sales from new launches up 30% in F '11. The four elements of our strategy haven't changed. Innovation can premiumize our offerings to consumers with success this year from Johnnie Walker Double Black and Buchanan's Master. These are fantastic liquids; they have beautiful packaging and they are priced at a 20% premium to the main deluxe variant. It's still early days, but sales of both variants are ahead of our expectations and they will be launched into new markets this year. Importantly too, they're also positively impacting the brand equities of Johnnie Walker and Buchanan's	.</p>
          <p>Innovation also makes our brands accessible to new consumers. In Africa, 20 cl spirits offerings and beer in cans have done just that. In these fast moving markets, innovation is about spotting an opportunity and acting quickly. In Venezuela, for example, we launched Moneda de Oro, a locally produced rum, at an accessible price point at a time when imported products have risen in price.</p>
          <p>In developed markets, innovation drives sales in less dynamic consumer environments. Flavor innovation across our vodka brands in North America and Europe is a great example of this strategy at work. Another is the work that we're doing in Australia and Great Britain to build the ready-to-serve segment; taking share from wine, and getting our brands into more homes.</p>
          <p>And finally, the reason our innovation program has consistently driven growth is because we remain focused on supporting and investing behind innovations beyond the first year of launch. For example, eight years on, C&#xEE;roc is now well over one million cases and it's still expanding rapidly.</p>
          <p>Deirdre took you through the reorganization costs and benefits, but as I said earlier as well as making these structural changes, we have to build a culture of continuous improvement. We have a very efficient supply function so tasking them with further improvements is tough. But we have. As a result of the operating model review, supply and procurement teams now report at a market level with end-to-end accountability to give increased customer focus.</p>
          <p>As you know, we began our plant rationalization program in 2009 with changes across our global operations. However, the way in which we've implemented these plant rationalizations varies by market. For example, in the U.S. most of our production is for the U.S. market in standardized formats and we can consolidate bottling in a small number of plants. Complex bottle formats have been consolidated in one plant so we can benefit from scale and shared expertise.</p>
          <p>In contrast, in Scotland, where we produce for a number of markets, we've had a number of packaging formats and therefore a level of underlying complexity. To be efficient in Scotland, we have to take out indirect cost. But more importantly, we have to get better at forecasting demand so we can plan our production runs in the most efficient way.</p>
          <p>We've engaged all our supply employees in our efficiency programs. As a result, our utility usage has reduced and water usage, which is focus for Diageo, was reduced by 3% and energy usage reduced by 8%. In addition we have targeted 7% per annum improvement in OEE in packaging. We've achieved this target over three years now and expect to achieve it again next year.</p>
          <p>We will continue to utilize our scale in order to reduce costs. For example, we've partnered with Logoplaste in the U.S. who built a new PET line at our Plainfield facility. This eliminated transport costs. They paid for the investment and we received a lower unit cost.</p>
          <p>This approach is equally valid in our faster-growing markets. For example in Africa, whilst inflation is high, we held our cost per unit flat by optimizing our ingredients. For example, we used more locally grown sorghum instead of imported raw materials.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have decentralized our global functions and moved resources from the center to the markets. This has delivered our objective to deploy our resources closer to our customers and consumers and it's reduced costs. In sales, for example, we will continue to have designated global account managers for our largest customers. They will be based in the market in which the head office of the customer is based. This means they're connected to the market, but we retain the benefits of a global lens. For example, our Walmart account director will be based in the U.S. with Ivan as the new global sponsor for the Walmart relationship. The focus of the global functions will now be to provide expert governance on controls, compliance and to support the markets.</p>
          <p>Now before I'm joined by my colleagues to take your questions, let me sum up. Our F '11 performance highlights the strength of our business and the way in which it has become stronger through the year. And you've seen the steps that we've taken to expand our presence in the emerging markets and to sharpen our focus.</p>
          <p>We have confidence in what Diageo, its brands, its route to market and its people can achieve although we are all very aware of the challenges that we face in these volatile economic times. This morning, we articulated our ends: 6% top line growth, operating margin improvement with the first 200 basis points in three years, and double-digit EPS growth to underpin faster dividend growth.</p>
          <p>These are not annual goals. It is a description of the progress we aim to deliver over the medium term. We have sharper focus on growth and improving margins. It isn't a new focus, it's simply sharper. It doesn't compromise on returns and it will continue to drive very strong cash flow.</p>
          <p>And now I'm going to be joined by Deirdre, the Market Presidents and Andy Fennel, our Chief Marketing Officer, to take your questions. Operator, over to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (47:09) three questions. First of all, regarding the U.S. market, you've expressed some optimism for the medium term. Could you perhaps elaborate a little bit more on more recent trends since the beginning of the new fiscal year, and how you feel about the &#x2013; leading to the Christmas season?</p>
          <p>Second, on gross margin, at least qualitatively looking at the different drivers of gross margin, what's your feeling for the fiscal year?</p>
          <p>And finally, more sort of qualitative comment maybe on when we look at what's happening in some of the economic climates, what's your view about the premium category versus the value category? Are there any internal discussions about the fact that if there is a deterioration in the economy then maybe the &#x2013; some increased effort should be put more on the value side of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe I should take the last question first. And then I'll ask Ivan to talk about the U.S., and maybe Deirdre can talk about gross margin. First of all, Diageo benefits from having a very broad range of price points and geographies. The one thing that's very clear as we look at the new wealth-creating markets, you have an emerging middle class that is very minded to adopt our products. And also, they represent affordable indulgence.</p>
          <p>In the developed markets you are seeing a bit of a two-speed economy. You have those consumers who have the wherewithal to enjoy our brands and it's interesting that on a global basis our reserve brand portfolio was actually up 25%. So the echelons of society that have the disposable income definitely are prepared to spend it on what they see as quality offerings and we have a great stable of those.</p>
          <p>But also in the emerging markets, the fact that we can come to market with affordable brands appropriately positioned in that market means that we've got a very broad array and we can play a lot of tunes within our portfolio. One of the reasons that we've structures ourselves as we have is that our local markets are best attuned to make those choices. So as we see changes, and inevitably will both on the upside and on the downside, our local commercial managers will have to deploy the appropriate resources to extract the right growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>But there's one thing, a bit of a myth out there that I want to correct. We often think that lower price point brands bring lower margins. That's now always the case. Some of our margins, even in our more mainstream markets, are very profitable. Ivan? U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, if you look at the U.S. trends, the Spirits business, I'd say if you look at the last 12 months, is growing at about 1.5%, 2%, the industry. And as you saw, our business is growing about 3 &#x2013; ahead of that, 3%. The most recent trends, which I'm sure you're interested in, the last couple of months continues to suggest continuing momentum. If I look at the key indicators of premiumization, what Paul has talked about, the ultra premium, super premium categories are still strong.</p>
          <p>The on premise, if you just look sequentially over the last four quarters, the on premise has been steadily getting stronger and all our indicators, and we have reasonable visibility into July and August, would suggest that the market is still firm and we're seeing that certainly in our business as well. So the indicators I think going in to the holidays to your question, right now we're cautiously confident that the trends will continue. And if you recall, even in the depth of the economic crisis, the beverage/alcohol category in the United States stayed in growth. It's supported and under pinned by very good demographics, the multicultural shifts and the premiumization trend is very much there to stay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just before we ask Deirdre to comment on margin, the other thing to bear in mind on our reserved brand performance. There may be those who say, "Aw, that's C&#xEE;roc." Well C&#xEE;roc is performing extremely well. However, even if you exclude C&#xEE;roc, our reserved brand portfolio is up 19%. So we're very encouraged by that. Deirdre, margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The elements that drove our gross margin improvement this year, as you probably will have seen, our mix into super premium and an increase in the delivery of our efficiencies through the supply chain. We'll, of course, expect those to continue. The trajectory in the business of our super premium brands, as both Paul and Ivan have referred to, we feel good about those businesses &#x2013; those brands performing strongly. And of course that gross margin gives us fuel to be able to continue to invest behind brands to continue to drive strong equity.</p>
          <p>But I think it's important to note what we're absolutely focused on the operating margin. Ultimately we have to get the return, not only on improved mix and improved supply efficiencies, but we have to get the returns on the marketing investments that we make. So while we are looking to get strong gross margin, we're absolutely focused on leveraging all of our spend, whether it be marketing or overhead spend, and driving operating margin improvement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just a follow-up. What's your estimate of the input cost increase this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what's &#x2013; we, of course, are not immune to input costs. We did have an increase in input costs of 2% to 3%. Of course there is still inflation running through a number of input costs but we'll also have savings coming through on our efficiency programs of 20 million this year which we think will help to offset those costs. And we're also &#x2013; have a balance in terms of the impact of input costs in our business, of course, because of Scotch and the input costs, of course, go into the inventory and our age. And that helps to moderate the impact in any given year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Can I ask a question on the outlook statement? Paul, you mentioned that you would describe the current environment as a polarized world, yet clearly you feel confident enough to provide the market with a three year, essentially medium-term outlook statement. You've made it clear that these are not annual goals but I'd be interested to understand what are the main assumptions behind this guidance in particular for 2012, and particularly focused on Europe? Do you expect essentially in this outlook the European sales growth to stabilize in 2012? And also, what's the outlook for the U.S. business for 2012?</p>
          <p>And then my second question relates to the cash flow development. It's down 15% year-on-year. Could you just explain why that's the case? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first thing I would say about outlook, Michael, is that we don't know what the global economy is going to throw at us. What I do know is that we have the brands, we have the routes to market, we have the people whereby we will navigate through whatever seas we have to. And I would remind everyone that even in teeth of the downturn in 2008, 2009, we continued to grow this business and invest in this business. So that's the general point I'd make.</p>
          <p>What I don't want to do is, having put out three-year goals, now provide a breakdown by market, by brand, by year. Clearly, to deliver on the 200 basis points, we have to start in fiscal '12 to deliver against that goal. So it isn't going to be back-end loaded. Equally, it isn't going to be the same every year. I do believe we can see relatively short-term acceleration in our top line and that will give us the air cover to improve operating profit margin in the short term as well.</p>
          <p>Now regarding &#x2013; you singled out Europe; we have to look at Europe almost market by market because it is quite polarized. If we look at southern Europe, an island, there's no question that we've seen a reduction in consumer confidence that's impacted our business. However, the rate of decline in those markets is moderating and we have maintained our margins. So these are still profitable markets and our teams there have done a great job in maintaining the margin.</p>
          <p>But elsewhere in Europe, there are growth opportunities. Benelux, Germany, Russia, even the U.K. we are able to orchestrate growth. On the back of that, we've got some new business coming on board with Mey Icki where we expect to see accelerated performance. So I think we can get overly depressed about Europe. Yes, there are certain markets that are causing us issues. We're managing that. But there are other areas in Europe where we're seeing growth.</p>
          <p>Cash flow, Deirdre?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You may recall last year's cash flow had the benefit of a change in our vendor payment terms. That provided a benefit of &#xA3;300 million to &#xA3;400 million. That's really the most significant factor. You only get the benefit of that change once and that's why we're seeing a lower free cash flow delivery this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Paul. Also coming back to the outlook and you're talking about the 6% medium term revenue growth, what here strikes me obviously is the emerging market essentially goes up, you'd expect to see faster growth. I just wonder where &#x2013; how we should think about the 6%. Is that looking at the current business or is that something aspirational in a few years time as you get up to, say, 50% of the business in emerging? And I was also just quite interested in terms of the shape of the U.S. business you see for this year, if you look at first half versus second half in what you've just reported it's dramatically different, particularly in terms of volume. How do you see the shape of the growth in FY '12 in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll ask Ivan to comment specifically on the U.S. Regarding the top line performance, currently we have just over 30% of our business in the new wealth creators. Clearly, with some of the M&amp;A activity that will come on stream throughout fiscal '12, that ratio will be will enhanced. And the figures that we are offering in this guidance is basically organic. You get the benefit from the new acquisitions on top of that.</p>
          <p>We delivered 5% this year. I can see, given the profile of the business, our way to 6% and if we see opportunity, given increasing mass in the new wealth creators, there maybe opportunities to increase that further. But let's take our hurdles one at a time here. We're seeing five in this year's results; we can see that moving to six. And then we'll reevaluate based on the progress that we see particularly in these new markets. Ivan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On the U.S. &#x2013; good morning, Ian. If you look at our total year performance of 3% NSV growth in North America, I would see that's sustained and outperform the industry, as I talked about earlier. I wouldn't read too much into H1, H2 volume. I'd look at NSV. If you look at our strategy right now, we have been reducing discounting. We've de-emphasized the low end of the business like Popov and Gordon's, where we have some big volume drop offs.</p>
          <p>I am actually very pleased with the quality of revenue growth coming through in the U.S. and the margin expansion that is accompanying that. And if you look under the numbers, as Paul pointed out, even take C&#xEE;roc aside, I mean brands like Buchanan's, the Classic Malts, Johnnie Walker Blue, Johnnie Walker Gold, are all in double-digit growth. The on premise on Ketel One is up 9%, 10% in depletion terms. There's some real quality underpinnings to what I see as a very healthy kind of revenue profile. And our goal is to keep outperforming the industry from a total revenue standpoint in U.S. spirits and expand operating margins. And going into the new fiscal year, I believe we'll continue to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to be clear, you only talk about price mix this year, does that mean more reduced discounts rather than headline price increases? Are you still expecting much on headline pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I expect we'll get more in F '12 than in F '11, but yes, it will be a combination of both and clearly we will track the consumer and competitive environment. But overall I would expect us to get price as well as reduced discounting in F '12 as well.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Ann, I was lucky enough to be in Turkey to announce the closure of the deal yesterday. The short summary is the business is doing very well since we signed the deal back in February. The &#x2013; if you recall, we did call that the market in calendar '11 for racket would be a few points off as a result of the tax increase that was incurred earlier in the year. That is playing out for the total market, but we are beating the market by a number of points in market share so we are actually in growth year-to-date and I can tell you essentially we're ahead of the business plan that we had put together and used in our modeling.</p>
          <p>So May itself, in growth for the year, but the racket category is off by about five points as a result of the tax increase. We see that playing out into next year and you're probably looking at something like flat category trend in calendar '12 and that would then translate into increased growth for us where we continue to see us gaining market share and getting mix and premiumization, which is a big, big focus for that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I would just add I see huge opportunity for premiumization in the local brands, but the other opportunity is that our imported brands are pretty thinly distributed in that market and that represents a huge opportunity going forward. So we're very excited by it and everything I've heard and the numbers I've seen is that we're well on track.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. I have a couple of questions please. First on, look, if we look back at the crisis, 2008/2009, one of the major problems there obviously was the destocking that occurred in various markets, U.S. and some emerging markets. How would you see inventory levels across the world as we stand now? And how would you assess that risk compared to going back to back then?</p>
          <p>Then moving back to the U.S., maybe a question that you can refer for Ivan again about &#x2013; you talked about in 2012 considering reducing discounts further. And the other large industry players seem to be doing the same. But what about the Tier 2, Tier 3, the smaller players; are you seeing, are they doing the same? Are they reducing discounts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe if I take the inventory question first, as we saw the economic environment improve, we did not see a rebuilding of inventories. So inventories came down, generally speaking they have not come back, so that's the first thing. However, a lot of the reduction in inventory that we saw back in 2008 was of our own making because we had great concerns about certain distributors being able to pay their bills. So in the event that we see some further deterioration, obviously we're going to watch the credit terms of our distributors very, very carefully.</p>
          <p>Now we've got better visibility, inventories are lower. We've got a bit of a track record now in how to manage these quite extreme situations. So I think we are far better equipped than in 2008. All of that said, there is nothing that we are seeing in our markets at the moment to suggest that there is an inventory issue or that there is a slowdown in ordering from our distributors. Ivan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On the discounting question, if you look at the current competitive set in brands in the U.S. right now, in the most recent periods there's about 50% of the brands that are reducing discounting right now. As you can imagine, we track this very closely. So it is moving in a more healthy place.</p>
          <p>I think our strategy is very clear here, which is we are &#x2013; our price premiums virtually across the portfolio in consumer price point terms have expanded in fiscal '11. So if you look at Smirnoff versus its competitive set, both up and below Captain Morgan, et cetera, we've expanded those. We are keeping the investment and the quality of marketing. I'm very excited about the new campaign on Captain Morgan; just been on air a couple of months.</p>
          <p>So I think us &#x2013; approach is going to stay very much the same. We are going to kind of reduce discounting. We're expanding those price premiums, keeping the marketing investment. And I think what's helpful is retailers are realizing this time around that keeping the value in the category and growth is good for them.</p>
          <p>In the environment to what's happening right now, beverage alcohol is one of the most attractive categories for retailers and I think our leadership in sustaining value in the category is being appreciated and I think we will work our way through fiscal '12, very much keeping that focus and value.</p>
          <p>And to our earlier point, the consumer dynamics on premiumization are still very strong. Ultra premium is back to growing a bit faster than super premium and that's growing faster than premium and the lower end is under pressure again. When you look at the last few months of data, that trend continues.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, everyone. A couple of questions from me please. The first one, you gave a number at the half year stage, the proportion of growth that came from your strategic brands as a whole. I was just wondering whether you could give us the number for the full year as well. I think it was 75% at the half year stage.</p>
          <p>And then a second question on Africa. There's an interesting comment in the statement that a third of your sales growth in Africa came from spirits and I was just wondering whether you think that is a turning point now where the spirits business on that continent starts to gain some scale quite quickly? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well maybe we &#x2013; while we find the number that you are seeking on the strategic brands, maybe between Stuart and I we can talk a little bit about Africa. I think there are a couple of things going on here. First of all, we have reorganized our spirits distribution in certain markets to bring it in house and to leverage the platform that we have honed over the last number of years in beer. And we are delighted with the performance. We are really seeing an acceleration in both market development and clearly is the leader in our market shares.</p>
          <p>I also, from what I've seen, I'm very impressed with some of the innovation that's taken place around spirits regarding accessibility and so on. But as regards to broader market developments, Stuart, why don't you give your perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jamie, I think the thing to say, you ask is almost now the time for spirits in Africa. And I think what we are seeing is definitely as economies are stabilizing, consumers are starting to get much more experimental and the emerging middle class dynamic is as true for Africa as it is anywhere else. Yes, there is a bigger opportunity for premium beverages and we're very fortunate we have very strong brand properties. Johnnie Walker, J&amp;B, Smirnoff, and Gordon's in fact, are all strong properties for us and we are seeing, as Paul said, as we've taken in house particularly in Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon where we've taken in house spirits distribution to supplement where we've already been distributing for many years and having our brands in Kenya and Uganda, we've seen a real acceleration of distribution reach, quality of distribution, on trade activation, all of the kind of things &#x2013; the perfect serve training, bar education, we're seeing all of that now really paying dividends.</p>
          <p>So alongside the innovation agenda and the in house skills that we're deploying now, and with some fantastic marketing platforms, very relevant both through digital, in terms of telephony, and also increasing Web access, we're seeing a great way to harness the full marketing mix in the same way as we do elsewhere in the world to great effect in Africa. And yes, I think you can continue to expect spirits to be a growing source of performance for us in our African business going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The final thing I would say about Africa is that even when we look back and in the depths of the problems of 2008, 2009, our African business hardly missed a beat. It continued to grow very strongly. It came off a couple of points but really came through that period very, very well. And since then we're even stronger. Our market shares are stronger, our management teams are stronger, our routes to market are stronger. So Africa is a jewel in this business.</p>
          <p>On your question regarding the percentage of growth, it remains the same at 75%.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, Nico, we started hearing you and now you're fading.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try this. Is this better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I was saying that your cost savings guidance of 80 million would imply a margin improvement of around 260 to 270 basis points over the two year period. Should we assume that the 60 basis points that is not in your <mark type="ph" /> turn of base point (74:00) guidance is an increase in A&amp;P? And would that be, the increase in A&amp;P, be front-end loaded?</p>
          <p>And then a second question, the margin guidance over the next three years with the margin improvement is mainly related to management self-help and specific cost savings. Should we expect after that, again back to the model of limited operating leverage? Or could we go &#x2013; or expect greater operating leverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all regarding the targets, I tried to allude to it before; we are not expecting the delivery of our medium-term term goals to be lumpy. So trust us to level it out and give you a reasonable trajectory.</p>
          <p>Now equally, given the size and complexity of this business, don't pin me down to 10 basis points in this year or 15 basis points in the next. But overall, we expect the level of delivery to be reasonably uniform; minor variations on that. I believe we can get this business back into positive operating leverage.</p>
          <p>And in our guidance we were very clear that we say the first 200 basis points in the next three years. I do not expect it to stop at that point in time. It will give us a period of time to look for more opportunities either through mix, gross margin, better market scale and presence.</p>
          <p>So this is the start of a journey. We have great confidence in those 200 basis points. What we're going to be working on is confidence in rolling that forward.</p>
          <p>Regarding the difference, I think you can expect some increase in A&amp;P, and the reason for that is that in these new markets, we have a very strong position. It would be crazy for us not to capitalize on that position, and therefore we will be accelerating our investment behind our brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which would imply that your A&amp;P would move beyond your levels where &#x2013; or the highs of previous years; and it could even reach 16%, especially if the premium end of your business is growing ahead of the value end because the A&amp;P, I presume, is higher there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it could. I think you should expect A&amp;P ahead of sales but not A&amp;P at the expense of operating profit growth.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, please; the first one relating to North America. We saw significant acceleration of profit growth in the second half. Was that primarily due to production savings and perhaps the USVI? Or was it a big acceleration in price mix benefit as well?</p>
          <p>And the second question relates to Europe; as well as the weaknesses in the countries, the individual geographies, we saw that the price mix in Smirnoff was very weak, down 7% for the full year. Is that mainly a channel mix issue or is there something else going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all on USVI, you've seen no benefits in this set of numbers from USVI. That will start to come in, in the second half of the fiscal we've just started. Ivan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The combination, Trevor, is of good cost productivity, both on cost of goods &#x2013; we've had very strong productivity come through in F '11. Overhead's productivity as well and the price/mix reduced discounting impact on the top line.</p>
          <p>So it's pretty holistic, and again I feel &#x2013; that's why I feel very good about the quality of both gross margin improvement in the year, which is about 140 basis points, and the operating margin leverage at 180, while we grew A&amp;P by 60 basis points.</p>
          <p>So a pretty holistic cost/mix price, and as Paul points out, there's no U.S. fee hike in F'11.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The other thing I would just add about first half, second half, if you look at momentum across the board, it improved in every one of the regions. So the performance was stronger across the piece.</p>
          <p>Next question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Smirnoff in Europe. I mean in addition to being subject to the geographic and channel negative mix that we face in Europe on all of our brands, it's also frankly been a very, very competitive category in some of the larger markets in Europe that has vodka.</p>
          <p>And so I think the margin pressure on Smirnoff, particularly in the off premise, has been stronger than in the vodka category than it has in some other categories. I would say that it's a particular focus for us in the in new financial year to improve our margins on Smirnoff.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. A couple of questions, if I can. Just going back to the performance of C&#xEE;roc in the period. I appreciate it wasn't the only driver of growth by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm just wondering how we should think about the growth of that brand looking forward. Perhaps Ivan could flesh out a little bit more what is driving it in the year. Was it new trade channel penetration or was it really just very strong consumer pull?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, obviously you're implementing a major restructuring of your European operating structure over the next couple of years. I know this is a two year program in terms of cost reduction, but I wonder if you could give us a flavor as to how fast, perhaps particularly at the commercial end, you're making those changes in markets. You are changing the way managers perhaps have &#x2013; are going to manage those businesses compared to history.</p>
          <p>And then just a final one on Europe. I wonder if Andrew could perhaps comment on perhaps tighter regulation in excise taxes, the risks around that looking forward. I note overnight the French government is looking to raise duties on alcohol, and I'm wondering how you will think about dealing with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe, Ivan, if you talk about C&#xEE;roc in the U.S., and then Andy, some of our rollout plans for C&#xEE;roc. Because we really only just started to move that brand into new markets, and the signs are very, very encouraging, so we're impressed by that. And then Andrew on Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Simon. C&#xEE;roc, as you can see, is performing very well. This brand is depleting over a million cases as we close fiscal '11.</p>
          <p>To your point, it is consumer-uptake-based. I mean this is not pipeline load. We've had tremendous success with the flavors, which have really exceeded our expectations, done very well.</p>
          <p>And I think as we look forward, we have confidence in the sustainability of this brand. It still has plenty of opportunity to grow its penetration in many of the geographies. California, for example, is less developed than the East Coast. We also see the awareness levels, which are growing, are still below where the leading ultra premium vodka brand is. And with the marketing investment, the momentum, the brand equity scores we're seeing on the brand, we feel good about sustained trajectory of growth on C&#xEE;roc in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And rest of world, we've got big ambitions for C&#xEE;roc; targeting the right people in the right outlets, top 250 nightclubs and bars. We've seen great momentum already in places like Brazil. We're starting to get footholds in capital cities in London, Paris, other European cities, and in Asia too.</p>
          <p>So big ambitions for C&#xEE;roc, doing it the right way, right people, right nightclubs, right bars; and a bit excited about it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Europe changing the operating model in the organization. I mean the very brief answer is this pretty much goes live next week. We've done an enormous amount of work over the last six months on redesigning processes, ways of working, the organization. And we are ready to go, essentially. And we've taken out the hub layer that we've had historically in Europe.</p>
          <p>As Paul said earlier, country directors, individual country directors, now will be absolutely focused on customer management. So they'll be &#x2013; have sales teams, they'll have customer marketing teams and customer service organizations, all focused on getting great service and collaborating with our biggest customers.</p>
          <p>And then we'll be able, at a West European level, to orchestrate changes in resource allocation, roll out innovations or proven growth drivers much more rapidly than we've been able to do in the past. And I think we see that as a potentially great differentiator against our competitors, the ability to roll out stuff that's worked more rapidly than anyone else.</p>
          <p>So we are ready to roll on incentives; they apply &#x2013; the line of sight element of our incentives apply to this new financial year. So it pretty much goes out of next week.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regulation, Andrew, specifically to the point in -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on excise tax. Yeah, I mean obviously, we've been hit most extremely here by Greece, where we we've had essentially an 80% increase in excise duty. And if you add to that, the fact that the consumer's been hit on personal taxation and other austerity measures, that's why we've got something of a perfect storm in what was a very sizeable and strong Greek business.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we are a potential target in West European economies where governments are looking for ways to offset the deficits. We've had some successes in persuading governments that that is the wrong route to go. But as in the case of Greece and one or two others, it's gone the other way. By and large, what we do is we pass that on to consumers, and clearly in some cases that does have an impact on consumption. And we're trying to offset that through gains in the way we structure our trading terms, increasingly.</p>
          <p>This year, you will look at us being much more selective about our discounting strategy so less depths and less frequency in many of our markets to look at ways to offset potential margin erosion from increased taxation in the P&amp;L. But it's a reality and we're having to deal with it as best we can.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of questions. Firstly in the U.S., you talked about the change in your distribution structure. Could you give us a bit more color on what you expect the benefits to be? How are these new teams going to be remunerated? Are they linked to your NSV targets? Or is there still very much a volume focus?</p>
          <p>And then on your price/mix in North America, you mentioned 3%. I'm wondering if you could split that price/mix?</p>
          <p>Then a second question on remuneration. You've set some very admirable mid-medium term targets. Could you give us some more detail, perhaps, how executive and operating management remunerations has changed? Has it moved more to a greater remuneration for success and less of a &#x2013; maybe just give us an indication that that's changed.</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, on Shui Jing Fang, when you did this transaction, you talked about a 25 million EBIT business. There's been some significant price rises in <mark type="ph" /> Beiju (86:28). I was wondering if you could give us an update on where you think the profitability of that business is now, quite some time after you originally put that number out into the market? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I talk about the compensation issue and then maybe Ivan on U.S. and then Gilbert, who is our expert on Shui Jing Fang.</p>
          <p>On compensation, we are changing our long-term compensation targets so that they will mirror the sort of guidelines that we've put out today, and that will affect our more senior people in the organization. And you will see those metrics cascading down into individual markets.</p>
          <p>The other change that we've made is that there is a higher level of reward based on direct line-of-sight performance. So rather than you being part of a hub of markets and being rewarded based on the hub's performance, there is now a greater proportion being on the market that you are accountable for.</p>
          <p>But the more fundamental issue for the leadership of this company is that in our long-term plans, the goals that we have articulated today form the framework of our long-term compensation. Ivan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Chris, on the U.S. distributor front, we have made some pretty bold and I think very exciting changes in the course of fiscal '11.</p>
          <p>Fundamentally, we will have more resources in our dedicated divisions. They're going to be focused against the strategic priorities, much more focused on the multi-cultural segments of the marketplace, the on-premise, the ability to execute innovation. And we have strong leadership teams in place with our distributor partners.</p>
          <p>To your question on volume versus value, we actually measure our distributor's performance on value terms. And that has been in place. We are actually tightening up the performance management and incentive system. But it's very much driven up value. And I think that in fact has been one of the enablers of what you see in the quality of our performance.</p>
          <p>So going into fiscal '12 and beyond, I do see our route to market being a stronger competitive advantage, and I do see the executional benefits coming through, which again kind of gives us the confidence that we will outperform the overall industry growth in value terms over the next few years.</p>
          <p>So very excited about them. They're big changes. And our distributor partners and ourselves feel very optimistic about the performance edge that it's going to deliver for us.</p>

          <p>Price/mix in at fiscal '11 &#x2013; mostly mix. I'd say three-quarters of it was mix. I think as we go into fiscal '12, you'll see more price, but we're monitoring it carefully. But most of it in fiscal '11 was mix.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And does your model work if you continue to see small volume share, as long as you grow value share? You're prepared to sit out several years until we get maybe more consolidation in the U.S. market with the growth in volume share, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think the important piece for us is the health of those brands. So if you look at Smirnoff and Captain Morgan and Cuervo and Crown Royal, for example, the big volume brands for us, we are very focused on ensuring their equity is strong.</p>
          <p>I think, Chris, also you've got to be careful, as you know. The syndicated data really covers discount heavy channels. You look at our performance in the on-premise, you look at the independent channels, that's why I do think coming &#x2013; going forward, looking at the NSV performance on these brands, I expect them to improve. You may not see it bounce back in Nielsen and IRI that quickly because we, as I said, we don't want to go back into discounting and more promotional intensity. But we've got a lot of other channels which are more profitable and where we will build our brands.</p>
          <p>So I expect volume to come back slowly, but our focus is very much on value and on making sure brand equity is strong. And I think with that, we will get the volume momentum come back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just before we hand over to Gilbert, building on Ivan's point, it would be most unwise of us to chase volume share as measured through syndicated data. That isn't where the action is. That's not good for the overall business.</p>
          <p>And even though I would concede that we have lost some volume share in the past year in the U.S., it's far less than you &#x2013; would be implied by simply looking at IRI and Nielsen. When you look at the on premise and you look at even outlets such as Walmart that, of course, isn't captured in the syndicated data, we're in far, far better shape.</p>
          <p>So to answer your question, Chris, we would not be happy with an ongoing trend of volume share loss, and we don't expect it. But equally, if all you're looking at is IRI and Nielsen, you'll get the wrong picture.</p>
          <p>Gilbert?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Chris, about your question on Shui Jing Fang, I am very optimistic about the potential for growth for this brand.</p>
          <p>I won't be able to comment on the operating margin and the operating profit specifically, because as you know Shui Jing Fang is a Chinese publicly quoted company. They are now in the closed period, as they will be reporting their results tomorrow. But I can tell you about the international sales component that we use to control over the last two years.</p>
          <p>On international sales, on Shui Jing Fang, we doubled the revenue of this business in F '11 and we quadrupled the business over the last two years. Shui Jing Fang now, in global travel for us in Asia, is the second biggest brand after Johnnie Walker in revenue and in contribution.</p>
          <p>At the same time, I'm very excited and optimistic about the innovation agenda we have in Shui Jing Fang, where we have been driving premiumization in the brand from the core <mark type="ph" /> Well Bay (93:06) brand to classic and the latest introduction of <mark type="ph" /> Jing Shui (93:10), the super premium Shui Jing Fang. And the response of the consumers was very positive. So going forward, premiumization is working with the brand. And I'm very optimistic about the potential of Shui Jing Fang in China and in international sales.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to clarify, thank you for putting out they've got the results tomorrow. Will the results they report tomorrow in sterling terms be a fair read through for how you would consolidate it? Because consensus is it's just under 50 million of operating profit. If they report that number, will &#x2013; whatever they report, is that a fair reflection of what you will then be consolidating?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on consolidation of Shui Jing Fang, our assumption is that we will consolidate as of January of 2012. And more or less, the ballpark on revenue will be around &#xA3;100 million.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We'll move to Pablo Zuanic, Liberum Capital for our next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Three questions. First, when I look at your guidance, medium-term guidance, obviously you don't want to give specific guidance for fiscal year '12, but can you point to any specific areas where actually you're seeing a slowdown related to 2011?</p>
          <p>I mean from the call, it sounds like everything's like improving or accelerating, but for example, what about Russia? We hear different things from other consumer companies, not only in drinks.</p>
          <p>The second question, in terms of the total beverage alcohol strategy, outside of Africa, how should we think of that playing out? I mean there were rumors in the press about <mark type="indiscernible" /> (94:57) but how does the company think about a more aggressive spirit/beer platform outside of Africa? Or is that the goal pretty much the way we should think about this going forward?</p>
          <p>And the last question is about China for Gilbert. Gilbert, any comments? I mean sales down 4%. Is the parallel import issue something that we want to be dealing with also in 2012?</p>
          <p>And regarding Shui Jing Fang, it's only 1% share of the premium value market, and I want to think of that in very positive terms. But I do know that it's only 1% market share. How should we think of that going forward? I mean are there significant opportunities to grow share? I mean just one point of share, obviously, would double that business. Some comments on that would help. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me maybe start with the whole TBA strategy. You know I think sometimes this gets taken out of context. We talk TBA because we are TBA; we operate in spirits, beer and wine. However, we recognize that in some markets, mainly Africa where we have the greatest scale in beer, it makes sense to leverage our distribution platform for all forms of alcohol. And indeed in Africa you've seen us develop that further with our partnership with Heineken.</p>
          <p>But we also recognize that that model cannot work in all geographies. If you look at the regulatory framework in the U.S., it's much more difficult to orchestrate that. So we are not a slave to that strategy. What we will do is look to see where we can exploit opportunities by combining our portfolio and if it makes sense, as recently it did in Africa, we will make acquisitions as we did with Serengeti Breweries. But we are driving the strategy; the strategy isn't driving us.</p>
          <p>You will always see our name linked to potential acquisitions because we have the balance sheet, we have the globality and we play, as I said, in all forms of alcohol. However, first of all, for acquisitions to make sense to us they have to be accretive to the top line. Secondly, they must create value for our shareholders. And we have been very rigorous around this, quite unwavering, and that will not change. Many people look to our balance sheet and say oh, does that mean you're going to go out and buy more things? We will only buy what makes sense for us. So often our name will get linked to things that can be very, very wide of the mark.</p>
          <p>Regarding the outlook, Deirdre, do you want to talk about how we see the world at the moment and then maybe come back to you, Gilbert, on China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean I think, and we referred to it earlier, I mean the &#x2013; we finished the year on a strong trajectory in the second half and we feel good about where we are in the first couple of months of the year. Of course any plan, if you look across a given market or a set of brands, you may find, given the competitive position, that some places and some brands are performing stronger than others. But frankly, we are expecting improved performance in every region.</p>
          <p>I think that some of the trends that were discussed earlier you may see play out in the marketplace. So for example, in some places we're seeing the value segment not performing as strongly. As the global economy continues to evolve and if we start to see weak spots, that may shift during the year. But I wouldn't point to any one particular area right now where we're seeing weakness. We think the investments that we have made both at the end of last year and through this year are delivering growth in the brands and markets where we're choosing to invest and we're getting good performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just before Gilbert comes in, we recognize that the global economy is uncertain. But I come back to the point around our breadth of geographic presence, price points within each market; that will enable us to mitigate any softness we see in a given market by exploiting growth elsewhere. And I fully recognize that by the end of fiscal '12 we will deliver against our goals but the profile may be different. We've demonstrated our ability to manage through turbulent and if anything, we're even more skilled. Gilbert?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pablo, let me start with your first question on China international spirits. Our underlying consumer performance in China on Johnnie Walker Black Label is very strong. Johnnie Walker Black Label depletions are up 13% and we gained one point of share in scotch whiskey in China. This is driven by the <mark type="ph" /> Yulu (100:03) campaign that Paul touched on during his presentation. On this campaign 70 million Chinese consumers have been exposed to our campaign, 20 million consumers engaged directly with this campaign on our digital platform, and the equity measures of Johnnie Walker are getting stronger.</p>
          <p>Most importantly in China is the strength of super deluxe scotch whiskey driven by Blue Label where our NSV on the super deluxe scotch is up 41% in F '11. So this gives us a very high level of confidence. Now as you know, our business was affected by the parallel trade driven by the strength of the renminbi. We see this easing up a little bit in F '12 and we will keep investing and working diligently to make sure that we keep strengthening Johnnie Walker brand and our whiskey portfolio in China.</p>
          <p>To give you another indication about our success in China on a brand that has no parallel imports is Baileys. Our Baileys NSV was up 21% in China in F '11 and this brand is also becoming a powerhouse for our business going forward.</p>
          <p>Now moving to your second question on Shui Jing Fang, before commenting on the market share of Shui Jing Fang let me highlight to you, Pablo, that our participation in <mark type="ph" /> Beiju (101:34) through Shui Jing Fang is a major competitive advantage for Diageo. We are the only international spirits company that participates in China in Beiju, local spirits in China and also international spirits. The way we look at Shui Jing Fang, we don't look at the one percentage share of premium spirits. We look at 4% market share in super premium spirits and this gives us plenty of opportunity to grow the brand in China and internationally.</p>
          <p>International sales can be a big opportunity for China. We are committed to build Shui Jing Fang into the big iconic Chinese global brand and we started this journey. International sales today of Shui Jing Fang represent 10% of the global sales of Shui Jing Fang, which is by far the highest ratio of any Beiju brand company. And in China, there is plenty of opportunity for us to grow Shui Jing Fang with Chinese consumers and hopefully be able to double our market share in the super premium, highly profitable super premium Beiju category over the next five years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to be very clear. The 1% market share, is it of total super premium spirits in China or is it 1% of premium Beiju in China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 1% is in the premium and super premium Beiju. We have 4% in the super premium Beiju. And this category, the super premium Beiju, is the fastest growing and the most profitable Chinese-wide spirits category in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very useful. If I may just do a follow-up. The reason I focus so much on this is that based on the numbers two years out, your Beiju business sold in China in terms of earnings would actually more &#x2013; be larger than your other businesses there. Is that &#x2013; would that be a fair assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is plenty of opportunity to accelerate the growth of our international spirits and we are also very excited about the potential of Shui Jing Fang in China and internationally.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pablo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>And our final question of the day will come from Simon Marshall-Lockyer of Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I just wanted to ask you a question about Asia Pacific and the priorities there with the business since 2006, the margins reinvesting heavily in developing the brands and the whole reach of the business in that part of the world. And you'll still around what, 800 basis points below where you were in terms of margins. Should we assume going forward that the priority remains with reinvesting and expanding the brands rather than raising the profitability back to levels that you enjoyed in the middle of the last decade? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is yesterday you might have seen that Heineken was making comments about poor developments in Europe and their guidance in respect to weather conditions and other difficulties in Eastern Europe. Could you comment, particularly on the Eastern European portion, as to what you're expecting there, just from really a trade and commercial perspective in the current environment with your portfolio? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I'm also aware that we didn't answer the previous question on Russia, so I'll ask Andrew to comment on that.</p>
          <p>I want to talk today about our results, not other people's; but what I would say is that we have a relatively low presence in Eastern Europe. We have some presence and the business is fine. I think the spirits category is less impacted due to weather. You very seldom, if ever, have heard us reference weather in our results presentation. And I also believe that when you look at Southern Europe, we took the hit probably earlier than most because of the impact of distributors in our business and their inability to pay and their desire to bring down their inventories very, very quickly. So I think we were kind of early to that.</p>
          <p>But specifically, Andrew, if you'd speak to Russia, Eastern Europe; and then maybe Gilbert on Asia Pacific.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, Paul, the only other point on Western Europe I think is that we've managed to maintain our A&amp;P spend in the more attractive markets. So if you take Greece and Spain out over this last year, we've actually increased our A&amp;P by 8% and that's driven 6% growth in sales. So it's very polarized where we've actually cut back on our marketing investment and I like to think we've continued to fund the brand growth in the more attractive markets in Europe.</p>
          <p>I mean coming to Eastern Europe and Russia, I think we're benefiting from a participation strategy that's working very well for us in Russia and Poland in particular. The less attractive category at the moment in Russia and Poland is vodka in our industry; and the highly attractive category for us in both of those markets is scotch. And we're increasingly playing a portfolio, a complete category play at lots of different price points, bringing consumers into the category at the lower end and then trailing them up into the more premium marks as they &#x2013; as wealth increases in those two markets.</p>
          <p>So Russia we were up 21% in the last year. I would say it's not slowing down for us. We've got a fantastic innovation pipeline for Russia as well which is very tailored to the Russian market. This is one of the characteristics of the new operating model is that we have the resources and the expertise in each of these big emerging markets to deliver against local consumers' needs. So alongside our scotch portfolio play, which is international brands broadly, we're bringing stuff in that's very much more Russian. So I think we're probably doing well as a result of focusing on imports and scotch rather than cheaper vodka brands, which are a more difficult territory in both Russian and Poland.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Simon. Simon, let me deal with your question in two buckets. You know the first one I will talk about our strategy for Asia Pacific and second I will touch on the operating margin improvement.</p>
          <p>Let me start with Asia-Pacific. Asia-Pacific, we are committed to grow our business, double digit, top and bottom line as of F '12 onwards. And we have a very good success track record in Scotch Whiskey. Scotch Whiskey, as you know Simon, is the biggest category in spirits, in international spirits, in Asia Pacific; almost 50% of total revenue in the category. This is category that we know very well. In F '11 we have gained market share in every single market in Scotch Whiskey across Asia Pacific and also most importantly, we outperformed the category by 1.5 times. We grew our Scotch Whiskey revenue in Asia Pacific in F '11 by 12% while the category was up 7%. And most importantly, also, we are winning in super deluxe Scotch Whiskey where our super deluxe Scotch Whiskey brands performed plus 31% in NSV.</p>
          <p>Now turning into operating margin, operating &#x2013; as you know, our gross margin in Asia Pacific is four points ahead of the Diageo average. Hence, our focus on &#x2013; is on improving operating margin year-on-year. In F '10, we have improved our operating margin by 70 basis points. In F '11 we have improved our operating margin by 60 basis points; and going forward we are committed into steadily growing our operating margin in Asia Pacific by double-digits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So very clear, we want growth in Asia but we're also paying very close attention to our margin structure as well.</p>
