      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nathalie. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our Q1 call. It's not long ago that I talked to a lot of you in our March call and subsequent roadshow and I think, everything I can report to you today is well on track with what I told you then.</p>
          <p>As we close this quarter, we believe the principal characteristics of EADS at the moment, are its stability, coupled with its positive alignment with the growth trend in global commercial aerospace. In Q1, we see a continuation of the factors we noted in our year-end review and guidance. The overall aerospace market driven by continued passenger growth, continues to support demand for our products. The global economy, whilst still in a mixed-recovery mode with pressures in North Africa and Japan and mounting oil price and currency volatility, this global economy is driving both leisure and business traffic. Therefore, we continue to experience product demand.</p>
          <p>Based on this positive momentum, Airbus is analyzing a further increase in its Single Aisle production rate, which is currently scheduled to increase to 40 aircraft per month by Q1 2012. A decision is expected shortly.</p>
          <p>The 332 new orders and commitments have proved this product is the right choice, at the right time, in an environment of increasing oil prices. Given that we have healthy product demand, a significant focus continues to be to deliver on improved profitability with a cost-management processes established under Power8 and Power8+. A400M agreement and development progress has been confirmed.</p>
          <p>A380 internal production processes are improving as scheduled. Vertical milestones have to be reached on the &#x2013; or have been reached on the A350, with difficulties to be overcome in the coming years to manage this risky program.</p>
          <p>On the defense side, the picture is more difficult with budgets under pressure. To adapt itself to a new global environment, Cassidian is preparing a transformation initiative, the magnitude of which is still dependent on final decisions on the German government budget reform. Overall, EADS is on track to improve its underlying profitability.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the specific financial highlights on Page 5. 2011 has started with revenue growth of 10%, despite the usual seasonality pattern in our institutional business. The growth is driven primarily by mix effects at Airbus Commercial and Astrium. Deliveries remain at a high level. Defense revenues are in line with the 2010 level.</p>
          <p>The EBIT before one-off, stands at around &#x20AC;230 million for EADS and around &#x20AC;170 million for Airbus Commercial. It increases in all divisions except Cassidian. The increase compared to last year is mainly driven by a favorable mix price improvement and favorable cost phasing at Airbus Commercial, which more than compensates hedge rates deterioration and higher R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>Order intake of &#x20AC;6.3 billion was below the 2010 level, which included a high level of commercial aircraft orders for the A330 and A350 XWB at Airbus. The 2011 order intake is net of 68 commercial aircraft cancellations and conversions.</p>
          <p>Our order book of more than &#x20AC;422 billion provides a solid platform for further growth. The Airbus Commercial backlog has been reduced by a negative revaluation impact of around &#x20AC;22 billion, due to the deterioration of the U.S. dollar closing spot rate since the year-end 2010.</p>
          <p>On Slide 6, we can look at the underlying performance development of the business. The EBIT before one-off margin is around, or is at 2.3% at group level. It benefited from good performance in Airbus legacy programs, as well as in core business activities in the other divisions. It also included a favorable phasing of costs at Airbus Commercial which should reverse throughout the year. The A380 continues to weigh on the underlying performance by roughly the same amount as last year.</p>
          <p>This quarter, the dollar mismatch and balance sheet revaluation had a negative impact on our EBIT result of around &#x20AC;40 billion.</p>
          <p>Now up to Slide 7. R&amp;D increased compared to last year, driven mainly by development on the A350 XWB at Airbus. The interest result is roughly stable with the 2010 level. This line includes interest related to refundable launch investments.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the other financial result deteriorated significantly by &#x20AC;280 million year-on-year. The main change comes from the negative revaluation of U.S. dollar and British pound cash assets, due to the deterioration of the closing spot rate at the end of March, compared to the end of December 2010.</p>
          <p>Last year, the revaluation had a positive impact, thanks to the strengthening of the dollar in Q1 2010, while this &#x20AC;0.08 deterioration in Q1 2011 triggered a significantly negative impact. In addition, the change in time value has triggered a negative revaluation of our options. This line also includes the unwinding of discounted provisions. The tax rate for the year 2011 is expected to be at 30%.</p>
          <p>Onto the hedging portfolio now on Slide 8. Since the beginning of the year, we have implemented $5.1 billion of new hedge contracts at an average rate of $135 per euro, without collateralization. During the same period, $4.2 billion of forward contracts matured at an average rate of $137 per euro. We have therefore managed to replace maturing hedges with new forward contracts at a slightly more favorable rate. Our hedge book increased from $70.2 billion at the end of 2010 to $71.1 billion at the end of March 2011. The recent deterioration of the U.S. dollar is partly mitigated by the evolution of the interest rates, that has favorable effect on forward curves.</p>
          <p>However, to protect flexibility and hedging capacity with banks in a volatile foreign exchange market, we want to limit the size of our forward portfolio to the current level and further diversify our portfolio with FX options. As our net exposure is hedged for 2011 and 2012, we are slowing the speed of our hedging activity. Due to the weakening U.S. dollar environment, we have implemented around $300 million worth of collars. Our collar options this quarter, maturing in 2013.</p>
          <p>At the end of March, the mark-to-market of our hedge portfolio was positive at around &#x20AC;700 million before tax, compared to a negative &#x20AC;1.9 billion at the end of December. This movement is driven by the evolution of the closing spot rate from $134 per euro in December, 2010 to $142 per euro for March, 2011.</p>
          <p>Up to the cash flow slide now, Page 9. Free cash flow for the quarter is positive at &#x20AC;309 million. Gross cash flow from operations reflects the improvement in operational performance, compared to 2010 the improvement is driven by the working capital, a higher level of customer advances received and a reduction in trade receivables is partially reduced by a ramp-up in deliveries, particularly at Airbus.</p>
          <p>Customer financing generated cash of around &#x20AC;100 million in the quarter as the lessor and banking market appetite continues to be active. The level of capital expenditure increased slightly compared to last year as expected, as investment continues to ramp-up on the A350 XWB program.</p>
          <p>I would also like to add that the board has decided on a pension asset contribution of &#x20AC;300 million in April, which will be deducted from our net cash position in H1, so in the first half.</p>
          <p>Now I will walk you through the performance by division in more detail. And as usual, we start with Airbus on Slide 11. Airbus booked 69 gross commercial orders this quarter, including 10 A380s, 68 cancellations were registered in the same period. 119 aircraft were delivered in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The commercial backlog stands at 3,434 aircraft, providing significant volume uplift in the mid-term across the product range. Early market success for the A320neo continues with commitments in excess of 330 aircraft only four months after launch. Entry-into-service has been advanced from 2016 to October 2015. As usual, commercial momentum is building prior to Le Bourget.</p>
          <p>Progress also continues on the A350 XWB, with its largest carbon fiber fuselage panel completed. The start of the Final Assembly Line is still targeted for the end of the year and the entry-into-service for the second half of 2013, but the program remains challenging. Together with local partners a new manufacturing center was inaugurated in Harbin, China to produce composite parts for the A350.</p>
          <p>In its Military segment, Airbus delivered three C295 aircraft to Mexico, Chile and Portugal. One new CN235 was booked for the Yemen resulting in a Military backlog of 239 aircraft.</p>
          <p>The A400M contract amendment was signed in early April. The program has entered into series production and the flight test program continues. The first A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport aircraft for the Royal Saudi Air Force successfully completed its maiden flight in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Up to Slide 12, where we have a closer look at the segment numbers. Compared to a year ago, Airbus Commercial revenues benefited from a favorable mix effect. Airbus Commercial EBIT before one-off, benefited from favorable mix effect and pricing improvement net of escalation.</p>
          <p>The underlying performance also includes favorable phasing effects, particularly non-series costs that should unwind as the year progresses. The improvement year-on-year is partially reduced by a hedge rate deterioration of around &#x20AC;110 million and higher R&amp;D expenses, particularly on the A350 XWB.</p>
          <p>At Airbus Military, revenue growth of 13% is driven by A400M revenue recognition of &#x20AC;165 million, reduced by lower volume on Medium and Light and Tankers. No A400M revenues were booked in Q1 2010.</p>
          <p>Airbus Military EBIT remains stable compared to Q1 2010. A favorable cost saving offset higher R&amp;D on basic technologies, transport and mission systems and boom.</p>
          <p>Up to the Eurocopter slide now, Page 13. The Q1 2011 net order trend has improved compared to Q1 2010 with 99 new net bookings this year. Gross orders were stable but cancellations were lower, particularly in the U.S., indicating the first signs of a recovery, in particular in the U.S. civil market, Eurocopter received contracts and commitments for 68 helicopters at the 2011 HeliExpo, including 15 EC175 with Russian operator, UTAir.</p>
          <p>In addition, a range of new and enhanced helicopter products were unveiled, including the new generation of the EC145, as well as a comprehensive evolution of the product line with new enhanced versions of four of Eurocopters light, medium and heavy helicopters.</p>
          <p>The revenues and EBIT increases compared to year ago are due to a favorable mix effect. The ramp-up of R&amp;D expenses will back loaded in 2011. Significant steps were made to expand international services in the quarter, with the agreement to acquire the Canadian Vector Aerospace Corporation, a leading global provider of MRO services for multi-platform helicopters and aircraft and helicopter engines. Final closing is subject to some pending regulatory approvals and acquiring the necessary shares to meet the legal threshold.</p>
          <p>If we move onto Astrium on Slide 14. Astrium saw a strong start into the year, driven by solid operational performance. Revenues and EBIT increased by 27% year-on-year. The revenue improvement is due to higher volume in launches, earth observation and telecommunication satellites. The EBIT increase was reduced by lower volume in geo-information services business which is experiencing a slowdown in the current business environment.</p>
          <p>Astrium continues to work on its transformation program, AGILE, to increase efficiency and prepare for a challenging competitive environment. The implementation of AGILE will trigger some non-recurring costs and higher R&amp;D in the next quarters. During the quarter, Astrium successfully launched the Automated Transfer Vehicle, ATV, called Johannes Kepler, also making the 42nd successful Ariane 5 launch. The ATV built for Astrium performed a perfect automatic dock-on maneuver with the International Space Station.</p>
          <p>Order intake included two export contracts this quarter, an earth observation satellite for Vietnam and the contract to equip Kazakhstan's Satellite Integration and Test Centre.</p>
          <p>If we move onto Cassidian on Slide 15. As you are already aware, Cassidian is beginning to feel the first pressure from the home country defense budget situation, both in terms of delayed order intake and R&amp;D that remains at a high level. The German government has postponed communication on its reform plans until later in the year. Meanwhile, Cassidian continues to prepare its transformation program and develop its strategy of global growth, particularly in security. This quarter, Cassidian and Atlas Elektronik announced the foundation of Signalis, the world's leading provider of maritime safety and security solutions.</p>
          <p>On top of the user seasonality effect, Cassidian revenues reflect an unfavorable phasing of Eurofighter volume, as well as lower volume in Secure Communication Solutions. R&amp;D expenses are focused mainly on Unmanned Aerial Systems and Secure Communication. Order intake for the quarter of around &#x20AC;800 million included a contract for EMIRAJE Systems, a joint venture between Cassidian and C4 Advanced Solutions, for the first phase of the United Arab Emirates Command and Control System. Meanwhile, the Eurofighter Campaign continues in India.</p>
          <p>Lastly Other Businesses on Slide 16. Revenues were stable with the 2010 level as a ramp-up in the LUH deliveries compared to last year and a higher revenue in Sogerma offset lower ATR deliveries. EBIT for the quarter reflected the lower ATR deliveries, which were in line with expectations, mitigated by the recovery in the jet engine MRO business at Sogerma.</p>
          <p>With 25 net aircraft orders already received compared to eight in Q1 2010 and continued strong commercial momentum, ATR marked a promising start into the year. Deliveries are back-loaded with only six aircraft deliveries in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The backlog for Other Businesses now stands at &#x20AC;2.6 billion. Order intake this quarter of almost &#x20AC;400 million reflects a strong demand for ATR aircraft in the high-fuel price environment. Sogerma's backlog has benefited from the increase in Airbus and ATR production rates. EADS North America received a contract from Lockheed Martin to supply its TRS-3D radar for the U.S. Navy's Littoral Combat Ships.</p>
          <p>Now, I will comment on our guidance on Slide 18. We confirm the guidance given in March to you based on an assumption of &#x20AC;1 equals $1.35 for the year-end closing spot rate. In 2011, Airbus should deliver 520 to 530 commercial aircraft and its gross orders should be above its deliveries. EADS 2011 revenues should be above the 2010 level.</p>
          <p>EADS expects 2011 EADS EBIT before one-off to remain stable, compared to 2010 level, at around &#x20AC;1.3 billion. Increasing volume and price improvement at Airbus Commercial are roughly compensated by the deterioration of hedge rates, increasing R&amp;D and less favorable mix of activities at Cassidian.</p>
          <p>Going forward, reported EBIT and EPS performance of EADS will be dependent on the group's ability to execute on the big programs, A400M, A380, A350 XWB, in line with commitments made to its customers. Reported EBIT and EPS also depend on exchange rate fluctuations.</p>
          <p>At &#x20AC;1equals $1.35, EADS expects 2011 EPS to be above the 2010 level of &#x20AC;0.68 a share.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow is expected to be positive, all the more after a Q1 that was better than expected. In 2012, the group expects a significant improvement in its EBIT before one-off, thanks to higher volume, better pricing and improvement of A380 performance at Airbus.</p>
          <p>And now, I will take your questions.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>We now start our Q&amp;A time. You introduce yourself and your company when asking the questions. Please limit yourself to two questions at a time. So, as usual, please remember to speak clearly and slowly to help all participants, particularly elsewhere, understand what you are asking. So, Simone, please go ahead and explain the procedures to the participants.</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Rupinder Vig of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, everybody. Morning, Hans Peter. I've got two questions please. First, just around the Single Aisle production increase. Can you just perhaps give us a bit more detail as to what is the sticking point here, in terms of making an announcement? Is there a particular issue with a particular member of the supply chain? Or what's holding up the decision here? Because it's something you've talked about for some time now?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just around customer financing. Obviously, there was a very good outcome in the first quarter, what's the outlook for the rest of the year? Is there a number you can give us in terms of what the full year should look like? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Rupi, thank you for your questions. First of all, on Single Aisle, as you rightly say, we were struggling with that question for some time and that's based on the strong backlog. The overbooking and the commercial momentum we still see for the years 2013, 2014, 2015. So, we struggled with the question of supply chain and we are maturing on that topic, finally we think. So, we'll see likely an announcement in probably a few days. We feel more comfortable to make a first step. We have not yet said what the step will be. So, this is the last remaining question. But it is all driven by demand obviously, and I've got a question, do we have and can we have the supply chain under control and manage the supply chain? So, that's &#x2013; the day we are converging and in so far, we see more comfortable now to announce something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And perhaps, Hans Peter, just a follow-up. Has there been a particular part of the supply chain that's been the issue there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not particular, we &#x2013; it was across, I would say, a lot of different system suppliers, aerostructures, particularly aerostructure suppliers, et cetera, where we were looking at. We had to fix some quality issues which are there so &#x2013; with suppliers. So all of this I would say, was now converging in the last two to three months to something where we can take a decision now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on customer financing, Rupi, indeed, the first quarter was very positive I would say. I would at this point, not expect significant customer financing commitments for the year. There is always some level of volatility, but we wouldn't expect now based on experience of the last two years, that there is a big activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rupi. Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from David Perry of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning, Nathalie, Hans Peter. Two questions, please. One, can you just clarify this higher production rates on the A320? What exactly it is you're considering? Is it one for several years out? Or is it one that could come through more quickly? Are we talking 2012, 2013?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, just on your comment on the A350, remaining challenging. Could you just give us some color around that? Incrementally, are you more or less confident than you were say, at the beginning of the year? Are there any tangible piece of evidence or data you can give us to &#x2013; to let us know where the program is? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question on A320 and I think the background of your question, David, was to understand when you might see the increase and the step? That is, I would say something obviously, which we'll discuss or we'll release shortly, but it clearly requires additional time. So currently, we are at rate 40 in the Q1 2012. And from today's expectations for another step, I would today, but this is &#x2013; has to be confirmed. Expect that it is taking probably around another year or close to another year.</p>
          <p>On A350, as we see, we are progressing along the time line, I would say. Problems are being solved and at the same time obviously, issues remain and have to be solved. As you know, buffers are in &#x2013; very, very little and literally, no longer existing.</p>
          <p>The manufacturing of the big components progresses quite well. We have not discovered any showstoppers so far and I've personally seen it in one of the factories with one of these huge fuselage panels, which they have produced. We start with assemblies now obviously, and we will learn now in the next steps where it really becomes tangible, whether everything is in place and everything is working. And as we are maturing on the production in the assemblies, we will get a more mature assessment of the time line certainly in the second half this year.</p>
          <p>So, in other words, pressure remains and that really I would say, on the time line since it's now really visible in the factories, it's certainly building up and we have to manage that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you &#x2013; what would you say is the balance of risk? Is it 50/50? You have to announce another delay? Or do you think it's less, much less chance than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll not give you any probability here, David, so &#x2013; we are heavily obviously, as a management, and particularly in Airbus, concentrating on delivering on the time scale and we are keeping the teams under pressure. So, that's I think, our job and we are not speculating about probabilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on the production rates, you normally go up in increments of two, is that what you're thinking? Or are you thinking something more aggressive than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've talked about the two next steps which are 42, 44. You will have to wait for a few days, that is the last final I think, decision step which is necessary, but 44 is quite a big stretch I would say, from today's point of view.</p>

          <p>Morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two question. The first on the cost side and the second one on cash. First on the cost side, Hans Peter, can you tell us how big the positive impact was from the non-series cost saving this quarter? And do you think we saw any net cost savings in Q1?</p>
          <p>And, then the second on cash. Of the &#x20AC;1.2 billion in working capital improvement, how much do you think of that can be retained as the year progresses? Or can you &#x2013; do you think you can even further improve in the next three quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cost side and the impact of non-series impact in the first quarter, it's in excess of &#x20AC;100 million positive, which currently we would expect that is reversed in the remaining part of the year.</p>
          <p>On net cost savings, I don't have a specific figure for you, clearly, if you look to the underlying performance development, we were at least able to compensate probably for cost increases and inflation. So, that seems to work well. And we have some progress on the pricing side. So, I think this seems to be well under control.</p>
          <p>On working capital, we have currently a situation where pre-delivery payments have made a nice step, particularly outside Airbus, in the first quarter of this year. I would not see that this is probably further improving. So, that's tough in the current environment certainly. At the same time, obviously on PDPs, where Airbus also increased in dollar terms, it will be depend certainly to some extent, on the performance we see now in the remaining part of the year, commercial performance. So, that means Le Bourget will be an important milestone and there I think, we might see hopefully, some inflows probably above what we've seen last year in Airbus.</p>
          <p>At the same time, if we go to inventories. We have seen some increase in the first quarter and as we move into and as we are on track with capacity increases, so the increase of the production rate on Single Aisle and long range, you should and we should expect, probably some additional inventory for the year. So in so far, that should be also under control but obviously with some increase.</p>
          <p>So, that means on the cash side, if I compare it to two months ago, it's too early to give you a figure today but I would say, I feel more comfortable than I felt two months ago that it will be a positive &#x2013; a nice positive number.</p>

          <p>Next question is from Celine Fornaro of Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Hans Peter. Good morning, Nathalie. Two questions, if I may. The first one would be on the pricing, if you could give us an update on the pricing of the new orders and also on the deliveries and how this does pan out over the next 12 months?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the A380, if we could have a guidance on the deliveries that you plan for this year and how this should impact the performance or division installment in '11 and '12, if there is any change on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let's get started the second question, A380. We don't expect an impact on the underlying performance this year coming from A380 compared to the previous year. So that has not changed. And it is not that much dependant on few more or less deliveries because, as you know, I mean the program is in a situation where it is negative and we are covered to some extent as a provision.</p>
          <p>So that is not changing. But if we go to the deliveries itself, the situation is such that we still expect to be in the mid-20s, so at least above 20 with all the things we have seen recently. so we are recovering from the engine incident end of last year and, Rolls-Royce, particularly is heavily working on compensating for the earthquake impact which we have in Japan.</p>
          <p>It seems, for the time being, this is somewhat under control, so at least we get no alarming messages here. And that, I would say, leads us to the conclusion that the deliveries will be above 20 and probably in the mid-20s. So that is the current status; needs to be closely followed.</p>
          <p>I mean, on A380, the problem is on the engine side; that seems we are still in the ramp-up mode. We don't have a lot of spares engine in the system. This is different on the other programs like Single Aisle, where we also have some impacts coming from Japan, but where we are feeling probably more comfortable because obviously it's a much bigger size and it, obviously, can be managed smoother.</p>
          <p>On pricing and deliveries, pricing, I understand, for order intake, no change. We are delivering along our plans. We have not seen a deterioration despite the fact that I read from time to time that this is different. So we feel comfortable with the pricing levels. We'll see in Le Bourget how it works out. This is not yet closed. Some of the deal negotiations are ongoing. So obviously we'll follow up on that subject probably latest in the half year.</p>
          <p>But for the time being, we are well within the plan and well within the business case particularly on the A320neo. So I think nothing new I could report here. On deliveries, we said it, 520 to 530 deliveries, so no change.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pricing on deliveries is further improving this year, certainly, probably at a similar level we've seen last year. So no, as well here, no big change because that is and was in the backlog. So it's probably a number of around $200 million for the year.</p>

          <p>Next question is from Ben Fidler of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Two questions. Firstly, on A380, I understand the losses are unchanged, largely presumably because of lower provision release. But I wondered if you're able to share with us what sort of the operational KPI improvements may be on that program today in terms of things like out-of-sequence work, excess work is in Toulouse, design query changes; whether you can give us an update in terms of where those operational KPIs are moving on the program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question was just coming back to that non-series production cost at Airbus. But is it just a phasing issue? Or put another way, what gives you the confidence that those costs will be increasing in later quarters or is it just a case that Airbus might actually, in its budget, be overestimating the level of those costs for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let's start with the first one. Operational, I would say development of the A380 program, I mean, what I said, we are well on track with the A380. The outstanding work is decreasing and these are the level which is manageable now, so no news from there on the performance of the aircraft in service.</p>
          <p>We can see real good trend on the reliability. So the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:59) reliability has improved over the last month and, for the first time, we are crossing the initial hurdle for introduction into service of 98% in recent months. So that is very good and confirms the good introduction into service. We are getting very good feedback from airlines. I would not name them now, but some of the airline CEO said, it is probably one of the best, if not the best, entry into service of a new aircraft program.</p>
          <p>So we have invested a lot into this particular topic because we think it is crucial that customers are satisfied with the performance in service. And that is, by the way, also driving the so called non-series cost to some extent, so continuous support is one of the cost elements in here. And then, so far, I think it was a good investment.</p>
          <p>And then the teams, also, in the engineering are still working on improvements coming from in-service issues which need to be fixed; nothing which is a concern but rather continuous improvement and I would say, maturing, further maturing the airplane and the quality. So that's, I think, what I can say here.</p>
          <p>On the phasing issue, we have some cost elements which are very I would say, let me say, volatile in terms of spending. One of them is, for example, the IT costs or what we spend for IT tools. It's just one example where you are depending a lot on suppliers and a lot on invoicing. So in so far, this is the current assessment that in the remaining part of the year there will be a pick-up in these, so called, non-series costs. It's a myriad of different cost elements. It's internal projects. It's IT. It's customer services. It's continuous support; all of these cost categories.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe also, just to help me understand, what is this kind of annual scale of those costs, just to put the $100 million lower than expected upcoming Q1 in the context of roughly the full year number is?</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:42) good questions have been asked. Just one on AGILE and Astrium, it sounds as though you're having a good look, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:51) Cassidian as well. Are you able to quantify how much restructuring cost we might see turn up late in the year as, I guess what would be, one-off charges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Avi. I think, particularly on the Cassidian side, this is a question for the remaining part of the year. On AGILE first, on space, this is a, let me say, more mature program than the Cassidian program because Astrium started earlier. We are envisioning costs savings of, say, around or in excess of $400 million with reduction of head count of own positions and of subcontractors, probably around 1,000 each. That was communicated and is discussed and under discussion with all the stakeholders here involved.</p>
          <p>On Astrium, I'm not sure whether we booked &#x2013; I think we've not yet booked the provisions for the head count reduction because of, I would say, the hurdles we have to cross under IFRS. So we have to be mature to the extent that we exactly know where it is and how we are doing it. So that is still outstanding.</p>
          <p>And on the Cassidian side, it's similar. It's not as advanced as on the space side. We have about 900 head count reductions which they have planned so far. It's probably not yet finally mature, and it certainly will also depend on the further development of the budget situation and 300 of which will be hired. So there is a shift in the qualification and it's in the context of the globalization strategy of Cassidian. So net, it's probably around 600, and it's the same as in Astrium. We are not yet mature enough and concrete enough with the social plans and with the social discussions. This, in Cassidian, will certainly take until the second half of the year. I would expect today, I think in both cases we should expect something like double-digit numbers, but I cannot give you more details today.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one real issue. How will the A350 affect working capital as we go through the year? I mean, I know we don't start final assembly until we got it all right, but my impression, still, is that we would have more stuff coming down the pipeline and that might affect how your working capital and cash flow goes. I know it's a slightly ignorant question, but could you just help me out a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't think that it is an ignorant question, honestly. Clearly, on the A350 and, I just have to look into my numbers here, we will see now progressively some, I would say, inventory being built up because we are, as I said before, we are producing parts and obviously this will go into inventories.</p>
          <p>In terms of the numbers, they are not yet, I would say, very material this year. So it will build up only in the year 2012, yeah, and 2013 probably. But I couldn't give you, now, more precise numbers, Sandy,  but I don't think in '11 it is a big question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So just to double check, it goes into inventory at some sort of value, perhaps some cost is expensed as R&amp;D, but it's not acting as a drag on EBIT before R&amp;D? Is that a fair way of looking at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean we have to distinguish &#x2013; first of all we have development airplanes which are, if I'm right, capitalized and then depreciated under the R&amp;D line. And then we have the production airplanes which, obviously, which have their costs according to the learning curve. So we are expensing &#x2013; in theory there are no expense costs for the series production aircraft other than if, we would have a certain level of inefficiencies of what we have seen on the A380. This is not something which is yet a topic in 2011 because we are very early in the whole production process. But it will be a topic to be discussed now for the next years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have two questions as well please. Just wanted clarification on the A380 for 2012. I think you suggested that it should see quite a big reduction, i.e., that's why the EBIT is going to be much better. Just wondered if you could give us some indication on that. That would be very helpful.</p>
          <p>And then the second question, I apologize for going into a bit detail here, but I do note that the selling and admin costs were up 10% or more than 10% in Q1. Was there something specific in there, or is this just general inflation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is not only general inflation. There was some reclassification between SG&amp;A and cost of sales, to some extent, so a more precise allocation.</p>
          <p>And second, we have some impact coming from the perimeter, particularly in Eurocopter, we have included some subsidiaries in the consolidation perimeter and then it is coming from selling, so from sales and marketing costs where we have seen some increase. So it's not really inflation or escalation behind that. It's either driven by sales <mark type="ph" /> constraints (50:09) or, I would say, by the perimeter of the cost.</p>
          <p>On A380, I'm afraid I will not give you a number, if that was your question. Clearly, I mean, we have to make the big improvement steps between 2012 and 2014 in order to achieve the breakeven and we know how much roughly has to be recovered, and there is a first big step certainly in 2012 already.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess you know how much has to recover. Do you willing to share that with us?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could I please ask a supplementary on the order side in Airbus? Sixty-eight cancellations in Q1; it seems like a little bit of big number at a time when, I guess, things would be going the other way. So could you just give us a little bit more on that in terms of the one, two, three customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's driven mainly by two customers, one of them, I don't have, now, the exact numbers in mind, but I will get them. One of them is DAE Capital, so Dubai, the big leasing vehicle which should have been built in Dubai where we received a cancellation of about 30 orders, 30 aircraft, and the second big one is Jazeera also a Middle East Carrier, also being in difficulties. These are the two big ones and then there is one other one which is not as big as these is Flyington. It's a freighter company, I think, coming from India with the same problem. So more or less, it's coming from these are the leasing segment where we know where it comes from in Dubai and from airlines being in trouble.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, one other thing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:04) have been arguing about is your overdependence on the Middle East in terms of the order book. Should be worry about this given these two customers are Middle East ones, or are they are just special situations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, currently, I mean, looking at the very recent release of Emirates, from the last few days, it has demonstrated the capability. So they are delivering very good results. Currently, it seems with a lot of our airplanes, by the way, and so far I think the real question is obviously it's a political one. The question is this region politically stable or not for the next years? The current, I would say, view, I think, is that the answer is, yes. In the major, I would say, in the countries where we have the major exposure, at least, we would think that there shouldn't be a big screw up in the next months.</p>
          <p>We have, if you go to the exposure numbers, we have roughly 13% of the revenues in the Middle East and North African region. And we have a backlog exposure in terms of number of airplanes, which is around the same. But, obviously, in value terms, it's much bigger, because there are a lot of big aircraft which are behind. And so far, this region is certainly a crucial region for us, and we obviously have a big interest that's the stability we've seen in the past, at least in the crucial countries, continues.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Doug. You are in New York?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's a very early morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Not as bad as some quarters, though, so. I'm interested on currency. And you're using a 1.35 euro, and we're clearly well above that right now. And as you look forward, if we see rates stay up in this year, are you thinking any differently on your approach to pricing location of operations, cost reduction plans, if we end up up in the $1.45 level. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Then the second one, on the A320, when you look at the neo coming in, can you comment on how you're thinking with respect to rate increases in terms of pricing, in terms of customers potentially switching between the traditionally 320 and the neo, how that's playing out in the, say, 2014, 2015 timeframe with respect to deliveries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, the last one is a difficult question, Doug, because we'll have, I think, to wait a bit until we see the final market reaction to that. Currently, it seems to be pretty stable. We have sold aircraft or we have commitments from airlines and, in most of the contract discussions and commitments we've got, we are selling both the standard version and the neo and we are about to fill the gap between, I would say, the probably rundown of the standard and the early deliveries and the first deliveries on the neo. So there is not much left in that timeframe. So it seems to play out pretty well.</p>
          <p>Now to understand what it means in terms of, probably, switching back and forth, it's very difficult to say. It, obviously, will be at the start of the neo production. It will be limited by capacity and ramp-up, so we are not free, I think, from the operational side to do what is probably desired and in so far it's very difficult to judge today.</p>
          <p>If I look at the difficultly around the dollar, I think your question was a little bit would we have a difficult look on the deal assessments? The answer is currently, no. We have, in Airbus, we have a cautious view on the dollar when it comes to deal assessments. So we don't have to change at this point.</p>
          <p>All the rest is what you address in terms of footprint, et cetera, is addressed under the current programs. And as long as dollar, I think, would not materially deviate from the levels we see currently between $1.40, $1.45, I don't think there will be any near-term additional, I would say, action required.</p>
          <p>So we certainly have to be vigilant on the dollar as I would see it today. I think in Europe we have our own difficulties and it's difficult for me to understand why the dollar should be so strong. But this is a personal view and not something where we base our hedges and our dollar strategy on. But at least I think we need to wait for a bit and for the time being, in a nutshell, I don't think there is need for action.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But then on the neo, when you look at some of your larger customers in terms of backlog who have today's version of the A320 in backlog for delivery out in the 2014, '15 timeframe, are you seeing any pushback from them in terms of a desire to open up the order book, a desire to move out and, instead, take neos at a later point in time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we've not seen that, Doug, and, as I said before, rather the opposite. Because of capacity needs, we currently see that they are still ordering standards and, by the way, standards will have the ringlets before the new engine, so the ringlet will be on the airplane in 2013 already. So you already get a certain step before and ,so far, we've not seen pressure on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Last question comes from Harry Breach of Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Hans Peter.  Good morning, Nathalie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can ask two. Firstly, earlier you touched on the Japanese earthquake and the impact on the engine suppliers, particularly Rolls. Are you seeing or is Airbus seeing any other impact on any other aspect of its supply chain from Japan?</p>
          <p>And secondly, the cancellations in first quarter at Airbus that were mentioned, the 68, am I right in thinking that the forfeiture of pre-delivery payments will be run through EBIT and, if so, how much was it in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you repeat the second one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, yeah, when you receive a cancellation at Airbus, the customer normally forfeits the PDP; the PDP's paid. Do those get run through the P&amp;L, and how much was that amount in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That runs through the P&amp;L. I couldn't tell you a number, obviously, but, if there would be &#x2013; I don't think there was a material EBIT impact coming from that topic in Q1 because, on all of those things, you only would run it through P&amp;L when you are absolutely sure that everything is settled and closed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So could it come later, then, maybe in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't exclude it, but, if the answer would be, yes, I don't think it's any big amount.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question was related to cash flow, Harry, or to EBIT?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's to EBIT on the PDP question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the Japanese earthquake?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to be sure that I don't tell you something wrong on this cancellation stories, I mean, you asked a question with the assumption that if there are cancellations, the related PDPs are more or less released, repaid or whatever, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, exactly. So, for example, if I cancel and if the wide body for delivery may be next year, it could be a large balance of PDPs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, which is sitting in our balance sheet, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but presumably when the cancellation is finalized and it's legally effective, presumably you recognize those PDPs as revenue or other operating income or I'm probably completely wrong. Maybe I'll follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to give you a wrong answer. I mean I have to check that, Harry. Normally if we keep the PDPs, obviously, at a certain point in time we will see them through the EBIT line. But don't expect something material this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The Japanese earthquake part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the Japanese earthquake part, yes, I mean, there are some second, third and, I don't know, fifth-tier suppliers, probably, in the supply chain. To be honest, it's not easy to find out, even today, whether it should or not have an impact. So far, we expect that it is managed. There are some chip producers which are affected. We have something in Eurocopter in the second and third-tier suppliers of Kawasaki on the helicopter side which are affected.</p>
          <p>But I would say people are rather inventive on how to deal with this and how to manage this impact, particularly also through spares and similar issues. So for the time being, we don't think the production program for the full year on Airbus would be really impacted. We might see, probably during the year, one or the other slippage of a few weeks. That is possible, but we wouldn't expect bigger issues today.</p>
