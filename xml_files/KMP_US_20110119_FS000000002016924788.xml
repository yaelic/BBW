          <p>Welcome and thank you for standing by for today's Kinder Morgan Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Ed. And welcome to the Kinder Morgan analyst call. As usual, we'll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Also as usual I'll give a general overview of the fourth quarter and full year 2010 and a little bit of a glimpse of the future outlook. Then I'll turn it over to Park Shaper, our President, who will take you through the numbers in detail. And then as we always do, we'll take any and all questions that you might have.</p>
          <p>Before discussing results at the business segment level, let me just mention a few key company-wide achievements. First of all, we increased the distribution per unit for the fourth quarter to $1.13. That's 8% above the distribution for the fourth quarter of 2009, and it works out to $4.40 for full year 2010 versus $4.20 for 2009, an increase of about 5%. $4.40 was our target for the year, and we actually produced $4.43 distributable cash flow per unit, or an excess coverage of about $9 million. That's a little less than the budget for 2010 which called for $32 million of excess coverage and as both Park and I will explain, there are a lot of moving parts in how you get to the $4.43 and the $9 million of excess coverage.</p>
          <p>But suffice it to say that through happenstance or whatever, the difference of $23 million in excess coverage between the budget and where we came out coincidentally is just about equal to the difference resulting from the WTI pricing. We had about $84 per barrel in the plan, and the actuals came in at about $79.5, and that equates to just about $23 million. Finally on a company-wide basis I think it's very important that all five of our business segments were above 2009, both for the fourth quarter and for the full year.</p>
          <p>Now let me talk about the individual segments. Our products pipeline was above 2009 and slightly below the plan for the year. Growth there was driven by increased revenue on our SFPP East Line, by increased revenue from ethanol storage and blending and I might add that we were up 29% for the year in that category and 19% for the fourth quarter, and by various expansions and some small acquisitions that we made.</p>
          <p>The real glaring weakness in the products pipeline was our Cochin NGL system, where we fell short of both 2009 and our plan for 2010. That was largely volumetrically driven. We just had milder weather and lack of crop drying in the upper Midwest during this past fall, so Cochin was under 2009 both and its plan.</p>
          <p>We always look at the volumes in our products pipeline segment, not only for our own edification, but because we believe it's also somewhat of a leading indicator about how the economy is doing. And the way to look at these, we give you a lot of different ways to analyze it in our release, but the right way to look at this, I think, is to adjust for the mandated ethanol blend in California which took effect January 1, 2010. If you adjust for that volumes for the quarter, if you include Plantation, were up 6.7% from the fourth quarter of '09. And without Plantation for the fourth quarter they were up 3.9%.</p>
          <p>On the same basis if you look at the full year, we were up 1.6% with Plantation, 1.4% without Plantation. I guess I'd add that this is two quarters in a row now we've had positive year-to-year comparisons in total refined products volumes. So, I think we're cautiously optimistic that maybe we've turned the corner, but I would emphasize the word cautiously.</p>
          <p>It's still hard to read and certainly we still do not have the kind of full recovery that we hope will eventually occur. Also in the products pipeline segment, work continues on time and on budget on both our Carson storage facility and on our Travis Air Force Base expansion in northern California.</p>
          <p>In our natural gas segment we were above 2009 and slightly above plan for 2010. The growth for the year came from our KinderHawk joint venture. That's our gathering system in the Haynesville Shale, from a full year of KM treating Mid-Continent Express Pipeline and Kinder Morgan Louisiana and from very good results at our Casper-Douglas processing system in Wyoming.</p>
          <p>These good results were offset in part by lower results at our Texas Intrastate, largely resulting from compressed margins and less volatility and lower gas prices, and lower revenues at KMIGT, for much the same reason, and the force majeure we experienced in the first quarter at REX and the higher Ohio tax also at REX. But again, the segment as a whole if you'd include KinderHawk came out well above 2009 and slightly above the plan.</p>
          <p>We had some significant developments late in the year in our natural gas segment. We completed the Fayetteville Express Pipeline at a cost of approximately $1 billion. That compares with the original budget of 1.3 billion and firm service began the first of January of 2011. As you're no doubt aware, this is a joint venture with Energy Transfer Partners and it's a line that has two billion cubic feet per day of capacity with 10-year binding commitments for 1.85 Bcf per day of that two billion capacity.</p>
          <p>In the Eagle Ford, which of course in our view is one of the most promising if not the most promising shale plays in the United States, located in South Texas, we've significantly expanded our joint venture with Copano to better serve our producer customers. The original budget as you may recall was to build 111 miles of 30-inch pipe at a cost of about $175 million, which would allow us to handle 375 million cubic feet a day.</p>
          <p>All of that capacity was subscribed pretty quickly by SM Energy and Chesapeake, so the joint venture is now committed to an additional $100 million to build 200 million a day of additional capacity through additional pipelines and gathering and through an agreement with Formosa Hydrocarbons Company to provide additional processing and fractionation services, which we think is a win-win for us and our customers.</p>
          <p>We expect to complete all of this by year-end 2011 and the joint venture will continue to pursue additional opportunities in this promising play. The response of our customers has been very good. We expect that all of this capacity will be fully committed within a short period of time. Another big development is the KinderHawk joint venture, which we closed on in mid-May of 2010. The throughput there continues to grow. At year-end we were moving about 800 million cubic feet a day through the system. That's consistent with what we've told you in past quarters and what our outlook was and the acquisition plan and in our budget for this year. Importantly, we continue to add third-party volumes. And that will pay dividends for 2011 and beyond, we believe.</p>
          <p>In our CO2 segment we were significantly above 2009 for the full year 2010, but we were below the 2010 plan. The full-year growth was driven primarily by a 5% increase in our NGL volumes and by higher oil and NGL prices when you compare them to 2009. The volumes at SACROC were down slightly for the full year, but pretty close to our plan for 2010. But the volume at Yates decreased by 9%, which is a greater decrease than we expected in our plan.</p>
          <p>I will say, though, that the fourth quarter volumes at Yates were pretty flat with the third quarter, which is fairly consistent with what Tim Bradley told you on the last analyst call in response to a question as to whether we thought the decline had flattened or bottomed out. That's essentially what we saw in the fourth quarter and we did actually see the oil column thicken ever so slightly in the fourth quarter of 2009. Certainly we want to &#x2013; 2010, excuse me. Certainly we'll want to continue to look at that oil column thickness throughout 2011.</p>
          <p>We were able to offset most of the impact from lower production by reducing costs, but we fell short of the budget for 2010, primarily because of this difference in WTI crude price that I talked about earlier. The two most significant developments in this segment during 2010 at least in my judgment were these.</p>
          <p>First of all, demand for CO2 in the Permian Basin is really strong. I think it's probably the strongest since we've owned this asset over the last 10 years. And this led us during the year to enter into new sales and delivery contracts for over 1.3 Tcf of CO2 to 10 customers for an average term of eight years. And in fact, the demand now looks strong enough that we are now initiating a study about expanding once again both our CO2 production facilities in southwest Colorado and the Cortez Pipeline which moves that production down to the Permian Basin.</p>
          <p>Now, I would caution you that the study is just beginning, and we'll need some additional commitments in addition to these contracts we've already signed from the customers in the out years in order to undertake that project. If we do undertake it, it would be a sizable project that would significantly add to the cash flow of the CO2 segment over a several-year period.</p>
          <p>Second major development during the year was that we completed our Eastern Shelf Pipeline project and began injecting CO2 at our Katz Field during the month of December 2010. We expect to grow production by 1,000 barrels per day at Katz in 2011 when compared to 2010, and we expect that over 15 to 20 years this $230 million project should allow us to produce an additional 25 million barrels of oil at Katz. In addition, we can expand the pipeline itself from the present 65 million a day capacity to 200 million a day capacity in order to serve third party customers in the same area.</p>
          <p>In our terminals segment, they were substantially above 2009 and just a hair below the 2010 plan. In this segment, the growth was driven by contract renewals and new storage capacity at our big Pasadena and Galena Park facilities on the Houston Ship Channel, by strong results at our Van Wharves terminal in British Columbia, by a 48% increase in steel volumes year-over-year, up to 24.7 million tons that we handled in 2010, and by contributions from our Slay and U.S. Development acquisitions and finally from additional ethanol volumes that we handled during the year. The ethanol volumes were up 78% largely as a result of the USD acquisition.</p>
          <p>I might add that combined, our terminals and Products Pipeline segments handled about 88 million-barrels of ethanol for 2010. That's up 58% over 2009 and represents about 30% of the ethanol used in the United States.</p>
          <p>We completed a number of acquisitions and expansions in the fourth quarter of 2010 in our terminals segment. Perhaps the most interesting was our investment of $50 million in the Watco Companies in return for a preferred equity position in that rail transportation company. Watco is the largest privately held short line railroad in America and operates transload and intermodal facilities, which are very much akin to some of our own operations.</p>
          <p>We expect that our new relationship with Watco will produce additional growth opportunities through things like crude unit train operations and incremental business at our terminal storage facilities. And we may invest as much as an additional 100 million in Watco during 2011.</p>
          <p>We're also taking a number of steps in our terminals group to take advantage of the increasing demand for coal export capacity, particularly for met coal. As a first step in that we just completed the expansion of our Pier 9 facility in Newport News, Virginia, and that expansion added capacity of 3 million tons per year of coal export capacity.</p>
          <p>We also signed two important LOIs with major coal producers that will result in expansion of two of our terminals. The first LOI is with a major central Appalachian producer that will support a $70 million expansion of our IMT facility, which is south of New Orleans on the Mississippi river. It will allow us to handle an additional 6 million tons per year for export purposes, with minimum long-term commitments from this customer for 4 million tons per year. We expect this project to be completed in 2012.</p>
          <p>The second LOI is with a major western coal producer to expand one of our Houston pet coke facilities to handle the export of two million tons per year of coal out of the Gulf Coast. That's a $15 million project, and we expect to complete that project in the third quarter of this year assuming a timely obtaining of the necessary permits.</p>
          <p>In our Kinder Morgan Canada segment, we were well above both 2009 and our 2010 budget. There our growth was driven by increased deliveries on our Trans Mountain system, both over the Westridge Dock in British Columbia going to California and to a lesser extent to Asia, and into Washington State to the refineries there, and also by the appreciation of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>As I look ahead to 2011 &#x2013; and we've detailed more of this in the release itself, but I want to emphasize that as we previously indicated, that we expect to declare distributions for 2011 of $4.60 per unit. That's a 4.5% increase from the $4.40 we declared for 2010, and we expect to be able to declare that and have $37 million of excess coverage for 2011. We also expect our business segments to generate over $3.6 billion in earnings before DD&amp;A, and that's an increase of more than $325 million from 2010.</p>
          <p>So before I turn it over to Park, I guess I'd just close on this note. As I was preparing my notes for this call, it struck me once again the tremendous number of opportunities we have for future growth in all our business segments and probably equally importantly the diversity of those opportunities. And I think this is largely the result of our enormous footprint across the United States and western Canada and I believe if you can combine that size of footprint with an experienced management team that knows how to successfully exploit those kind of opportunities, and then add to that the ability to access the capital markets to fund the expansions and acquisitions, I think it's a combination that bodes very well for benefiting both our large number of customers and our investors both now and in the future.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it over to Park.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks, Rich. As always, I'm going to be working off the financial pages that are part of the press release and so if you go past the text, the first financial page you should get to is the face of the income statement. Looking at that briefly before we turn to the next page, you'll see above the segment earnings before DD&amp;A section, the declared distribution per unit, as Rich mentioned, $1.13 for the quarter, up from $1.05 for the fourth quarter of 2009. Now that's an 8% increase from a year ago. And then for the year $4.40 up from $4.20, that's up almost 5% from what we distributed for 2009 and it is consistent with our budget. Our budget target was $4.40.</p>
          <p>If you'll turn to the second page, you'll see some more detail on that and how we generated that cash flow. I think the important thing to start at is towards the bottom above the notes, the second line above the notes, the distributable cash flow per unit before certain items. It was $1.17 in the fourth quarter 2010. That was flat with $1.17 in the fourth quarter of 2009, but covered our distribution of $1.13 by $11 million.</p>
          <p>And for the year we generated $4.43 of distributable cash flow per unit, up from $4.25 a year ago. That's over 4% growth, and it is almost $9 million of coverage above that $4.40 distribution. You may recall at the third quarter conference call we talked about the fact that as we looked at the year at that point, we thought we'd come in right around the $4.40 in terms of distributable cash flow per unit. And so actually the fourth quarter came in stronger than we expected, so we're very happy with the performance in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Just moving up from there for a few lines, you have the net income per unit before certain items right above that. We don't think net income is necessarily the best way to measure KMP's performance, but you can see they're very strong comparisons to last year. And then you get to DCF before certain items, 366 million is up $24 million or 7% for the quarter and $1.36 billion for the year up from $1.2 billion, or up $164 million for the year or 14% growth in total distributable cash flow for the year.</p>
          <p>Sustaining capital expenditures above that, $58 million for the quarter, a little bit under where we were a year ago. For the year $179 million, that is up from $172 million a year ago, but you may recall that our budget was $207 million. So, we are actually under our budget in terms of sustaining CapEx. This is right about where we expected we'd end up, though, when we reported the third quarter, so consistent with our expectations there.</p>
          <p>And there were some things in it for sustaining CapEx, some things that got pushed off to '11. Some things that got picked up in either expense or expansion capital and some things that were either done on a more efficient basis or did not need to be done at all.</p>
          <p>Above that you have the Express and Endeavor contribution. Really what we're doing here is we're backing out book earnings and we're putting in the cash that we received from those investments from Express and Endeavor.</p>
          <p>Our cash was dead on in our budget. These numbers here are actually a little bit above our budget, and the reason for that is that &#x2013; well, actually for the full year it's a little bit under our budget. The reason for that is the earnings were a little bit less than budget. But really what shows up in distributable cash flow is the cash that we received, and that was on our budget for the quarter and the year.</p>
          <p>And then above that you have the difference between book and cash taxes. Again, what we're doing here is we're backing book taxes out of earnings and putting in cash taxes. They were both under budget for the year, but so really what is salient is that cash taxes were under budget for the year. So we got that benefit that shows up. That's the amount that remains in distributable cash flow.</p>
          <p>DD&amp;A, you'll see it's up for the quarter and for the year. It actually was a little bit under our budget CO2, DD&amp;A came in a little bit under our budget. And then above that you have the limited partners net income but as we discussed, net income's probably not the most relevant measure. We believe distributable cash flow is a much better measure to track KMP's performance.</p>
          <p>With that let me jump to the top and talk about the segments and Rich really touched on a number of these. But you'll see product pipelines, $171 million for the quarter, up about $6 million from 2009. For the year, about $688 million, up $52 million or over 8% versus 2009. Now, the $688 million is about $11 million under our budget of $699 million. And what was going on there as Rich mentioned, Cochin was under budget and under 2009, the volumes were lower due to weather, lower due to the lack of grain drying and then there was an expansion project on Cochin that we &#x2013; did not occur in 2010, but we expect to occur in 2011.</p>
          <p>Pacific was also a little under its budget for the quarter and for the year. That was primarily due to the change in rates that took place in September of this year and that were not factored into our budget. But it was nicely above 2009 both for the quarter and for the year. And so again you have the total segment nicely above 2009 just slightly under our budget.</p>
          <p>Natural gas pipeline is $243 million for the quarter, up from $226 million a year ago, so almost $17 million increase for the quarter and then finished the year at about $836 million compared to 788, so an increase of about $48 million, and that $836 compares to a budget of $830 million in terms of segment earnings before DD&amp;A, so above budget by about $6 million.</p>
          <p>Now, Rich mentioned a lot of that actually comes from the KinderHawk acquisition, and then the benefits from the KinderHawk acquisition were offset by under-performance at the Intrastates again due to tighter margins and lower volatility that we saw in that market. And then at Rockies Express we ended up about $6 million under our budget. Now operationally we actually performed pretty well. We had two events that caused us to be under budget. One was the January outage, which was a force majeure event and cost us to our share about $15 million. And then the other was the higher Ohio property tax, which cost us to our share about $6 million. So you can see ending up at just $6 million under budget facing those two events is actually a pretty strong performance.</p>
          <p>Now one other thing to note, we do add &#x2013; down below in the DD&amp;A that I just talked about when we're getting to distributable cash flow, we add back the DD&amp;A related to our joint ventures. We do that because it more closely tracks the distribution that we receive from those joint ventures, but if you want to know the total impact that natural gas pipelines has on our distributable cash flow, it is more than the $836 million. It's actually about $146 million more, so it's really about $981 million is the total impact from the assets that are owned in the natural gas pipeline segment. So, again, what shows up in the segment is just the equity earnings. When we get to Bcf down below we're also adding back our share of DD&amp;A for those joint ventures and we also take off our share of sustaining CapEx.</p>
          <p>Last piece to know within the natural gas pipeline segment is we also did have a very strong year in our upstream businesses. Our Casper and Douglas assets and our Red Cedar assets dramatically outperformed the budget.</p>
          <p>Next segment is CO2, up about $14 million for the quarter, up $164 million for the year to $960 million versus a little bit under $800 million in 2009. Now that being said, our budget for CO2 in terms of segment earnings before DD&amp;A was $1.6 billion and so we did end up as Rich mentioned about $46 million under our budget.</p>
          <p>About half of that was price, and then the other half was primarily related to volumes, especially at Yates volumes were a little under our budget. SACROC volumes were a hair under our budget, NGL volumes were above our budget. And so those amounts accounted for essentially the other half of the $46 million miss to budget.</p>
          <p>Terminal segment, up almost $18 million in the quarter, up over 11% for the quarter, up over $70 million for the year, which is over 12% to about $647 million. Now that compared to a budget of $655 million and so the terminals were about $9 million under budget. Truthfully our existing assets performed essentially as expected. Now there a lot of ins and outs there but &#x2013; but they ended up where we expected them to be.</p>
          <p>Two major acquisitions during the year, the Slay terminal and the U.S. Development terminals were a little bit under our expectations and really the two totaled to the $9 million variance versus budget, but very nice growth in the segment overall.</p>
          <p>Kinder Morgan Canada had a strong fourth quarter and a strong year, ended up $8 million above 2009 for the quarter, $16 million above 2009 for the year, and $13 million above our budget. We did have very strong volumes on our Trans Mountain Pipeline, driven primarily by incremental volumes going across our dock at Westridge but also by volumes going down to Washington State. And then we also benefited from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar in this segment. So those were the primary drivers of a very nice outperformance at the Kinder Morgan Canada segment.</p>
          <p>Where that gets you for the quarter is $876 million of segment earnings before DD&amp;A. For the year, over $3.3 billion and again if you add back the joint venture DD&amp;A that's added back down below, you end up at $3.46 billion of segment earnings before DD&amp;A, so again our assets generate a tremendous amount of cash.</p>
          <p>Now, in total that $3.31 billion is a little bit under our budget. It's actually under by about $46 million, which happens to be the amount by which CO2 missed its budget. If you look at the other segments as I mentioned, natural gas was a little above the Kinder Morgan Canada segment was a little bit above and then the Products and Terminal segments were a little below. So again segment earnings before DD&amp;A ended up about $46 million under our budget.</p>
          <p>With that I'd like to drop down 10 or 12 lines to the G&amp;A line. So, G&amp;A costs in the quarter about $87 million, under the fourth quarter 2009 of $89 million. For the year, $375 million ahead or more expense than what we saw in 2009 of $332 million. Our budget was actually about $364 million. Now, so we ended up a little under $11 million above our budget.</p>
          <p>The drivers to that were primarily legal costs, healthcare costs, and then some one-time costs primarily associated with our captive insurance plan. We really talked about those mostly in the first quarter, a little bit in the second quarter and so that we've seen those in the year-to-date numbers again since the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Interest, up to about $132 million for the quarter, it's about $15 million above where it was fourth quarter 2009. In 2010 it's about $505 million, up from about $430 million, but about $11 million under our budget. And so actually overall rates came in a little bit favorable to what we had in our budget, so our total interest expense for the year was under our budget.</p>
          <p>That gets you the net income before certain items which you see there. Let me just give you a couple of points on the certain items. The allocated non-cash long-term compensation &#x2013; I'll remind you we say this most quarters &#x2013; that is compensation that expense, that for accounting purposes has been allocated to K&amp;P but K&amp;P will never pay any amount related to that. So K&amp;P never pays economically any of these costs.</p>
          <p>Acquisition costs are just items that previously were capitalized. We still break them out down here. The big item for the quarter is the legal reserve amount and that's actually the big item for the year-to-date as well. In the quarter it went up by $14 million and that's related to some other settlements that are under negotiations and to legal costs associated with those rate cases throughout the year. And then of course earlier in the year we took a large increase to our rate case reserve and that's why you see the $172 million for the year and that was related to a payment that went out in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Insurance deductible and casualty loss &#x2013; sorry, I skipped a line. The mark-to-market on effectiveness of certain hedges, you actually see positive amounts for the fourth quarter and for the year-to-date. As we've said before, we run the full value of the hedges through our segment earnings when the transactions occur. On some of these hedges, we do have to mark-to-market through the income statement.</p>
          <p>On the amounts that have &#x2013; related to transactions that have not yet occurred, we pull those amounts out down here, but again the full amount is recognized in the segment when the transaction occurs. Now you can see, again those are positive amounts that we're not taking credit for in 2010.</p>
          <p>Insurance deductible and casualty loss just related to some insurance claims and we pull those costs out here. And then you'll see down below when we get reimbursed from insurance that also shows up down here rather than showing the gain in the segments or in our distributable cash flow.</p>
          <p>Environmental reserves and receivables, no change in the quarter, modest change for the year. Asset disposition expenses, these are costs related to an asset that we are going to sell. So, we do have ongoing clean-up costs associated with that asset and then earlier in the year we actually had some non-cash book value that we wrote off. We expect to receive cash from the proceeds of this sale that will exceed all of the amounts that we have taken here, so this is really timing. We expect that we'll receive a fair amount of that in 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, once again, when we get those positive amounts, they will from an accounting perspective represent a gain. We will not show that gain in our segments. We'll break it out down here in certain items, so in other words, we won't be taking credit for that gain. We'll represent it here.</p>
          <p>A gain on the sale &#x2013; our sale of 50% of the Cypress pipeline and so we had about a $9 million gain related to that. And then insurance reimbursement for casualty loss again, you can see that insurance recovery is there. Those gains, they're treated as gains for accounting purposes but we pull them out and show them here. And then other, you know nothing for the quarter, very small for the year.</p>
          <p>So total certain items was a negative about $9 million for the quarter, negative about $190 million for the year, but again the year was primarily the rate case settlement so an increase to the rate case reserve. And then about $18 million related to this one property in California that we are preparing for a sale and so we will recover all of that going forward. So then those are the certain items. We keep going down, you'll get to net income, you take off the general partners' interest, and you get down ultimately to the distributable cash flow numbers that we've discussed before.</p>
          <p>That's really it for the income statement. I don't think there's anything else worth discussing on &#x2013; back on the first page, which is the GAAP income statement. I'll remind you that that page does include all of the certain items broken out on various line items between the quarters and the year. And so it does make &#x2013; it does distort some of those comparisons and some of the total numbers.</p>
          <p>But with that, if you'll turn past the volumes page to the last page of the press release, you'll see the balance sheet and I'll run through that briefly. Cash and cash equivalents is essentially unchanged. Other current assets has gone up by about $50 million during the year. That is largely a note receivable that we have with Plantation, where we and our partner in Plantation have loaned money to Plantation. And that note receivable has gone from long-term to current and so it's moved into current assets. You'll see a similar reduction when we get down to other assets where it has again just been reclassified.</p>
          <p>PP&amp;E is up about $450 million. This is a function of acquisitions plus CapEx, less DD&amp;A. Now recognize I'm going to go through &#x2013; really, and it shows up on the next line &#x2013; some of our acquisitions and investments have been in joint ventures and so those show up on the investments line rather than in the PP&amp;E line. So you'll see a very big increase on the investments line, over $1 billion.</p>
          <p>The KinderHawk investment is over $900 million of that and so it's the lion's share of it, but we also made incremental investments in the Mid-Continent Express, into the Eagle Ford and into Red Cedar, so the Eagle Ford joint venture and our Red Cedar joint venture. And then also because we've sold 50% of Cypress, it went from PP&amp;E into investments because we now account for it on the equity method.</p>
          <p>Deferred charges and other assets is up about $67 million. As a function of acquisitions, goodwill and other intangibles went up and then we had the note receivable which moved out of this line and up to other current assets. And so those things net out to the $67 million increase in that line. Total assets, a little bit under $22 billion, up from a little over $20 billion at the beginning of the year, so a total increase of about $1.6 billion across the year.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the liabilities, notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt, we do have a maturity in March which is now showing up in current maturities. It really has for the last two quarters. And then at the end of the year, we had commercial paper outstanding of a little over $500 million. So that's what shows up in that line.</p>
          <p>Other current liabilities, is an increase of about $74 million. It was really spread across a number of line items, accounts payable, accrued taxes actually went down but there were also increases in accrued interest and deferred revenues and current environmental and in the mark-to-market of the hedges. Long-term debt, I'll talk about in just a minute.</p>
          <p>Value of the interest rate swaps up from the beginning of the year, again that's just a function of the forward curve. And then other, the decrease there of $267 million is largely a reduction in the mark-to-market of the hedges. Accumulated other comprehensive loss, again that's just the mark-to-market of the hedges flowing through. Other partners capital is up about $360 million and so what you have going on here is you have earnings increases it, distributions decreases it, then and equity issuances increase it and we'll talk a little bit more about the equity issuance in a minute. And so really not much of significance left in partner's capital and it gets you clearly to the same balance sheet amount of $22 billion.</p>
          <p>So dropping down, total debt at the end of the year 11.4 billion, at the beginning of the year we were at 10.4 billion. So the increase throughout the year was $964 million. At the end of the third quarter we were at $11.5 billion and so the change from the end of the third quarter to the end of the year was actually a reduction in debt of $87 million. And I'll talk about the drivers of both of those numbers, the changes in debt in just a minute.</p>
          <p>But first let's talk about debt-to-EBITDA. You'll see EBITDA over $3.1 billion for the year compared to about $2.7 billion for 2009. That takes our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to actually about 3.66 at the end of the year and so that's down from the 3.8. It really was 3.80 at the beginning of the year and actually even at the end of the third quarter we were at 3.77. So we had a nice reduction in the fourth quarter and truthfully if you adjust for the KinderHawk transaction &#x2013; remember that transaction closed in May, so we don't have a full year of EBITDA from that transaction included in our EBITDA, although we do have the full amount of the debt.</p>
          <p>And if you adjust for that transaction we would actually be at 3.6 times, so about 3.6 flat, which is actually right where we expected to be when we did our budget, and so consistent with those expectations. And then from this level of 3.66 in 2011, we expect that number to continue to decline and we expect it will end the year at about 3.55. It may still round to 3.6, but again we expect we'll be right around 3.55, so another nice decline in that ratio, just demonstrating the strength of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>With that let's talk about the change in debt. As I mentioned for the quarter, debt went down by $87 million. For the year it went up by $964 million. So first what were our investments? On the expansion CapEx side, we've spent about $244 million in the quarter. For the year we've spent about $840 million. On acquisitions, we've spent a little bit under $100 million in the quarter. For the full year we've spent about $1.35 billion on acquisitions. Now the biggest piece of that was KinderHawk clearly.</p>
          <p>And then contributions to joint ventures, about $100 million in the quarter and about $300 million year-to-date. Now you'll see overall that's right at $2.5 billion invested. And we'll talk about how we financed that in just a minute. But before I get to that, let me just point out two other things, cash in and out. We did pay the FERC settlement to shippers. That totaled a little over $200 million, so that was additional cash out.</p>
          <p>Now, that was actually financed primarily through an interim capital transaction whereby the distribution to the general partner was reduced and it was reduced by about $170 million. And just one thing I should have pointed out when I went over the income statement, when we calculate distributable cash flow numbers for 2010, we are not including the impact of the interim capital transaction. If we did include that impact, our distributable cash flow numbers would be much bigger because the general partners' incentive distribution was reduced by the impact of the interim capital transaction.</p>
          <p>We don't think that's the right way to look at KMP's performance during the year because again we think it's reasonable &#x2013; interim capital transactions are not going to happen on any frequent basis. I can't tell you hopefully they never happen again. And so we don't think it's the right way to look at it, taking that into account. And so you actually, you can see that it is back on the income statement that we went through.</p>
          <p>But essentially the FERC settlement payment was funded primarily by that interim capital transaction, which was about $170 million reduction in the cash that went to the general partner. And so again, I've talked about $2.5 billion worth of investments really for the year. How did we finance that? In the quarter we issued equity of about $122 million. That was all through our at-the-market program. And for the year we issued equity of about $850 million. That was a combination of the at-the-market program and an underwritten offering.</p>
          <p>In addition, we had KMR distributions, which totaled about $100 million in the quarter and about $300 million year-to-date, and in the fourth quarter we unwound swaps. So we had swaps that took us from fixed to floating. We unwound those swaps and as part of that swap unwind, we received $160 million. So we picked up $160 million in the fourth quarter and that amount for the year.</p>
          <p>If you sum those amounts for the year, 850, 380 and 160, you get to right about $1.4 billion. So that's essentially the equity that was raised to finance the $2.5 billion of investment. And you may recall at the time that we did the KinderHawk transaction, we said that we would over equitize that transaction and again 1.4, normally we're about 50/50. And so the 1.4 relative to the 2.5 shows you that we did follow through and over equitize that transaction.</p>
          <p>Now, one other thing to make &#x2013; one other point to make here, because I talked about the KMR distributions, again that was effectively cash retained of $100 million in the quarter and $380 million year-to-date and so that is a huge benefit to KMP. KMR is a very powerful security for KMP, but it's also, as we talked about last quarter, we believe a very attractive investment opportunity for investors. It is still trading at a discount to KMP. We can't tell you why that discount persists. What we can tell you is that its distributions are the same as KMP. And for many investors they're probably a tax advantage and so in essence more attractive distributions than KMP.</p>
          <p>So why KMP would trade &#x2013; why KMR would trade at a discount is still unknown. I still believe that that discount will shrink. If you look at it actually at the end of the year it was significantly smaller. So again I believe that that is an attractive opportunity for investors.</p>
          <p>Now, one other piece on the debt reconciliation, we did have a source of cash from working capital and other items for the quarter of about $150 million, and for the year about $172 million, so very attractive source of cash from working capital and other items. And let me walk through what some of those items were. AR and AP were actually a use of cash in the quarter of about $70 million and for the year, they were essentially flat.</p>
          <p>Other current assets and current liabilities for the quarter were a source of cash of about $132 million and again for the year they were essentially flat. Now that other current assets and current liability is primarily accrued interest. And we have big interest payments in the first quarter and the third quarter, so we generally see positive amounts in accrued interest in the second quarter and the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Distributions from equity investments in excess of equity earnings plus DD&amp;A were a source of cash for the year of about $44 million. For the quarter they were essentially equivalent, meaning the distributions were essentially equivalent to our equity earnings plus our DD&amp;A. But again for the year that was an incremental benefit of about $44 million.</p>
          <p>We also had a couple of other cash items, some timing, some just realized cash that doesn't go through the income statement, total about $35 million for the quarter and for the year. Excess coverage provided as with retained cash about $10 million for the quarter and for the year. There were some asset sales and some insurance proceeds provided cash of about $13 million for the quarter, about $34 million for the year.</p>
          <p>Change in margin deposits, our use of cash about $4 million for the quarter, but a source of cash of about $18 million for the year. The CapEx numbers that I gave you are really on an accrual basis rather than a cash basis, and so that's a source of cash of about $17 million for both the quarter and for the year. And then there's some timing issues and some other issues that were a source of cash of about $16 million for the quarter and about $12 million are to the year. Now, I know those are a lot of kind of miscellaneous items, but if you sum them up, you do get to $150 source of cash for the quarter and $172 million source of cash for the year.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, let me talk about CapEx and contributions to joint ventures. As a reminder on the CapEx, it's about $244 million for the quarter, about $840 million for the year. Products was about $18 million in the quarter, about $91 million for the year. The big project there, the new sixth tank at Carson, the Travis Air Force base Pipeline, which is currently ongoing, relocation of our transmit facilities in St. Louis and then various other smaller projects.</p>
          <p>On the natural gas side, expansion capital about $35 million in the quarter about $120 million year-to-date. The big project there, expansions of our Dayton storage field and then the Hastings Lateral at KMIGT and again various other smaller projects.</p>
          <p>And the CO &#x2013; in CO2 segment, a little under $100 million in the quarter, $364 million for the year. We did have capitalized CO2 amounts in there. And then you had the Katz expansion and the Eastern Shelf pipeline, which was built to serve Katz and then of course the ongoing expansions at SACROC and a little bit of expansion at Yates.</p>
          <p>On the terminal side, expansion CapEx about $91 million in the quarter, about $250 million for the year Cortez gateway expansion which is ongoing, the relocation of some pet coke operations to another facility, one of our other facilities in the Houston Ship Channel, ongoing projects at the BP Whiting for their coker, ongoing projects to handle coal at Pier 9, and then a variety of other smaller projects.</p>
          <p>And then at Kinder Morgan Canada we've spent about $3 million in the quarter and about $11 million for the year. Then looking at contributions to joint ventures, really just there's about $300 million for the year. Rockies Express was a big piece of that, Mid-Continent Express, KinderHawk, Eagle Ford and Red Cedar are really the entities that we made contributions to during the year. And that is it for the balance sheet and I will hand it back over to Rich.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Raymond James. Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Darren. How you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty good, Rich, thanks, couple quick questions. First as it relates to the recent 8-K, could you give us a little bit more color on why you expect SACROC production to be essentially flat year-over-year, especially given the current robust demand trends that you detailed and the good historical conformance of the field? Is it an issue with conservatism around conformance risk of additional pattern development or maybe some conservatism around the subpump or compressor run time or injection rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll have Tim Bradley answer that question. He's sitting right here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really the former and not the latter. The run time on our compressors and our subpumps continued to improve in 2010 versus 2009. So our mechanical operability is running very smooth. The issue is that we're moving into the northern platform area of the field. It is more geologically complex. Some of the performance that we saw in the fourth quarter indicated that conformance in the green zone, as we've discussed in the past, may be a bit more challenging. So we tried to factor that into our budget forecast for 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, Tim, also, I appreciate the color that you guys provided around the oil column issues impacting the Yates volumes. Is it fair to assume that when you extrapolate that conservatism, is that the reason why you're expecting the volumetric decline year-over-year? And I'm also wondering to what extent you think higher oil prices are going to drive increases in in-field drilling and maybe that somewhat offsets this organic decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I doubt that in-field drilling is going to offset it that much. We do have some opportunities on the west side of the field and we are going to prosecute those and those seem to be somewhat independent from the main portion of the Yates field that is dominated by the gravity drainage process. But ignoring that upside potential &#x2013; and we did bake some of that into our plan for next year, for 2011 rather &#x2013; we do think that over the long term, the oil rim will gradually decline in its production at a very gentle rate simply because the amount of oil that's draining down from the gas cap is diminishing in its total quantity.</p>
          <p>So we do expect that long-term there will be a long-term decline. Our simulation studies give us a range on that, but a budget we kind of picked a midpoint as to what we thought that would be. So we tried to factor in a long-term look as to what's going on in the field as well as near term opportunities for in-field drilling on the west side and came up with our budget guidance where we did.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. As you put kind of both of those pieces together for both fields, based on how demand for CO2 in the Permian is trending, as we try and get our arms around capital allocation in 2011, is it fair that we use 2010 as a benchmark? Meaning that CO2 I believe was projected to account for about 415 million or roughly half of your growth capital budget? Is that kind of the fair benchmark for 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean I think that's right in the range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, final question for me on KinderHawk, as it relates to the new acreage dedications and opportunities that you guys have to add that incremental 200,000 decatherms a day, when you talk to producers, what are you hearing regarding the drilling schedule? I'm just trying to get a feel for how quickly you think you can ramp from that 800 MMcf a day platform as kind of the year progresses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, we have built our 2011 plan on the numbers that Petrohawk actually submitted to us for their volumes based on their drilling plan. And then with regard to third parties, that we based it on our new contracts that we have with Chesapeake and others with our best estimate of what they will be dominating over the course of the year. So I think we have pretty good visibility through 2011, and the ramp-up is pretty gradual over the 12 months. Tom, did you want to add anything to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think that's right. I think the trend I think really is to drill the whole acreage right now and then really gas prices will drive the activity I think overall for the market later in the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I guess following up on Darren's question, can you give a little more color as to what kind of volumes you're expecting at 2011, maybe even 2012 in KinderHawk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We have, I think said publicly that we expect the volumes to go &#x2013; we expected in the beginning to end the year 2010 at 800 million a day. That's combined Petrohawk and third-party volumes and that's where we ended up.</p>
          <p>Third-party volumes were a little higher than we thought, Petrohawk a little lower, but we ended up right at where we had projected. And we've said that we expect that to grow from 800 up to a Bcf a day during 2010, and that's based on what I said earlier, our estimates as supplied by Petrohawk and our estimates on other customers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's pretty good change. We're growing 25% in volumes from one year into the other. Tom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That Bcf is really an average for the year. We could be in the neighborhood of 1.1 or slightly higher than that by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then turning to terminals, can you talk a little about your view for coal volumes in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For coal volumes, yeah, we &#x2013; first of all I think everybody knows the coal export market now is very hot. And we have completed an expansion at our Newport News facility that takes our capacity there up to about 12 million tons a year, all of which is fully subscribed, and we are in January moving slightly over 1 million &#x2013; we expect to move slightly over 1 million tons in January, so we seem to be on target with that.</p>
          <p>Then I mentioned we have two additional LOIs that will lead to expansions of two of our other facilities to handle additional coal export, and we're just seeing that any place producers &#x2013; coal producers have a chance to grab some export capacity, they're very willing to do that.</p>
          <p>And I would not rule out us being able to get some additional export capacity in some of other our terminals. We're very lucky at Newport News, for example, to have been able to design it in such a way that we can either import or export, and so that makes it &#x2013; puts us in a very good position regardless of what happens with worldwide coal pricing. And then the ability to lock up customers for medium- to long-term time periods makes it a very profitable venture for us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it really does, yes. If you were a betting team, what would you say the odds were that acquisitions could be north of $1 billion as you look at 2011?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's too early to tell. I think our track record, Yves, is that certainly we tend to find more acquisitions during the year. So if the question were over/under on the 224 that we have budgeted, I would say certainly over because most of the 224 is already identified. But as far as 1 billion is concerned, that would be a closer call. It just depends on what opportunities we have. We continue to look at a lot of things and I think we will certainly have some acquisitions, but I wouldn't want to bet one way or another on $1 billion over/under.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have any priorities in terms of where you like to expand? I mean, Canada is a small part of the overall enterprise. Is that something that is a priority to try to get bigger or will you just continue to be opportunistic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we'll continue to be opportunistic and again as we've said so many times, we have the ability to deploy a lot of capital and we're willing to do that. Where we're really religious is about the returns. So if we can get returns well above our cost of capital, we'll make investments in all of our five business segments and if we can't, we won't. But luckily like I said at the end of my little talk, you know, the opportunities look really good against &#x2013; across a whole range, and certainly I would not rule out Canada. Again we've said repeatedly that we won't expand Trans Mountain again unless we have throughput agreements to support that expansion. And so we'll just see.</p>
          <p>Certainly we're running full, essentially full up there pretty well all the time now, and we've had to allocate in some months. So there's a lot of demand to move both crude and to a lesser extent products, but mostly crude over the mountains and to Vancouver to our dock, and then some down into &#x2013; a significant amount down into Washington State to the four refineries there. When the demand gets to the point where people are willing to stand up and support a major commitment on terms we can agree to, then we would certainly contemplate an expansion up there. But that's not something we think's going to happen this year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'd probably rather just &#x2013; that's pretty confidential information coming from some of our producer customers and I think we'd rather just stick with what Tom corrected me on. He's absolutely right, that it's &#x2013; we're projecting our budget 1 Bcf a day average throughput for 2011 and that's a combination of Petrohawk and the third parties. And it's based on what Petrohawk, their own drilling plan that they've furnished us. It's not something we speculated on and then it's based on the combination of nominations, drilling that we're aware of and our own estimates with regard to the third-party buys, but I think we'd be misleading and revealing information we don't want to reveal from our customers if we were more specific than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the two last ones &#x2013; I promise &#x2013; is have you lowered your hurdle rate at all on investments because of the pretty benign or low cost to capital environment that we're in right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course we look at our overall cost of capital, as we've discussed many times. Certainly if you look at it as 50% equity, 50% debt, then the fact that you have lower interest rates impacts that somewhat. Now, we don't go out and base something on the one-year strip, so we're looking at longer-term interest rates. We generally look at approximately what we pay for ten-year debt as a good harbinger for our interest component of our cost of capital.</p>
          <p>So, you could say that drives it down a little bit, but again this is &#x2013; to us it's an art, not a science. You look at it on a project-by-project basis and look at such things as how sure is the cash flow you're getting, how long are your contracts. If you have contracts on a particular asset, what's the potential upside, and so a lot of different things would impact what our hurdle rate would be on a given project.</p>
          <p>Then as we've shown in the past with the KinderHawk acquisition, if we have something that long-term looks like a very solid project for us but it is a bit of a hockey stick in the sense that some of these shale plays, your production is ramping up over a period of time, we're willing to take on some of that and even have our general partners step in as they did and weigh their distributions from KinderHawk for 2010 and 2011 to help get the project to clear the hurdle rate for KMP. So I think we're pretty flexibility and we feel like we've got a good position that enables us to make the acquisition we want to make.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my last question is how does &#x2013; what's your sense of natural gas prices and what are you thinking about in terms of the budget for 2011? How are you thinking about natural gas prices and how that may impact the budget?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, natural gas prices have except in an indirect way have very little direct impact on us. But we use &#x2013; on all of our commodity and interest rate pricing, we've learned we're not smart enough to outguess the market so we use the forward curve, and that's what we've used for 2011.</p>
          <p>On the WTI, for example, we used $89, which happened to be what the forward curve was on the day we finalized the CO2 portion of the budget. Today it's about $4 and change above that. We don't know if that will stick or not, but the budget was based on where the forward curve was when we did the budget. And we did the same thing on natural gas.</p>
          <p>Again, there's not the same direct commodity impact that WTI has on us. It does have some indirect impact on some of our operations like our Texas Intrastates. Generally speaking if the prices are lower, some of the margins are a little bit lower. We're just using the forward curve as the way it was then. And Tom, I don't know, I think it's actually probably up a little bit from the time when we actually did the budget, maybe $0.20 or so but not much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. First question is, Rich, if you could talk about any kind of potential momentum you're seeing in Canada for moving oil to the West Coast? Obviously your pipes have done well, but you've talked in the past about doing an expansion project into a deep water port, and how that plan may stack up against Enbridge's plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all of course what we've always stressed to our customers is that we have assets in place and we have the ability to implement and expand with minimal environmental disruption, because we already have a pipeline right away all the way down. And in fact we've already done the expansion through both the National Park and the BC Provincial Park. So in the event we were going to expand, that does require pipe. It's not a cheap power expansion, but we're not on the most pristine area of the Canadian Rockies. We finished that with the last expansion that we did. So we have the ability to go from 300,000 barrels a day now &#x2013; still with the Vancouver what we call the lower Mainland outlet, we can take that up in incremental steps for the future.</p>
          <p>We could take it as high as 700,000 barrels a day, but we don't have to do it in one fell swoop. And then we have the ability to use the portion of the line that comes through the national and state parks before it turns southeast to go down to Vancouver, we could do a direct shot across which would be shorter than the Enbridge proposal and come out at a northern BC position. We would not do that unless we had tremendous incremental demand. That's a very expensive project, and so we just believe while we would be willing and able to do that, we believe that the more common sense approach is to just continue to make incremental expansions on our present Trans Mountain system and that's what we're doing.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, we're running basically full now and some months we're allocating and if and when we have enough demand to make another expansion &#x2013; and there's another expansion in the 70,000 to 80,000 barrel a day range that we could do, as a next phase &#x2013; then we would do that. But we're not going to do it unless we have satisfactory throughput agreements with the customers. I think we are being more appreciated, particularly with some of the other problems that have occurred with getting volumes out of Canada.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Rich. Just a couple of other quick ones, on the CO2 it sounds like you're getting ready to look at possibly expanding that. Is that just adding compression or are you actually laying new pipes there? Second, you mentioned about $100 million CapEx budget for rail and if you could just give us a few details around what that might be going towards? And then the last thing, if you could make any comment on Cochin in terms of lack of demand for crop drying, I would think that that would have been pretty decent this year but was a little surprised to hear that. That's it for me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, let me start in the order that you asked them. On the CO2, this would be, if we expand Cortez would be a major expansion of the facility, and would involve some pipe in addition to compression. We &#x2013; but most of the costs would be in our infrastructure in Southwest Colorado to produce more CO2 out of the ground. We have incredibly rich reserves up there. Wells are very productive, but obviously if we were to go up by 200 or 300 million cubic feet a day, we would have to substantially expand our &#x2013; both our number of wells and our gathering system up there. So CO2 expansion would be a major project for us, which we would be happy to undertake if the demand is there.</p>
          <p>On the Watco investment, this is an interesting thing, and I think sometimes we think outside the box. Again, we've invested $50 million in return for a preferred equity position in the company, and we have &#x2013; we don't have it budgeted on that we'll invest $100 million, but we think the opportunity is there on some projects that we're talking about to participate with them that could lead to a $100 million investment, could be somewhat short of that. But broader term, I hope I got this across earlier, the broader term, a lot of what Watco does is very close to what we do and complimentary to what we do.</p>
          <p>For example, Watco is the company that operates the crude oil unit train for EOG resources from the Bakken down to Cochin. There are all kinds of opportunities to do this, we think, with crude and NGLs, not necessarily on a permanent basis but as you have in a lot of these plays production outstripping takeaway capacity, one quick way to solve the problem for a producer in a place like the Bakken or the Eagle Ford is to use rail until pipeline and other infrastructure can be built.</p>
          <p>So we think that's an opportunity and they also have some of the intermodal transload facilities  very similar to what we have. I think you can see some potential joint ventures where they will operate the railroad and we'll operate the terminal facilities at both ends of a short line railroad, so there's a lot more potential there than just investing some money with them.</p>
          <p>On Cochin, we did have a weak crop drying year, surprisingly weak, I think the weakest since we've owned the line and that was simply because in the particular areas where our four terminals are in the upper Midwest that we serve and own, they're just &#x2013; the crops did not come out wet. They did not need to be dried, and that was a tremendous difference. I think that alone, Tim, was 3,000 barrels a day or something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it was about a million barrels.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A million barrels in the fourth quarter alone. So that's a big ticket item, almost 3,000 barrels a day for the whole year. Now, some things that are happening that are positive there &#x2013; of course we're having a cold winter up there now, but also we're now seeing some propane &#x2013; excuse me, some EP mix being moved on the East line of the system. And the project that we thought would get done last year, we believe is going to get done in the first half of this year, which will enter &#x2013; which will involve a permanent contract to move significant amounts of EP mix all the way from the Midwest across the eastern part of Cochin. We terminate our line at Windsor, but then on other lines, common carrier lines from Windsor up to Sarnia where the need is for EP mix. So we think that we're going to have a better year on Cochin this year than we did last year.</p>

          <p>Good, Rich. Thanks. It sounds like Katz is going to make a nice contribution to your results next year. And I just wanted to know if you had any visibility on whether that development and Katz will drive any significant increase to your 2010 year-end reserve results. And then more specifically what are your expectations for, I guess year-end total reserves on a year-over-year basis?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The short answer on Katz is that under the SEC definitions, they're not quite considered proved reserves yet. Our reserve auditor was Netherland Sewell and they agree with that that classification at this point in time. Of course, as our early patterns that we've already started injection begin to respond, they'll be able to form a basis for being able to extrapolate that to other areas of the field. And our proved re serves base ought to gradually grow during the course of the year. So that's the answer on Katz. I don't have at my disposal our finished proved reserve report that I can share with you numbers. But I'm sure that they could be provided at the investor conference when that's scheduled here in the next few weeks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is there any focus to increase your RP ratio at CO2 or is production still your primary focus at this point?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and again, we're not looking at those metrics. We're not agonizing over what our reserves are. We're not agonizing over what our RP is. What we're trying to do is invest money and earn a good return.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. And then also on the natural gas side, any significant rollover on contracts on long haul transportation contracts or even on the storage space? I imagine that's in your estimates or guidance but just didn't know if that was taken into consideration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it was all taken into account in the budget.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is it &#x2013; is your feeling that &#x2013; what is your, I guess your longer-term feeling over the next couple of years both on basis differentials and storage margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that of course the basis differentials are substantially lower today than they were a couple years ago, largely &#x2013; there are a number of factors, price, general price of commodities went up. Secondly all the new infrastructure that's been built, including REX and MEP and other pipelines like that that have collapsed some of the bases &#x2013; some of the basis differentials. And that's had an impact on storage. When you have a flatter less volatile market, you obviously &#x2013; storage becomes less valuable. That said, there's an awful lot of storage that needs to be utilized for other things. I can't remember the exact numbers, but with the last cold snap in Chicago, on our NGPL system, for example, we drew down enormous amounts of spec. We think for January, we'll set a record all-time for withdrawals from storage.</p>
          <p>So storage is still necessary to serve the market and the people who are going to serve that market still need storage. But it may not be as valuable in the hands of people that are speculating on a contango or a backward data for that matter, but primarily the contango market. Tom, anything else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I would just say, you know, I think at least to my view, the storage valuation, service valuation declines are short-term in nature and it's somewhat indicated in the marketplace by some of the high valuations that have been transacting on storage deals that have been done, storage acquisitions. So I think the market generally believes storage is going to be very valuable in the future and that we're just in a short-term down cycle.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, can you give us &#x2013; I'm just wondering as aging coal-fired power plants shut, how does that translate to demand on your export terminals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you mean as aging coal plants -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You're cutting &#x2013; you've got a large number of coal-fired power plants that are &#x2013; they're going to probably shut down in the next few years and I'm just curious if that's why you indicated coal producers were scrambling for export capacity and if they know their domestic market is going away, does that translate to demand on your terminals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think at some point it may, but that's not what's driving it now. What's driving it now is the tremendous international need frankly for both steam coal and met coal, but particularly for met coal from places like China and India. We of course talk here about phasing down coal plants, which is the right thing to do if you want to reduce CO2 emissions and the right replacement for that is natural gas, certainly for to get a quick turn in your CO2 emissions.</p>
          <p>But China and India are still building coal plants and at an enormous rate and their utilization is going up as they modernize. So it's huge demand and that's what's driving the prices up and today, particularly the Appalachian coal can just do very well in foreign markets and so just about every coal export facility I think is either &#x2013; is being fully utilized and in many cases expanded and that's what we're trying to do. So I think the driving force now does not have anything to do with aging coal plants and trying to supplant or replace market that they've got now. Now, in the long run it may have impact certainly, but for right now, it's a demand pull primarily from China and India.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think really nothing beyond what we've said in the past. We continue to work on it and when we get viable contracts with creditworthy customers, we will prepare to build it. But we won't if we don't, and that's where we are right now. It's very fluid and we'll just see what happens.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Just a few quick follow-ups, on the CO2 side, how do you view potential opportunities for additional acquisitions of fields around your CO2 pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, I'll let you comment on that. You and I were just talking about that about 40 minutes ago or two hours ago now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're constantly looking for opportunities, whether they're near our pipeline or just in the region. Unfortunately it's a pretty frothy market. With oil prices over $90 a barrel, the sellers of these properties that we might be interested in are very proud of them. We have evaluated several acquisition opportunities during 2010, made and submitted bids. In several cases the seller withdrew the property. In some cases they closed the transaction with a  third party, so it's an opportunity to be constantly working. We haven't been able to get to a transaction to bring it home yet, but we're obviously constantly looking at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But again, when you look at the CO2 segment, I would not &#x2013; there's a lot of emphasis on the E&amp;P side of it, but we think there's going to be an opportunity to make sizable investments in additional infrastructure if we continue to see this kind of demand out of the Permian Basin, and these are not small investments. These are large investments that could prove to be a real shot in the arm for the CO2 segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess just to follow up on that, the CO2 potential expansion side, would you potentially backstop the Cortez pipeline expansion &#x2013; or it's the CO2 production with an acquisition of your own field or are you really seeking third-party demand to go ahead with those expansions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we're talking about with the expansions is third-party demand. As I said during the year we signed ten contracts for over 1.3 tcf with an average life of eight years, and if we keep getting this kind of market response, we're going to be pretty quickly potentially at a place where we could expand both the production fields in southwest Colorado and the Cortez Pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay, and then just to circle back on the terminal side, I'm not sure if I missed this, but did you discuss what type of returns you're expecting on those additional coal export capacity expansions, is it kind of in line or better margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're very fair margins, we think. I wouldn't want to get into details, but they are &#x2013; they meet our hurdle rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then just quickly on the at-the-market equity program, how much capacity is left on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And then last one for me in terms of hedging and hedging philosophy, are you basically where you want to be in terms of the hedges for 2011 or any thoughts to wanting more with the current strip prices above your budget?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're constantly looking at our hedging position. We have guidelines with both minimums and maximums and we're certainly within that. I think including NGLs, we're 78% hedged for the year. And our sensitivity per dollar of difference up or down is now about $5.5 million versus around six last year, but any rate, we constantly look at the hedging. The issue is that of course we have significant &#x2013; when you net everything out, we have significant NGLs as part of what we produce. And so if you're going to try to cover the NGLs, that's a pretty dirty hedge.</p>
          <p>As you all know, the NGL to crude ratio could vary right now. It's running slightly ahead of what we had in our budget. But one never knows on that. It's difficult to hedge those. So we'll always have some amount which is unhedged, but we're pretty much in the sweet spot right now with where we want to be. We will continue to hedge certainly out in the out years as the strips look good in '12, '13, and even '14 and a little bit in '15.</p>
