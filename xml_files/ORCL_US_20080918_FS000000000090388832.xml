          <p>Good day, everyone. And welcome to today's Oracle Corporation Quarterly Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to introduce Roy Lobo, Head of Investor Relations of Oracle. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Oracle's first quarter fiscal year 2009 earnings conference call. With me on this call are Chief Executive Officer, Larry Ellison; Oracle's President, Charles Phillips; and Oracle's President and Chief Financial Officer, Safra Catz. Joining us in the room today is also Jeff Epstein, our Executive Vice President who will become our CFO once our 10-Q is filed, a warm welcome to you, Jeff.</p>

          <p>We will begin with a few prepared remarks and then take a few questions from the audience. Let me begin by reminding everyone that today's discussions may include predictions, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. With these forward-looking -- while the forward-looking statements represent our current judgment on what the future holds, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.</p>
          <p>You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which reflect our opinion only as of the date of this presentation. Please keep in mind that we are not obligating ourselves to revise or publicly release the results of any revision of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.</p>
          <p>Throughout today's discussion we'll attempt to present some important factors relating to our business that may affect our predictions. You should always review our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.</p>
          <p>A PDF copy of our press release and financial tables which include a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be viewed and downloaded on the Oracle Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Safra Catz for her opening comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Roy. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us. I'm going to first focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2, and then turn the call over to Larry and Charles. Our non-GAAP EPS grew 32% to $0.29, setting us up well for another year of very strong EPS growth. This quarter's 32% growth is compared to non-GAAP earnings growth of 27% in Q1 of last year and it follows the 27% earnings growth we had in Q4.</p>
          <p>We were also able to improve our operating profitability by 350 basis points this quarter to 40.1% achieving the highest Q1 non-GAAP operating margin in the company's history and really proving once again the leverage of our model. Our non-GAAP operating income grew 29% to 2.2 billion.</p>
          <p>This quarter, we came in at the mi point of our license guidance despite a very tough comparison to last year's 35% license growth. The currency impact for the quarter was positive four points on revenue as compared to the five points I included in my June guidance.</p>
          <p>New software license revenues were up 14% to 1.2 billion, right at the midpoint of my guidance adjusting for the change in currency impact. We saw exceptional strength in our technology license business with revenues growing 27%, improving on last year's Q1 growth of 23% and following our 23% growth in Q4 of 2008. BEA contributed 84 million in the quarter but we need to remember that this is now a merged product with Fusion Middleware in most cases and so the allocations are not precise.</p>
          <p>Our applications license revenue contributed 331 million in the quarter and that is down by 12% in the quarter primarily due to the 65% applications growth we had last Q1. We're extremely pleased with our execution and growth in our applications business since our application license revenue has more than tripled over the last three years.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flows for the trailing 12 months increased by 1.3 billion to 7.9 billion, while free cash flow increased 20%. Product update and support revenue was up 24% on a non-GAAP basis to 3 billion. Our first quarter, product update and support revenue alone is now bigger than the total annual software revenues for all but the top five software companies. As you can see, the scale of our business combined with our recurring revenue model enables us to deliver free cash flow, net income growth, margin improvement, and earnings growth.</p>
          <p>In Q1, we bought back approximately 22.7 million shares at an average price of 21.97. As we have said the rate of our buyback will fluctuate each quarter taking into account both our stock price and alternative uses for our cash.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to guidance. Our as-reported guidance for Q2 will show a substantial change in exchange rates as the dollar has strengthened enormously. The currency contribution in Q2 last year was a positive seven points. Our currency assumption for this quarter is a negative three points. Now, I want to remind everyone that we don't actually predict currency. All we do is take currency spot rates where they are today for the purposes of giving our as-reported guidance.</p>
          <p>In my guidance today, I'll give you the constant currency range, the range as reported, and the currency assumption I used to get to the as-reported range. If currency moves up or down during the quarter, you should assume that the midpoint of our as-reported guidance moves as well. In other words, you should really just read through the currency impact.</p>
          <p>The important point to remember on currency is it doesn't impact our pricing or our competitive position as we do not adjust the global price list daily. So, if rates in the quarter were to stay the same as they are today, the as-reported guidance assumes three points of negative currency impact on our Q2 growth rate.</p>
          <p>With that, new software license revenues are expected to be up 5 to 15% year-over-year in constant currency, and then 2 to 12% assuming that rates stay where they are at negative three. Total revenue is expected to be up 12 to 15% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis in constant currency, and 9 to 12% assuming today's rate. Total revenue on a GAAP basis is expected to be up 12 to 15% in constant currency and 9 to 12 assuming today's rate. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be 35 to 36 cents assuming today's rate. GAAP EPS for the second quarter is expected to be 26 to 27 cents. This guidance assumes a tax rate of 27% for Q2 and 28.2 in Q2 &#x2013; versus 28.2 in Q2 last year as a result of our mix of earnings between higher tax and lower tax jurisdictions.</p>
          <p>Our pipeline continues to grow at a very healthy rate. Our forecast looks good and I am using regular, meaning normal, historical close rates. I want to emphasize that our Q2 license guidance is a function of a tough comparison against a very big quarter last year. In Q2 last year, we delivered 38% new license growth, 63% applications growth, and 28% technology growth.</p>
          <p>Now, since it's topical, let me quickly address financial services. As I said at Analyst Day our exposure to banking customers globally is in the low single-digits. Our exposure to US banks is even lower. The US banking and mortgage situation has been playing out for months, and we do not believe that it should have a material impact on our performance for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In addition, we've reviewed our exposure to financial institutions who are reported to be facing significant asset impairment and liquidity risk and have concluded that our exposure is de minimis and immaterial.</p>
          <p>Now, before I turn the call over to Larry, I just want to welcome Jeff Epstein who is here with us today. Next quarter, Jeff will participate in this call and he will take over as CFO once we file our first quarter 10-Q.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the call over to Larry for his comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Safra. I'd like to emphasize and try to explain why we're able to consistently improve our margins --you know, year-over-year, year-after-year, year-after-year. It's because of economies of scale and there are two parts of that economies-of-scale story.</p>
          <p>First is the one that Safra mentioned that our license renewal business, sometimes called maintenance, software maintenance is now approximately half of our business, and that's an extremely high margin business that continues to grow in a very healthy fashion.</p>
          <p>So that's a reshaping of our business where the highest margin portion of our business is now also the largest portion of our business, and the second part of the economy of scale story is our market share growth across a number of product lines.</p>
          <p>Gartner recently, by the way, the fact that we have number one market share is helpful for the following two reasons. When you have number one market share you sell more of your product than anybody else. You're able to invest more in engineering, improve your product more rapidly and simultaneously bring more money to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>So the fact that we sell more database than anybody else means we can invest more in improving our database and every year that our database increases in market share we can increase our investment in engineering and increase our profitability, increase the margin of our database business.</p>
          <p>Our database business according to Gartner's latest report, which covers the year 2007 lists the Oracle database with a 49% market share, which is larger than the next four competitors combined, in order that means we're larger IBM plus Microsoft plus Teradata plus Sybase with our 49% share. Again, that allows us to invest more in engineering and bring more to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Our fastest growing business is our middleware business which grew 35% in Q1, while again Gartner just reported on 2007. We think that 35% growth has moved us from number two to number one in middleware. We've either passed IBM or we're about to pass IBM in the middleware business. Again that will allow us to invest more in middleware than anybody else and bring more to the bottom line, because we're number one not only in data business but also in middleware.</p>
          <p>In the application space we have been for a long time number one in CRM. We're number one in ERP in North America. We're number one in a variety of industries including communications, retail and others. These number one positions, again, allow us to invest more in R&amp;D while continuously expanding our margins.</p>
          <p>I'd like to turn it over to Charles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Larry. Just want to make a few comments by major product area. We had a very solid quarter in technology and middleware as you saw. I think of note our core enterprise edition database was the strongest quarter in over three years. I think we had excellent execution on integrating the BEA acquisition and we're very pleased with the product integration milestones we've reached and the overall customer endorsement of the strategy and the product line.</p>
          <p>As Larry mentioned, the Gartner report on the database side that came out with their annual database vendor market share and once again it showed Oracle expanding its market share lead. According to Gartner, Oracle accounted for a 49% market share in database which is more than the next four vendors combined: IBM, Microsoft, Teradata and Sybase. Their report also showed Oracle gaining on Microsoft on the Windows platform as well. We grew 21% last year and Microsoft grew 16.5% according to Gartner.</p>
          <p>In addition we're seeing significant adoption of 11g on pace with the 10g adoption curve. We expect that momentum to continue. Since the August 2007 release of the Oracle Database 11g, we've had 450,000 downloads, over 200 ISVs have certified. Once customers upgrade they're all eligible for additional options such as Active Data Guard, advanced compression, total recall, and really important one, Real Application Testing, that one allows you to capture and replace work loads to test applications and we've now back ported that to 10g and 9iR2 so more customers can upgrade as they test their applications and get to 11g.</p>
          <p>There will be an additional 11g update this quarter that will contain some ease-of-use enhancements and a major dimension to the product line to be discussed next week. It's more than a feature, let's say. It puts Oracle into a new segment of the database market which should help us sustain the consistent market share gains we've enjoyed the last several years. So if you want to hear the details please come on out to OpenWorld in San Francisco next week.</p>
          <p>Short comment on the Linux platform, our Linux product continues to do well. Some name brand customers standardizing on us this quarter: State University of New York, Corning; Payless Shoe Stores (sic) [Payless ShoeSource] and Quantum Corp.</p>
          <p>Middleware area, we did a great job I think of actively integrating the BEA products lead by Thomas Kurian's team. The majority of the BEA employees were retained. We've reached over 5,000 BEA customers so we've been aggressive in getting out there in front of partners and customers. We've conducted half-day executive and technical briefings on BEA and Fusion Middleware with over 1,200 partners and launched a 70 city worldwide tour to welcome BEA customers and partners.</p>
          <p>Next week, 1,500 BEA User Group alumni are coming to OpenWorld which is the same amount they had at their entire conference prior to the acquisition so we haven't lost anyone. We also created a BEA Customer Strategy Council to get direct feedback from their largest 150 customers.</p>
          <p>On the product side, as part of the 100 day release plan for BEA products, we announced which products would be shipping. We delivered each one of them. A few of them talk about WebLogic Server 10g R3, JRockit Mission Control, and WebLogic Network Gatekeeper and several others. As part of that same 100 day plan that Thomas and I talked about when we did the webcast in July, there will be an additional 19 products certified on the WebLogic Server 10g R3 platform within the Oracle product line this quarter, and those are all on track.</p>
          <p>Some key customer wins, ESPN, a competitive win over the Microsoft on the .net platform; Capital One, some financial customers are still buying apps; city of New York, which was a broad platform deal; SOA [Service Oriented Architecture] Services for Marvel Entertainment; Nissan; big Oracle Business Intelligence wins with American Red Cross; Marsh &amp; McLennan; Content Management with Abu-Dhabi and the state of Kansas.</p>
          <p>In the application area, some key ERP wins with Daimler that was a win over SAP for HR and recruiting; Avon Products, that was a JD Edwards win; Illinois State University where we beat SunGard and SAP for PeopleSoft, HCO.</p>
          <p>CRM, we won at Farmers Insurance, that was a win over Salesforce and SAP. We also released two Fusion based applications in the quarter, one called Sales Prospector and the other one was Mobile CRM for the iPhone.</p>
          <p>In addition, we had a good wins for our Agile PLM [Product Lifecycle Management] product at Marvel and Clarion which is a subsidiary of Hitachi, G-Log Transportation Management we beat SAP at Dawn Foods and Oil Express and the largest supermarket retail chain in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Some very key strategic wins in core banking platform. Deutsche Bank chose us for the FLEXCUBE Private Banking, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale for the FLEXCUBE Universal Banking, and JP Morgan Chase for Reveleus for Credit and Operational Risk Management, sounds like of you should have bought that a year ago.</p>
          <p>And in retail, Carrefour, the largest retailer in Europe. In our Enterprise Tax product which we're pretty much the leading vendor there, not many off the shelf products there. We won the North Carolina Department of Revenue. They are going to move their tax system to an off the shelf product from Oracle.</p>
          <p>Telecommunications, Telecom Italia and Samsung Networks for Billing and Revenue Management and then some interesting go-lives in the quarter, Facebook went live on EBS r12, they went live in nine months, JDS Uniphase on r12 <mark type="inaudible" /> live in three months, and GMAI International went live On Demand and Land O' Lakes live on JD Edwards 8.12 and Hyperion.</p>
          <p>Overall we feel really good about where we sit. I think we are being viewed as a very safe partner for both customers and employees in the marketplace it is getting easier for us to hire from the competition and we have got some great upgrades, and key hires in key countries around the world. Our license organization is approaching 19,000 around the world and that's a key strength in the marketplace, and we look good from where we sit.</p>
          <p>I'll turn it back over to Roy.</p>

          <p>[Operating Instruction]. We'll go first to Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks a lot folks. Two questions. Just first on the margin side. You're off to a great start overall for the year. But Safra, could we really think about Fiscal '09 being yet another margin expansion year for you? I know with BEA folding in originally kind of thought it would be more flattish to slightly down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I actually expect us to continue to improve margins, as the operating leverage in the business really continues, as Larry mentioned, you know at our size, we have enormous economies of scale, both because of our back office and our distribution capability, but most importantly we have an enormous maintenance base. These are our existing customers paying us annually for the right to receive the newest software that we're writing and that's a very highly profitable part of our business because we're spending the 3 billion in R&amp;D already to build those products. So we expect margins to continue to expand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And even in a tough environment I'm presuming that still gets quite protected, because most &#x2013; a lot of it's coming out of that maintenance stream that's quite sticky; correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's extremely rare for a customer not to renew their maintenance contract. They still need to run their business, and our software is absolutely critical to really most of the industrialized world to run their businesses, so we're very much required and they are going to renew their maintenance contracts with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then could I just follow-up on geographic, anything that you saw, Europe weakening; I know it's a tough quarter because it's European summer, so it's hard to tell if it's weak or if it's just the summer, but it looks like apps in particular in Europe were perhaps weaker than normal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All you're really seeing, it was really nothing special at all about the quarter. Remember, it's Q1; small differences make a big difference, and it was a very difficult comparison, and that's really all you're seeing and because it's Q1 it's always the small quarter in comparison, obviously not in comparison to other companies, but in comparison to the Q4 that it follows; so smaller differences just have a larger impact percentage wise, nothing special at all this past quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, guys, and nice margin quarter as well. I had a question Safra, just in regards to the current macro environment and the impact of the volatility in the stock market is potentially going to have on deal closings. I think that's something a lot of the people in the market are concerned about. You mentioned you feel confident about your exposure to financial services. I was just wondering in the past you've shared with us your assumptions behind close rates for the upcoming quarter in terms of whether you are using in line with normal historicals or whether you might be being a little bit more conservative going into November given the environment we're in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, the close rates that I'm using are very much in line with where historical rates are. They move around a little bit quarter to quarter. There's nothing particularly special about these rates. I think they are sort of completely appropriate and consistent with previous years and quarters, etcetera, and what's going on right now. I've not gone out of my way to make any adjustment, actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can I &#x2013; the quick follow-up I have would be, what was your experience in August? Was your close rate in line with normal assumptions in the August quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. They were within, you know, sort of our normal range of close rates, but nothing special. It's a real nothing special quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll go next to Peter Goldmacher with Cowen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about when you all talk to customers if you're working through a big deal, what's generally their purchasing priority? Is it database capacity is far more important than applications? Is middleware more important than database capacity? How do services fit into that whole mix? I don't want to make more of an issue over the negative apps comp because I know it's off a really tough comp, but as you guys go forward, every impression I get is that spending intentions are softening a little bit and where would you expect to see it show up first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it all seems to be important. These are normally project driven and sometimes different buyers in the same company. So I'm not sure you can segment it like that. But these are things they're going to have to do eventually and where they fall, whether it's this quarter or next quarter they do get them done. These are customers who are normally buying from us who are already customers. They are extending their relationship and automating things that need to be automated and lowering their cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And let me add that if you look at the buying intentions we follow it pretty closely that the Oracle brand has bubbled to the top of a number of these surveys, and while there might be some softness in the overall number for buying intentions, Oracle has held up better than its peers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not -- it's clear with your results that you guys have held up better than your peers, but if I understand what Chuck is saying there's no real, your customers generally don't make a distinction between a database budget and an application budget, they just &#x2013; they either have budget or they don't and they plow through regardless?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think each customer has a different set of priorities. So it depends where they are, what they deem their most important investment is, if it's business intelligence, some are buying business intelligence some are moving to our SOA suite in middleware, some are expanding their database capability, others are putting in new CRM application. So it really varies an awful lot customer-by-customer. I don't think we can say any one product line is seeing more demand. I think we are taking more share because we're a relatively smaller middleware player than we are a database player so our middleware business is growing faster because we're taking share at a faster rate in middleware than we are in database, but we're taking share in both.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I had a couple questions, maybe fleshing out the strength in the technology business. Charles you mentioned that the core database was one of the stronger numbers you saw in I think three years you said. I was wondering if you could talk about why you think it was so strong in the quarter and then maybe update us on options and some of the other elements there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I do think 11G has been out long enough now, we've gotten an ISV base of around 200 like I said earlier that helps people who are waiting to upgrade and I think just the strength of the product and the relative lack of response from the competition, the distance between what we have and what everybody else has is widening which is I guess kind of hard to believe after 30 years but that still continues to be the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think more people are making standardization decisions and an awful lot of people are entering into license agreements where they are &#x2013; those license agreements reflect the fact they've decided to standardize their database going forward on the Oracle platform, and again that's why our share is growing. We're getting more and more of these standardization decisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we are seeing a bubble of migrations off the mainframe. That happens, it's hard to predict when that happens. I have a whole group focused on that and they have been doing very well the last couple quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terrific. If I could just ask a follow-up on BEA, it looked like the revenue numbers were a little bit better than I had expected and it was possibly maybe even a little bit more accretive than we had expected. It's obviously early days but could you just give us an update on where you think you are on the integration there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you're talking about operational integration with BEA, we're well along on all of it. We've got product roadmaps and products out. We're operationally one company as we were very, very quickly after the acquisition. It's going very, very well. Customers are delighted. We acquired BEA very much because it made a lot of sense for our customers and it was enormously important for us strategically to move to number one in middleware. So the reality is customers are delighted. They are voting, continue to vote with their pocket books and operationally, we're completely moved on and integrated, so everything is going very, very well at BEA. It was always a very good deal for us financially, and it's a fantastic deal for us strategically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think from a product perspective, this is one of the fastest starts we've ever had to product integration. We had a strategy of embracing standards and being hot-pluggable in the middleware area already. So many of our products already co-existed and interoperated with BEA, and we knew exactly what we wanted to do when we got in house and again, Thomas Kurian did a great job of delivering that in the first quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Safra, it sounded from your comments like the apps business while it is up against obviously a very tough comp, came in about as planned and just sort of two questions around that. One, I'm assuming by your comments that the pipeline in the applications business is building as you'd expect in the first quarter. And then secondly, we've heard obviously because of the macro environment and some competitors in that particular area becoming more aggressive on pricing and I just want to get a sense of whether or not you had some irrational pricing going on in some of the deals by say some of the smaller players, and if that had any impact in the quarter or not at all? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The apps pipeline is very healthy. The pipeline period at the company is overall very good, very healthy. We're very pleased with where we're at on that. As far as apps vendors getting irrational, I'll tell you, the apps business, as all our businesses, remain competitive and but there's nothing new at all. We're not seeing anything specific, anything new in pricing. Our win rates are extremely good, we're very pleased with them, and they continue to do very, very well. So it's simply a matter of just a very tough comparison. I mean imagine this business is just so much larger than it was just three years ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could ask one really quick follow-up for Charles just around the vertical markets for the applications business, were there any sort of standouts for you all this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the utilities business did a great job. That's utilities and tax, it's smaller numbers but in terms of customer wins and year-over-year growth we're finally getting our feet on the ground and getting some traction there and this tax market could be a large one since there's not really a product out there that for large organizations that need to collect taxes. They usually build that for many, many years, so that one stood out. We had some good design wins in financial services, and I think retail kind of hit their number, but the pipeline going into next quarter looks even better. So overall not bad for &#x2013; on the industry side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on the macro side. I know you said there is &#x2013; you really haven't seen a whole lot unusual and you continue to execute better than most, but as Safra said in the past you all read the papers too and you see what's happening out there and there's been other tech companies that have came out and said that they are starting to feel the softening out there, and you seem to be able to weather through that. I'm just curious, why do you think that's so and when do you think perhaps you might start to see it or give a little color around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we can't see into the far, far away future, and but I'll tell you, I mean the reality is that the company has so much momentum, such a broad product line that if a customer is buying, they're much more likely to buy from us because they have a lot of experience with us, and they still got to do whatever it is they need to do. It's very, if they've got to decide something not to spend on, it's probably with some smaller guy or something that's a little bit less strategic and less important. The company has just a lot &#x2013; has a very broad product line, has a lot of very dedicated, committed customers. We've got our big show is coming up next week. We've got over 40,000 folks showing up and so it's a real &#x2013; quite different than what you're reading or seeing in &#x2013; on CNBC But the truth is our business has a lot of momentum and we just continue to sort of have our heads down and continue to execute.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, thank you. And Safra just a quick follow-up on something you said earlier. You said that you don't adjust global pricing daily and so hence the constant currency rate issues, but I'm just curious how often do you adjust global pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anywhere from every six months to annually. It's dependent on how much movement there's been.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our final question from Brent Thill with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. You've been fortunate to generate $8 billion in operating cash flow. When you look at how you're redeploying that to M&amp;A versus buyback, I think Safra, you're on pace to equal the buyback of last year assuming you keep the 500 million a quarter, but that's still down from 4 billion the year before, so I guess when you look at balancing the buyback versus M&amp;A and Larry's comments about when the economy gets tougher you would potentially ramp up the M&amp;A machine, can you just walk through how you're thinking about that balance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, we actually bought back 4 billion two years ago, or more than two years ago actually. We've been sort of on this pace mostly because we needed the money to pay for Siebel and to pay for Hyperion and to pay for BEA. And so we've spent a couple billion back a year for the past couple of years now, and we have &#x2013; depending on what there is, we're somewhat opportunistic but we also look at things, acquisitions as how important they are for us strategically. And of course, we keep in mind where our own stock price is. And so we just are always looking at what's the best use of our cash. I can tell you one thing, we're not going to sit around on it necessarily. We're going to send it back to the shareholders or we're going to acquire things that give us earnings that the shareholders can then benefit from. So we're not going to necessarily load up a big pile of cash and sit on it. We're going to do one of two things: We're either going to spend it on deals that bring earnings to the bottom line or we're going to send it home to our shareholders.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. I know you mentioned Europe, but I think that's one area that we've been getting questions from your investors as it relates to the applications number being the weakest in that region, but just to stress that there was nothing unusual in Europe that you saw, just the comp was it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There really, you know, you have to look back on what went &#x2013; what happened in Europe last Q1. It was up 78%. Just there was nothing interesting happening in the Q1 of FY '09. It all has to do with the comparison to FY '08's Q1. That's all that's going on there. Small numbers, have a big impact, especially in Q1. Even within quarters, you know, that's why if you really want to understand the business, you really got to look at it trailing 12 months or annually. It's going to bounce around in the quarters when you have comparison, as you know, year-over-year, that are just so massive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So your expectation was applications will rebound to positive growth in Q2 and beyond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for the year we expect the applications business to grow, absolutely for the year, because it's a growing business and it's been growing. In any particular quarter, it could move around depending on what the comparison was especially as you start getting more and more granular by region. Then it's really bouncing around all over the place and you really &#x2013; you just look at the spreadsheets we issue with this release and you'll see that these things are bouncing around quite a bit quarter to quarter, very dependent on how tough or easy the comparison was a full quarter ago in that region.</p>
