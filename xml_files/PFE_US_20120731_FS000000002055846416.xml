          <p>Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's second quarter 2012 performance.</p>
          <p>I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Olivier Brandicourt, President and General Manager of Emerging Markets and Established Products; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Geno Germano, President and General Manager of Specialty Care and Oncology; Amy Schulman, General Counsel, President and General Manager of Pfizer Nutrition; and John Young, the President and General Manager of Primary Care.</p>
          <p>The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our homepage at Pfizer.com by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance, Second Quarter 2012 located in the Investor Presentations section in the lower right-hand corner of this page.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2011 annual report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.</p>
          <p>The discussions during this call will include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today, July 31, 2012.</p>
          <p>In addition, we will offer some brief comments regarding our preparation and target timeline for the potential initial public offering of a minority stake in our Animal Health business, Zoetis. As I'm sure you'll understand we are not going to be able to respond to questions on that subject in light of the quiet period imposed by the securities laws.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chuck.</p>
          <p>During my remark this morning I'll briefly discuss the quarter and provide some context concerning recent late stage pipeline developments.</p>
          <p>Beginning with the quarter, our performance was solid, noteworthy highlights include solid revenue and margin performance compared to the year-ago quarter, despite the negative revenue impact of $1.8 billion resulting primarily from the losses of exclusivity of Lipitor in most major markets as well as Caduet, Xalatan and Geodon in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We had strong performance in emerging markets with 14% operational growth quarter-over-quarter, driven by volume growth, mainly in key markets such as China and Russia as well as the timing of government purchase of Prevnar 13 in Turkey and Enbrel in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Of particular note, China grew 36% operationally, driven in large part by the targeted investments we have made in our Chinese <mark type="indiscernible" /> (3:25) sales force and the strength of our cardiovascular portfolio in China.</p>
          <p>We had greater expense discipline resulting from our ongoing efforts to streamline operations and focus R&amp;D programs. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted SI&amp;A expenses decreased 16% operationally and adjusted R&amp;D expenses decreased 18%.</p>
          <p>The Animal Health and Consumer Healthcare businesses achieved good operational performance quarter-over-quarter. Animal Health grew 7% and our Consumer Healthcare grew 11% driven primarily by the addition of products from the recent acquisition of Ferrosan and Alacer Corp.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to create value for shareholders through share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.3 billion of common stock and have purchased about $3 billion since the beginning of this year. On a full year basis, we expect to repurchase approximately $5 billion of common stock.</p>
          <p>Regarding Animal Health, we anticipate filing a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission by mid-August for a potential initial public offering of up to 20% ownership stake in the business, to be named Zoetis. We are targeting completion of the IPO in the first half of 2013. As we continue to work towards this potential IPO and the potential full separation, we remain open to all alternatives that would maximize the after-tax return for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Concerning the pending sale of the Nutrition business to Nestle, we remain on track to close the sale by the first half of 2013. We will work to maximize the after-tax proceeds and expect to allocate those proceeds to share repurchases, while also considering other value-creating opportunities with the return on share repurchases remaining the case to beat.</p>
          <p>Given our performance year-to-date, I believe we are well-positioned going into the second half of this year. By staying focused on our current course, we are building a sustainable innovative core and creating shareholder value.</p>
          <p>A few words about the innovative core. The actions we set in motion early in 2011 to improve R&amp;D productivity are starting to bear results. We have a pipeline that I believe includes potential high-value assets at all stages of the development continuum across our key therapeutic areas.</p>
          <p>Of particular note is the strength of our oncology, vaccines, inflammation and cardiovascular portfolios and our early stage portfolio is increasingly comprised of new therapies based on precision medicine approach, an approach we believe yields more targeting treatments for patients.</p>
          <p>We have precision medicine efforts underway at various stages of the pipeline across several therapeutic areas including diabetes, oncology, and cardiovascular. We have a sharp focus on the innovative core. I believe we're able to create a portfolio that matches our areas of expertise and it positions us for long-term growth.</p>
          <p>In terms of the late-stage pipeline, we're in ongoing discussions with the FDA about the regulatory reviews of Eliquis and tofacitinib and remain enthusiastic about the potential commercial prospects for each of these important therapies.</p>
          <p>Regarding Eliquis, as we and our alliance partners, Bristol-Myers Squibb previously said, the FDA has requested additional information on data management and verification from the Eliquis ARISTOTLE trial. They have not requested any new studies. And along with Bristol-Myers, we are working closely with the FDA and are confident we can address and resolve their questions. We will provide an update when we have new information to share on the status of the review.</p>
          <p>Concerning tofacitinib, as you know, the FDA Advisory Committee recommended approval on May 9th. Subsequent to that meeting, the FDA requested additional analysis of the existing data in our NDA. We are planning on providing them that information in early August. Given the timing of the additional analysis requested, we anticipate that the FDA may require additional time beyond the August 23 PDUFA date to review this information.</p>
          <p>In another tofacitinib development, we now have the top line results of our Phase III study, 1069, also known as ORAL Start. As a reminder, this study was conducted in methotrexate na&#xEF;ve, moderate to severe RA patients and it evaluated the use of tofacitinib in five or ten milligrams twice-daily doses as monotherapy compared to methotrexate. 1069 included a structural endpoint.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to share with you that the study met all of its primary endpoints at both the five and ten BID doses, including demonstrating statistically significant changes versus methotrexate in inhibiting structural damage. We are issuing a press release on these top line results following today's call and will provide more information about this study at upcoming scientific meetings.</p>
          <p>Because the study only recently read out, it was not part of our NDA submission and is not under FDA review. We are exploring the most appropriate method and timing to submit this information. Overall, we are confident in the efficacy and safety profile of tofacitinib and believe that it would make an important contribution to treatment of RA.</p>
          <p>And now, a few comments about the recent top line results for bapineuzumab study 302 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who carry the ApoE4 genotype. As we recently reported, study 302 did not meet the co-primary clinical endpoints, no statistically significant benefit was seen in changes in cognitive or functional performance in the bapineuzumab-treated group compared to placebo.</p>
          <p>Study 302 was the first of four placebo-controlled Phase III studies complete in the bapineuzumab development program. The Janssen-led study in non-carriers, Study 301, has just completed and the data is being evaluated. We plan to report the data to regulators and announce the top line results in August. Of note, both studies 301 and 302 have been accepted as late breaker presentations and will be presented at the European Federation for Neurological Society's meeting in Stockholm in September.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the second half of this year, we will continue to work on our cost structure inclusive of everything from manufacturing, corporate functions, our go to market strategy and continuing to execute on our existing R&amp;D plans. Our work across these areas should enhance our ability to create incremental value for our shareholders and invest in potentially new treatments that addressed unmet medical needs in such areas as cancer, neuroscience, pain and vaccines for infectious diseases.</p>
          <p>For the foreseeable future we expect that our operating environment will remain challenging and uncertain, especially in Europe and we will have to offset the impact of upcoming LOEs as well as expirations of co-promotion and licensing rights over the next couple of years as we embark on new product launches and generate growth in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Despite these challenging market forces, we are demonstrating through our quarterly performance both in this quarter and in recent quarters that the fundamentals of our business are strong, our capital allocation decisions are sound and our colleagues are skilled at navigating in uncertain and sometimes inconsistent markets. For these reasons, I remain optimistic about our ability to generate consistent, predictable earnings per share growth over time.</p>
          <p>To sum up, we turned in another quarter of solid performance. We remain enthusiastic about the potential commercial opportunities we see for tofacitinib, Eliquis and Prevnar 13 adult. We continue to build a track record of consistent performance that provides us with a firm foundation for steady future earnings per share growth.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Frank for additional details on the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone.</p>
          <p>As always, the charts I'm including today are included in our webcast. I want to remind you that the nutrition business is presented as a discontinued operation in consolidated statements of income for all periods presented, given the pending sale of that business to Nestle. As you know, discontinued operations are excluded from adjusted financial results and consequently throughout 2012, the results of the Nutrition business will be excluded from adjusted results.</p>
          <p>Now let's move on to the financials. Second quarter revenues of $15.1 billion decreased 9% year-over-year, reflecting an operational decline of approximately 6% driven mainly by the loss of exclusivity of several key products in certain geographies, notably Lipitor, in most major markets.</p>
          <p>Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.62 increased approximately 5%, which primarily reflects the favorable impact of lower expenses resulting from cost reduction and productivity initiatives and fewer weighted average shares outstanding due to our share repurchases and the unfavorable impact of the loss of exclusivity of certain products, including Lipitor in most major markets.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter revenues by 3% or $451 million and favorably impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&amp;A and adjusted R&amp;D expenses by $396 million or 4%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter adjusted diluted EPS by less than $0.01.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, emerging markets biopharmaceutical revenue increased 8% to approximately $2.6 billion reflecting operational growth of 14% and the negative impact of foreign exchange of 6%. Volume growth of 15% in emerging markets, primarily in China and Russia, were partially offset by price reductions of 1%, resulting in the operational growth of 14%.</p>
          <p>The second quarter emerging markets biopharmaceutical revenues, approximately 41% was generated by Established Products, 33% by Specialty and Oncology products, and 26% by Primary Care products. Established products revenues generated by sales in emerging markets increased 17% operationally year-over-year. Specialty Care and Oncology total revenues in emerging markets increased 14% operationally and Primary Care revenues in emerging markets increased 12% operationally.</p>
          <p>With respect to BRIC-MT markets, second quarter biopharmaceutical revenues increased 12% to approximately $1.2 billion, reflecting operational growth of 20% and the negative impact of foreign exchange of 8%. Of the second quarter, BRIC-MT biopharmaceutical revenues, approximately 42% was generated by Established Products, 32% by Specialty and Oncology products and 26% by Primary Care products. Revenues for Established Products sold in BRIC-MT markets increased 24% operationally, year-over-year, Specialty Care and Oncology total revenues in BRIC-MT markets grew 21% operationally and Primary Care revenues in BRIC-MT markets grew 13% operationally.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, biopharmaceutical volume growth of 24% in the BRIC-MT markets was partially offset by price reductions of 4% resulting in operational growth of 20%. These markets contributed about 62% of emerging market biopharmaceutical operational growth versus second quarter 2011. Year-to-date operational growth in the BRIC-MT markets was 15% versus the year-ago period, reflecting volume growth of 20%, partially offset by price reductions of 5%. We're reaffirming all components of our 2012 financial guidance, which we updated in our first quarter, 2012 earnings announcement in May, to exclude the results of the Nutrition business from our revenue guidance and our adjusted financial guidance.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter results reflect our continued solid operational performance, despite the negative impact of the loss of exclusivity for certain products in most major markets, mainly Lipitor in the U.S. and in most major markets.</p>
          <p>We anticipate filing a registration statement with the SEC by mid-August for a potential initial public offering of up to a 20% ownership stake in the Animal Health business to be named Zoetis. We are targeting the first half of 2013 to complete the potential IPO. As we continue to work toward a potential separation of the business, we remain open to all alternatives to maximize the after-tax return for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>We expect to complete the sale of our Nutrition business to Nestle by the first half of 2013. Additional repurchases of our common stock remain the case to beat for the use of the after-tax proceeds following the completion of the transaction. Given the potential of our late-stage and emerging pipeline, our strong operating cash flow, streamlined organization and disciplined approach to capital allocation, we remain confident that we are well positioned for long-term success.</p>
          <p>Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2012 and beyond with approximately $3 billion or 136.6 million shares repurchased through July 30, and we continue to expect to repurchase approximately $5 billion of our common stock in 2012.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Frank. And at this point, operator, if we could please poll the participants for questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. I actually have a number of questions. But maybe, Ian, if you could just start with bigger picture, given the activity around Nutritionals and Animal Health, if you could frame for the investment community, your thinking around how you envision the reshaping of Pfizer, post the Nutritionals and Animal Health spin, what is Pfizer going to look like? And do you envision an opportunity to further reshape the portfolio going forward?</p>
          <p>Secondly, for you, Frank, is it safe to assume that the changes in the FX rate, since you reported your first quarter and obviously the euro has dropped quite a bit, would have an impact on the balance of 2013, but that you are able to absorb it and how?</p>
          <p>And then my third question, back to you, Ian, and I'm sure there are a million other questions on the call, relates to the animal health spin. Is there a minimum timeline for which you would have to wait to spin the 80% of the animal health business that you would continue to own after the partial IPO? Just trying to get a sense for how quickly you could fully monetize the entire business once you've taken the 20% to the market. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jami. I'll ask Frank actually to handle both the FX and the Animal Health and the minimum spin time.</p>
          <p>And as to your first question about reshaping, when we've completed, I think we've discussed this several times. When we've completed the separation of Nutritional and the potential separation of Animal Health, I basically see us as a company that has two core businesses, with consumer fitting into either one of those. But the two core businesses, one being what we could call Innovative Co. or Growth Co. and the other being a value company being represented by large brands, sold around the world with reasonably large infrastructure, good channel presence; and the Innovative Co. being a company which has growth from innovative products, a research organization sized for that size of that opportunity.</p>
          <p>And we have started already down this path of managing the company that way by our BU structure where we have basically Innovative Co. inside the BU structures of Specialty and Oncology and Primary Care. And then outside of that, we manage emerging markets in a more traditional method of country-based organizations. So you know, through 2013 and 2014, we'll continue to refine our operational structure to maximize the values of those two distinct businesses and we will see how the value of those two businesses are reflected in our growth and on our share price and then take decisions based on that.</p>
          <p>Frank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks, Ian. So, Jami, on the FX question, if you look at our basket of currencies and you look from our last earnings call where our guidance was based on mid-April rates and you look at this earnings call, where our guidance is based on mid-July FX rates, currency has moved against us and it's moved against us for the year to the tune of a few cents and we absorbed that in our guidance and obviously reaffirmed guidance as a result.</p>
          <p>The way we did that was through a combination of things but primarily our cost reduction and productivity initiatives. If you look at our numbers for the quarter on a year-over-year basis, our adjusted cost of sales, our adjusted SI&amp;A and our adjusted R&amp;D all-in were down about 12% operationally. And so it's that performance and it's down 10% operationally on a year-to-date basis that allowed us to mitigate the adverse effect of foreign exchange from the previous quarter to this quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of the other question you asked about the timeline on Animal Health and make sure I've got it right which was from the time of the potential IPO to the time of I'll call it the potential full separation, what are we thinking about? I'll tell you how we think about this, which is, typically, you want a quarter or two of some operational performance of the company so you can demonstrate what I call the rhythm of the businesses. So I think one will be, you know, you want a quarter or two of operating performance to demonstrate rhythm and then, two, the other thing that will inform us is the macroeconomic conditions, what's going on in the markets and I think those things in combination will drive the timeline between a potential IPO and then a potential full separation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. I'll ask three quick ones upfront. First, on Eliquis, were the issues raised by the FDA in the CRL [Complete Response Letter] likely to be raised by other regulatory bodies around the world? And have you been proactive about that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, Ian, what's your latest thinking on whether to weed or feed your generic business over the coming months and years?</p>
          <p>And third, can you talk about the decision to drop the Acura program and what can we read into regarding EMBEDA, Remoxy and your commitment to that franchise? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gregg. Well, I'm going to ask John to answer the Eliquis question and also the Acura question.</p>
          <p>Regarding weed or feed our generic business, I mean, we have Greenstone in the U.S. It's a well-run business. It's a &#x2013; I think it's an important part of our overall established products presence. We continue to invest, where appropriate, in branded generics and generics. We take a regional approach to that. We've done investments in Brazil. We've done investments in China. We take &#x2013; this is a very local business and we've committed to being successful and a presence in these BRIC-MT markets, so we will continue to be opportunistic on how we strengthen those businesses.</p>
          <p>John, would you take the Eliquis and the Acura question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Gregg, if I take Eliquis, first of all, as we obviously previously stated, the CRL that we received from the FDA requested some additional information on the data management verification from our pivotal ARISTOTLE study, which, as you know was a very big study, around about 18,000 patients with atrial fibrillation.</p>
          <p>I think one point which is really important to make is that it's our belief that the information requested doesn't impact the outcome measures of the trial and importantly, as Ian has already said, we haven't been requested to conduct any additional studies. We're confident in the results from both the ARISTOTLE trial and AVERROES trial hasn't changed.</p>
          <p>In terms of our discussions with other regulators around the world, both in the E.U. and other countries, those discussions are progressing, in line with the timelines per our filing dates that we previously announced.</p>
          <p>If I then pick up on the King products, just to give you an update on where we are there with EMBEDA, as we previously communicated, we're very confident that we'll be able to return EMBEDA to the marketplace. We expect to submit a prior approval supplement to the FDA by the first half of 2013.</p>
          <p>On Remoxy, as we previously stated there, based on the work completed by our technical team over the past several months, we remain cautiously optimistic we'll be able to bring Remoxy to the marketplace.</p>
          <p>We have preliminary results from two bio availability studies that are currently being analyzed along with data from experiments designed to optimize the formulation composition and analytical methods for that product. Upon completion of those analyses, we'll determine the timing and the nature of our engagement with the FDA to address the Complete Response Letter that we received in June last year. At this time we're certainly hoping to meet with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>So lastly if I could just pick up briefly on Acura, we decided to return the license development and commercialization rights to three smaller, early stage, immediate release assets to our development partner Acura, based on our ongoing portfolio prioritization for not only our opioid portfolio, but in line with our standard practice.</p>
          <p>I think it's important to say, in regard to those particular technologies, that immediate release wasn't a high priority area for Pfizer, but we do continue to work on Oxecta that was launched earlier on this year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. First, can you help us just quantify on Prevnar, some of the one-offs just so we understand what the underlying growth is for Prevnar?</p>
          <p>Second, can you talk about where you are in taking expenses out of the business? I mean, are we halfway through the nine-inning game? Are we 3/4 of the way through? I know you've talked about Europe as an area that you're really focusing on and trying to take some costs out. Could you give us some specifics on what you have left to do there?</p>
          <p>Third, on the gross margin, can you just remind us again, what's going on, kind of behind the scenes on the gross margin which seems to be much stronger than we would expect. I didn't hear the numbers that you had called out, as far as FX-related. I was just curious, obviously with Lipitor going off, everyone thought the gross margin would fall off much more and yet it's not. Thanks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Marc. I'll ask Frank to take the European gross margin first probably and then ask Geno to make comments on overall vaccine growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on gross margins, let me run the numbers and then I'll answer the question which is &#x2013; and I'll do it in terms of just of cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue.</p>
          <p>So this quarter it was 17.7%, it was down from 18.3% in the year-ago quarter but if you adjust that 17.7% for foreign exchange, it was actually about 19%, which is, I'll call it in line with the guidance we provided for the year. Now, what's going on there, Marc, is clearly the benefit of cost reductions and I'll talk to that in the second question that you asked me. And what's kind of working against that, was really the impact of Lipitor. When you put that altogether, you get the 17.7% that we reported, but it had the benefit of foreign exchange, which, if you removed, would take it to about 19%.</p>
          <p>The FX benefit to COGS this quarter was about $285 million, so it reduced COGS by $285 million, which is how I get from the 17.7% to the 19% or so.</p>
          <p>In terms of where we are, and I think you said, you know, you used the baseball analogy in terms of what inning are we relative to cost reduction, I would describe it as we're not in the early innings anymore. I think we're clearly in the middle innings, but clearly with opportunities quite frankly throughout the business. We continue to work on things like streamlining our manufacturing network through productivity initiatives and working on the productivity of each of our individual plants. We've announced that over the next several years, we believe we can further reduce our plant network by another ten facilities or so, so still lots of opportunities there.</p>
          <p>In SI&amp;A, we continue to streamline our corporate functions. In R&amp;D we continue to execute on our engine for sustainable innovation product in terms of the therapeutic areas that we focused on and the therapeutic areas that we discontinued and the work we do in those areas. So if I had to net it all out, I'd say we're in the middle innings and there's still &#x2013; with everything that we've accomplished, there's still significant opportunities going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Marc, just to comment on Prevnar, on the Pediatric business, business is good in Europe and the United States and what we're seeing now is a return to kind of the stable growth that we've experienced in the past now that the catch-up opportunity is fundamentally completed. So we're looking at, you know, quarterly and year-to-date results on developed markets that are similar to a baseline that we can expect going forward.</p>
          <p>Japan, we're continuing to see strong growth as the formal national immunization program is continuing to roll out there. Remember, that's Prevnar 7 and we're continuing through the registration process to introduce the 13 valent and expect to pursue a catch-up opportunity when we do have the 13 valent there as well. And then in the emerging markets we continue to see very strong growth of the Prevnar business for the quarter and year-to-date on what's becoming a reasonable base now, not just good growth on a small base.</p>
          <p>On the adult side, we're making good progress. As you know, in the U.S. this is a business that's driven by ACIP recommendations. Fortunately, the ACIP did make a recommendation to support immunization of immuno-compromised patients &#x2013; that's a good step in the right direction. We've also seen progress with some quality measures through CMS that we expect to help open the door for additional growth for Prevnar adult going into the end of the year and the beginning of next year and around the world we continue to see registrations in all of the developed and emerging markets for adult and we're starting to see, you know, promotion and some limited uptake there as we start to introduce the adult vaccine on a global basis.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Congrats actually on a really nice quarter. I had a couple questions. The first you may not answer, but I thought I'd ask it. On bapineuzumab, is there a consideration that you may file in the non-carriers group even if you miss your primary endpoint but see interesting signals in sub groups?</p>
          <p>The second question's on EM. This plus 14% year-on-year is very impressive and well above your annual guidance. I was looking for a little bit more color on that. Do you recommend we extrapolate that forward or should we keep kind of long-term growth rates a little lower than that?</p>
          <p>Third, on tofa, any more color on what the FDA has asked for and can you get the Oral START data in the FDA's hands before they write the label? I ask specifically around structural progression.</p>
          <p>And finally, a really quick one, I know you guys have said in the past you plan on breaking out &#x2013; sorry, you said you were considering breaking out the value business versus the growth business for reporting purposes in the Ks and Qs next year. I'm just wondering where that decision stands? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mark. Well, you're quite right where we can't comment on the bapi situation. We haven't seen the results of the trial yet. It's still blinded to us, so when we have those results, we'll think about all the things you asked the questions on.</p>
          <p>On breaking out the Value and Growth Co, once we get through the potential separation of Animal Health and the separation of Nutritional, we'll step back and look at the business and see what is the best way to ensure that the analysts have transparency onto what we see as the core drivers of the business. So we want to be transparent there.</p>
          <p>With that, I would ask perhaps, if Olivier could give a little bit more context around emerging markets, the growths in different marketplaces, and on tofa, Geno may want to make some comments on tofa for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in emerging we continue to be optimistic and we see attractive opportunities across emerging markets. And all of that, of course, related to increased population and to what we are seeing produced by the nations and the low amount, which is currently spent on healthcare, of course.</p>
          <p>So as you have seen, we have posted 14% operational growth for Q2. And it's driven by very good performance in BRIC-MT. You've seen the results for BRIC-MT is about 20% operationally, but it's 24% in term of volume growth and there is an impact of 4%. So, we will continue, we know that, to expect and to see quarter-to-quarter productivity in emerging markets. And it's more appropriate, probably to look at results on a 12-month basis and our goal for this year and future years is to grow our emerging market business by high single-digits over time.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Thank you, Olivier.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So with regard to tofa, we see the review progressing very nicely. We filed the NDA at the end of last year. We had a very quick Advisory Committee meeting in May, a very positive outcome. In fact, the only thing material that the Advisory Committee would have liked to have seen more of is more structure data and now we have the additional structure data. So we see that as a positive development.</p>
          <p>With regard to the analyses that the FDA has requested, it's basically a routine analyses. It's a very large NDA. We have 5 Phase III pivotal trials, 5,000 patients and they've asked for some additional analyses. This is very common to request additional analyses and even to do their own analyses, and we're busy putting that together. And we plan to have it to them, certainly ahead of the action date, so that they can determine their next step.</p>
          <p>So with regard to the 1069 structure data, the FDA is aware that we have the top line results, and we will find the most appropriate way to get the data to them, for consideration in future labeling.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions on Prevnar 13 then a couple others. Can you get any real commercial traction in Adults ahead of CAPiTA or does it all really depend on that? Also have you done an interim look at those results? I believe one was built into the protocol.</p>
          <p>On tofacitinib do you expect to get both the five- and the ten-milligram doses approved?</p>
          <p>And then last question, in terms of the next round of pipeline products beyond the ones like tofacitinib and Eliquis what are the two or three products that excite you the most?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Tim. So we'll ask Geno to discuss the Adult vaccination opportunity in Prevnar 13 and the tofa question on dose and then ask Mikael Dolsten to comment a little bit on the next wave of products. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I mean, with Prevnar 13 Adult, look, what we know is that there's a huge disease burden out there. We've &#x2013; I think I've quoted these statistics many times before. In the U.S. we know there's 300,000 hospitalizations a year for pneumococcal pneumonia, 20,000 deaths associated with pneumococcal pneumonia. So we believe there is an opportunity to build a business on the basis of just the need for the vaccine alone. But having said that, it's true that it is a &#x2013; historically in the vaccine business, it's CDC recommendations that are the real drivers and the CDC recommendation is likely to be most influenced by the CAPiTA trial.</p>
          <p>So we're going to do the best we can to build this business from the ground up from now until we have those CAPiTA results and certainly the CAPiTA results will be a major driver. And hopefully that gives you a sense for what our thinking is.</p>
          <p>In terms of the interim look on the CAPiTA trial the interim look I believe was only to give a sense for how many events had occurred and we don't have any insight into the number of events that have occurred in the placebo group versus the vaccinated group. So we don't have any insight into early read on effectiveness. As you know, this is an event-driven trial and we'll have a final result when there are an accumulation of enough events to determine the outcome.</p>
          <p>With regard to tofa, 5 milligrams and 10 milligrams, I think the question was do we expect both? We certainly believe that we've demonstrated through the five pivotal trials that we've done, a very consistent and robust effect of both the 5 and the 10 milligram, at a certainly acceptable safety profile. So the Advisory Committee had a review of the two doses and we know that they were supportive of both doses. We know rheumatologists would like to have both doses available and we believe that our NDA supports both doses. So that's our feeling on the two doses.</p>
          <p>And I don't know if the next round of innovative products was...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so thank you for showing interest in our rich portfolio beyond tofacitinib, RA and Eliquis. So I'll just give you a couple of example in four of our therapeutic areas.</p>
          <p>In vaccines, you will see a really rich pipeline evolving. We have agreed with regulators in major regions about mening B study design and we are starting the Phase 3 now. We've also had a very exciting staph aureas program where we are industry-leading and we have completed the first Phase II and are heading into the second Phase II.</p>
          <p>Oncology, as Ian alluded to, is really a growing, exciting area for us. We have inotuzumab as the leading antibody drug conjugate for hematological malignancies and also best in class dacomitinib for lung cancer, based again on precision medicine. And you may not have seen our CDK drug that's going into breast cancer, also based on precision medicine.</p>
          <p>Finally, immunology and inflammation, please note our lifecycle management of tofacitinib going into inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis but also our really best in class IL-6 antibody for both lupus and inflammatory bowel disease opportunity. And also beyond Eliquis in cardio metabolic you should keep an eye on programs such as pancreatic leukokinase activator and also a PCSK9 field.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just had a few here.</p>
          <p>First, on the gross margin trends, looking at your second half, I think to hit  the midpoint of your range it does imply a fairly substantial drop in margins. Could just elaborate a little bit more on that? I know we had some currency benefit first half but it does seem like quite a big step down.</p>
          <p>The second question was on the established product division. I think we've had new leadership there since our last call. I mean is there any change in focus or priorities for that division?</p>
          <p>And then finally one that I don't know if you'll comment on, but as we think about the value versus established or versus growth core here, when we get out to 2014 or 2015, you've had more time to evolve the strategy and if we're not getting the value for those businesses in your share price, would you be open to splitting those franchises apart? Or do you see meaningful structural issues that would not allow you to do that given the shared resources? Is that even something let's say that's on the table as we look out a few years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so on the established I'll ask Frank answer the gross margin question in a moment.</p>
          <p>On established products and emerging markets. Olivier Brandicourt has taken over the leadership of those two areas. He has a long experience in pharmaceuticals, both in emerging markets and developed markets. So, I would ask him to make a brief comment on what he sees vis-&#xE0;-vis the established products.</p>
          <p>But before he does that, on the question on Value and Growth Co., you know, we are focused at Pfizer on shareholder value and ensuring shareholder value so we will evaluate those questions you posed and we will take the decisions that are &#x2013; that will best drive shareholder value at that time. I think that's the best way really to answer that question and one that we continue to show that we are focused on ensuring shareholder value is optimized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On established products, I must say I'm very optimistic and I see very attractive opportunities with this business, which is very new to me. So, we have a strategy which looks at both segments of the LOE market: brands and generics. For the brands, we are trying to leverage our leadership, not only in quality, but also in reliability of supply, which has been a problem as you know, in many countries, and also in the enhancement of product value.</p>
          <p>For the generics themselves, we focus our investment in different, what we call profitable pockets of the market and more specifically, the sterile injectable and oral solids when they are very much differentiated. So we posted about 18% operational growth during Q2 and of course, that was very much driven by the fact that we had inherited in this division a few LOE products and Lipitor being the largest one both in the U.S. and in Japan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Olivier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thanks, Olivier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the second half COGS, relative to the first half, what I'm going to is I'm going to bump it up a level and talk not just about COGS, but about earnings as well in terms of the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. We've got a couple of factors that will impact all the second half of the year or a portion of the second half of the year that didn't impact the first at all or impacted it only partially, these are, I'll call them negative factors.</p>
          <p>So for example, in the U.S. with Lipitor, Lipitor began facing multi-source generic competition in the U.S. on May 30th, so not an impact for the entire first half of the year, but that'll be an impact for the second half of the year. That'll obviously adversely affect cost of goods solid, it's also adversely affect EPS. Same thing in Lipitor in Europe, where once again, began facing multi-source generic competition in March and May, so you'll get the full year effect of that, at least the second half you'll get the full impact of that.</p>
          <p>Now the same thing with Geodon, which in the U.S. began facing multi-source generic competition in March of this year. Then if you go out for the remainder of the year, we have anticipated LOEs for Detrol in the U.S. and Europe and Revatio in the U.S. in September, which will adversely affect earnings and that has an impact on our overall line, you know, things like cost of goods sold as well.</p>
          <p>So it's those kinds of factors that we factored into our guidance that'll impact the second half of the year that didn't have as much of an impact the first half of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Three questions. Many of the pressure points, Frank, you just identified will linger into 2013. Would you be able to provide any perspective on 2013, relative to the trend versus 2012? Can we anticipate an up year, a flat year or what?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Spiriva, what markets has Pfizer already given back to BI and what significant markets are to be given back in the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, did you formally drop your follow-on CETP inhibitor and if so, was it because the agent wasn't optimal or do you feel the area is too speculative? Thank you so much. Bye.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, Frank, if you could handle the impact into 2013 and then we would ask John, if you could take the question on Spiriva and then finally Mikael on the CETP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So in terms of what I said in the previous question, relative to the second half of the year and then how that impacts 2013, let me just start with we haven't provided guidance yet on 2013. That's something we'll do obviously later on. But in terms of just, I'll call it positive items and negative items, I went through some of the negative items.</p>
          <p>Some of the positive items that'll have a positive rhythm going into 2013 include strength things like the strength in some our inline products. So for example, this past quarter Lyrica, Enbrel, Prevnar 13, Celebrex all had very strong operational growth. Lyrica globally 18%, Enbrel 15%, Prevnar 13 14%, Celebrex 7% and internationally, even stronger growth rates. So for example, Prevnar 13 internationally grew 33%. These are all year-over-year operationally. So certain key products in the inline portfolio have been growing very nicely. We expect those to continue to grow nicely going into 2013.</p>
          <p>Our new products, things like Xalkori, Inlyta, those are products that we expect and then obviously the products that we talked about before, like Eliquis, for example.</p>
          <p>Then geographic expansion. So we had emerging market growth this past quarter of 14%, 15% on volume. BRIC MT markets grew 20% operationally, 24% on volume. We expect to continue to see growth in those areas as well.</p>
          <p>And then obviously we'll continue to try to allocate our capital in ways that will be an enabler of growth on a going-forward basis. Those are some of the positive rhythms and the negative ones that'll impact 2013 and we'll provide guidance on 2013 like we always do when we close out this year and provide guidance for 2013.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Frank. John, could you make comments on Spiriva?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks for your question, Steve. So based on our ten-year contract with Boehringer Ingelheim, the termination date differs country by country and it's calculated from the launch date of the product in each country. So E.U. countries will begin contract exit in the 2012, 2013 period. U.S., Japan in 2014 and the last country is finishing in 2016 aligned with our contract.</p>

          <p>Yeah, as you know, we are not as well originally interested in CETP inhibitors as a means to help regulate good cholesterol HDL and reverse cholesterol transport. Our view, currently, is that, that field has uncertainty and we haven't been keen in progressing until there is more science that understands the potential role of these mechanisms as a way of change risk factors in cardiovascular disease. Instead, we think further focus on LDL lowering and also anti-inflammatory mechanism has to be the main focus now.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Catherine Arnold from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. First of all on tofa, I wondered, your comments about the START study and achieving your primary endpoint on all doses, both very positively. Obviously with the Advisory Committee, there was some debate regarding the radiographic changes and the implications of those, with Pfizer coming out with one dose having a positive effect and the FDA coming out with a different answer based on a different analytical method. I guess I just wondered, could you express your confidence that there won't be this difference of opinion in terms of the radiographic effect of both doses?</p>
          <p>And then on bapi, I wondered if you could comment, if you will address any polled data findings in press releases prior to the meeting in Sweden?</p>
          <p>And I know you'll love this last question, I can't help myself but it's in regards to your definition of top line and what you're putting in the press release, should we assume that when you report study 301 that, that definition will continue to be nothing below the primary endpoint on efficacy? Meaning if there are any trends positive or negative in the sub-populations, we won't know that until Sweden. And then I would assume the top line definition, and this is going to a conversation with Chuck, in regards to the side effects with an instance of greater than 1%? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Catherine. I didn't quite understand the question on poll on bapi. Could you just expand on that, what were you trying to get at? You can't come back, okay. Well then we'll go to tofa with Geno. We'll try and answer your bapi question and we'll also go to the top line question you have with John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Catherine. Just to comment on the structure data. The data, as you know, that was presented to the Advisory Committee and discussed during the Advisory Committee was from 1044 and in that study, we had a different population. These were patients who had experienced methotrexate for the most part. One of the design challenges for that trial was that the patients were on placebo for a very short period of time and then their structure progression was extrapolated.</p>
          <p>I think it was acknowledged by the Advisory Committee that this is a very difficult study design to demonstrate the difference in structure progression between the active group and the placebo group. What we found in that study was that neither the placebo group nor the tofa group progressed very much and the separation was significant at the ten milligram, but not at the five milligram on the primary analysis, other secondary analysis did demonstrate significance at both five and ten.</p>
          <p>So there was a lot of discussion around the study design and why the results were what they were and the sensitivity analyses. I think it was acknowledged that it was a difficult way to demonstrate a difference in structure.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the 1069 study is a different study and a different patient population. These are patients that hadn't been exposed to methotrexate. They were progressing more rapidly in their disease and the separation between methotrexate and tofacitinib is much more pronounced and clearly there was significance at both the five and 10 milligram doses.</p>
          <p>I think this absolutely establishes the disease modifying capability of the drug and that's what the FDA should be basing their decision on.  So we feel pretty good about these results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the only thing I'd add to that is of course there's a timing issue. The FDA hasn't formally got the 1069 and so we'll have to see how we best incorporate that into the eventual label of tofacitinib.</p>
          <p>Olivier, could you answer the bapi questions if you understood them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hopefully, Catherine, you will have the answer to your question. Just as the stage is updating so we have announced last week of course the 302 co-primary end point results, and we believe that was the right decision to make, not only to inform regulatory authorities but also the right decision for patients and investigators because patients needed to be re-consented in the overall program, in the entire program.</p>
          <p>So second decision we've made was &#x2013; as an alliance was to expedite the interim analysis on the ongoing 301, the international carrier study. The results will help us inform the risk benefit profile of the asset and we know that we have enough patients who have completed this study to do a pretty strong interim analysis and futility analysis.</p>
          <p>So the other decision we made was for the extension study. We have discontinued that study because we think the clinical benefit was just not demonstrated.</p>
          <p>To your question regarding 301, 301 will be reported to you in the format of top line results and only co-primary end points will be reported and that will happen during the month of August.</p>
          <p>And finally all results, including secondary endpoints and biomarkers, all of that will be reported, as you know, in Stockholm, early September.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Olivier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink Swann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question. So first off for Ian, as we kind of look forward at the different opportunities in the business, what aspects are you most excited about? Are you really more excited about what you're seeing in the innovation portion of the business? And if there are products that you would call out that you're particularly excited about given your long history, which ones would you call out? And then and again more on the sort of the near term and longer term pipeline if you would.</p>
          <p>Second, as it relates to tofacitinib, Geno, maybe you could just comment on should we think about this data that FDA has requested as the typical, major amendment type of situation that normally results in a three-month addition, obviously not speaking for the FDA, but more just speaking in your experience.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, as it relates to bapineuzumab, Mikael, if you could just kind of give us your thoughts on biomarkers that would be important to future development of bapineuzumab as we look at the data. Should we really be focusing in on PIB-PET markers or should we be looking at CSF tau as a potential marker going forward? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Seamus. So on the tofacitinib question, I think you expressed it well in the way you described the type of data that the FDA is requesting. We're not speaking for the FDA, we continue to work with them, but we would look at the way you expressed it as being very similar to the way we see it and we'll just have to wait and see what happens with the FDA.</p>
          <p>On the &#x2013; what I'm excited about frankly, is I'm excited about the state of the company, about the imperatives we have, about what we're doing on fixing the innovative core and seeing real momentum and enthusiasm, both at the ground level with the colleagues who are working in research and R&amp;D and also excited about our opportunity as a global company in emerging markets with our strategies in the BRIC-MT, driving our inline brands and also looking to launch our innovative products in those marketplaces.</p>
          <p>So while emerging markets will be turbulent, will have ups and downs, there is, in a way, an irreversible move to higher GDP, higher healthcare spend, which represents a huge opportunity for an innovative company like Pfizer to be successful in, over the short, medium and long-term. So the emerging markets is a really exciting place for us, for all of our portfolio and in the developed world, in Japan, the growing strength of innovative core is also hugely promising, both in oncology with dacomitinib, with inotuzumab with the CDK program, with Xalkori and the potential for Xalkori in CMET, which is a large opportunity.</p>
          <p>Our inflammation portfolio and the expansion of tofacitinib into other extensions such as Crohn's and U.C.</p>
          <p>Our vaccine program is extremely strong. We have one of the best vaccine teams in the industry and we have a broad vaccine opportunity. We continue to invest in CV, both PCSK9 and the other molecules that Mikael mentioned.</p>
          <p>So frankly, I'm enthusiastic about the short-term and very enthusiastic about what I see coming through from now to the next five years as our pipeline matures with a very strong, Phase I, Phase II program.</p>
          <p>The remaining question was to Mikael on...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Biomarkers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On biomarkers. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you already mentioned the ones that are most widely monitored in the field. On one hand PIB-PET to look at the amyloid, are you lowering amyloid, that's number one and are you affecting downstream signs of damage such as p-tau level in CSF, I think those will be very important and we'll see what we learn from this study and over time, you'll also see incorporation of more early psychometric sensitive tests as this field moves forward.</p>
          <p>Olivier, do you want to add your point on top of this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only point I can make is refer to what we have in the current program, which answers, I think, partially the question. So we do have PET-PIB as a marker of amyloid, but with CSF we are looking for amyloid a beta and tau, and we also have volumetric MRI. So that gives you already a sense of what we are doing already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you, Olivier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Ian, you didn't call out Inlyta and Xalkori with respect to overall products and what those revenues may be. While they may represent precision medicine, as you've alluded to, the question is, are you putting additional resources behind them? And then what lessons have you learned with respect to R&amp;D that may help you win next generation precision medicine in oncology, for example comes out or would it be more, to Seamus' point, more to have biomarkers available at that time and be utilized with those medicines?</p>
          <p>The second question is around, again, emerging markets, tremendous operational growth of 14%, especially when you look at 9% in Q1. I'm interested in what changed between Q1 and Q2 other than a couple of the tenders that really led to that jump?</p>
          <p>Lastly, and to be fair, in Q1 in August, I think it was Olivier that made the reference that once the 301 study was available, you would announce the data in tandem for bapineuzumab and I am just  curious and I haven't heard it yet, what actually changed with respect to splitting out 301 and 302? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So Tony in Inlyta and in Xalkori, you know, probably an oversight given the richness of the number of products I wanted to mention. We're extremely excited about Inlyta, it's going well on its first launch. I think this product has a lot of legs to it and a lot of opportunity. It's going to be a product that I think its profile will develop over time. We are very optimistic about its performance in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>And with Xalkori, I think the issue on Xalkori is we're changing medical practice. We need to get doctors to have the tests done to identify the specific need for Xalkori. It's frankly, slower than we expected to achieve the changes given the 3% to 5% of the population that may have the translocation. But we will continue to invest in that. As I said, I think Xalkori may have substantial opportunity on the CMET side as well.</p>
          <p>Mikael, do you want to comment a little bit on what you see, what we've learned on the precision medicine side and the strategies we use? And then I'd ask Olivier to comment further on the reason for the change on what we previously announced on bapineuzumab.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Ian said, it's very exciting to be a pioneer in bringing such a transforming product as Xalkori forward. I think the two things you know on the learning side, currently the diagnostic practice is very much one, test one drug and I would like see that change so you know, it will be a panel of tests for a disease like lung cancer that I think will drive the utilization of the first drug and multiple drugs and grow the marketplace and also the need to engage all the players that are involved in precision medicine from the treating medical oncologist to the pathologist, and also to the diagnostic labs and the payers. I think as this layer of precision medicine stakeholders become more familiarized, I think we will see even more significant momentum and the way you develop those relationships, I think we're in a unique position given our learnings here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Tony, on emerging markets, so we have a very clear set of 3 or 4 strategies which we are applying in emerging markets for the last two or three years and I believe they are the right strategy. So we are maximizing, of course, our innovative portfolio and we are building capabilities into behind that portfolio and you heard about the results. The very good results we've got with Prevnar. I could have mentioned Sutent, Enbrel did also very, very well during the quarter and Lipitor, especially in China. So second one is to participate in a more meaningful way in the off patent segment.</p>
          <p>As you've heard, we've made an acquisition in Brazil, we signed a partnership with Hisun in China to that matter and we are penetrating that segment very effectively. And you've seen the growth of established products in emerging markets for this quarter has been 17%, which is much larger than what we have seen in the previous quarters.</p>
          <p>We are also executing a very specific program in terms of access, supporting governments in emerging markets, China and their Healthcare agenda around cardiovascular medicines, we're very active there.</p>
          <p>And finally, I think we are taking advantage now to our commercial infrastructure and the leadership we have put in place in emerging markets in the last two or three years. So that's how I would summarize the answer.</p>
          <p>And then your question on 301...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why they were separated, the press releases were not together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, right. So initially we were thinking to put 301 and 302 together because we thought that it was best view, the results would be more meaningful in that context. However, the clarity of the results we've got on 302 led the alliance to take the decision on reporting the top line results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Olivier. I think on emerging markets, we've always said that we're going to get volatility quarter-to-quarter and different markets react at different times and clearly in this quarter a lot of the BRIC-MT markets were all firing on full cylinders at the same time. I don't believe we see long-term or medium-term 14% growth rate in emerging markets. We remain committed to our sort of high single-digit for a full year growth rate.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I have, I guess, three questions.</p>
          <p>The first is, I'm not quite clear on the Eliquis timeline from here; can you please clarify that in terms of the FDA process and potential approval?</p>
          <p>Second, with respect to bapineuzumab, the FDA and Pfizer and others agreed to two primary endpoints for Phase III. Could you just discuss why the FDA is interested in seeing both cognition and function and the relative importance of cognition versus function?</p>
          <p>And then third, I was hoping that you could just characterize what the pipeline news flow is to watch in the near term beyond bapineuzumab? So what clinical trial readout should we be focused on in the near term? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mikael, could you sort of take the questions on bapineuzumab and on the pipeline news flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I think you first asked about the endpoints here on cognition and function. Over the last few years we have seen from initial more focus on the importance on showing impact on functional performance of patients, whether you use physician scores or patient-reported outcome and, you know, it was the kind of view of many regulatory agencies that you needed to look at the combined impact on cognition and function. However, I should say, as we see this field move forward, there's growing interest in actually cognition as a standalone parameter, both in diseases like Alzheimer's and Schizophrenia which I think again, opens up opportunities for drug development here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. So you heard from BMS on their call last week, the alliance has already met with the FDA and we have an agreed plan on the requested information and we're working hard to provide that information to the FDA by September. We're really working as expeditiously as we possibly can across the alliance to address the outstanding questions and move the application forward.</p>
          <p>As you know, the FDA may take up to six months to review our response to a complete response letter once submitted. But we're already working with the agency and we're hopeful that the review can be completed within a shorter period of time. The alliance will issue a communication when the FDA accepts our resubmission and we'll be able to provide you with more information at that time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And, Mikael, you'll make some brief comments on the pipeline flow? I would say that I think we've had a very rich year this year and still pending of course, Eliquis and tofacitinib and bosutinib news, very, very strong in our Phase II. Do you want to comment on some of the more closer to Phase III studies, Mikael?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so it's been &#x2013; I'm thrilled about the interest in the pipeline and the opportunity. So I'll pick a few that we haven't touched so much on this time. In vaccines, I think there is opportunity for potential transformative change when it comes to management of staphylococcus aureus. That's a tremendous health care burden with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:12:27) systems. We are in the middle of Phase II trial with our staph aureus vaccine here.</p>
          <p>You know, when it comes to the whole class of antibody drug conjugates, I'm really thrilled with the strong data we have previously reported for inotuzumab. We're expanding now, also from lymphoma into leukemia, starting soon Phase III studies.</p>
          <p>I should say also, there is a drug in our pipeline, an IV mTOR/PI3k inhibitor that I'm quite excited about, and you will see that in addition to what we mentioned about the CDK.</p>
          <p>And, and finally, one example of an opportunity with risk but also high reward, the p38 inhibitor has been around for some time. We have actually a quite exciting study in COPD which could open potentially for an oral drug with disease-modifying effect.</p>
          <p>So I think that gave you a mix of things of transforming capacity that's all in our pipeline in addition to all the others that we've had an opportunity to discuss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, David, just to comment on that, I think we've had &#x2013; we will have this year and potentially in the first quarter of next year or early next year, we'll have quite a bolus of exciting approvals from potentially Eliquis, tofacitinib, we've had Inlyta, we've had Prevnar 13 adult, we've had Xalkori, so I think we've had a rich bolus of approvals this year and potentially in the beginning of next year. And then where you need to see us progress our Phase III cohorts and our Phase IIs into Phase IIIs of really strong clinically-differentiated products is the thing to look at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ian. And, operator, we have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your final question comes from Michael Tong from Wells Fargo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but just a couple, first one, for Ian, as you think about innovative, versus value co, in several years' time, what current synergy exists between the two businesses as they operate now? And do they represent necessarily an impediment as you think about further breaking or further separating the two businesses?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, can you provide us with an update as to your biosimilar efforts, where they stand now and how you see that space playing out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I think right now I'd say, at this moment in time on the synergies, clearly we have large primary-care products that require substantial infrastructure and that is synergistic to our, in our emerging markets, to our branded products that sell on quality. And, and whether those synergies remain important, really depends on how our portfolio is shaped over the next two to three to four years.</p>
          <p>So if the portfolio moves more in a direction of specialty products, then the potential synergies between a Value Co and an Innovative Co may be less in the future than they are today. So it really depends on how the portfolio develops and that's why, I think this is a matter of looking at this as an evolving situation as we look at our options and look at how to manage those businesses.</p>
          <p>And the last question was...?</p>
