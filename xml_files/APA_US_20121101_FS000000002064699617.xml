          <p>Good afternoon. My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brady Parish, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Regina. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation's third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. For all of you who have been impacted by Hurricane Sandy, we wanted to let you know that our thoughts are with you and your loved ones.</p>
          <p>This morning we reported earnings of $161 million or $0.41 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $861 million or $2.16 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $2.4 billion for the quarter.</p>
          <p>On today's call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. First, we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; and finally, Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>We prepared our quarterly supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or pre-tax margins. This data package can be found on our website at www. www.apachecorp.com/financialdata.</p>
          <p>Today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brady, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As I'm sure you've all read in our release this morning, during the third quarter we accelerated our growing momentum across our portfolio. We've got excellent results. In the U.S., we continue to step up our play activity and now run 63 rigs, 50% more than we did at the beginning &#x2013; had at the beginning of the year. And Rod's going to go in a lot more detail, but we've had outstanding well results in a number of plays including the Cline, Wolfcamp, Wichita-Albany and the Canyon Wash in the Permian Basin, and also the Granite Wash in the Anadarko Basin.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, our growing drill bit momentum was also notable on the international front. In the North Sea, after consolidating our expanded portfolio earlier in the year, we're having very good drilling results with excellent flow rates from oil discoveries across our fields, and the value of Apache as operator I think has just been endorsed by a major, with Shell last week announcing that their purchase of Hess' position and many of the Apache-operated fields in the region.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, we completed our first Vaca Muerta horizontal well, which was a relatively short lateral, it was about 1,900 feet with only 7 fracs. It's early days, but the well results have been very encouraging. We continue to assess the economics of the play. We have four additional horizontal tests that's planned over the next few months. We have 450,000 net acres in this play and that has enormous resource potential.</p>
          <p>After a very successful portfolio expansion phase over the last 2.5 years, we really focused &#x2013; refocused back to the drill bit. We hold a leading position in some of the most attractive basins and plays around the world and we intend to actively exploit this resource potential for the benefit of our shareholders.</p>
          <p>As we disclosed by our press release last month, our third quarter reported production reflects approximately 25,000 barrels of oil a day of production downtime, which were due primarily to hurricane disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico and the scheduled North Sea platform turnarounds. Our third quarter production averaged about 771,000 barrels a day, and if you put 25,000 barrels on top of that, which is all back on right now, we're producing today approximately 800,000 barrels a day. The important thing is, we remain on track to deliver our production growth guidance for the year and we're going to stay within our $10 billion exploration and development budget.</p>
          <p>One final note as we continue to build and execute our global pipeline of exploration activity, we're testing two wells, one in the Williston Basin, both of which we have large acreage positions, and the Mississippi Lime. The good news is we've had good oil shows from the logs and the formations that we were targeting. We're currently completion &#x2013; in the completion phase of our initial wells in each of these plays and we'll be experimenting with our frac designs to give us optimal results.</p>
          <p>We secured a number blocks in the recent Gulf of Mexico lease sale and we have captured a highly-sought-after deepwater block in Suriname, which is on trend with recent play-opening discoveries.</p>
          <p>You should expect our drill bit momentum to continue. We have built the foundation of this portfolio over several years and this is personally the most exciting time for me over the last 25 years. We have the asset depth, financial strength and delivery expertise to stand out in this sector, and that's exactly what we intend to do.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Rod.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve. Our total reported net production for the third quarter was approximately 771,000 BOE per day. Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf of Mexico and outages in the North Sea due to scheduled maintenance activities, reduced production by 13,000 BOE per day and 12,000 BOE per day, respectively. Nearly all of this production is back online and we have entered the fourth quarter with record worldwide net production.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we continued the conversion of our extensive onshore oil and hydrocarbon liquids-rich inventory into production and cash flow. We rank among the most active drillers in North America having operated an average of 66 drilling rigs in our U.S. regions during the quarter, including 35 in our Permian region and 24 in our Central region with outstanding results. Our Permian and Central region averaged combined net production of approximately 184,000 BOE per day during the third quarter, nearly a quarter of our total worldwide net production.</p>
          <p>Moreover, this represents an increase of 15% over the second quarter average net production of 160,000 BOE per day, and an increase of 30% over third quarter 2011 net daily production of 141,000 BOE per day. With an inventory of over 67,000 locations in these two regions alone, we remain on track to deliver double-digit growth in the oil and liquids-rich Permian and Central regions for years to come.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are continuing our very active, new venture exploration program. Steve already elaborated on our encouraging results of the Mississippian Lime, Williston Basin and Vaca Muerta Shale, so I'll not address these plays here. In Alaska, we are on track to spud our first well in the Cook Inlet during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally in October we signed a new production sharing agreement to explore at a high potential area in Block 53 offshore Suriname in the Equatorial Margin fairway. We were awarded 100% interest in this block and expect to commence a 3D seismic program during 2013.</p>
          <p>Now turning to more detail on our regions. The Permian had another outstanding quarter as we continue to grow through drill bit. Third quarter production averaged nearly 112,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 7% increase over the second quarter, which partly increased resulting from additional NGL processing at the Deadwood plant as it became fully operational.</p>
          <p>Our substantial acreage position continues to provide Apache the flexibility and optionality to test new plays and concepts. During the quarter, we added 230,000 gross acres to our overall acreage position, the majority of which was in the Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp play. We now hold over 3.7 million gross acres across the hydrocarbon-rich Permian Basin.</p>
          <p>We are now the most active driller in the Basin, and during the quarter averaged 35 rigs, drilling 201 wells, of which 26 were horizontal. We expect to continue our shift to more horizontal drilling in the fourth quarter and into 2013, when we anticipate nearly half of our drilling rigs will be horizontal.</p>
          <p>Drilling at Deadwood and Yeso continues to be a large contributor to growth, while Irion County/Wolfcamp horizontal activity and potential continues to expand. At Deadwood, where we're targeting the Wolfwood and Fusselman with vertical wells, we averaged a 15-rig program for the quarter. Earlier in the year we acquired additional 3D seismic data with the first migrated data arriving earlier in the third quarter. This new seismic information greatly enhanced our ability to target prolific Fusselman accumulations and new locations are continuing to be identified.</p>
          <p>A couple of our most recent Fusselman successes are the Squire 9 Number 5 well, which flowed at 339 barrels of oil per day and 677 Mcf per day, and the Riley 37 Number 8, which produced at a rate of 166 barrels of oil per day and 256 Mcf per day.</p>
          <p>Drilling in the Deadwood area will remain active throughout 2012 and into 2013. We operate two horizontal rigs in the Deadwood area; targeting the shales of the Wolfcamp, Atoka/Barnett and the Lower Cline formations. The latest Cline well in Deadwood is Apache's best well to-date. The Barracuda 45-2H was drilled on the southeast edge of our Deadwood acreage. The well is drilled to a TD of 13,353 measured depth with a 1,300 foot lateral and after an 11 stage frac the well attained a peak rate of 810 BOE per day. The well has averaged 623 BOE per day in its initial 30 days production and has produced nearly 26,000 barrels oil equivalent to-date, and a preliminary EUR of about 600,000 barrels. The average EUR of the last five Cline wells is now 452,000.</p>
          <p>Also in Deadwood, a Lower Wolfcamp/Deadwood Shale lateral was drilled 1,300 feet to a TD of 12,900 feet measured depth and tested a peak rate of over 200 barrels of oil per day and 200 Mcf per day. Additional appraisal wells are planned for the Wolfcamp and Cline Shale plays in 2013, and commercialization of these shales can add hundreds of potential locations to the 560 locations already identified in the Cline Shale. We have in addition also drilled a horizontal well in the Barnett Shale and after a 14 stag frac the peak rate exceeded 308 barrels of oil per day and 613 Mcf per day.</p>
          <p>In the Barnett/Wolfcamp play, where Apache has drilled 13 wells, 8 producing and the remainder either in drilling or fracing or flowback stages. Since March 2012, these 8 wells have produced 234,000 barrels of oil and 509 million cubic feet of gas or 319,000 BOE from the Upper Wolfcamp shales only.</p>
          <p>Current Wolfcamp production is 21,050 BOE per day. Two Middle Wolfcamp wells are currently drilling and a Cline horizontal well in Ketchum Mountain will spud soon.</p>
          <p>In other Midland Basin and Eastern Shale properties we've had some notable results in the Wilshire area, such as the well at McElroy Ranch that tested as high as 289 barrels of oil per day and 735 Mcf per day from the Spraberry through <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:28) intervals on a submersible pump.</p>
          <p>In the Yeso area of New Mexico we ended the quarter running four vertical rigs. 27 vertical wells were spud during the third quarter and 22 wells were completed and producing. Notable wells from the quarter included the Lee Federal Number 59, which averaged 168 barrels of oil per day and 403 Mcf per day during September and the Tony Federal Number 39 whose 30-day well test averaged 119 barrels of oil per day and 287 Mcf per day. Our fourth rig recently transitioned from drilling vertical wells to commencing our multi-year Cedar Lake horizontal drilling program.</p>
          <p>We continued our good results in the Central Basin platform where we are applying horizontal drilling to historically conventional fields and reservoirs with outstanding results. In the Three Bar Shallow Unit, we have tested the Wichita-Albany, an interval characterized by interbed limestones and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (13:21) zones at measured depths of 7,000 feet. Results from the first two wells included the 10-1H with 30-day average production of 848 barrels of oil per day and 465 Mcf per day and the 105-H for the 18-day average production of 620 barrels of oil per day and 754 Mcf per day. We plan to run one rig in the unit during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>As we drill more we learn more and we're able to improve the efficiency of our exploration and operations activities. As evidenced by these widespread encouraging results we continue to be excited about the abundant opportunities and growth prospects of our Permian Basin position.</p>
          <p>In our Central region, we're also seeing excellent results in new ramp up activity across our nearly 2 million gross acres. Production was 72,300 BOE per day up 31% from the second quarter. Adjusting for acquired whole year of production growth was 24% quarter-over-quarter as we realized the benefits of our active oil and liquids-rich drilling program. The growth was driven by a 42% increase in oil production and a 20% increase in gas production. Our opportunities in the region continue to expand following our May acquisition of over 312,000 net acres and subsequent 18,000 additional acres in the heart of the Anadarko Basin.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter this region operated an average of 24 drilling rigs, 23 of which are horizontal and drilled 40 wells with a 100% success. During the same period we completed 26 new wells for an average daily rate of 485 barrels of oil per day and 2,700 Mcf of gas per day. We continue to work numerous plays across our acreage position. Notable highlights in the quarter include strong results in the oily Tonkawa, Marmaton and Cottage Grove, a new horizontal play we are testing in our Stiles Ranch and other properties.</p>
          <p>In the Tonkawa, for example, our Karen 1-25H averaged 525 barrels of oil per day and 1.8 million cubic feet gas per day for the first 30 days of production and the Steward 1-20H averaged 664 barrels of oil per day and 758 Mcf per day.</p>
          <p>In the Marmaton, we'll also had positive results including the Screaming Eagle 1-16H which averaged 514 barrels of oil per day and 5.8 million cubic feet of gas per day and the Madole 1-18H which averaged 1,116 barrels of oil per day and 8.9 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Cottage Grove also provided strong results with the Stiles 24-68H averaging 893 barrels of oil per day and 1.2 million cubic feet of gas and the Stiles 12-1H averaging 1,652 barrels of oil per day and 1.6 million cubic feet of gas per day.</p>
          <p>The Granite Wash continues to be a significant focus of our drilling program, where during the quarter we tested the Weatherly 6-1H which averaged 672 barrels of oil per day and 5.7 million cubic feet of gas per day. In general, we are finding enough oil in the Granite Wash that remains economic despite low NGL prices.</p>
          <p>In the Texas Panhandle, drilling success continues in the Canyon Wash on our 200 square mile Bivins Ranch acreage. During the quarter, we completed our 9th and 10th successful wells, which tested 1,050 barrels of oil per day and 950 Mcf per day and 1,447 barrels of oil per day and 1,199 Mcf per day. This is encouraging validation of Apache's play concept. Keep in mind these 1,000 plus barrel a day wells are from vertical wells.</p>
          <p>To de-bottleneck our growing production we completed a 9-mile pipeline to transport stranded natural gas during the quarter, thereby securing our takeaway from the area, which has grown from zero to over 5,000 barrels of oil per day in 14 months. The line is currently selling 3.3 million cubic feet of gas per day of 1,450 BTU gas with NGL recoveries. In addition, we've added a second rig in the Bivins Ranch area.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, low ethane prices at Conway resulted in ethane rejections for the region. The ethane rejection was limited in the month of July and August as ethane prices at Conway dropped to record lows in early July. At that time, Conway ethane was trading at approximately a 90% discount to Mont Belvieu. In the end of the third quarter, this discount was reduced to approximately 42% to Mont Belvieu. Currently, Conway ethane is discounted 44% to Mont Belvieu.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Gulf of Mexico shelf, quarterly production was down 8% to 90,000 BOE per day as a result of approximately 10,000 BOE per day of curtailments due to Hurricane Isaac. This was due primarily to the storm's impact on our third-party facilities as Apache's infrastructure was relatively unharmed. With shut-ins behind us, we are currently running eight rigs, two of which are focused on P&amp;A work. Year-to-date we have TD'd 21 operated wells. Offsetting some of the downtime experience during the quarter were positive well results from our shelf drilling program. For example, the Main Pass 315 well came online at 634 barrels of oil per day. At Eugene Island the 118 B Number 1 sidetrack penetrated 45 feet of gas in the Q-sand. At Ship Shoal the 126 B well came online at 522 barrels of oil per day and 3.8 million cubic feet of gas per day, and two new wells at Main Pass 308 came online for combined rate of 1,555 barrels of oil per day. The total platform rate is currently 2,596 barrels of oil per day but production is being curtailed due to facility restrictions. Modifications are currently being designed to remedy the situation.</p>
          <p>We've now been awarded 60 of 61 blocks from the June 20th Federal lease sale adding to our inventory of opportunities in the Gulf.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we plan to increase our rig count by one where rig finishes a seven-month shipyard project. By the end of the quarter, we plan to complete the Main Pass 308 drilling program. The last location is drilling and one re-completion is remaining. Our Eugene Island 330 drilling program will also continue through the end of 2012 with two additional locations to be drilled.</p>
          <p>In the Deep Gulf, third quarter production was relatively flat as a full three months of production from our Wide Berth and Mandy fields was offset by Hurricane Isaac downtime. We anticipate bringing on our Bushwood field in the near future as capacity is freed up from Gulf re-completion. This will add approximately 4,500 net BOE per day to the region's production.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we announced our participation in the June 20 Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale. The awards have now been completed and we received 28 blocks. During 2013, we are taking delivery of two rigs to begin exploring these prospects. In our Gulf Coast onshore region, average production was up 8% over the second quarter to 2,700 BOE per day as additional takeaway capacity was installed at our Atchafalaya Bay Field and production was reestablished in Lake Pagie Field. These additions coupled with new production volumes from continued drilling success at our Chapman Ranch in South Texas and Golden Meadow Field onshore Louisiana helped offset production deferrals due to Hurricane Isaac.</p>
          <p>A notable highlight from this region was the Scottsdale Number 1 well in South Louisiana, which tested 20.2 million cubic feet of gas per day and 199 barrels of oil per day at 47 degree API gravity oil. We plan to complete the installation of a 4-mile, 8-inch flow line connecting the well to our Atchafalaya Bay production facility before yearend.</p>
          <p>Apache's Gulf Coast onshore region initiated production this morning through a newly installed 12-inch pipeline connecting our Atchafalaya Bay production facility to TransCanada or ANR's 30-inch pipeline 5 miles away. We are currently ramping up production to 50 million cubic feet of gas gross per day with plans to increase production to 75 million cubic feet of gas gross per day over next few days. This marks the completion of Phase 1 of our Atchafalaya Bay infrastructure project. Phase 2 is anticipated to be complete during the second quarter next year, which will bring gross production from Atchafalaya Bay wells up to 220 million cubic feet of gas per day, an increase from current producing rates by an incremental 170 million cubic feet of gas per day. Apache has a working interest of approximately 48% to 50% in these wells.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead we intend to have six operated rigs running during the fourth quarter as we focus our efforts on oil opportunities in Southeastern Texas, Southern Louisiana and Southern Mississippi. Heading north to Canada, production in the third quarter was steady as the region continued to transition to more oil and liquids-rich production. Drilling is focused on several plays across our extensive acreage position such as Dunvegan, Bluesky and Sparky. Well highlights in these areas included the first three or four operated Dunvegan horizontal oil wells in the Kaybob area with one well already in production. Initial oil rates range from 159 to 320 barrels of oil per day. Drilling of the fourth well and production startup of all wells will occur in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In the liquids rich Bluesky area, we continue our horizontal program completing three wells during the quarter. Very strong results were seen particularly in the third well, which tested at 11.7 million cubic feet of gas per day and 600 BOE per day of liquids.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the Sparky program in the Consort area continues to play a significant role in our program where during the quarter we operated three rigs and drilled 24 wells. Oil production in Consort increased from 1,250 barrels of oil per day to 1,792 barrels of oil per day in the third quarter of which Sparky program provided about 300 barrels of oil per day with one third of the third quarter drills tied in and cleaning up. Production startup of the remaining wells will occur in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving outside North America and the North Sea, third quarter production averaged 67,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day, was down quarter-over-quarter due to turnarounds and continued challenges with ESP failures as previously disclosed resulting in deferrals of approximately 12,000 BOE per day. All operated Forties platforms are back to full production as are Scott and Telford. Nelson is scheduled to return to production in mid-November.</p>
          <p>During the quarter the region operated four rigs and drilled and completed six gross wells with two further wells in progress. Well highlights for the region included Bacchus West, the second successful horizontal development well in Bacchus Field. The well encountered 889 feet of net pay in the Jurassic Fulmar sandstone reservoir. It was completed in late July with initial production of 8,500 barrels of oil per day gross. Apache is the operator of the field with a 50% working interest. The Bacchus Field commenced production in May of this year and is currently producing around 10,000 barrels of oil per day, 5,000 barrels a day net, through the subsea tie-back to Apache's Forties Alpha platform.</p>
          <p>Looking to Forties, we also brought on three new wells at an average IP of 1,633 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We made continued progress on the installation of the Forties Alpha Satellite Platform. The jacket was installed successfully west of the Forties Alpha Platform on September 8. The platform topside will be lifted into place in the second quarter of 2013 followed soon thereafter by development drilling through the 18 well slots. We continue also to have drilling success at our Beryl Field where during the quarter Apache's Beryl Bravo's B73y development well tested at 8,161 barrels of oil per day and 5.9 million cubic feet of gas per day from a Jurassic Nansen reservoir containing 71 feet of net oil pay. The well began producing at the end of August. The well also encountered 245 feet of net pay in three additional zones that will be produced at a later date. We have a 50% interest in the well.</p>
          <p>The U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change announced this month the award of 11 new North Sea licenses to Apache, the highest of any operator participating in the 27th Seaward Licensing Round. These awards covered 19 full or partial blocks, 613,000 gross acreage and 2,482 square kilometers. Included in these blocks is all the available acreage around our Beryl Field plus two key licenses near Forties.</p>
          <p>Apache was &#x2013; also was awarded an interest in another non-operated license. The economic prospectivity of these areas was enhanced by recent improvements in the U.K. tax allowance mechanism involving small fields and high pressure, high temperature formations.</p>
          <p>Looking into fourth quarter, we plan to drill wells on Forties Charlie and Forties Echo as well as reinstating wells on Forties Bravo and Forties Delta. The Beryl Bravo platform will be down for a planned <mark type="ph" /> par (25:52) which started 26 October returning to full production on 22nd of November in order to perform routine maintenance.</p>
          <p>Turning to Egypt, our operations continued unabated. We average 26 rigs operating and reported quarterly average net production of 153 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Because of the terms of our PSC to provide for lower nets with higher oil prices, we reported a 4% decrease in the preceding quarter. On a gross basis however we essentially held production flat.</p>
          <p>In addition during the quarter we saw record turnarounds on development lease approvals after seeing delays of nine months or more during 2011. The most recent approvals for development leases took us 34 days, a positive sign that the new leadership, the Petroleum Ministry at EGPC is finally finding its footing.</p>
          <p>In Khalda we had several discoveries of note this quarter including the <mark type="ph" /> Samaha (26:41) North-1X which drilled to a TD of 17,362 feet in the Lower Safa. The well encountered pay intervals in four zones and a test is pending. The early discovery of <mark type="ph" /> Samaha (26:55) 1X tested at a rate of 20.8 million cubic feet of gas per day and 913 barrel of condensate per day from the Lower Safa and 23 million cubic feet of gas per day and 19,097 barrel of condensate per day from the Upper Safa. And the <mark type="ph" /> Samaha (27:08) East-1X tested at rate of 28 million a day and 711 barrels of condensate for Lower Safa and 13.5 million cubic feet of gas per day and 11,010 barrels of condensate for the Upper Safa.</p>
          <p>KPC or Khalda Petroleum Company's current oilfields also saw a high level of activity. During the quarter a total of 13 wells were drilled or are currently being drilled in these properties. In the Eunice Field seven wells were drilled including three injectors. A recent initial test of the Eunice II Upper Bahariya reservoir resulted 1,800 barrels of oil per day. The Eunice Field started production this year and as of October is already producing in excess of 5,500 barrels of oil per day gross.</p>
          <p>Looking to Australia, we continue to make significant progress toward development of our large infrastructure projects in the region. The BHP operated Macedon Project is reported to be over 70% complete and on schedule for first gas in mid-2013, which will add approximately 45 million cubic feet of gas of net production when two new contracts come on in 2013 and 2014.</p>
          <p>All contracts have been executed on schedule for our Balnaves Project with the Armada Claire FPSO currently in the shipyard undergoing refurbishment and replacement construction preparing for Balnaves 2014 commencement. Our Julimar gas development in support of the Wheatstone LNG Project is progressing on schedule with recent contract awards are now through various subsea project components.</p>
          <p>Third quarter net production of 64,000 BOE per day, are 3% from the previous quarter largely due to anticipated decline at the Van Gogh. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, two new wells commenced its Stag in late October, while Van Gogh and Pyrenees are forecast to continue declining slowly for the remainder of the year. The first Stag well first Stag-44H came on line this week and is currently producing 1,800 barrels of oil per day, adding to the Stag-45H production that came on the week before at around 1,500 barrels of oil per day.</p>
          <p>A planned turnaround of the Yara fertilizer plant that began in late September has experienced delays to an unexpected equipment failure. It is anticipated by our partner, the operator of the plant, to be offline until late November. Offsetting this deferred volumes at Yara, our recently signed commercial gas contracts for additional Reindeer and John Brookes volumes in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, in Argentina, productions during the quarter averaged 48,500 BOE per day, a 3% decline quarter-over-quarter. During the quarter, our total gas plus production averaged 111 million cubic feet of gas per day and a 214 million cubic feet of gas per day of total net production, with 98 million cubic feet of gas per day or 88% of the volumes sold at gas plus prices, which averaged $4.97 per Mcf.</p>
          <p>In the Neuqu&#xE9;n Basin, we drilled and completed successfully the NL-62 well, at 2.5 million a day from the Precujo formation. The well has been approved for gas plus and we are currently selling at $5.47 per Mcf. In total, in the Neuqu&#xE9;n Basin 70 wells reached TD in the third quarter under gas plus and a total of eight wells were initially completed delivering a combined growth rate of 17.1 million cubic feet of gas per day and 1,595 barrels of oil per day, which is 4,445 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As Steve  already mentioned, the encouraging mixed results from the Vaca Muerta exploration program. I won't elaborate further here.</p>
          <p>That concludes our many operational highlights, and I'll now turn it over to Tom Chambers.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rod and good afternoon, everyone. As Steve and Rod mentioned, we are actively focused on our significant inventory of drilling opportunities and realizing the potential we've built through recent acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Record rig counts continue to increase in our Permian and Central regions and significant infrastructure investment in all regions has set the groundwork for a positive momentum heading into year end. Underpinning this activity is our ability to generate strong consistent revenues and cash flow.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter, we reported earnings of $161 million or $0.41 per diluted share and adjusted earnings of $861 million or $2.16 per share when we adjust for certain items that affect the comparability of results.</p>
          <p>Third quarter adjustments totaled $700 million and include a non-cash property write-down in Canada, a change in tax rate on decommissioning expenditures for North Sea oil and gas facilities, a foreign currency fluctuation adjustment and some small merger acquisition and transition cost.</p>
          <p>The non-cash after-tax write-down of our Canadian oil and gas properties totaled $539 million, which brings the year-to-date amount to $1.4 billion. Our Canadian region's reserves were over 77% natural gas at year end 2011 and the decline in natural gas prices over the prior year continues to impact us under full cost accounting rules.</p>
          <p>The other large non-cash item impacting earnings was the $118 million charge related to the decommissioning facilities in the North Sea. As you recall, in 2011, the U.K. increased the corporate income tax rate on North Sea oil and gas profits from 50% to 62% and at that time also proposed that the tax relief attributable to decommissioning expenditures remain at 50%. The decommissioning related legislation was not formally enacted, but it was included in the finance bill introduced in 2012 and enacted in July of this year necessitating the change in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Production drove the results in this quarter and fueled by our extensive drilling program. Production averaged 771,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, a strong performance, despite downtime in the Gulf of Mexico associated with Hurricane Isaac and maintenance downtime in the North Sea. Higher oil prices contributed to the total revenue of $4.1 billion for the quarter and a record $12.6 billion on a year-to-date basis. This compares to $4 million in previous quarter and $12.5 billion year-to-date in 2011.</p>
          <p>Our revenues and ultimately our ability to maintain operating margins translates into cash from operations which totals $2.4 billion for the quarter. Cash flow from operating activities before it changes in working capital was 2% higher than the previous quarter. Year-to-date our cash flow from operations was down only 2% over the prior year-to-date period, despite lower worldwide price realizations with natural gas and NGL prices down 16% and 27%, respectively and oil prices up only 2%.</p>
          <p>The international price realizations helped mitigate the decline in the quarter in earnings and cash flow with oil price realizations up 10% sequentially and 3% from the prior year quarter. Additionally, with Brent currently trading at over $20 premium to WTI we will continue to reap the benefits of our global oil position.</p>
          <p>International natural gas prices were up 3% from the prior quarter and 13% from the third quarter 2011. For the past three quarters, we have realized over $4 per MCF on our international gas production, a significant premium to North American prices, which averaged well below $3 per Mcf over the same timeframe when we exclude the impact of hedging.</p>
          <p>International regions represent just over one-third of our worldwide gas production. A key point I'd like to emphasize is that both international oil and gas price realizations were 20% higher than North American average realizations, a true testament to our global portfolio of balance and reach.</p>
          <p>Our cash margins for the third quarter remained strong. At $41.64 per BOE, our cash margins increased 5% from the sequential quarter, but decreased almost 10% from the prior year period. Our cash cost was slightly higher than we would have liked to see this quarter, particularly lifting costs, which were primarily impacted by an increase in non-recurring repairs and maintenance costs tied to corrosion repairs at our Grand Isle facility and plant turnarounds in Canada and the North Sea.</p>
          <p>We also increased workover activity in nearly every region. Besides providing very good rate of return projects, they support our base production. Coupled with the continued growth in our onshore North American operations, our labor costs have increased accordingly. As production rises in the fourth quarter and into next year, rate should fall back accordingly. Rest assured, we remain focused on optimizing our margins and managing our costs while not comprising safety.</p>
          <p>You can find a detailed calculation of our margins, adjusted earnings, and cash from operations in the financial supplement located on our website.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with a debt-to-cap ratio of 27%. We ended the quarter with $318 million in cash and a total debt of $11.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving on to taxes, as I mentioned on the prior call, our earnings would be impacted this quarter by a change in U.K. tax law, which it was and I detailed earlier in my comments.</p>
          <p>The third quarter effective tax rate of 79% was impacted by this charge in the Canadian <mark type="ph" /> ceiling test (36:35) adjustment as well. Absent these adjustments and foreign exchange movements, our effective tax rate would have been a more typical 45%. We would expect a deferred tax percentage of approximately 20% for the year absent these adjustments.</p>
          <p>In closing, we had another solid quarter of production revenues and cash flow driven by our drilling program. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Brady.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Steve, we've seen some pretty interesting announcements regarding majors, including Exxon paying some pretty high valuations for Canadian gas acreage. I just wanted to see if you could maybe comment on some of the potential implications for Apache? Are there opportunities for you to monetize some of your acreage in places where you're not spending capital? And does this have any implications? Could you partner with Exxon regarding Kitimat where the market is concerned about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two different questions, I'll take the first one about the acreage. Interestingly, and I think the number is correct, because I asked our guys and gals in Canada. We have about 300,000 acres in that same play that just traded. And in fact, we're starting to drill some wells there at the end of this year and the first of next year. How we actually exploit all of that acreage, we've got 6.5 million acres in Canada and we just went through the same process that we've done in the Anadarko Basin and the Permian Basin in the &#x2013; in our Canadian region in terms of resource potential, and we're going to be rolling that out here in the coming months. But the potential for liquids and liquids-rich gas in Canada are actually much stronger than I thought they were. In terms of partnering with Exxon, I can't comment on that. And despite some of the things you hear in the press, we're &#x2013; Kitimat's still going forward and we have &#x2013; we're very positive about it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll leave it at that. Obviously, Steve, this year you've had some production disruptions. It sounds like those are in the rear-view mirror. How comfortable are you, Steve, with your 6% to 9% target for 2013? And I just wanted to also see if we could get a little bit more color on the next couple of quarters for the North Sea, given &#x2013; with the ESP issues back online, things like that. So, some more color on the North Sea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in terms of &#x2013; there's nothing, honestly, if you &#x2013; and this is an excuse and I don't like to give excuses, but if you were to adjust our production, which you can't do because we didn't get the cash and we didn't get the production. But if you were to adjust it, we would have been right on for the hurricane, which you can't do a damn thing about, and the events in the North Sea would be right on our production forecast. And I know that sounds like an excuse, but as we move to the drill bit, those kinds of things we've got to get over. We've got to get past those kinds of things. So far I will tell you, from an outlook for the fourth quarter, we're very positive about it. And there's nothing changed with respect to our forecast for 2013, 6% to 9%. I mean, I think we have the inventory and we have the asset base in order to do that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon, fellows. A couple for me, please if I may. Steve, it is obviously pretty nice to start seeing momentum picking up in the lower 48. Can you tell us where you see the rig count going in terms of relative capital allocation between, I guess, international and U.S., particular the lower 48 and particular 63 now, where do you think that tops out or you are at a level now where you think you <mark type="ph" /> got an optimistic ratio (42:42)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, I think you're going to see that momentum build. Certainly from an opportunity standpoint, we have the opportunity to &#x2013; and I'm going to be redundant, but if you remember in 2010 we spent $500 million in the Permian and we went to about $1 billion. This year we're going to spend a little over $2 billion, and then next year we're going to spend more than that. We'll probably run 40 rigs next year in the Permian. And in Anadarko Basin, our results there are actually better than we expected. So we're going to &#x2013; you're going to see an increase in the Anadarko basin also, which speaks to the allocation of capital. Certainly, we haven't allocated our capital for 2013 yet, we're going to do that in December. But it certainly &#x2013; we're going to put it into best projects wherever those projects are.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, this might be a dumb question as a follow-up, but I'm going to have a go, anyway. Your stock prices, when you did the BP deal; last time you issued equity was above where the share price is now. You've obviously &#x2013; you've done an Analyst Day, you've given us insight to everything that's going on. And you spent a lot of money buying assets, as you say; you've got a deep portfolio. But one could argue that you could buyback reserves cheaper by buying back your own stock. I'm just curious as to how that plays into how you're thinking about trying to address some of the recent performance in the share price, which seems to contrast with the tremendous portfolio you built up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've had this discussion before. I think in terms of the rates that we're getting for the investment dollars that we have in our portfolio, other than perception, would beat rates of a return which would be cost of capital and buying our stock back. At the present time, we're not considering diverting capital from the base program to buy our stock back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for different reasons they are very similar actually. I mean obviously let's assume that the pricing of the LNG is exactly the same in Australia versus they are in Canada. I will tell you, the add-ons of trains in Canada would be much more lucrative than they would be Australia just because of the cost. So that project really is a long-term project, and there's tremendous amount of gas in the United States or in British Columbia right now.</p>

          <p>Yeah, actually fracing cost came down really in the third quarter in a big way and you're starting to see rigs come down. If you look at the rig count in the Permian Basin over the last two months, it's the historic or the continuous ebb and flow of prices, service costs and capital, and what you're seeing right now is we were on the back end of all those service costs going up. We're on the front end of it now, because I think they'll continue to go down.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Just two quick questions for me. Firstly, on the CapEx side, looking at Q3, it looks like the run rate CapEx spend was about $2.7 billion for drilling and then also gathering. Is that a reasonable rate that we should think about going forward? And then as we head into 2013 kind of could you talk a little bit about the rig count that you're currently employing by basin and how that may change over time? I think you mentioned the Permian will increase to about 50% horizontal rigs. I'm just trying to get a sense of how those rigs are shifting around?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've got 34 rigs &#x2013; I might be off one, but I think we have 34 rigs in the Permian. We've got 24 or 25 in the Anadarko Basin. I think we're up to 7 in Canada, and we've got 8 offshore Gulf of Mexico. That's not exact, but that's pretty close.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Can you refresh us, in Australia, on production trajectory and your latest thoughts on Van Gogh platform remediation and just what we should expect production trajectory-wise over the next four to seven quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Van Gogh has been very good. It paid out in nine months. We're still producing I think about 16,000, 17,000 barrels a day there. We have a turnaround on our FPSO coming in about the middle of 2013 and the real reason that's important is we're going to &#x2013; when we bring it back &#x2013; in the meantime, we're going to be drilling Coniston wells which is a sister field to the north of Van Gogh that will start ramping up our oil production going through that FPSO. But, frankly, we've seen the peaks of the production at both Van Gogh and Pyrenees and the way we replace that is we've got Balnaves which is about a 20-million barrel oilfield we should have on &#x2013; Rod, when? 2014?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I have &#x2013; in fact, both Rod and I spent a week in September in Egypt. I happen to be the Head of the U.S. Egyptian Business Council, and we had 48 U.S. companies there, some of the largest companies in the world. We met with the President, the Prime Minister. I think we had government officials with us from the U.S. Quite frankly, we've been very pleased and very positive about not only that trip, but our relationship with the government. Rod alluded to that we have a new Petroleum Minister who is, frankly, a breath of fresh air. We've got more things done in the last 90 days than we got done in the last two years in terms of development leases approved, issues that we needed to get solved, a new gas contract at Hydra. So, honestly, I'm very positive about their direction, at least for our sector.</p>

And, then we had the North Sea <mark type="ph" /> tar (56:56) cost and some of the Canada SemCAMS plant downtime costs, turnaround costs in there as well. So, those are all one period type costs that you should see that coming down. And, with the production back up, the per BOE should drop as well.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Back to the Permian Basin, it sounds the Midland &#x2013; I guess I'd call it the Deadwood area, what would you characterize as your best part of the basin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd tell you, it's hard to tell. We thought the stuff we were doing down in the &#x2013; hang on one second, I've got &#x2013; now, he's going to give me a chart here. Well, the &#x2013; actually the best results we've had so far in individual wells is the Wolfcamp Shale. But, I don't know that if you caught that we drilled a well on the Central Basin platform in the Wichita-Albany. Those wells came on 900 barrels a day, still making about over 600 barrels a day, both of them, and we have about 23 locations to drill in there.</p>
          <p>So, the one thing I would say about the Permian Basin &#x2013; and the reason we started getting in there in 1991 and made a number of acquisitions before we made BP &#x2013; is exactly where we are today. We've got tremendous acreage position. It is the oiliest place in North America, oiliest place in the world outside of Russia. So, it has a lot of potential for horizontal drilling. And, I think Rod mentioned we're going from &#x2013; I don't &#x2013; we're going to drill 123 wells this year, horizontals. Next year, we're &#x2013; it's going to be more like half of our wells. We're just on the cusp, not just us, everybody is in terms of understanding the Permian Basin, the kind of oil that's out there.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we talked about it at the last conference but &#x2013; I mean call. But, we found gas. It had a real chance of finding gas. We thought we'd find an oil leg. We drilled on a big structure. We found some gas. That's not what we were looking for. We're now reevaluating that block. We've got 1 million acres there so we're reevaluating that block. I happen to see where Tullow just drilled another oil well onshore Kenya but we're &#x2013; this &#x2013; what we were looking for is not in the same horizon that Tullow is drilling onshore. I think they're in the Cretaceous.</p>

And, the follow-up question, going back to the Permian Basin; you mentioned &#x2013; you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks some good Cline results I thought, and I wondered if you could offer your thoughts on the relative maturity and attractiveness of the Cline horizontal play versus the Wolfcamp horizontal play?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Rod pointed out that well is making 600 barrels a day &#x2013; or tested first 30 days, I think, 600 barrels a day. And, I &#x2013; and if you look at our acreage position and what we showed at the resource potential and what we're looking at now, it's different. It's bigger because what we found is just &#x2013; we drilled a Barnett Shale well in the Deadwood area. We didn't drill it that far horizontal. It's made 300 barrels a day. I'll go back to my statement from the question earlier and that is, we &#x2013; as an industry, we haven't yet fully evaluated the most important plays in the Permian Basin and I'll go back to the Wichita-Albany. I'm shocked that the Wichita-Albany is making 900 barrels a day.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've drilled a couple of Cottage Grove wells &#x2013; actually more than that; I think we've drilled four. It's a very good play. The Anadarko Basin has sands from the Tonkawa, all the way down to the Atoka and, as you get deeper, it gets gassier. But that's another area that we have just scratched the surface as an industry and finding things, like Hogshooter. We go down there and drill a couple of Hogshooter wells and two or three of them make 4,000 barrels a day. And, I can't emphasize enough, you want to be in basins that have a lot of thickness and a lot of hydrocarbons and we're in two of the best. And, I will tell you, one of these days the Western Sedimentary Basin of Canada is going to look like this. They're just way &#x2013; they're a lot further back in terms of the learning curve and exploiting it.</p>

You talked about maybe getting more traction here with the new energy minister? How should we expect gross Egyptian oil production to change here as we get into 2013?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And, we're going to have to put on a little presentation. It's &#x2013; or maybe put something out. Actually, our gross production &#x2013; gross operated production in Egypt is higher than it was at the beginning of the year and our gross operated gas is higher than it was. What happens is that you get &#x2013; because of the way that the concession agreement works, the price of crude oil has an awful lot to do with what you report for net production. So, we need to start putting out our gross production and our net production because it's &#x2013; Egypt is still very good and it's going to continue to be good, and we're going to continue to see bumps in our net production based on oil prices.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I was looking at some of those numbers in your supplement and maybe I was looking at them wrong. But, I saw you did 211,000 gross barrels a day this quarter and I thought like....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That's about right. And, what we did in the quarter before, 216,000 barrels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I saw it 215,000 barrels in the first quarter of 2012 and it was like 220,000 barrels in the third quarter of 2011. It just looks like it's been slowly coming down. So, I wasn't sure if that was a Permian issue or bottlenecks or you guys just weren't....</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got you. And, you mentioned getting good traction in the last 90 days with the new Petroleum Minister over there. Do you expect that to really change things as we get into 2013 in Egypt for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I &#x2013; we've got 26 rigs running. We &#x2013; it still gives us the highest rate of return in the company. And, I don't &#x2013; that's probably what we're going to run all of next year.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Looking at your gas production in Egypt, the other thing I noticed was that it looks like your net take in the third quarter was a fair bit lower; I'm seeing about 36% of the gas versus the gross. And, previously it had always been 40% or higher. Anything particular that happened in the third quarter? Should we expect it to stay at that 36% level going forward? Is that going to rebound? How should we think about that?</p>

          <p>I've got to ask....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There has been no material change in the gross gas production except for the turnarounds we just mentioned. Some of this is PSC related, which Steve just mentioned. But, I should point out that the value of the gas and all that gas we produced in Egypt is only about 18% on a revenue basis compared to the value of the oil. So, all the value in Egypt is coming from oil and condensate we produce.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. A little bit more on the Williston Basin, if you might, just &#x2013; you've got I think three permits, maybe one well drilled and testing and just a little more color on that. That is question one. Question two, I've heard you've been actively leasing up there even more land. And, question three, have there have been any other well results by other companies that have been encouraging to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are in the process actually of fracing our first well up there, and we're drilling our second well. I think yesterday we were at 2,700 feet. So, we're going to have two wells down by the end of the year. We're not picking up big amounts of acreage, but we're filling in to the land blocks that we've put together, which is &#x2013; I think is about 300,000 acres or so. And, there have been some other operators &#x2013; it's not right next door &#x2013; that have announced pretty good results. The play is moving that way. So, hopefully, it moves all our way. We're going to find out here pretty quick.</p>
