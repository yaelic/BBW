          <p>Statoil presentation both to the audience here at the Brewery in London and to the audience following the presentation on Web or by phone.</p>
          <p>My name is Hilde Nafstad and I'm the Head of Investor Relations. Please note the emergency exits on both side of this room, one in the back of the room and one right behind me. Today's events can be followed by webcast. The webcast and transcript of the event will both be made available later.</p>
          <p>Today's program is placed in two. First, Statoil's Chief Executive Officer, Helge Lund, and Chief Financial Officer, Torgrim Reitan, will give a short fourth quarter and 2010 earnings presentation. At 1:30 London Time, we will start the strategy update with our CEO, CFO and our Executive Vice President for Development and Production, Norway, &#xD8;ystein Michelsen.</p>
          <p>Each of the two blocks of presentations, first the fourth quarter 2010 and then later the strategy update, will be followed by a Q&amp;A session. I would ask you to observe the phone number on the page where you access the webcast. This is the number to use for the Q&amp;A. The first Q&amp;A session is devoted exclusively to questions related to the fourth quarter and to the full-year 2010.</p>
          <p>At 6:30 London Time, Statoil published results for the fourth quarter of 2010. We also published all the presentations you are going to see today. Go to our website statoil.com and follow the link from the front page if you want to open and/or download these now. And I ask you both here in London and all the download presentations to carefully study the forward-looking statements at the end of the presentations.</p>
          <p>And now, it is my privilege to introduce our CEO and President, Helge Lund.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hilde. And welcome to all of you. It's good to be here. It's also good to be finally able to talk about 2010, but may be even more importantly to later talk about the future for Statoil. I feel that the focus of this session is primarily important as we look at our plans moving forward in the sessions later.</p>
          <p>2010 has been a very active strategic year with good strategic progress for Statoil. And we have also been active in terms of portfolio management. We have matured our portfolio &#x2013; five new fields have been set in production and we have sanctioned another nine projects. We are now also accessing high potential exploration acreage through now the nomination of Statoil by Sonangol as a partner and operator at several pre-salt opportunities in offshore Angola. We have also through our 2010, have been strengthening our unconventional U.S. gas position by accessing yet another breakeven field or area in the U.S.</p>
          <p>I think also in terms of strategic significance, it is important that we, through this year, have been able to lift successfully the Statoil Fuel and retail and thereby clarified even further the strategic profile of Statoil as a technology-driven upstream company. I think also that you have noted that we have been active with our international portfolio by the investor partners of 40% on the oil sands assets in Canada and also in our offshore assets in the shales under agreement and created, I think, very good value for Statoil and our shareholders.</p>
          <p>As it comes to all the active management of the portfolio over the last few years, we are now improving on our reserve replacement ratio and for the year 2010, it is now up to 87% for the year in total.</p>
          <p>During 2010 we have also maintained a very high activity level at the Norwegian Continental Shelf and I think securing the foundation for a sustained high level value creation at our home, in our home market. Production has been very strong and stable in the first part of the year, but during the second half of the year, we produced less than expected and I will come back to the reasons for that later in my presentation. I think although significant aspects of our 2010 results have been that we continued to improve on safety and on efficiency. We demonstrated good cost control in our operations, particularly in Norway. We delivered strong cash flow and continue to show that we care about also the direct dividend to our shareholders. And the proposal before the Board of Directors is to pay NOK6.25 per share for 2010.</p>
          <p>As I said, we produced at a high level during the first half of 2010 demonstrating the capacity of our portfolio. And I was especially pleased with our operational performance and the stability of our performance in that period. And we were able therefore to utilize most of our capacity.</p>
          <p>During the second half of the year, we experienced specific operational issues taking the annual production to a lower level than we expected earlier in the year. As we told you at the third quarter presentation in Oslo, the Q3 was impacted by plant maintenance, especially also this year impacting our gas delivery system. This combined with specific operational issues at our Gullfaks feed, lower than expected production permits on Ormen Lange. Going into Q4, we also talked about during the Q3 presentation that we decided to temporarily shut down some production wells on the Gullfaks south field and on the Tyrihans field and that was to make sure that we preserve the reservoir and the production capacity for the longer run.</p>
          <p>The result of this, as you know already now, was that we took down the production guidance from 1,925,000 barrels per day and 1,975,000 barrels a day, the range, down to 1.9 million barrels per day. In the fourth quarter, we saw slower-than-expected build up of production from the massive turnaround program we had in Q3. This combined with certain operational issues at some of our partly operated assets in Angola and Azerbaijan and also some issues at the NC assets led production level lower that was than we had anticipated at the third quarter. So this took us for the year down to 1,888,000 barrels for the year in total.</p>
          <p>We are now working with all our teams to make sure that we correct these specific operational issues. I do not see that this is a systematic issues, although some of them I'll probably speak to later today will also influence production in 2011.</p>
          <p>If you look at the results a little bit more in detail, we delivered strong cash flows and good financial results in 2010. But our fourth quarter in 2010 adjusted earnings was NOK40.8 billion, and that is up 19% from last year. And for the year 2010, the adjusted earnings was NOK142.8 billion, up 9%. This was primarily driven by oil prices, higher oil prices, partly offset by lower gas prices for the year, as a moderate six months delay in the gas prices compared to how the market is working and also lower volumes.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to again show that we are demonstrating good cost control and the costs in our operations are largely in line with last year.</p>
          <p>A few comments on the different business area. E&amp;P in Norway delivered yet another strong financial result, underpinning the strategic importance and financial importance of these great assets for Statoil. And we will later today go through in detail how we would like to develop our position there as we move forward.</p>
          <p>International E&amp;P continue to build momentum and adjusted earnings increased by 50% year-on-year. Natural gas continued to demonstrate high financial results and significant value creation in a changing gas market. Marketing and manufacturing is influenced by the poor market conditions for our refineries. Torgrim, our new CFO, will take you in much more in detail on some of these numbers later in this part of the presentation.</p>
          <p>Our performance this year again enables us to pay an attractive dividend to our shareholders. Since the lifting of Statoil in 2001, we have always given high priority to dividends. This illustration that you see here, just now take into account the fact that we paid special dividends for a number of years. So the actual payout ratio was even higher than what you will see here. And the ordinary dividend has increased over the years. The Board of Directors, as I said, had decided to propose a cash dividend of NOK6.25 per share at the annual general meeting. This will take place in Stavanger on the 19th of May. This implies that the ordinary dividend will grow by more than 4% from last year and it implies a payout ratio of 52% of net income. Let me now give the floor to our new CFO, Torgrim Reitan, he will expand on the quarter and also on the financials. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Helge. As many of you know, I took up the position as CFO, only one month ago. And it's good to finally get started in my new job. It's a privilege to set up as a CFO in a company with financial information and with clear growth opportunities. But you like details, but I'm not going to go through all the numbers that we planned in the MD&amp;A, we go through the highlights and the key drivers of our results.</p>
          <p>Our quarterly result is strong. And as you know, we have large exposure through the changes in oil and gas prices. But these increasing prices have had a significant impact. But we cannot be fully satisfied as we did not utilize the entire production capacity in the second half of the year. However, the increase in oil and gas prices worst than all stated, the negative impact from reduced volumes in the quarter. And we see an improvement both in reported and adjusted results related to fourth quarter in 2009. The reported net income increased by 37% from fourth quarter in 2009 and the adjusted earnings increased by 19%.</p>
          <p>The main causes to the change in earnings is the following. The increase in oil and gas prices contributed positively by NOK12 billion. The decrease in production caused a reduction of NOK4 billion. Exploration had a negative impact of NOK1.6 billion while refining yielded net results compared to last year.</p>
          <p>The illustration behind me takes you from the reported net income to adjusted earnings of the company. The adjustments in the quarter amounts to NOK2 billion. The most important one is related to renegotiations of regasification capacities at Cove Point. The length of that contract is short and the commitment in the remaining period is also reduced. We have then therefore reversed NOK2.7 billion of earlier provisions related to the contract. You'll find more details in the MD&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, our operating expenses, they were reduced by 4% quarter-on-quarter, while the selling, general and administrative costs increased due to ramp up of new production. We spent more on exploration and we have two expensive events that we expensed in the quarter. That is Tonga/Caesar in the Gulf of Mexico and the Kollsnes on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.</p>
          <p>The financial items, when we adjust for foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives was NOK0.3 billion. In other words close to 0 and exactly what you should expect. The tax rate was 74% in the fourth quarter both for reported earnings and adjusted earnings. The main explanation for the relatively high tax rate in the quarter is the segment that experienced international E&amp;P in this quarter was around 83%. And this is related to provisions and expenses of the Tonga/Caesar I just mentioned. We had earlier guided on a segment tax rate internationally at 40% to 45%. Adjusting for the provision in costly countries where we do not have tax shields for accounting purposes, the guiding is still valid.</p>
          <p>Okay. Let's turn to the full year 2010. The reported net income more than doubled from 2009 to 2010. The adjustment for the full year amount to NOK5.5 billion. Impairment losses related to Mongstad and Kalundborg are the main contributors. The adjusted earnings after-tax increased by 11%. Increasing oil price had of course a significant effect on the gas prices for 2010, actually was lower than in 2009. And this is due to adjusted majority of our gas sales are on long-term oil link contract where we had a lag in the pricing. So the 2009 gas price was heavily impacted by the very high oil prices in 2008. The total price effect explains NOK40 billion of the increase from 2009.</p>
          <p>Reduced productions contributed negatively by NOK13 billion and adjusted exploration expenses was NOK4 billion higher in 2010 than in 2009. These completed certain line items in 2010 and that includes expansions. And we have 25, 31 wells where we defined as incomplete. Total adjusted exploration was NOK17 billion and that was somewhat above our guidance given last year.</p>
          <p>We reduced our adjusted operating expenses by NOK1 billion last year. And we had a reduction in the combined operating expenses and SG&amp;A. That is despite that we have cost spending in production in new fields and we now have more fields under operations. This is due to cost improvement of resources and also from lower production from 2010 to 2009.</p>
          <p>The tax rate was around 72% for 2010 based of reported earnings and 71% based of adjusted earnings.</p>
          <p>I would also like to mention that total fuel and retail is still consolidated 100% in the lower costs due to that we own more than 50%. Statoil Fuel and Retail is reported as a separate segment.</p>
          <p>Let me then turn to the cash flow. Cash generation has been strong throughout the year. And the cash flow from operations has been more than sufficient to cover taxes, investments and EBITDA. Our cash flow for 2010 is of course largely impacted by increased oil prices. And we generated NOK190 billion in cash from underlying operations and we paid NOK92 billion in taxes.</p>
          <p>Our cash flow to investments was NOK78 billion, a number around what we told you one year ago. Since the closure of the Canada transaction and the Peregrino transaction belonging to 2011. The proceeds of these will be part of the 2011 cash flow. However, we have received some premium prepayments from the transactions already. The Canada transaction, that was by the way closed in January.</p>
          <p>In 2010 we paid NOK19 billion in dividends or NOK6 per share. During 2010, we also took advantage of favorable market conditions in the gas markets and issued new debt of $2 billion. Okay, debt-to-capital employed ended at 25% at year-end and that is gone from 27% one year ago. So this leaves us with a very strong financial position as we enter 2011. And I'm very pleased to step up as the CFO for a company in good shape.</p>
          <p>So 2010 in brief: Strong results and cash flow, high production in the first half of the year but temporary operational issues in the second half, continued portfolio optimizations resulting in value-creating optimizations, value creating transactions, and many projects on the way that we will discuss later today.</p>
          <p>So thank you for your attention and then I will leave the floor to Hilde to lead us through the Q&amp;A session.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. As Torgrim said, he will now turn to the Q&amp;A session. The session will last for approximately 15 minutes. Let me just repeat and emphasize certainly in this session only we'll take questions related to 2010. You will have the opportunity to ask forward-looking questions in the next session. Please limit yourselves to one question at the time. For the audience in the room, please give me a signal if you have a question. Microphones will be passed. For the audience on the phone, please listen to the operator's instructions regarding asking questions, which will come right now. Operator, can you please give out the procedure for questions?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Do we have any questions from the audience? Yes, we have one over here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm Paul Spedding from HSBC. I wonder if you could give us an indication as to how your production ended the year, because clearly Q4 was impacted by various unusual outages. I was just hoping to get a better picture for what the quarter could have looked like if things have gone more according to plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had -- in the third quarter results we've given operating guidance of 1.5 million barrels a day. That was taking into account the knowledge we had at that point in time. We ended slightly below that number for the year-end, and that was related to operational issues in the partner-operated part of the portfolio, Angola and Azerbaijan and we also had some issues related to gas processing on the Kollsnes. And we had testing issues as well, which we put out there on the news. So I think if you add those, you have the main contributors to the exceptionals in fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Brendan Warn from Jefferies. Just on CapEx, backward-looking question in terms of can you give us any clarity or breakdown on the CapEx in terms of what was spent on new developments versus stay-in-business? And also split from Norwegian Continental Shelf and international, and just whether any of the under-spend in '08 and '09 has led to some of the production issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was for 2010. It's broadly split equally between Norwegian Continental Shelf and internationally and generally we spend around 10% in related to activities, refinery upgrades, and new energy. There you have the growth. I would say if you're looking into the international investments, both are heavily made into growth prospects. When we look at Norwegian investments, a significant part has moved to grow that part of the business and investing in new projects. But they also have a significant part to improve valuation and improve the performance, especially production. We will talk more about it in the afternoon session.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the second part of your question, there is no relationship between the slightly lower CapEx and the production shortfall lost in the fourth quarter that it also a very specific point that we already mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, can I have the next question from the audience?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's John Olaisen from Carnegie. A question on the production permit on Ormen Lange. We didn't get -- there is no expansion of production guidance for that field in 2010. That's a little bit unwise. So the disputes on the optimal production led to the characteristics et cetera? Why didn't you get the production from it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The explanations are given for that. So we have to take what we get. But beyond that, we do not anticipate any general change when it comes to policies related to production permits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may, just a follow-up on that one. For next year, it seems like strong gasoline Norway's experiencing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> We do not normally give explanations for production permits. But it's true that for the next year we have a lower production permit for the next half year than we've had in the past. And that is also partly explained in the investor call later today, that a lower production in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there any more questions here in London?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have one over here.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. This year you cut CapEx by close to 10% while one of the competitors, Shell, maintained their CapEx and they have been both marketing, and also a stronger production performance. Is it related to that they have a stronger balance sheet difference in macro view or the opportunities that they were able to do that? And do you think still that is a good choice to cut that growth, cut that CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we have seen in the last two years, we have given our results and the quality or performing, we are quite high CapEx level and discussed the CapEx level moving forward. We are actually pretty probable, the fact that we were able through the financial crisis to handle the balance sheet in a way that protected the majority of our investment program both in Norway and internationally. And it's not any business goal, decisive strategy to cut back on CapEx. Is more timing issues when they have been able to due to maturing prospects.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I think we will close this morning's first session. We will now take a break and then we will continue at 1:30 for the capital markets update. So please get back from break. Thank you very much.</p>
