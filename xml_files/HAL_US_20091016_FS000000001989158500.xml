          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Halliburton's Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Christian Garcia, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please begin.</p>

          <p>Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Third Quarter 2009 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast, and the replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release announcing the third quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President, Drilling and Evaluation Division and Corporate Development.</p>
          <p>I'd like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, and current reports on Form 8-K.</p>
          <p>Note that we will be using the term International to refer to our operations outside the U.S. and Canada, and we will refer to the combination of U.S. and Canada as North America. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures; reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release announcing the third quarter results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian, and good morning to everyone. Here's a summary of our overall results for the third quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter grew 3% from the second quarter and represents the first sequential revenue increase we've experienced since the fourth quarter of 2008. Most of our product service lines registered sequential growth from the prior quarter with software and asset solutions and production enhancement showing mid to high single digit growth from second quarter levels.</p>
          <p>Our International business registered an overall revenue increase of 3% despite a 1% decline in the rig count from the prior quarter. While there is a risk of further decline in international activity in the coming quarters, I am more optimistic than I was previously that this downturn will not match previous cycles in terms of duration and depth.</p>
          <p>However, we believe operators will not materially increase their spending levels despite stable commodity prices without compelling evidence of recovery in hydrocarbon demand. As a result, they continue to reduce capital expenditures by deferring projects and exerting pressure on the oil service companies to improve their project economics.</p>
          <p>In North America the market continues to be challenging. Natural gas fundamentals remain fragile despite the first signs of a supply response resulting from the severe curtailment in drilling activity. Weak domestic gas demand coupled with the productivity of the new shale resources has led to gas storage record &#x2013; reaching record levels. We believe that a significant improvement in the natural gas market in the next few quarters is unlikely without the resurgence of a broad market economic demand and support of winter withdrawal and supply patterns.</p>
          <p>While we expect that the industry will see accelerating production declines in the coming months in response to reduced drilling activities, we don't believe these declines will be adequate to provide a meaningful near term correction of the current supply and demand imbalance. Despite these challenges, we are continuing to successfully execute our strategy implemented at the beginning of the downturn to navigate through this environment by aligning our resources to those areas that best leverage our differentiated technologies.</p>
          <p>Let's discuss now in more detail the International and North American markets. The International revenue grew 3% sequentially and now represents 64% of our total business. We saw double digit sequential growth in the North Sea, the Northern Gulf in the Middle East and Russia. For example, our Russian revenues grew 18% sequentially, and it is clear that the Russian market bottomed from depressed levels in the first quarter. Production has not declined as feared with production coming onstream from greenfield areas such as Salim, Uvat and Bancore, all of which were serviced by Halliburton.</p>
          <p>While we expect to see a slight increase in meterage drilled in Russia for 2010, operators continue to be challenged by lingering financial market issues that could restrain some of the strength of the recovery in Russia.</p>
          <p>We also saw a 9% sequential revenue increase in Brazil in the third quarter. As you know, we've been awarded several new contracts that expand our market position with Petrobras and other participating IOCs. In addition to winning a package for drilling fluid services, we also secured additional contracts for wireline, drill bits, and directional drilling, all with Petrobras. We also continue to increase our exposure to the growing IOC market in Brazil with a new fluids contract. Deepwater Brazil is an important and growing segment, and this expansion of our position there will be beneficial to our long-term prospects. We expect solid revenue growth into next year with a ramp-up of these new contracts as well as overall higher upstream development activity being forecast for the Brazilian market.</p>
          <p>Excluding our employee separation costs, International margins for the third quarter were a healthy 22% versus 20% for the second quarter. As we stated last quarter we continue to believe that International margins will be under pressure through 2010. This is based on our knowledge of the lower pricing in the recently competitive tendering activity that took place for work that will begin later this year and into next year. That pricing would suggest downward risk to current margins, which could be partially offset by a more significant rebound in upstream spending.</p>
          <p>Also, unlike the U.S. market where volume and pricing fell so rapidly that we could not keep our revenues in balance with costs, we have more visibility and time to proactively work on our cost structure and introduce new technologies in the international market, and this may help mitigate some of this pricing impact. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in the last few years in building our International franchise, and I believe it will continue to pay dividends as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to North America. Revenue grew 2% sequentially. While the overall U.S. rig count increased from the prior quarter, the increase was predominantly in oil-directed rigs with gas-directed rigs declining 6% from the second quarter. In addition most of the rig activity increase was vertical in nature and operated by the private E&amp;P companies who are not our traditional customers and are not as service or technology intensive.</p>
          <p>Despite the lower service intensity and the 6% gas rig activity decline, we saw our first sequential revenue increase in North America since the third quarter of 2008. We continue to see our market share increase across most basins as operators direct their work preferentially toward those providers that have broader offerings and better service quality.</p>
          <p>The Gulf of Mexico had a weak quarter due to a continuing decline in shelf activity, with the offshore rig count down 33% sequentially from the second quarter. However, we continue to make progress in expanding our well construction businesses which will benefit from the influx of deepwater rigs in the upcoming quarters.</p>
          <p>We also benefited somewhat from the seasonal recovery in the Canadian market. However, as you all know, the proportion of the Canadian market to our overall North American business is quite small.</p>
          <p>We continue to see significant pricing pressure during the third quarter for those product lines that have the most excess capacity in the market. However, improved activity as the quarter progressed helped stabilize margins. During the quarter, pricing for our stimulation business stabilized in some basins and reservoirs but continues to decline in areas of robust activity like the Haynesville and Marcellus shales, which are particularly competitive.</p>
          <p>As we have stated in the past, in our view much of the industry's existing stimulation equipment is unsuitable for the lower depths and pressures of the new shale plays. We believe that the continued use of suboptimal equipment by the oil service industry for these harsh shale environments is unsustainable. This will facilitate the absorption of this oversupplied equipment situation in the market as equipment is much more quickly used up, particularly if our competitors are unwilling or unable to expend the appropriate fund to maintain their equipment.</p>
          <p>So while we see signs that pricing is stabilizing across all product lines in service basins, as I said, in others it is not. But overall, margins are bottoming out. They may be under pressure slightly in the fourth quarter due to the typical season weather factors, the environmental stipulations that affect the operations in the Rockies and potential declines during the holidays when customers typically stop spending in an environment like this and send their people home.</p>
          <p>In addition, in the third quarter we saw customers continue to drill more wells than they completed. We now believe that there is an inventory of about 13 to 1,500 uncompleted wells in North America. Part of this is due to the low gas price and part is due to customers not wanting to grow their actual production until they have their 2010 hedges in place. While this will be very positive for us when this completion backlog is worked off in 2010, it clearly created a disconnect between demand for drilling-related services versus completion-related services in the third quarter. We expect this to continue into the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>This disconnect can be seen in our third quarter results for our U.S. land operations, where our drilling-related product service lines showed an 8% sequential increase in revenue and some actual margin expansion, but our completion-related product lines, primarily stimulation, showed only a 1% sequential increase in revenue with some related margin contraction. This lower level of completion activity affected the product lines, of course, with the largest industry over capacity, and we believe this is another contributor that could pressure fourth quarter pricing.</p>
          <p>All this being said, however, we believe that margin expansion in 2010 is possible, that it will result from activity increases rather than be pricing led, and that further pricing erosion can be mitigated by realization of our cost savings initiatives. We are also anticipating a structural shift in the U.S. land market because I am convinced our resources become a more prominent component of the production profile.</p>
          <p>We expect to benefit from this trend as operators are drilling longer horizontals and increasing their fracture and stimulation treatments to enhance initial production rates. This is why it is so important for us to direct our resources to those areas. We have expanded our facilities this year to support our growth in the Marcellus, Haynesville and Williston basins. We believe these investments in our differentiated technologies will ensure that we will retain our market share gains and accelerate our growth once the market recovers.</p>
          <p>While the near term look for both North America and International continues to be challenging, we have been executing against our strategy of improving our position in key markets. Internationally, our incremental capital spending has been geared disproportionately toward deeper water where we are well positioned, and in North America we have seen our market share increase in a number of basins as operators prefer to rely on Halliburton's broad offerings and service quality for their work.</p>
          <p>The success of this strategy appears to be supported by the recent Oilfield Market Report by Spears &amp; Associates that indicates that we have gained market share in all of our product lines on a worldwide basis. And Tim will talk about this in more detail. Uncertainty about the timing and breadth of the recovery remains, and various factors will influence the path of growth coming out of this downturn in the many markets we serve.</p>
          <p>However, our strategic imperative has been to continue to identify and increase our exposure to the industry's highest growth markets. The underlying trend toward well complexity will drive increased service intensity and provide beneficial overtones to our business as we go forward, whether it's in increased reliance on unconventional resources or expansion of the deepwater drilling activity worldwide.</p>
          <p>Let me turn the call over to Mark, and he can go into more detail on our financial results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide you with our third quarter operational highlights, and I'll be comparing our third quarter results sequentially to the second quarter of 2009. Our revenue in the third quarter was $3.6 billion, up 3% from the second quarter. As Dave mentioned, this is the first time since the fourth quarter of 2008 that we have shown a sequential quarterly increase.</p>
          <p>On a geographic basis, most regions grew sequentially led by our eastern hemisphere regions, each with a 4% increase. International revenue grew 3% versus an average international rig count decline of 1%. North America revenue grew 2% despite the challenging pricing environment. Total operating income for the third quarter of $474 million was essentially flat from the previous quarter, as increased operating income in international markets offset continue weakness in North America.</p>
          <p>In addition, we recognize $28 million in employee separation costs during the third quarter as we continue to execute our cost control program. Our second quarter 2009 results included $17 million in employee separation costs. International margins in the third quarter were 22%, excluding employee separation costs, up from the second quarter due to strong completion tool sales in the Middle East/Asia and pipeline services and vessel activity in Europe/Africa/CIS.</p>
          <p>These types of activities tend to be lumpy from a timing standpoint. In fact, our International region, Latin America, registered a margin decline from the second quarter due to lower activity in select markets and the impact of pricing pressures. As Dave indicated, despite the overall strong margin results for Q3, we believe that our International margins are at risk to fall into the upper teens over the next five quarters driven by lower pricing. The timing and the depth of the margin decline will be dependent on various project startups which we expect to predominantly occur in the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>For North America, margins in the third quarter fell from the prior quarter consistent with our guidance at our second quarter earnings call. Average pricing continued to deteriorate in the third quarter, but we are now seeing pricing stabilize for most of our product service lines. Overall North American margins experienced a gradual improvement throughout the quarter, driven by improved activity and cost savings. So leading edge margins suggest to us that we are near the bottom. However, as Dave pointed out, we still expect that we could see a slight margin decline in the fourth quarter due to the typical seasonal issues in the Rockies and operators' holiday schedules.</p>
          <p>Now I'll highlight the segment results and note that we've excluded employee separation costs in the comparisons that follow. Completion and Production revenue increased $69 million or 4%, mainly due to increased activity in Russia, the North Sea and Angola. Production enhancement revenue grew 6% from the second quarter from increased International activity. Overall Completion and Production operating income was flat, as the flow through of increased International revenue was offset by continued pricing declines in North America.</p>
          <p>Looking at Completion and Production on a geographic basis, North America revenue increased while operating income declined as higher U.S. land activity was outweighed by price erosion. As Dave mentioned, we're seeing strong signs that pricing is bottoming across most basins which may lead to the stabilization of margins in the next couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, Completion and Production revenues slightly declined, and operating income fell 14%, driven by lower activity across all product lines in Venezuela and Argentina. In addition, higher second quarter deliveries of completion tools in Mexico and Brazil also affected the segment's results in the third quarter, which is typical of this product service line since it often experiences irregular delivery patterns from quarter to quarter.</p>
          <p>In Europe/Africa/CIS, Completion and Production revenue and operating income increased 10% and 57%, respectively, due to recovery in Russia and improved vessel and pipeline and processing services activity in the North Sea and West Africa. We expect to see vessel activity decline in the fourth quarter consistent with historical seasonal patterns.</p>
          <p>In Middle East/Asia, Completion and Production posted sequential increases in revenue and operating income of 6% and 17%, respectively, with higher production enhancement activity in Southeast Asia and increased completion tool sales in Saudi Arabia, China and India.</p>
          <p>In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating incomes increased slightly on sequential growth in North America and Middle East/Asia. We continue to see considerable improvement in our Baroid product service line, which had operating income growth across all regions.</p>
          <p>In North America, Drilling and Evaluation's revenue and operating income each increased 3% as our well construction product service lines continue to benefit from the favorable mix toward horizontal drilling, notably in the Haynesville and Marcellus shale. Growth in land operations was offset by a decline in the Gulf of Mexico from lower shelf activity and deepwater rig delays. Looking ahead, we see stronger Gulf of Mexico activity for the division as additional deepwater rigs come online.</p>
          <p>Drilling and Evaluation's Latin America revenue and operating income remain flat from the prior quarter. Lower revenue in Venezuela was offset by increased drilling in Mexico and wireline and testing jobs in Brazil. During the quarter, we commenced our Chicontepec drilling project and are currently working on four rigs. The heavy rain that occurred in the last week of September had a minimal impact on our drilling operations in the field.</p>
          <p>In the Europe/Africa/CIS region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue was flat, and operating income was up 15% from the prior quarter as a result of the strong flow through of the revenue increases in the Caspian and Russia as well as a better mix toward higher margin directional drilling activity in Norway and Angola. Drilling and Evaluation's Middle East/Asia revenue was up 3%, but operating income declined 6% due to the mix of projects in Saudi Arabia and project startup costs in Southeast Asia.</p>
          <p>Now I'll address some additional financial items. As the second part of our two-prong strategy of navigating through this downturn, we continue to generate positive cash flow and maintain our strong liquidity position while at the same time investing the necessary capital to improve our overall competitive position. By focusing on the management of our working capital, we generated approximately $100 million of positive cash flow for the quarter and have $3.2 billion of cash and equivalents in investments and marketable securities at the end of September.</p>
          <p>Our current net debt to total capitalization ratio has decreased to 11% at the end of the third quarter. We continue to hold $1.2 billion of unused borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facilities and continue to maintain our investment grade debt ratings. We anticipate that corporate expenses will be approximately 50 to $55 million in the fourth quarter. We continue to forecast our 2009 effective income tax rate for the full year of 2009 to be between 31 and 32%.</p>
          <p>And finally we're currently in the process of setting our capital expenditure plan for 2010 and will be providing more specific CapEx guidance during our fourth quarter call. A key part of our capital strategy in 2009 has been to spend within our operating cash flows. And at this point, that strategy will continue to be our guiding principal for next year. However, if we see positive changes in activity or the industry outlook, we'll make adjustments accordingly. Further, we continually reassess the configuration of our tools and equipment based or our view of the market. So for competitive reasons we will not be providing further updates on additions and retirements of our equipment.</p>
          <p>Tim?</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this year we discussed the parallels of this cycle compared to previous cycles. This quarter provides the industry with additional reference points, and with that in mind it's a good time to revisit analogies from past downturns.</p>
          <p>Based on the familiar mix that we discussed earlier in the call of supply, storage and demand, it's our view that the North America cycle could be consistent with that of the 2002 recovery. In 2002, gas-directed recants rebounded from trough levels and were then range bound for around 33 weeks, verse being range bound for around 17 weeks at this point in the 2009 cycle. If we follow this pattern, then drilling activity may remain at restrained levels into the first half of 2010 before demonstrating a meaningful increase.</p>
          <p>Complicating factors in the recovery include shut-in wells and the impact of the 1,300 to 1,500 wells which have been drilled and not completed, as referenced by Dave earlier. The largest concentration of these appears to be in the Barnett. For reference, there are approximately 4,200 gas well completions in the second quarter, down sharply from last year. Accordingly, the inventory of wells is now becoming statistically significant and could represent 7,000 or more frac stages.</p>
          <p>Internationally, the '97 cycle took about 84 weeks to reach trough and then rebounded sharply. Currently we're in the 48th week of decline but expect that this international downturn will be shallower in amplitude and shorter in duration than the previous cycle. In our view, the industry's supply issues, impacted primarily by accelerating decline curves, are more pervasive today than they've been in the past.</p>
          <p>While operators are continuing to constrain incremental upstream spending, they're taking advantage of lower service costs while keeping activity levels relatively steady. However, as prolonged underinvestment exacerbates supply concerns, this may lead to a robust rebound in international activity as the global economy recovers. We've been working hard to execute our strategy, and as Dave pointed out, the current Spears' Oilfield Market Report provides additional data points to support our progress. However, we participate in roughly 25 to 30% of all the oil field segments monitored by Spears.</p>
          <p>According to the latest report, Halliburton is growing share by five to 9% across all of our product lines, except in directional drilling and testing where they report an approximate 15% increase in these businesses. We're especially pleased that our directional drilling business has overtaken our closest competitor and gone in the number two spot. The same holds true for our drill bits product service line where we're now the number three player in that segment.</p>
          <p>Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Tim. To summarize, we're seeing signs that pricing has bottomed in North America, though as we said, margins may decline slightly in the fourth quarter due to the items that we enumerated. Our International market and outlook remains unchanged. Operators are currently not increasing their spending until they see evidence of broad based demand recovery. And we believe margin degradation is possible over 2010, based on the competitive tendering we've seen, although we may be able to mitigate some of this with cost controls and increased volumes from the recently awarded work we've gotten.</p>
          <p>We are successfully expanding our market position in key markets during this down cycle, and we believe that by deploying our resources where we think activity will be robust, we will retain the share gains we've experienced and accelerate our growth once the industry rebounds.</p>
          <p>I think it would be good to open it up for questions at this point, and Christian, do you want to lay down the rules?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> One moment for the first question. Our first question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. Dave, you mentioned that you were more confident with respect to the international markets, and you provided some commentary along those lines, but you also mentioned that you were seeing continued reticence on the part of the IOCs with regard to prosecuting spending increases due to a lack of confidence demand, so forth and so on. How is your increased confidence internationally manifesting itself with respect to your International business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Bill, in a couple ways. One, the &#x2013; if you look at commodity prices have bounced around a little bit in Q3 but now seem to be settling sort of into the 70 to $80 range. Part of it is just due to a lot of the discussions I've had with our customers in the international marketplace about their spending plans and the fact that some major projects like the Gorgon project and several of those have now been sanctioned and are going forward. And I think as one IOC sees other IOCs take big projects forward, then I think that tends to just build on itself. So I think it's really been more based on discussions and my confidence level has therefore increased that this is not going to be maybe as hard a downturn as we thought or I thought a quarter or so ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then secondly with respect to the follow-up. If you could provide just some brief commentary and outlook and insight with regard to two markets, Mexico, especially Chicontepec, as well as Iraq?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me handle Iraq first. Actually I was recently in Baghdad, and there's clearly a lot of activity, a lot of people are going in and out of there. It's certainly is a market that has a reserve base that will support a &#x2013; I think a large and diversified oil services industry going forward. And I think it's also going to be a market that really sort of calls for every type of philosophy of service work, from sort of an integrated package drilling market to traditional services to maybe even some risk taking. And I think there's really going to be room for all of that in there.</p>
          <p>That being said, there's really not a lot going on in there other than people looking at building some infrastructure. We are in the process of staffing up in Iraq. We are moving equipment in. But I really don't see that we will have a significant revenue stream out of there, certainly for several years. We will have revenue. We will have revenue this year, we'll have more revenue next year, but it's not really going to be meaningful, I don't think, for a couple of years.</p>
          <p>But clearly it is a big prize out there for oil services, and I think you see everybody trying to establish a base there, and we're no exception. But clearly a great future there, and one we will participate in in a big way.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, I think everybody has sort of been reading the news around Chicontepec. We obviously have some exposures in Chicontepec with some of the projects that we have won. We don't have the exposure that maybe some of our competitors do. I think that there clearly is a rethink going on within Pemex on the contracting philosophy around Chicontepec. Right now the contracting philosophy has been sort of drill the cheapest hole and really don't worry about maximizing production. And I think that concept is being rethought within.</p>
          <p>I think the upper reaches of Pemex, and we think that perhaps they would envision changing that contracting philosophy going forward to make it more of one that increases production versus just drilling the cheapest hole. We are just getting started on our Chicontepec project, and it really isn't providing any meaningful revenue or operating revenue at this point in time. So we continue to watch that market and see whether that philosophy is going to result in a change.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks. First question on International margins, if I understand your comments correctly, it sound like you're still looking at a three to 500 basis point margin compression, but it's from the third quarter level of around 22% as opposed to let's say the second quarter level. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, Geoff, that if you look at what we said last quarter, we thought it would be three to 500 basis points, and our margins were lower. Our margins are a bit higher this quarter which is why I think we've adjusted our thinking into the high teens from the mid to high teens. So I think generally you would conclude that.</p>
          <p>I think the &#x2013; let me just reiterate now that you sort of opened the door there. I mean, the issue is if you look at the pricing that we're having to tender to work, it would suggest and will result in lower margins going forward. However, because of the length of time we have to prepare for these contracts, we also can more easily adjust our cost structure to anticipate that revenue stream, and therefore perhaps some of that pricing decline can get mitigated, especially the more time you have to get ready.</p>
          <p>So I'm not trying to be cute here, it's just that we &#x2013; the more time you have to get ready for a project, the better you can do to get your costs in line. And one of the silver linings I think, of this slowdown has been even though a lot of this work has been tendered and we've been successful in winning it, the delay of implementing these projects has in fact given us even more time to work on our supply chain and to work on our infrastructure cost to try to offset some of the margin decline that you had to give up in pricing. So that's really why we believe the pressure is going to be there. But the longer we have, the less that impact's going to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add some color on that, Geoff, I calculate that probably about 50 basis points of the margin improvement in Q3 is due to cost savings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as a follow-up, kind of the comment you made, Dave, are pretty broad and would apply across your International business in terms of supply chain and so on. But as you look, are there markets where you would expect to see perhaps no margin compression or markets where you would expect to see outsized margin compression? And if you do see differentials, would that be more because of mix, differential pricing pressure or really just the timing of projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, Geoff, I'm not going to be as foolish as to say there's a market where we won't have any compression or I guarantee our customers in that area will come straight at the service industry and want some compression of margins, so. But there are markets like that, but I'm certainly not going to enumerate them.</p>
          <p>But there are markets that have gotten very, very competitive just because of the prizes that are out there. Two that would come to mind, one would be &#x2013; the first would be Brazil. We've been very successful in winning projects down there. But that's also a very big prize that our competition also sees. And I think the &#x2013; therefore, the pressure on the tendering process has been pretty good.</p>
          <p>West Africa in Angola would be another where you see big projects, long-term projects, lots of dollars involved, and those also have tended to get very, very competitive. Then I would say the markets where activity is less robust, but us and our competitors have sort of large embedded infrastructures like the North Sea, where there's very little activity going on but a large fixed cost base. So anything that comes up for tender in an area like that, and I'm talking about the UK sector of the North Sea, also tends to get very, very competitive in terms of pricing.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hi, guys. I guess the first question, couple unrelated ones, but the first question is maybe the recontracting cycle. Often as you head toward the end of the year, you wind up recontracting with your clients. Has the current market changed that? Did you do so much recontracting in the first half of the year and fixing your pricing base out for a while that we're not going to see or hear about a lot of the recontracting now as we turn to the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, yes, you will not hear much about it as we get to the end of the year, mainly because that philosophy has essentially been tossed out the door by our customer base. Because of the overcapacity, especially in the pressure pumping side of the business. It really is &#x2013; I wouldn't quite say it's a job by job, but certainly it's a maybe 30-well program or 50-well program at a time, and then the customer tends to go out and retender it or rebid it or, in many cases with us, renegotiate it. It didn't go out for tender, but they try to renegotiate sort of based on the current market.</p>
          <p>So the process that was in place over the last several years when things were a lot busier for the service industry was to try to tie up the service company for a year, negotiate a price, and then sort of sit back and say great, now I have the resources. With the excess capacity that's available today, customers feel no compunction about tearing up an agreement and basically taking it back out for tender. And I don't really see that that's going to change until some of this overhang of equipment goes out of the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Makes sense. I'm glad we covered it, but it makes sense. I guess another Q4 type of question, as it relates to the normal, what I'll call the normal seasonal up tick, in things like export sales and your wireline business and the tools business. Often I assume you have some visibility about that. Where do you see that as it relates to this Q4, and what does that say about what the customers are willing to commit to regarding programs for the following year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say that that's a thing that's changed also a bit. We have pretty good visibility in terms of backlog for traditional sales, and we're not seeing the buildup in backlog that we typically would this time of year. I think part of it is just our customers are also paying a great deal more attention to their inventory supplies, their supply chain. As our supply chain has gotten more efficient at being able to produce and ship stuff on a real-time basis, our customers have sort of &#x2013; they've started to draw down their own inventory stocking expectations.</p>
          <p>And then, of course, I think you've got the whole element of the projects that have slowed down and not knowing when they're going to start up. I don't think you're going to see &#x2013; and that's part of what we're trying to broadcast here. I don't think you're going to see the spike-up of sales that we typically see in Q4, at least our order books wouldn't support that at this point in time. It doesn't really concern me greatly because as I said, I think part of it is just a more efficient supply chain all the way through the industry. But certainly some of it is a reluctance on the part of our customers to spend what capital they have here the balance of the year. And I would hope that we would see that backlog pop up as we get into next year. But we'll just have to wait and see.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I've got a couple questions. The first one being on &#x2013; there seem to have been a lot of fluids contracts recently. If you could tell us what's going to change or changing at Baroid, is this just like a clusters or is your competitive position changed at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Tim. Alan, we've had a significant focus on Baroid over the last couple of years. Jeff Miller, who leads that product line, has been really very focused on developing a strong to essentially rebuild and strengthen the franchise, and it's one which has been particularly successful. So I wouldn't characterize this as a sort of a flurry of activity around &#x2013; sort of a concentration of particular bids. It's really more sort of a fundamental structural change in the way in which we do business, and as a result of that we're obviously looking for sustainability in terms of performance of Baroid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a mix improvement as well and more deepwater?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very much so. I think that we've clearly been significantly more successful in deepwater, and that's all about gaining confidence of our customers since deepwater is something they take very, very seriously in terms of service selection. So Baroid's success rate in deepwater clearly is a function of the confidence that they've built with major customers around the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect, thanks. I have another question, more of a high level issues question. Can you talk a little bit about the controversy the sector faces with respect to frac fluids and the sort of the bristling we have on an environmental side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that clearly there's been a great deal of discussion around the sort of the whole legislative process. And not to sort of belabor the point, I think that clearly studies that have taken place through the years have really detected no evidence that fracturing has any impact to sort of drinking water sources, which has been the primary focus of this discussion since its inception 60 years ago or so.</p>
          <p>So we're continuing to investigate opportunities within our technology to minimize exposure. And as an example of that, at the SPE just last week in fact, we introduced something we call a chemical scoring index which provides a benchmark metric on the sort of relative environmental performance of a suite of  &#x2013; our suite of fluids and enables our customers to really make a selection of treatments based on the balance between reservoir performance and environmental performance.</p>
          <p>And so we certainly anticipate this becoming an industry benchmark which we hope it will drive sort of an increased awareness in environmental issues and stewardship and at the same time provide us with an opportunity to continue to advance the science around improving our customers' performance of their wells.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's more of an education issue for customers and many of the politicians?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it gives our &#x2013; will give our customers an opportunity to select the appropriate fluid that gives them the balance between environmental sensitivity and also reservoir performance.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just with regards to Russia, you guys showed a really big sequential increase in that market. One of the industry rig count services in line showed a fairly significant drop-off in September of activity. Is that something you saw in the field, or is Russia just kind of pushing forward ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean we've been very pleased with our performance in Russia. I think when we take a look at Russia overall, clearly 80, 85% of the production today is coming out of western Siberia, which is a very, very mature province. And as Russia looks to sort of try and sort of maintain its leadership position, if you like, in terms of global production, it's going to force a great deal of incremental activity into Eastern Siberia and other locations, all of which are significantly more service intensive locations for companies like Halliburton.</p>
          <p>So all in all, we're very positive on the outlook. But of course as Dave pointed out in his commentary, there are some sort of financial overtones which still have to be resolved in order to perhaps allow Russia to achieve its full potential. We don't think that the sort of &#x2013; the month to month data collection is probably a little bit iffy. We don't really sort of &#x2013; we certainly didn't see any significant change which would alter the picture which we outlined on the call here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, that's very helpful. And then unrelated follow-up question, just regarding some of the contracts that were negotiated earlier this year internationally, I believe had some oil prices escalation clauses in them. Presumably those oil prices is at a point where those escalators could potentially kick in. Could you just comment on how Halliburton is treating those, and if you're trying to push for higher pricing or increased scope on those contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, those escalators basically included in a number of cases oil price triggers for a period of time, and so it's necessary for those oil prices to be sustained above a certain level for a period of time. Clearly that gives us the right to have a discussion with our customers, and we're certainly having discussions with a number of our customers. But we're also in a very competitive environment, Jeff, so we're reserving that right. The timing of improvement in pricing relative to those triggers is yet to be seen.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. First of all, back on the fluids situation again. Would you say that you are -- clearly gaining market share given the announcements in your press release, but are you gaining market share by replacing incumbent operators or are you gaining market share by winning new rigs coming into the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer to that is really both. And the deepwater experience has been a function of both, and that's obviously one which everyone pays a great deal of attention to. So I guess the short answer is both a combination of new rigs and also replacing incumbents.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A little bit more specific there, Tim? Is it predominantly &#x2013; I mean Brazil is clearly a replacement but on the other rigs, are they new rigs? Is it evenly balanced or is it predominantly one of them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can't really sort of give you a detailed breakdown of that. But it's, Ole, it's a combination of both of those elements. I think to sort of elaborate a little bit further, certainly the data would suggest that we have indeed been gaining market share there, and we're obviously very proud of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Congratulations. On the market outlook, Tim, you gave a fairly robust outlook while referencing previous cycles. I don't think we've ever had a cycle where we had $77 oil at the trough. But you seemed pretty optimistic when you said that a vigorous international recovery, yet Mark, I mean you keep on talking about your three to 500 basis points negative margins. So there seems to be a little bit of a dichotomy between the way the two of you are describing the outlooks. Could you clarify if you differ at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ole, this is Dave. I think it's important to understand that we have a pretty robust view of the international markets. We've seen the contracts that have been tendered, so we know that there is a good revenue stream that is going to come off of those contracts. But they're not going to be at the margins we saw at the peak in the last cycle because of the longer term nature of the international contracting market. And therefore, you could see the revenues kick up. But they're not going to bring with that initially the incremental margins that we would have seen two, three, four quarters ago. Because it will take us time, as I said, to make sure our costs are in line, our supply chain is in line, and then we can bring appropriate new technology into those contracts and up-sell from that opportunity.</p>
          <p>So I really wouldn't think of it as sort of a dichotomy in the view. Clearly we see a kick-up on the revenue side. But the margin side, I think, is going to lag, and that's what we're trying to sensitize our investor base to is that we're not going to have the kinds of incrementals you saw 12 or 18 months ago. It's going to take some time to work our way back to those incrementals, but as activity does increase, then the margins will start to come up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very clear. I'm with you now. So we'll let it go with strong revenue growth and margins follow later. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I wanted to ask you about the market share gains in North America that you referenced. And I know you've had an initiative to try and bundle or package your products. A typical package might be bits, motors and mud. I wonder if that is having some success, or can you give us an update on that strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Robin, I think it is having a success. What we'd like to do is package bits, motors, mud, frac and completions. But as Tim has said and I have said, we've been very successful at doing the bits, mud and motor piece, but because of the really pretty amazing number of wells that are being drilled but not completed right now, you aren't able to sort of bring the full suite of services to bear. But there clearly has been a push on our part to do that, and in my view, we've been very successful at it. And when we get back to a more normal routine of basically being able to do what is essentially a turnkey well from the drilling all the way through the completion, I think that strategy will pay even more, but it certainly is paying even in this marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just following up on your comments about the pressure pumping equipment supply relative to demand. And I think you've cited that in -- wear and tear on pumping units has increased, and it's I think we've seen examples in Haynesville wells, which are notoriously pump eaters. And I think you've experienced that as well as others. Where is the &#x2013; predominantly, where is the excess use and wear and tear coming from that is leading to perhaps a greater rate of decline in the pressure pumping unit supply?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Generally, Robin, I would say that the combination of sort of high pressure, high temperatures and long, long stages are really driving the sort of wear and tear equation. And as we outlined before, and I think as many others have outlined in the industry, we're certainly not alone in that fact, that this is a source of potential using up of equipment, if you like, and restricting the amount of capacity that's ultimately going to be available.</p>
          <p>And it really benefits those and certainly rewards awards those that have strong maintenance programs and those that are continuing to invest in making sure that their technology is up to date to service these wells. And in some respects it's not a lot different with drilling equipment either. So I think it's just a general source of the sort of tougher more complex wells which require more service intensity than we have historically seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we were seeing this particularly in the Haynesville. That's an area where this situation is most acute. And as we see our customers they might go and use equipment that is under power for it, and they'll walk away from it because of poor service quality and the inability to meet their requirements on getting those jobs done.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. I wanted to talk about the margin dynamic you talked a little bit about in the U.S., and how some of the higher end shale plays were potentially coming under pressure there. Presumably that's because you're coming from a higher level there. The rest of the U.S. has been pretty depressed for a while, and I believe margins have held up a little better in that space, and now you're seeing competition coming. Is that reasonable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think it's two things. One is that the &#x2013; as we've successfully executed sort of our market share strategy, a lot of our competitors, especially the smaller competitors have really concentrated their efforts in the two big shale plays that are robust today, the Haynesville and the Marcellus. So I think if you look at where there is the most overcapacity in the industry in pressure pumping today, it clearly is in those two basins.</p>
          <p>And then you couple that with the very difficult frac conditions that Tim just talked about. So you are having to bid fairly cheap to get work, but then the work you are doing is very tough and consumes a lot of profit, it comes a lot of pumping time, you have to take a lot of equipment to location so therefore you don't get the efficiency that we typically would have in some of the more established basins around the U.S.</p>
          <p>It's pretty clear that as time went on in the other basins in the U.S., we have figured out a way to sort of most efficiently frac wells. The level of activity to date in the Haynesville hasn't allowed us to be able to get that model precisely where we want it. We certainly are making progress in that area. But I think if you couple a relatively inefficient way of fracking right now with the way overcapacity of competitors that are in those markets it really makes for a very, very fierce competitive situation, and we're well suited to fight in a marketplace like that and we very much are.</p>

          <p>Good, and I think you basically just answered this, but going forward as you are able to drive those efficiencies as you have in the past, as the competitors presumably aren't able to perform as well as you think you are or will be, that's still going to be a very good market for you, rather than a good market for your customers?</p>

          <p>Oh yeah. No, I think that it will be a good market for both of us.</p>
