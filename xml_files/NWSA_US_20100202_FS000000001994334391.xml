          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to News Corp.'s Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Also, as a reminder, this teleconference is being recorded. And at this time, I will turn the conference call over to your host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for News Corp., Reed Nolte.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our Second Quarter Fiscal 2010 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chase Carey; President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dave DeVoe, our CFO. Dave will give a detailed presentation of the quarter results followed by Rupert, who will give his own perspective and color on the quarter. We'll then take your questions, first from the financial community, and then from the press.</p>
          <p>This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp.'s businesses and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The corporation's 10-Q for the three months ending December 31st, 2009, identifies risks and uncertainties cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings. Additionally, in this quarter, you may have noticed that we have changed the presentation format of the consolidated income statement to no longer display an operating income caption. Instead, we provide the measurement of total segment operating income in the earnings release and notes to our financial statements. As contrasted to our prior reporting of operating income, the only difference is that total segment operating income excludes impairment and restructuring charges. Prior periods have been revised to conform to this new presentation. Total segment operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure. The definition of and reconciliation of total segment operating income to income before taxes is provided in both the earnings release and our 10-Q filing. In addition, we may refer to other non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website.</p>
          <p>If you have any questions on the presentation, you can contact me after the call. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Reed, thank you very much, and good afternoon, everybody. At the outset of the call, I'd like to note that our reported results this quarter reflect a one-time charge related to the previously announced settlement of litigation involving the company's Integrated Marketing Services segment. The related $500 million pre-tax settlement charge is reflected in this quarter's segment operating income, and it had a $315 million, or 12 cents per share net income effect. After adjusting for this item, we were extremely pleased with the underlying strong financial results we reported for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, where total segment operating income reached $1.2 billion. This is an improvement of 44% from a year-ago, and this improvement rises to 50%, factoring in the absence of the results from NDS, which are no longer consolidated this year. This increase was fuelled by a 10% overall revenue growth, and was further supported by the cost reduction efforts we initiated over the past several years. Our reported net income in the quarter was $254 million with earnings per share of 10 cents. This compares to a reported loss of 6.4 billion, or $2.45 per share last year. However, excluding the net income effects in both years of one-time items, such as the litigation charge this year and the impairment charge we took last year, second quarter earnings per share this year were 25 cents, as compared to the year-ago results of 15 cents.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to provide some context on some of the results in our segments. And let's start with the Filmed segment, where second quarter operating income was $324 million. This is up $212 million over last year's result, with revenue growth of 28%. This strong performance was led by the worldwide home entertainment release of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, and also reflected other home entertainment releases, including Wolverine and Night at the Museum. The December quarter also included significant launch costs for our very successful theatrical releases of Avatar and Alvin and the Chipmunks. The profits from these films will begin to flow in the next quarter, which is our third quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $29 million improved by 31 million, as compared to the second quarter a year ago, and this is driven by a 19% higher television station contribution and improved results at MyNetworkTV. And after six consecutive quarters of year-over-year declines, station revenues were up 6% in the current quarter, and this reflects improved local advertising trends, particularly in the telecommunications, retail, fast food, and finance sectors, as well as improved sports advertising from considerably higher ratings in the Major League Baseball's fall season on FOX. The growth was achieved despite a significant reduction in political advertising revenues versus last year, and I think it's worth noting that we saw significant improvements at the stations as the quarter progressed. For example, we began with October being down 14% versus a year ago, and ended up in December being up 28%, and these positive trends, which Rupert will probably talk more about, have continued into the current quarter.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the Cable Network segment, where we continue to show very strong growth, with record, now record segment operating income contributions of $604 million. And this is up 35% from last year on revenue growth of 18%. The revenue growth was led by a 21% increase in affiliate revenue and high single-digit growth in advertising. The largest year-over-year gains in the quarter were from the FOX News Channel. This was due to higher affiliate rates and additional subscribers, and a relatively flat cost base. The international channels, from affiliate revenue increases and ad gains, and the advertising was particularly strong in Europe and in Latin America. The Regional Sports Networks, which reflect higher advertising rates, and essentially flat advertising revenues, and at STAR, which has been included in this segment since last quarter, we had significant growth in advertising revenues in India. This was led by the rating strength of our regional channels.</p>
          <p>Turning to our pay television business, SKY Italia, it generated a segment operating loss of $30 million, as compared to income of 10 million in the second quarter a year ago. SKY Italia continues to operate in an extremely challenging business and economic environment, and subscriber growth is clearly below our expectations. However, it is important to note that this is a very profitable business, and we remain confident in the longer term growth in this under-penetrated market. In the quarter, SKY Italia saw revenues decline by 2% in local currency terms, as compared to the prior year's quarter. Monthly ARPU in the quarter averaged around 43 euros, as compared to last year's 45, and this reflects the lower average tier mix, reduced pay per view revenue, and the lag effects of various price promotions. Overall costs in the quarter were flat, as higher soccer costs were offset by savings in other programming. SKY Italia's subscriber base declined by 63,000, compared with the previous quarter-end as total quarterly gross additions of 150,000 were more than offset by churn. This puts our ending subscriber levels at approximately 4.75 million. At quarter-end, over 2.1 million subscribers representing approximately 47% of the subscriber base were taking at least one premium service, compared with approximately 22% of the subscriber base a year ago. The importance of this is that the premium service subscribers' churn rate are about one-fifth of the non-premium service subscribers.</p>
          <p>And shifting to our Newspapers and Information Services segment, our operating income in this year's quarter was $259 million, and this is up 30% from what we reported a year-ago. This improvement is largely driven by higher advertising at The Wall Street Journal, and lower operating expenses throughout all of our newspaper businesses. Our newspaper results also benefited from a favorable foreign exchange impact on revenues and segment operating income that was primarily from the relative strength of the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. And like at our TV stations, comparative advertising revenues at our newspapers improved as the quarter progressed.</p>
          <p>At our Book Publishing segment, operating income contributions of $65 million in the quarter increased by 42 million, primarily due to higher revenues in our general book and children's books divisions, as well as reduced operating expenses resulting from last year's restructuring efforts.</p>
          <p>And at our Other segment, we reported a second quarter operating loss of $125 million, compared to a loss of $38 million a year ago. Approximately 40% of this change reflects the absence of NDS operating profit this year, due to the partial sale of NDS in early February 2009. And NDS is now accounted for as an equity company. Additionally, the Digital Media Group's earnings declined from last year due to lower advertising and search revenues at MySpace. This is offset in part by cost reductions from our restructuring efforts.</p>
          <p>Before I address our guidance, I just want to make a couple comments related to our balance sheet. We reported a cash balance at quarter-end of nearly $7.3 billion. A portion of this balance will be used to reduce debt in the current quarter, as we have a $150 million senior note maturity which comes due in March. And today, we committed to satisfy in cash the put if exercised by holders on the $1.7 billion of debt that is convertible to shares that we owe to BSkyB. Investors have until March the 10 to notify the company of their decision. And also, today we announced a 25% increase in the company's dividend from 6 cents a share, to 7.5 cents a share.</p>
          <p>And finally, before I turn the call over to Rupert, I'd like to address our guidance for fiscal 2010. And as a reminder as we did at year-end and our first quarter this year, we measure this guidance excluding from fiscal 2009 segment operating income results of $121 million in operating profit from NDS, which is no longer consolidated in our results. So, as we look at measuring growth in fiscal 2010, we are comparing it to a base of 3.44 billion as segment operating profit for fiscal 2009.</p>
          <p>In early November, we gave guidance in anticipating our segment operating income growth rate for fiscal 2010 to be at the high single-digit to low double-digit range, above the 3.44 billion fiscal 2009 adjusted results. Since that time, we have performed better than anticipated in several of our businesses. The box office records being set by Avatar have raised our outlook for the Filmed Entertainment segment. The U.S. television environment's performing better than we had assumed, as are our newspapers. And the impact of recent negotiations with cable operators can now be considered. Partially offsetting these improvements, operating conditions in Italy tended to be more difficult than earlier anticipated, and it is taking longer than we expected to achieve our revenue goals at some of our Digital Media business groups, including MySpace.</p>
          <p>As a result, and taking all these items into account, and excluding the effect of the litigation settlement and the restructuring related charges, we're increasing our segment operating income growth guidance to a growth rate in the low 20% range above the fiscal 2009 adjusted result.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Rupert for some additional comments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dave. And good afternoon, everyone. As Dave has just described, our true operating results for this past quarter were extraordinary. We have enjoyed the most &#x2013; we have endured the most severe recession since the Great Depression, but have emerged from this turbulence and turmoil, I think, as the world's preeminent content company. A crisis recasts companies and economies, a crisis highlights weaknesses and expedites pre-existing trends. From a crisis comes clarity, and the strength of our company and our strategy is clear for all to see.</p>
          <p>Excuse the immodesty, but News Corporation's preeminence as a content creator comes as the debate over the primacy of content is over. Content is not just king; it is the emperor of all things electronic. We're on the cusp of a digital dynasty in which our company and our shareholders will profit greatly. Devices and platforms are proliferating, but this clever technology is merely an empty vessel without any great content. Machines are not powered by batteries, but by creativity and ingenuity, by content that is original, accessible, and trusted. Those characteristics define the nature of our company and are the pillars on which we are building a profitable future. It's worth taking a moment to put the company's content into context.</p>
          <p>We have the world's leading film studio, which has just made the most successful film in cinematic history. We are thrilled at the confidence we placed in Avatar and its talented team, led by James Cameron, has been recognized by appreciative audiences around the world, and is still being recognized. And just this morning, it was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Beyond its stunning financial success, I'm convinced Avatar will be a harbinger of fundamental change in the industry, and herald an exciting new era of 3D entertainment. It's worth recalling, as Dave explained, in the most recent quarter, we booked much of the film's costs, and only a small portion of the receipts. In the current quarter and beyond, Avatar will provide a strong stream of revenue for our company.</p>
          <p>The studio's other hits included Ice Age 3, and Alvin and the Chipmunks, both of which helped us surpass $4 billion in worldwide box office this past year, an industry record. Also, we have the No. 1 broadcast network in the United States, FBC, which has been the top-rated network for the past six seasons on the strength of shows like American Idol, which just kicked off its ninth season, and is as dominant as ever. And this past fall was the strongest in the network's history. Our television production studio, long the place of such brand name shows like The Simpsons and 24, is now home to more new hit series than any other studio, with shows like Modern Family, Glee, and The Cleveland Show.</p>
          <p>We have America's No. 1 newspaper in The Wall Street Journal, No. 1 in terms of circulation, influence, and quality. While other prominent papers are still suffering year on year advertising and circulation declines, the opposite is true at The Journal. And WSJ.com remains the digital model for newspapers around the world, with a strong subscription base and still growing advertising revenue.</p>
          <p>In the United Kingdom, we have the No. 1 newspaper in The Sun, which had record weeks of advertising revenues during this past quarter, and has left other papers far, far behind in the contest for readers. In Australia, we have the largest selling daily paper, The Herald-Sun, which grew circulation, while The Australian national daily achieved strong advertising marketing share growth, as well as increasing its position as the most influential paper in the country.</p>
          <p>The FOX News Channel is certainly the No. 1 news channel in the U.S., winning an ever greater share of an audience that is both loyal and lucrative. Roger Ailes has done a remarkable and admirable job at building the world's most influential and profitable news network. Through FOX International Channels, we have launched more cable channels around the globe than any other company, and we are profiting from continuing growth in Asia and rapidly expanding middle class audiences elsewhere in the world. While the west was coping with the crisis, the economic emancipation of much of the developing world continued at an almost unprecedented pace, as our unique success with STAR in India testifies. And HarperCollins is one of the world's leading publishing houses, with much improved profitability.</p>
          <p>There's no doubt that we have been at the forefront of the global debate about the value of content. At times, that debate has been intense. But that was essential when the stakes were so high. It's surprising how many content companies who were passive in the face of predatory behavior and self-serving sophistry, passivity, and meekness are not characteristics of our company. A year ago, our acquisitivism was thought heretical, but somehow, the profane has become profound, and the content plan has gathered around our ideas.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, the value of content is now clear. Instead of the existential debate about value, now we are merely haggling over valuations. Consumers want content to be delivered immediately, and on an array of devices to suit their needs, and they're willing to pay to be entertained and informed. Our mission is clear and coherent. It is to create great content and customize it to suit our expanding audiences around the world.</p>
          <p>In the couple of months I have took &#x2013; in the last couple of months, I have toured the most innovative Asian research laboratories, and walked the floor of the Consumer Electronic Show. The message is the same everywhere: Without content, the ever larger and flatter screens, the tablets, the e-readers, and the increasingly sophisticated mobile phones, would be lifeless. Without content, these ingenious and wonderful devices would be unloved and unsold. And I'm delighted they're certainly not complacent, that our employees' creativity and energy have been paid the ultimate compliment by consumers. They have paid for our content.</p>
          <p>As Dave pointed out, our results almost across the board far outpace those of the same quarter last year. Our revenues have revived and should remain strong. Local and national television advertising markets have been surprisingly strong. The signs are that this trend will continue in coming months, but the truth is that the advertising cycle has shortened, and we all have limited ability to peer into the future.</p>
          <p>The broadcast network business was thought moribund by many, but we fundamentally changed its fortunes, with the ground-breaking retransmission consent deal we made a few weeks ago. The precedent we've established means that the retransmission fees we will be renegotiating with cable and satellite providers as our current deals expire over the next couple of years will breathe new life into that business.</p>
          <p>When it comes to online news, we have committed to changing that model too. We are in advanced discussions with other media companies around the world, all of whom have turned to our company for ideas and innovation. We are currently in the midst of very substantive conversations with device makers on developing a subscription model that will develop high quality journalism to consumers wherever and whenever they want it. We have begun to charge for online content at a couple of our U.S. titles, and we expect to expand to other titles in the coming months. We have the most experience, given our success with various digital offerings of The Wall Street Journal.</p>
          <p>The success in 3D of Avatar and Ice Age 3, and our experience in being the most innovative broadcaster of sports events, puts us in a prime position for the development of the next generation of 3D consumer technology. Asia manufacturers are well advanced in developing the technology that will transform the home viewing experience. Of course, you'll see more 3D films, but more fundamentally, there'll be exponential growth in 3D programming in the next couple of years. Following on this experience, in leading the development of high definition viewing in Britain, BSkyB will be launching a 3D channel in the very near future. Only last night, they made their first 3D broadcast. As well positioned as we are, there remain a few areas of our business that are not performing as well as we would like that continue to be long-term growth drivers. The first is SKY Italia. As David noted, SKY Italia is faced with a tough economic environment and increased competition, but we're certainly enthusiastic about the potential of this business, given the high quality of our service and the low penetration of pay television in Italy.</p>
          <p>The second is our affiliate Sky Deutschland. We have great confidence that the new management team headed by Brian Sullivan, who helped build BSkyB into a powerhouse, will be able to make headway in another big market with very low pay TV penetration. As proof of our confidence in this business, we just increased our stake by 5 percentage points. Despite the challenges in these markets, we remain firm on our commitment to pay TV around the world.</p>
          <p>And there's MySpace, but it's not where we want it. MySpace remains one of the world's top web destinations, and during the past quarter, we started to see signs of traffic stabilization, as its mission was clarified. We believe the stability points to progress the new management team has made in repositioning MySpace as the prime place where people share thoughts and ideas about music, entertainment, and other popular content.</p>
          <p>Finally, after all I've just said about the recent achievements of our company, I think the most important point I can make overall is that these businesses are growing, not just surviving, but thriving. The majority of our business segments reported double-digit revenue growth this past quarter, clearly driving our higher operating profits. It's a widespread improvement that we believe will continue in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>And I have to say that kind of success comes with having great depth of leadership. At News Corporation, we have the best leaders in the media business. Chase Carey is a wonderful partner, and his strategic focus, dynamic ideas, and willingness to take on tough issues have helped to reinvigorate all of us. And with some of the recent executive moves we've made at Dow Jones, our FOX businesses, our international newspapers, and the restructuring of our STAR Asia business, we think we are positioned for an exciting new chapter for News Corporation.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. And now Chase, Dave, and I will be happy to take any of your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll go to our first question in queue, and that comes from Alan Gould with Soleil. And your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I was wondering &#x2013; Chase, a question regarding the retransmission consent, how big a deal is this retransmission consent? One, are there a lot more coming up in the near future, and over the next three to five years, should we be thinking 40 million a month or 100 million a month coming out of retransmission consent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm probably not going to quantify it with specificity at this point. What is clear is it's a transforming event. Look, it really puts the network on a path where it's a profitable business that generates the type of profit that I think it should for the audience and the importance it represents in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>In terms of timing, we've got two of the top 10 distributors done, so we obviously are in early stages, and there really are two fronts to this issue: one is through our O&amp;Os, where we deal directly with distributors, and then the second is through the affiliate body. First, in the arena where we deal directly, it's about a 3 to 4 year process, and in the next two years, about half of the distribution universe is up with us and we'll deal with it.</p>
          <p>In terms of the affiliates, we're engaged now, look &#x2013; with the affiliates, we think, we value the relationship, we think it's important that we reach a fair conclusion. That being said, we think the network is the most valuable and important programming that we provide to consumers. And we've begun those discussions, but those discussions will really probably continue in the months to come, but certainly they will move forward. We're engaged now, and we'll move forward on those. And again, probably with the affiliates, their deals come up with distributors likewise, in probably that same three plus year timeframe.</p>
          <p>So, I think that's the broad construct. I do think obviously we have a lot of work left to do, but I believe this really does set us on course, and point us in a direction that the FOX Network can assume the role it should, it's the most important television channel we have. It is the force that drives our Television business, and it should generate profits that reflect that. And we think we've set it on that course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So this fixes the broadcast business model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, look, I think it puts it &#x2013; it probably sounds overly simplistic to say everything's fixed. I mean you've got to &#x2013; look, we have great management there. We got to run it. We are the No. 1 network. I think it puts us on a course where we can generate the profits we should if we generate &#x2013; if we run a good network. And so, yes, I think, simplistically you can say it fixes it, but it certainly puts it in a competitive place where it has a dual revenue stream like successful cable networks does, and those that it increasingly competes with.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I have a question and also, a follow-up to the last one. I was hoping you could help us on Avatar in terms of just the timing of the impact of when do you think you'll have the home video release? And can you discuss any plans for sequels, and how the economics may change?</p>
          <p>And then on TV, just to follow up on Alan's question. Chase, I was hoping you could comment, one on, first of all, just the current advertising outlook as we move into the second half of fiscal '10, and would you expect between re-trans and reverse comp that you will get back to prior levels of the TV business of more than $1 billion in OI?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'll just go on Avatar first. We put in &#x2013; some of the costs of course were taken in the last quarter. Avatar, we think about 60% of the profits, perhaps better, will be in the following six months. I think over the next two quarters, which means that we certainly plan to release the DVD as soon as possible. But it is continuing for a great period, it seems, in the cinemas.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the ad market, it really does continue. On the positive, it continues to be really a good &#x2013; a very solid, strong ad market. The network is still doing sort of scatter business at the 15% sort of mid-teens above the upfront. The cable channels, really, solid double-digits in news. The entertainment business on the cable side, probably neighborhood of 20% above upfront. The sports, which has probably been the one that has probably had the toughest row to hoe, given dependency on some categories like autos is actually stronger than it's been.</p>
          <p>So, the ad market has really been a solid market, and the station business, I think Dave said &#x2013; the station business, again, we've got a quarter that looks like it'll be sort of mid to high teens year on year. So, I mean, you still have an environment, I'd say that &#x2013; you don't have the visibility historically you had, and people talk about the economy, and how much &#x2013; and how reliable are some of the positive things you're seeing, but certainly with those qualifications, certainly what we're experiencing and dealing with in the marketplace all continues to be positive from an advertising perspective, really, across stations, network, cable.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. I've got a question on SKY Italia. It looks like this year you could see margins maybe back to the '07 level, and I assume you think you can increase subs by at least a couple million over time. So, I'm wondering, what should we look at as maybe a leading indicator for improvement in the business? Is it less promotion, the economy, political, something else? And are we at a point now where the soccer and programming costs are largely fixed, so we can see a start of the margin ramp going forward, when you see the sub gains? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think as we look at SKY Italia, I think if I look the next calendar year roughly, probably it's not a period where we're focused on sub growth, so I think it probably is a more stable sub environment. You've still got a tough economy, so we're coming through these things. We sort of are really getting to the end of digesting the price increase, the VAT increase that occurred close to a year ago, so it helps us as we absorb that.</p>
          <p>I think we had to adjust to some of the issues in terms of selling our product, the loss of advertising space on the media sat channels, and again, I think we're making adjustments. The court has given us a right to do it. But I think we're again sort of appropriately getting on top of that. And given that environment, our focus in the short-term will, again, be stabilizing that and appropriately managing the business in a tough environment.</p>
          <p>I think as  you look through toward the end of the year and going forward, we do really still think we have a lot of sub growth in front of us. The market still has only 30% pay penetration. I think we've got a great product. I think we are &#x2013; got a great brand, great franchise in the marketplace. And really, should be able to build on that position as we go forward.</p>
          <p>A soccer deal is &#x2013; we have a deal done for three years, so we have CPI type increases in the next three years, so we have a fairly predictable &#x2013; we have a pretty predictable situation in terms of those costs. And I think our focus in the short term, again, will probably be on stabilizing the business, dealing with some of the issues we've had, like churn. I mean, churn has been a challenge in this year, again, some of it was the price increase, the market itself, but I think we feel we're taking the steps to get on top of it, so I guess look for something in the short term. I think something like churn would be the type of measure we'd be focused on, improving efficiencies and really stabilizing that business in a tough environment, setting it up to grow, which it should.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. So, for Rupert and Chase, I wanted to ask about growth prospects for Cable Networks. Profits have increased over four-fold from 2004 to now, at least to what looks like a 2 billion 2 plus of EBIT this year. The last year or two had a good chunk that was driven by FOX News renewals, so I was hoping you could help us understand how much growth is left at Cable Networks? Can you break down the drivers of growth from here and also indicate how much longer can Cable Nets maintain double-digit profit growth? That'd be helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly in SKY News, we've had most of the effect of the big increase in the price we're charging for it, but we have another year to go before everybody clicks in. It probably will not be as big an increase as this year there, but it's a very solid one. It's certainly a big double figure. And if you look at the overall, we think we have great potential for growth in our existing channels, both as profits and in distribution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we've got quite a long way to go yet. We only need to look at the profits of the long established channels like USA. We've got plenty of room for growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and I'd second that. I think if you look at it sort of in two levels, I think it's interesting, the U.S., I think you're going to head to a period where it's quality over quantity. I think we've said that before. I think if you've got really strong channels, you should be able to drive them. I think they're more popular than ever, I think continuing to take share, and you look at our big driving channels.</p>
          <p>And as Rupert said, FX is nowhere near what USA generates, Nat Geo, nowhere near what something like Discovery generates. FOX News &#x2013; look, realistically, FOX News just continues to get stronger and stronger. I don't know that there's a channel that is more important or powerful in the television universe in the U.S. So I think that channel has great upside to it. So, I think those powerful channels which are going to drive it have a lot of room left to grow, and we're certainly bullish about.</p>
          <p>And the other &#x2013; the international marketplace, which is the other front, really at its core is going to &#x2013; it's going to get driven as the international pay TV business really follows the U.S. business in terms of growth and penetration, first and foremost. We're a leader in most of the places we deal &#x2013; we do business, so we're in a great position to take advantage of those markets as they grow in terms of size and penetration and the like. So, we think that business has, internationally has enormous growth ahead of it as the market grows, and we take advantage of the position we have in those competitive markets.</p>
          <p>So, I think it's a business that has a lot of room to grow. Look, I know everybody asks where does the money come from? Realistically, we want good relationships with distributors, but you have distributors that are making a lot of money, with big, healthy profit margins. So, I guess we'll &#x2013; those will be the negotiations that we have in the marketplace of how to get the fair share, get our fair share for the quality of the content we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But there's &#x2013; basically throughout the world outside of America, which is pretty fully developed, you've got about a 20% growth in pay television wherever you look, wherever it's available in the world. And where we're on those platforms, we get that 20% growth. We expect to put other channels on to be able, to charge more to improve them. We've got a very big future ahead of us there I think we've really only just started.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes, but it won't be 3D. At this stage, the science is not developed into 3D DVDs. Isn't that correct, Chase?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

One of the opportunities we have as it evolves is the 3D Avatar down the road, but I don't &#x2013; it's not in this window. But the one thing I will say, in the film, if you look at year to year, we actually had a pretty good second half last year, and so what's driving the year to year comparison, when you get to the second half, we had a pretty good film year in the second half, so I wouldn't say it's film that's driving the second half.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just wanted to follow up on this whole re-trans issue. Chase, I think you said at an analyst conference or at an investor conference several months ago that if ESPN gets $5 a month, basically, why shouldn't FOX be getting $5 a month? And I guess you've had incredible success with Idol in what -- season 8 or season 9, and you've obviously gotten re-trans. The cable operators seem increasingly willing to play ball on re-trans in bigger and bigger ways, and I'm just wondering, what are the issues? Is it regulatory? Like what stops you from literally setting a hard level of something like 4 or $5 a month per sub for the FOX Network? How do you drive this far faster even than you are now, or why aren't you even just pushing it with like an extra zero in front of it? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I guess, I'd say in some ways, Rome wasn't built in a day, but look, we have important relationships with distributors. I think we want to &#x2013; we want to get fair value for our content, but I think we, in all honesty, try to approach this constructively. We've built businesses with them, we've built valuable cable channels. We feel we have enormous value in the FOX Network. We felt the right thing to do was to try to take a big step forward to get the value of that FOX content recognized. Could you argue it's worth significantly more? Sure. I mean, you could.</p>
          <p>But there are a lot of issues involved, certainly you did hear noise from an array of fronts. And I think you try to take all those factors in terms of the relationship you have with them on &#x2013; in other businesses, the broader marketplace, and try and figure out how do you get this to -- moving &#x2013; get to this to a place that at least gets us started in terms of recognizing the fair value for the FOX Network.</p>
          <p>And it doesn't have a &#x2013; I think what we've tried not to do is have a &#x2013; while it's a difficult negotiation, a negotiation that was ultimately really destructive to a point that fractured a lot of things in a way that wasn't sort of respecting how do we build &#x2013; how do we continue to build the business with the distributors as we have over the last X years?</p>

I mean, maybe 10% of their operating profits. We still have two or three years to pass through.</p>

          <p>Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions. Can you please talk about your view on the value of film libraries in current conditions? There are two reportedly for sale, MGM and Miramax. Are these still attractive and complementary assets for a major studio like News Corp.? And secondly, Cable Networks, which is roughly half of your operating profit, the margins were 34% in this quarter, operating profit. How should we think about long-term operating profit margins for this business? Thank you.</p>

          <p>In terms of film libraries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There were two questions there, film libraries. Whatever you like, it's just a matter of opinion what they're worth. The big one, MGM, is for the most part very old. There are some good films in it. At the right price, we'd be interested, but it appears that other people there are more interested. So, I think you can count us out of that one altogether. And we don't know how that'll end up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess what I -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, I can rule out Miramax right away.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think in terms of film libraries, again, I think it's certainly a value. You do have to look at a DVD market that is not &#x2013; that is in decline, not growth, which was a significant part of it. The flip side is television market, particularly overseas, is pretty healthy, but I guess the second issue on film libraries, realistically, do you need that current product that clearly reinvigorates it. If you just have a &#x2013; say, a library that sits there and gets stale over time, it's probably a depreciating asset, so I think it's important in a film library to have that current product flowing in that continues to give it a currency and livelihood &#x2013; liveliness to it.</p>
          <p>Yeah, I think in terms of long-term cable, long-term cable margins, I think we continue to believe in the business we've got, we continue to drive. And in some ways &#x2013; but they're businesses frankly as you'd find, you take global franchises that probably have opportunities. I mean, as we &#x2013; National Geographic, National Geographic Wild, the type of content that really travels around the world, I think, gives us an opportunity to really create value very cost-efficiently and the like.</p>
          <p>So, I think we feel good about where the cable business is and opportunities to continue to drive those margins forward.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and good afternoon. My first question is just on the guidance. I believe you guys grew EBIT about 26% in the first half, so, the guidance would seem to imply a little bit of a deceleration in the second half, despite the ad market getting better, comps getting easier, plus Avatar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I didn't know when you doubled your guidance, it was a deceleration, but yeah, essentially as Chase mentioned before, we've got &#x2013; we had a great first half in the film company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, maybe just a second question for Rupert, just on the -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to have a great quarter. This quarter we had , but we honestly do not have any visibility about the last quarter. And certainly, you'll be paying the usual business of charging up a lot for new films for the next financial year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, the thing is &#x2013; in film was actually, we had a very &#x2013; last year, we had a very weak first half, and we had a stronger second half, so we have &#x2013; comparative to last year, we've got a big benefit in the first half on a comparison from a weak film business last &#x2013; first six months of '09, fiscal '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And maybe just one quick question for Rupert. Just on the books business, obviously, there's been a bit of controversy over how Apple may price e-books versus Amazon. So I was wondering if you could just share with us your perspective on retail or wholesale pricing for books in a digital delivery mode. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we don't like Amazon model of selling everything at 9.99. They don't pay us that. They pay us the full wholesale price of $14 or whatever we charge. But we think it really devalues books, and hurts all the retailers of the hardcover books. We're not against electronic books. On the contrary, we like them very much indeed. It's low cost to us, and so on, but we wanted some &#x2013; you know, some room to maneuver in it, and Amazon &#x2013; sorry, Apple in its agreement with us, which has not been disclosed in detail, does allow for a variety of slightly higher prices. They'll be prices very much less than the printed companies of books, but still will not be fixed in the way that Amazon has been doing it. And it appears that Amazon is now ready to sit down with us again, and renegotiate pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Before turning to the press inquiries, which I think &#x2013; do next, I'd like to leave investors with a few closing comments. We obviously feel good about our second quarter results and the momentum in our business for the rest of the year with our fiscal 2010 guidance doubling from a quarter ago. But these results do not really reflect the degree to which our businesses are truly positioned to grow over the next few years.</p>
          <p>In broadcasting, as we've touched on, we're now on track to build a dual revenue stream business that enables FOX to achieve a value that equals its strength and its importance to viewers. Our leadership and content creation in both film and television, as Rupert said, continues to build, as many of our competitors struggle, and new technologies like 3D and mobile platforms open up new avenues of revenue growth. At the same time, these new platforms and devices open up new avenues for our news, sports and print content.</p>
          <p>Our cable channels have great momentum, both in the U.S. and overseas. In the U.S., we believe quality brands and content will be the real winners, and channels like FOX News and Nat Geo ideally position us. Internationally, we've built a position of true leadership that we'll take advantage of as subscription TV catches up with the U.S. around the world. These businesses, as well as our other unique franchises, provide News Corporation a great opportunity to drive our profits and cash flow to a whole new level as we grow beyond this year.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and with that, I guess we'll turn it to the press.</p>

          <p>Hi. Repeating the late night question, if you do go into talks with Conan O'Brien, how are relationships with affiliates? And how would you make that work? And would you potentially run into similar problems that NBC had with affiliates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, certainly very different ones. NBC's problem was that their move from 10 to 11 reduced the lead-in to all their news services, which reduced their news service ratings, which in turn, led into &#x2013; gave Conan a much worse lead-in than Leno had been getting. We don't have that problem. On the other hand, all our affiliates tend to run syndicated programming from 11 to 11:30, most of them profitably. And it will take time to adjust.</p>
          <p>I mean, if we were to decide to go ahead and do it, and do it at 11:00 rather than 11:30 immediately, I'm sure we'd have some difficult negotiations. But I'm speculating. We'll have to wait and see.</p>
