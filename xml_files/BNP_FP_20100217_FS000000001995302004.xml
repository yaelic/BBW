          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon, and we're going to present today BNP Paribas Results &#x2013; Full Year Results 2009. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I will now ask Baudouin Prot, CEO of BNP Paribas to present the results. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I think in a nutshell, the key messages for December result is the first quarter concerned the powerful capacity to generate profits with &#x20AC;5.8 billion Group net income. The ROE is 10.8% for the full year. We have considerably strengthened equity and therefore the solvency position of our Group. We have finalized the Fortis acquisition and also the industrial plant and we have now got our first significant contribution, and we have earnings to continue to participate in a dynamic rate in financing the economy especially in the domestic markets in Europe.</p>
          <p>Overall, the &#x2013; first of all, the revenues we crossed the 40 billion numbers in terms of revenues, which is when compared to 2007 of 31 billion is quite a change. Operating expenses were I think well under control, we see that therefore the gross operating income reached, well, close to &#x20AC;17 billion. And I think a very important figure and that amount enabled us to wave that compensate for over two-third of the increased cost of risk between 2007 and 2009, which is as you've seen &#x2013; as you see here went from 9.7 billion in 2007 to 5.7 billion in 2008 and 8.4 billion in 2009. After that our operating income was 8.4 &#x2013; &#x20AC;8.5 billion for last year, which is 2 billion lower than in 2007, but more than doubled for 2008.</p>
          <p>And pre-tax income was exactly &#x20AC;9 billion and the net income attributable to equity holders was &#x20AC;5.8 billion, which I already mentioned and the 10.8% return on equity. So, a very strong rebound in profit generation even if, especially in ROE terms that is far from pre-crisis level.</p>
          <p>In terms of revenues, I think it's interesting to see that over the last two years, retail revenues increased from &#x20AC;16.4 billion to &#x20AC;18.3 billion with well regular increase over the last two years even before the crisis. Investment Solutions, well, held up very well during the crisis, especially between 2008 and 2009 and we'll see latter on that the net asset new collection was very strong last year.</p>
          <p>CIB, we have significant market share gains and a very balanced customer driven activity for a platform getting to over &#x20AC;12 billion of revenues for last year. As for Fortis, almost 7.5 months, the contribution was a bit over &#x20AC;5 billion. So, revenues have been up sharply during the period of the crisis at BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost, the retail banking costs were really under tight control because they increased basically from very, very slight increase of &#x20AC;60 million compared to 10.8 &#x2013; 60 million, yes, compared to 10.8 billion, so a very small increase. Investment Solutions got cost control well implemented so that the costs were a bit lower in 2009 from the full year than they were for 2008. And regarding CIB, you see the cost increase very much, very limited compared in relation to the revenue increase. So, I think we had overall good cost control in all businesses at BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost of risk, certainly for the full year, we had a rise in cost of risk of 2.6 billion. Cost of risk was 2.6 billion higher in 2009 than it was in 2008. The first quarter &#x2013; on the contrary the first quarter had a marked decline of &#x20AC;500 million, 17% compared to the third quarter of 2009. I think that we've seen this peak of the cost of risk in the third quarter and the decline started at Group level for the first quarter, 124 basis points all together in relation to risk weighted assets compared to 141 in the third quarter and 144 in the second quarter. Of that the contribution of capital markets and the Investment Solutions so it really kept the markets contribution was very limited, only seven basis points. Which is a clear sign that the financial crisis impact on our cost of risk is now disappearing. And even the contribution from the credit portfolio leveled up from 123 basis points in the third quarter down to 116 basis point in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>For the Group, in CIB financing businesses, cost of risk was &#x20AC;190 million for the first quarter, down &#x20AC;114 million so from &#x20AC;200 million to &#x20AC;190 million from third to fourth quarter, quite a significant decline. We're seeing a limited number of new doubtful loans and new difficult size entering in the last quarter. So, I think we have somehow a positive view on what should be the cost of risk for our financing businesses in terms of strength entering into 2010.</p>
          <p>French Retail a moderate increase 48 basis points, still a low number in absolute terms, about 20 basis point better than our competitor in the French market. The cost of risk is &#x20AC;122 million was up &#x20AC;12 million to the third quarter. So, only a moderate increase and I think that should continue to see a moderate increase into 2010, but keeping it at a low level in terms of basis points to risk weighted assets.</p>
          <p>Cost of risk at BNL banca commerciale in Italy, 137 basis point for the first quarter against 113 basis point for the first quarter against 113 for the third quarter. Cost of risk of &#x20AC;205 million, up 32 million compared to the third quarter see a rise in all customer segments. And we foresee a continuing rise in 2010 and also it will be at a lower &#x2013; at a slower pace than in 2009.</p>
          <p>BancWest, cost of risk of &#x20AC;275 million, down &#x20AC;67 million compared to the third quarter, which was the peak and the rise &#x2013; the decline is mostly due to much lower provisions on investment portfolio and we can see a continued &#x2013; that the rise continues in provisions for loans to individual customers. We still believe that the peak was reached in 2009 and we'll see later on that we believe that the cost of risk at BancWest should be lower for 2010.</p>
          <p>Emerging Markets Retail Banking, cost of risk there was flat &#x20AC;212 million, down 7 million to the third quarter, of which Ukraine 108 million. We see delinquencies stabilizing in Ukraine and the increase in coverage ratio. So, there also we believe that we've had reached some how, a peak in the cost of risk for Emerging Markets Retail Banking.</p>
          <p>Personal Finance, the cost of risk at 519 million is similar to the third quarter at constant scope because we have had the consolidation with Findomestic, which explains all of the 18 million &#x2013;  &#x20AC;20 million increase, which compared to &#x20AC;500 million it wasn't any way &#x2013; not very significant. So, we will consider that the cost of risk at personal finance is stabilizing since the third quarter at around 340 basis point and this is what we foresee for next year, stabilizing cost of risk for Personal Finance.</p>
          <p>We've been very active last year financing the French economy with loan growth of 3.7% in line with our commitment. The lending to household, was 4.1% and to businesses 2.5%. This is in very sharp contrast to what happened in the other euro zone countries. We will continue to commit different actions and having dedicated envelopes for medium and long-term needs of very small businesses and for SME's financing also.</p>
          <p>For the family fourth quarter results, revenues were &#x20AC;10 billion, well, just over &#x20AC;10 billion, down 5.7% to the third quarter. I think this is for the fourth quarter with a similar effect especially on CIB, I think it is still fairly strong numbers in terms of revenues. Operating expenses were up 1.7% but mostly explained when we get into the CIB numbers by what happened with the way we have been accounting all of the deferred valuable remuneration in this fourth quarter for the full year. And gross operating income is close to &#x20AC;4 billion. Cost of risk as I said is down 17.5% so we end up with net income attributable to equity holders &#x20AC;1.365 billion at 4.6% compared to the third quarter. So, overall, powerful earnings generation capacity confirmed.</p>
          <p>I will now pass on to Jean-Laurent for the retail operations.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So, good afternoon. So for FRB, the French Retail Banking, 2009 demonstrated a good sales and marketing drive within French Retail Banking with 145,000 net accounts opened, loans up 4.3%, deposits up 3.1% and gross asset inflows in life insurance up 12.4%.</p>
          <p>Revenues grew by 4.4% compared to the first quarter of 2008 driven by net interest income up 4% due to positive deposit mix trend and fees up 5% compared to weak base in the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating expenses grew by 3.3% and as a result, the gross operating income grew by 7.2% this quarter. And despite the rise in the cost of risk, pre-tax income remained stable at &#x20AC;316 million.</p>
          <p>For 2010, basically, we have four main projects. First, of course, the integration of Fortis France that will represent an extra &#x20AC;200 million in revenues coming from 50,000 individual customers and 20,000 corporate customers. Synergies expected from the project are &#x20AC;50 million by 2012.</p>
          <p>Then three further projects representing additional revenues of &#x20AC;200 million by 2013 will be implemented. Net banking with the introduction of new online and cell phone services, the creation of 60 new dedicated outlets for SMEs and entrepreneurs. And finally, non-life insurance with damage, dates and disability products. This year as for the last year French Retail Banking will aim to achieve a one point positive jaws effect.</p>
          <p>In Italy, as in France, the Banca enjoyed good business development with a net gain of over 60,000 net customers in the year, lending was up 5% compared to 2008 and 51 branches were opened of which 40 in the fourth quarter alone. In the last quarter, the revenues were up 3.4% compared to last year driven by strong financial fee growth. At the same time, operating expenses were down by 1.3%.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the chart, the cost/income ratio has been brought down from over 70% to below 60% in three years time. Pre-tax income at &#x20AC;69 million, were down 31% over the first quarter of 2008. Finally, what we can say today is that all of the 2006-2009 objectives from the business plan have been reached.</p>
          <p>The plan going forward for BNL is to expand the network to reach 1,000 branches by 2012. In fact it has been opening 50 to 70 branches a year. At the same time, we will continue to increase the effectiveness of our set up in Italy, cross-selling can still be raised between the network and all the other businesses to group out there. Findomestic, the consumer finance specialist, Investment Solutions and CIB. Finally, two integrations will be managed locally next year. First, one of Fortis Italia and then UCB into BNL. And to summarize, objective for BNL is three points of positive jaws effect in 2010.</p>
          <p>As for BancWest is concerned, revenues were down by 8.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This was essentially due to two factors. A further drop in net interest margin and a 3.7% decline in outstanding loans compared to a year-ago. Good growth in core deposits up 17.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 did not outweigh these two factors. Excluding the impact from the FDIC assessment, operating expenses at constant exchange rates were brought down by 1.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. And despite a noticeable drop in the cost of risk of BancWest ended the fourth quarter with a loss of &#x20AC;55 million.</p>
          <p>For 2010, the plan for BancWest is clear. First boost revenues through increased customer acquisition and cross-selling. Further cost-cuts to reach US$130 million in all, US$72 million already been achieved in 2009 and benefit from lower impairment charges from the investment portfolio. These should bring BancWest back into positive territory in 2010.</p>
          <p>For Emerging Markets, this franchise has reached the five million customers threshold this quarter. Nevertheless, revenues are still down compared to the first quarter of 2008 but has stabilized compared to the third quarter of 2009. The drop is a consequence of negative effect of falling interest rates in all countries and the 8% drop in outstanding loans. Operating expenses were brought down by 2.6% at constant scope and exchange rate compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 as the restructuring plan in Ukraine continued. Cost of risk stabilized compared to the third quarter of 2009 and the pre-tax income at minus &#x20AC;70 million.</p>
          <p>For 2010, while these business is changing from Emerging Markets Retail Banking to Europe Mediterranean to symbolize a new focus on three priority regions with high growth potential; five North African countries that we shall now plainly call Mediterranean, Turkey and Central and Eastern Europe. Europe Mediterranean accounts 2,300 branches in the region, of which 500 in the Mediterranean, 600 in Turkey and 1,000 in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>To accelerate the commercial expansion, BNP Paribas will roll out an adapted version of its retail banking model to these countries, in particular commercial synergies will be expanded with Personal Finance and the trade centers, JVs will be created with the private bank. All in all, the group has major ambitions in these fast-growing markets.</p>
          <p>And then for Personal Finance, at constant scope and exchange rate, Personal Finance posted sustained revenue growth at plus 11% compared to the first quarter of 2008. This was driven by the growth in outstandings plus 4% and a fall in refinancing costs. At the same time, operating expenses were yet again brought down, minus 5%, with marketing expenses picked up gradually. Pre-tax income at &#x20AC;69 million was down 57% due to the effect that in the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a &#x20AC;123 million capital gain from the disposal of Cofidis. This quarter the growth in gross operating income was &#x20AC;167 million, fully absorbed the &#x20AC;135 million rise in cost of risk. For 2010, Personal Finance will take advantage of a number of gross levers.</p>
          <p>In Italy, synergies between Findomestic and BNL confirms the set of insurance and savings product and additional partnerships with e-business players. Synergy with banking networks will also be increased in Belgium with Fortis. In Germany, with the Dresdner partnership now expanded to Commerz and with the Europe Mediterranean organization. IT systems will be upgraded and streamlined especially in France and Spain. And Personal Finance 2010 objective is to achieve a positive two-point jaws effect.</p>
          <p>Then this is Georges to present you Investment Solutions and CIB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Laurent. We will move now to Investment Solutions and CIB. Investment Solutions, first, we have two very important aspects to look at which were net asset inflows and assets under management. Concerning net asset inflows we have positive, we have positive net asset inflows 25 billion in 2009. I will remind you we had also positive net asset inflow in 2008. So globally it comes on Asset Management 14 billion half of which in money market assets and in Insurance, in life insurance plus six billion, mainly due to the interest in long-term products in Euro in life insurance.</p>
          <p>So, now we have assets under management of &#x20AC;588 billion, which are naturally 17% higher than end of 2008, that's also higher than at the end of 2007 that means that as ever at BNP Paribas, we are over the crisis let's say. You can see that the increase of assets under management is due for 25 billion for net asset inflows and from the newest 50 billion from performance effect, which is naturally a good year. So, globally, we have substantial net asset inflow for the year and major rebound in assets.</p>
          <p>So results for the fourth quarter. So revenues are up 12% to a level of &#x20AC;1.2 billion. Let's say all the business lines are positively contributed except Securities Services and I will come back on it. Wealth &amp; Asset Management plus 12%, Insurance plus 68% that we have to take in &#x2013; to take into account that last year or for the fourth quarter of 2008, we have a negative effect of 142 million due to equity, the adjustment of equity portfolio, but despite the difference, we have a very positive growing Insurance revenue.</p>
          <p>In Securities Services, we have minus 20%, due to the fact that we have lots of deposit naturally in this business and due to the net interest margin contraction because we have a net margin interest contraction due to the fact the short-term interest rates are naturally lower compared to the first quarter of 2008 but at the same level then in the third quarter of 2009. We naturally maintain strict control on the on operating expenses, plus 3% despite large investments in IT, in Insurance and because we think we have to continue to invest strongly in Insurance.</p>
          <p>At the end, the pre-tax income is below &#x2013; just below &#x20AC;300 million, plus 40% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. So globally strongly down compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our investment &#x2013; our action plan for 2010 is very simple. We continue to develop like we were before. I mean that we continue to work on the customer acquisition, we are constantly in a positive customer acquisition and naturally one specificity of our model, it's the cross-selling with our domestic networks.  We had previously two domestic networks, France and Italy, now we have four domestic networks as in Belgium and Luxembourg. Naturally, we will complete the integration between BNP Paribas and Fortis and BGL. I remind you that we will create &#x2013; we are going to create the fifth larger asset manager in Europe and the number one private bank in eurozone and naturally we will develop, we will continue to develop Security Services business specifically through the huge presence of BGL in Luxembourg. And naturally, we will continue to grow us organically in Asia. All know that Asia is a growing market. We're growing asset management in wealth management and in insurance. So, Investment Solution has always been a growth driver for the Group it will naturally continue for 2010.</p>
          <p>I will come now to CIB. It is interesting to see that we had very well let's say required revenues year for 2009 and each quarter compared to &#x2013; each quarter of 2009 compared to each quarter of 2007 is higher that shows clearly that we have constantly gained market share in this business. After the crisis, we think we are much stronger than we were, thanks to our strong business model. Naturally, we were pleased and delighted to see that we have a lot of businesses in capital markets, a lot of significant volume for securities issued, corporate bond, capital increase, convertible bonds naturally.</p>
          <p>But also in Financing business our platform and our franchise shows that we gain new clients not only Europe but also in U.S. and in Asia. And naturally, as we have expressed too in the beginning of last year, we have substantively reduced our market risk and our risk-weighted assets. I assume that we'll cover that in the general conclusion. So, globally, our customer-oriented business will show that during the crisis we were very resilient and after the crisis we think we are much stronger than we were before.</p>
          <p>Coming to the Q4 results for CIB. Let's say that first of all due to seasonal effect we see decrease in our revenues in Q4 compared to the Q3.  As you know all our clients were probably in vacation in the second half of December. So, naturally, we have seasonal effects especially in capital markets, not really in financing business.  We have made no comparison compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 because it was not significant at all.</p>
          <p>Our operating expenses are being strongly controlled. You see that in the current terms, we are only below &#x2013; we are only decreasing of 2.5%. But I have to make you some comments about the way we have the accounts our variable compensation because in fact the deferred part of variable compensation was fully booked in Q4. If you remind the operating expenses in Q3 were lower by the impact of the deferrals but half of the deferred bonuses as an interim solution because we have to work on it. In between we got an official statement from the French accounting authorities allowing us to book all the deferred part in 2009. Hence Q4 was impacted by June month which were deferred in Q3. So, now we're now back to the prudent accounting principals that as we know, at BNP Paribas we like to stick to and that we were only able to apply in Q3 due to uncertainty surrounding the road to apply.</p>
          <p>So, naturally if you look at the situation in fact the pre-tax income which seems to be lower in the first quarter than in the third quarter is in fact higher due to this impact as the variable compensation booking results because as Baudouin mentioned, the cost of risk on top of that has been reduced coming to 280 million compared to 570 million in Q4. So which is clearly a narrow accounting is at a deferred part of variable compensation not carrying forward so we have no borrowing for future earnings concerning the deferred part of compensation.</p>
          <p>Concerning the activities on the revenue; we'll go through quickly on that. On fixed income, we see a normalization of the market that means a continued reduction on the bid-offer spread and the volatility, which we continue and we seem to continue to gain market share. And naturally, in interest rate and ForEx products, as I mentioned you as far as in mid of December, there were not a lot of clients. So it is really a seasonal slowdown in business.</p>
          <p>In Equity and Advisory, we enjoyed to have now IPO in Europe and Asia, which is a good news for the first quarter. We see that a lot of clients come back for simple, capital-guaranteed structured products. So the business is equity and advisory is back. So, globally strong business except the seasonal effect in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>I would like to make some comments about 2009 variable compensation. Naturally we at the level of BNP Paribas, we observe strictly the G20 rules, which are now applicable to market professionals.  That means that, first of all for the perimeter, we take into account all charges, which could affect CIB capital market businesses naturally; our new liquidity cost, cost of risk, allocated equity, remuneration, exceptional taxes in the U.K. and in France. And naturally as we comply to G20 rules, more than 50% of the variable compensation is deferred and conditional and subject to claw back and naturally indexed on BNP Paribas' share price.</p>
          <p>What is interesting to associate is that we are booked, as I mentioned, all variable compensation components. So not only the deferred and conditional part, which will be payable into 2011, 2012 and 2013, but also exceptional taxes in France and in the U.K. which will be paid on this year. Globally, our compensation ratio is now around &#x2013; exactly at 27.7%, coming from 40% to this number, which is probably one of the lowest level in the industry worldwide and on top of that, if I add that no variable compensation charges are carried forward. I think this is very robust. So globally it shows that we are absolutely observe the G20 rules and we have a lot of moderation in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Just to comment about our risk policy and concerning our average value at risk. We are now at a much lower level than we were in 2008, around 60 million. And as you know, we think that our value at risk is a very robust model because naturally in 2009 we have never had one day higher than the value at risk. And I think during the two year, the three years of crisis, we have only nine days greater than our value at risk. I think it's a good performance compared to a lot of our peers. So globally we are substantially decreased. Our market risk as Baudouin Prot mentioned, last year and the beginning of the year presenting our 2008 results.</p>
          <p>So I come to our Financing business for the fourth quarter. It's a very good business with revenues at the level of 860 million plus 12% compared to the third quarter. We have very strong platform, with a very good franchise so naturally, it is &#x2013; we succeed in that type of business. We have a substantial decrease in the cost of risk and I previously mentioned that. So all in all, we have posted a pre-tax income of 417 million, which is &#x2013; let's say, I'd say not your highest level because the highest level was during the fourth quarter of 2008 but the second highest level for BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>Naturally interest rate illustrates some examples of what we have done. We have now for the first year, the first in euro denominated bond issues, it is a first tier. We have &#x2013; let's say managed more than 260 bond issue of 2009, cumulating &#x20AC;170 billion naturally also a lot of equity and equity-linked deals. And in financing part, we are naturally a very strong financing partner because we're a lead manager for more than 200 billion, you have some examples on the slides mainly for the European customers, German, U.K., Spain, Luxembourg and naturally France.</p>
          <p>Our action plan is really continuity. We will continue what we have begun to deliver before the crisis, during the crisis and after the crisis. In Europe, we are clearly leader, so we will naturally continue to develop this leadership in capital markets and in structured finance. We will continue to improve our penetration in commercial banking. I think it's interesting to see that since Fortis and through the implantation of Fortis in Europe, we will create a new &#x2013; what we call CTBE, Corporate &amp; Transaction Banking Europe and that will allow you or allow us to continue to penetrate more and more our customers especially in Europe.</p>
          <p>In North America, we are still selective because we have not improved the products, but naturally we will continue to develop in capital market, we will leverage and enhance our position in prime brokerage and I remind you that we have built the part of Bank of America prime brokerage last year. And so we will develop on that and naturally as we are very strong in energy and commodity finance we will develop this activity.</p>
          <p>In Asia, same as our Investment Solutions. We will continue to grow organically without paying  goodwill especially in fixed income, in other capital markets branches naturally for structured finance. So, globally, we'll consolidate our position in Europe, we are clearly a leader and we continue to reinforce positions in these regions when we see we have a lot to do.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I will leave the floor to Jean.</p>

          <p>So, about BNP Paribas Fortis, <mark type="inaudible" /> revenues about &#x20AC;1.6 million this quarter, down by &#x20AC;650 million compared to the previous quarter. Part of the drop, 241 is due to one-off adjustments to our own credit spread and the other part is due to revenues from market driven activities that are &#x20AC;345 million down compared to the third quarter I's in the context of de-risking.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses were brought down by &#x20AC;120 million, as the synergies implemented start to have an effect. Pre-tax income stood at &#x20AC;311 million, of which &#x20AC;391 million of PPA adjustment. Now that a new mood exists within BNP Paribas Fortis, important companies have been launched in Belgium and in those individual customers and corporate clients, a new sales and marketing drive is under way in Belgium and as shown on the chart some deals used this new momentum.</p>
          <p>Regarding Retail Banking in Belgium deposits are continuing to rise at &#x20AC;67.2 billion, well above the level at end of 2008. Elsewhere in Belgian Retail Banking franchises in Luxembourg, Poland and Turkey deposits have remained stable compared to the third quarter.</p>
          <p>On the loan side, the situation has also been globally stable.</p>
          <p>As for Fortis Investment and the Private Banking, assets under management have been roughly stable as performance effects have globally compensated the outflows recorded this quarter. This is globally at &#x20AC;205 billion assets under management franchise that has been merged into the respective BNP Paribas businesses.</p>
          <p>In Merchant Banking, revenues have been stable in the financing business as the dropping outstandings is offset by lower refinancing cost. Costs have been reduced over the fourth quarter and risk-weighted asset reduction has continued. All in all, this is a good performance for Merchant Banking in the transition period.</p>
          <p>For the synergies, deferred synergy expected from the Fortis Industrial Plan had been announced on the 1st of December. So, this is just a recap; was picking a total of &#x20AC;900 million of synergies for this plan by 2012. These are essentially composed of cost synergies for &#x20AC;850 billion, integration cost should total &#x20AC;1.3 billion over the first three years of this project from 2009 to 2011. The integration is progressing well and &#x20AC;120 million of cost synergies had been achieved in 2009, slightly ahead of the initial plan that was &#x20AC;110 million.</p>
          <p>So this is it for Fortis. And I'll hand over the floor to Baudouin for the conclusion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>At Group level the first thing we managed actively this year was the Group balance sheet. The balance sheet of the Fortis was &#x20AC;520 billion and we've managed in such a way that the balance sheet of BNP Paribas as at end of 2009 at &#x20AC;2.58 trillion is lower than at the beginning of the year. So reduced Group balance sheet by &#x20AC;536 billion, a bit lower than the Fortis' contribution to the balance sheet. So it was I think a responsive and active management, actually all of the reductions or most reductions concern the repo's, the derivatives and the other trading assets and overall the trading book was reduced by 31%.</p>
          <p>In the meantime the banking book was increased by 40% with especially the loan book increasing from &#x20AC;615 billion to &#x20AC;788 billion. So I think it's an important demonstration of what we can do in terms of managing the balance sheet and I think this is important from the perspective of further changes including regulatory changes.</p>
          <p>In terms of liquidity, there also we've been continuing to proactively manage liquidity, even if we enjoy the best CDS in the market as we see here with 80 basis points just before HSBC and Credit Suisse and Rabobank. We have improved our loan deposit ratio, which stand at 120% as at the end of 2009 compared to 128% as of the end of 2007. And certainly our portfolio of securities eligible with Central Bank now stand at &#x20AC;190 billion, so quite a steep increase compared to a year or year and a half ago. And I think it's important that &#x2013; our medium to long-term issuance program for 2009 would be lower than last year. Last year we issued &#x20AC;38 billion and this year we'll issue less. Therefore I think we will be able to have a very competitive refinancing position into this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of solvency, we certainly increased our equity Tier 1 ratio very much last year. It stood at 5.4% as of the end of 2008 and it's now standing at 8%, so it's a 12, 15 basis points nearly 50% increase over the last year, of which the organic equity generation contributed 85 basis points. The dilution in risk-weighted asset is 75 basis points, and the capital increased including dividend paid in shares 100 basis points. We believe this is very adequate level of solvency confirmed during the crisis. Certainly BNP Paribas had no losses whether in 2007 or 2008. So we never had to use really a capital through compensate for losses and we &#x2013; with the risk profile of the Group, so the crisis and it's very diversified business model has confirmed its resilience in that business. And so we see that this reinforced solvency had put it now to a very adequate level for BNP Paribas risk profile.</p>
          <p>In terms of Tier 1 capital, the Tier 1 capital, the equity Tier 1 capital of the Group stand at &#x20AC;49.6 billion as of the end of 2009, it is an increase of over &#x20AC;20 billion &#x2013; &#x20AC;20.6 billion exactly through last year. Of which the revenue generation was &#x20AC;4.6 billion after distribution. The capital increase was &#x20AC;5.2 billion and the effect of the Fortis deal was &#x20AC;10.8 billion.</p>
          <p>In terms of risk-weighted asset there also we had an active management last year as per the balance sheet, the contribution of Fortis was 166 billion euros and last year we reduced all together our risk-weighted assets by 73 billion euros, of which the retail banking increased by four billion euros of that part didn't contribute in any sense to reduction. CIB brought 48 billion euros to the reduction and the BNP Paribas Fortis another 20 billion euros primarily Merchant Banking, which is the corporate in this banking arm of the Fortis.</p>
          <p>In the last quarter of last year, we saw a slight increase of two billion euros of which Findomestic consolidation after this &#x2013; taking control of Findomestic was four billion. The foreign exchange effect was four million to the well increased parity of the dollar to the euro mainly. And Fortis contributed a reduction of seven billion euro again primary in Merchant Banking. So, we are going to continue to manage risk-weighted assets going forward in an optimal way.</p>
          <p>In terms of earnings per share, the earnings per share is rising by 74% from three euro to 5.2 euros from 2008 to 2009. The net income group share grew by 93%, while the difference is due to the limited dilution resulting from the capital increase that we initiated last year. We've had the limited dilution during the crisis compared to a number of comparable banks and I think we have shown our capacities therefore to generate growth and to create value throughout the cycle.</p>
          <p>In terms of dividends, we were very committed to grow solid dividend policy. We will &#x2013; this year, we will prepare to the Shareholder Meeting a dividend of 1.5 euro per share, this is a payout ratio of 32.3% and we will again offer to our shareholders the option to get the dividend base in shares and not in cash if they want. As you see over the last year eight years, our payout ratio has been some how in the range of 30% to 40% and we believe it is, well, it is around 32% is the kind of payout ratio well, I and the Board of BNP Paribas feel very comfortable for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>Going into this year, we will concentrate really involving out our integrated model was in the new European scope of the group, which in our four domestic markets of France, Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg, we're going to fully rollout one of the diversified and integrated business model with well in France cross selling. We are going to neutralize and show more platforms.</p>
          <p>And we are going to increase our presence in the other countries, especially for CIB where we are going through consolidating and our positions and increase &#x2013; continue to increase market share. As Georges mentioned the Corporate &amp; Transaction Banking Europe, CTBE, is a new integrated and expanded offering for corporates in terms of cash management and trade services that will be we think very competitive offer. Personal Finance is going to expand its credit offering with the new integration fees of Findomestic in Italy. And Investment Solutions, we want to successfully complete the integration of Fortis and BGL businesses units. We want to rollout our successful private banking model that we have successfully initiated in France, successfully deployed in Italy and even now going to deploy it in Belgium. And so, this will be really a heart of the strategy this year.</p>
          <p>In the Europe Mediterranean, emerging markets as Jean-Laurent explained, the new ambitions in growing market and in Mediterranean, in Turkey, in Central Europe and especially Poland, we are going to rollout our retail banking model adapting to local conditions and expanding also the offering to corporate clients.</p>
          <p>And in Asia, both CIB and Investment Solutions, we saw the two key divisions already really a presence in this world. Huge region, we have 5% of the group's workforce over 10,000 people between &#x2013; mainly between CIB and Investment Solutions working in Asia with 6% of the group earnings and CIB will concentrate on three regional hubs around Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo.</p>
          <p>And Investment Solutions, there we want to become a major player especially in Asset Management, in Private Banking and also in Securities Services, as well we have initiated growth in plans become a key player in the major market. The plan is developing in good conditions we started it two years ago.</p>
          <p>And we have some joint initiatives from the two CIB and Investment Solutions divisions towards institutional clients and also in terms of products.</p>
          <p>So the 2010 outlook, we believe we are well positioned in many of our key businesses, we want to consolidate market share gains and take full advantage of our integrated model. We will &#x2013; we have to deliver this year &#x2013; this year is very important for the synergies of the BNP Paribas Fortis investment plan. So, they should continue to improve our operating efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
          <p>And as I said earlier, we expect to see a start our continued and even a soft decline in the cost of risk as of this year. So this will be really a year of optimization and organic growth for BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>And after nearly three years, the crisis started nearly three years ago was showing resilience and the robustness of our business model throughout this three years of crisis. We have been relevant -- rare player in Europe having been able to expand its domestic markets through the crisis with the acquisition of Fortis. Our solvency is now really reinforced and we believe that profit generation capacity will be available to expand our footprint, well expand our two thing to have to acquire new customers and to consolidate on our market share gains in our main territories and businesses.</p>
          <p>We're now ready with Jean-Laurent, Georges and Philippe to answer any of your questions.</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. The first question is maybe about the <mark type="inaudible" />  we developed that as we have seen that market for several European <mark type="inaudible" />. You have about 67 billion outstanding in bonds, seven bonds in your trading. I was wondering if you could comment whether this environment is positive for year or negative; does it affect other business plan in fixed income?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to Fortis, if you could give out some breakdown of the profitability or the revenues by business line, I know you will give new breakdowns, but maybe you can give some indication? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jean will answer the first question. And the second, I'm not sure we're going to give you much breakdown.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we mainly have invested in insuring (52.49) bonds, the figures we mentioned concerning 67 billion is mainly within our domestic market. So we are mainly invested in France, in Italy, in Belgium and in Italy, in Netherlands, due to the former Fortis. As you know, we have no domestic market, we are not in a domestic market, neither in Greece, nor in Portugal, nor in Spain. So it's mainly that so, I would say it's neutral for us and we are not so very involved in the countries you have not mentioned but probably you think a lot. And naturally, we are &#x2013; we are much more sort of primary dealer in all the countries.  So we have some residual amounts, but not really &#x2013; a part of it is covered by CDS and so on. So it's not clearly for us very major &#x2013; we are not happy on that but it's not very consistent for BNP Paribas specifically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Not mainly, there are so many effects in the market, so it's one of the components, but not very important.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So second question maybe...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. On Fortis, maybe we can just confirm that in April, we will give you the full presentation of Fortis according to the BNP Paribas revenues. So for the time being, we are not giving more information on the different business range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In April, we will give &#x2013; we'll give the split for <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yes. We are giving on, in April, the full P&amp;L for 2009. And then, each quarter we will give you the equivalent for 2010, but basically we will have the deluxe spot that will become the DSRBO, the DNL within the retail part and then all other figures are going to be directly included in the different business lines,from investment solution or CIB. So this is &#x2013; this would be the presentation for the years to go for Fortis. I don't remember if the date is already scheduled, no, not yet?</p>
          <p>It will be done before &#x2013; obviously before the release of first quarter results, probably late April.  Still working on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Alexander Curtis from Macquarie. Three questions from me. The first one is again on Fortis. When you look at the 1.6 billion expected revenues in the fourth quarter, you also mentioned that you had about 330 million of reduction in revenues due to the de-risking of the business. Just wondering whether this is strategy de-risking, we're going to see a lot of revenue going forward, or we might see revenues going back to the level of the third quarter? That's the first question. The second one is on the corporate center where we've seen a significant swing in revenues from minus 200 million in the third quarter to 500 million in the fourth quarter. You explained partially by saying that there had been some gains in the on-debt. I was just wondering whether you can give us some flavor as to what we're going to see going forward in terms of contribution of this division? And finally the third question is on the equity and advisory business. We've seen some reductions from, of revenues from 600 million to 500 million in the fourth quarter. You're also telling us that the activity is back to a good level in the first quarter. What level of revenues are we going to see? Can we expect some figure in the region of 600, 700 million? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so Jean-Laurent will answer to Fortis, Philippe on the second question, CapEx, and Georges on the third.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So, about the merchant bank revenue generating business, it is very difficult to compare the first quarter to the third quarter, because of the April seasonal effects and especially because the third quarter was quite high, it was still in the good part of the year. So we cannot derive much from these figures. We are going to give it in a much more I would say friendly way in April. I hope it is going to be much more clear in April, so.</p>
          <p>And then Philippe, for the...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you mentioned those two figures for the quarters, and I was mentioning the market was clearly let's say closed through the 15 of December. So naturally, we have a seasonal effect in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So globally, I would say that I prefer to see a 600 something, but let's say if I go back, it's very difficult for us to make some outlooks. The only thing I can repeat as Baudouin mentioned this morning, is that we see absolutely no bad news concerning the beginning of the year. But it's very difficult to give you a figure. Let's say simply that we're on a good momentum, then we will see what will be the market quarter-after-quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as corporate center is concerned, apart from what we said, you have to bear in mind that the corporate center is also showing the interest revenue on the cash held by Central Treasury; it's a kind of Central Treasury of the bank.  Meaning that if the cash of the bank, net of the notional equity allocated to the business lines, which is of course remunerated.</p>
          <p>And what happened this year, in fact, is that contrary to the other years, the risk weighted assets went down in the business lines, so the corporate center had less to allocate quarter-after-quarter. And at the same time, we benefit from the capital increase we &#x2013; at the end &#x2013; especially at the end of the year, which increased the cash available. And so this kind of swing between if you want more cash due to the capital increase and less capital allocation to the business lines is creating a kind of unusual wealth in the corporate center.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in the new vision of the Group, we are going to rebuild again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This is one &#x2013; yes, this is going to be changed in the &#x2013; but when we are going to reallocate everything according to the new presentation in April, all that will be restated according to the new rules anyway and the new segmentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Neuez from Goldman Sachs. Three quick questions if I may. The first question about BNL in France. We see some sort of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, is it BNN or BNL?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>BNL.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>BNL, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in France we see some reallocation of certain disposals, which are going down and insurance, mutual funds which are going up. I was just trying to understand whether that's a funding strategy and if you could sort of put this in context of your funding strategy and potential changing the total funding requirement, in particular terming out and things like that?</p>
          <p>Then I would like to ask you about the impact of the rising short term interest rate in BNP as a whole, if you can give a sense of the sensitivity on that; what would be the impact? And the third question is about the capital structure. I can see obviously that you have less of Tier 2 capital and also less of hybrid Tier 1 capital in the context of the new regulation that could come up there. I was just wondering what you think about all of this amount of capital and whether that's something that you find useful in a way? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe on the first point...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just a business effect, a market effect that when rates &#x2013; short term rates are going down, you tend to lose, because this is the choice of the customers, you tend to lose short-term deposit and balance sheet, and marginally these customer would move to the insurance life because they would enjoy a mid-term rate that it was just, let's say, commercial customer attitude that is moving when you have that kind of a change between short-term rates that are very low and mid-term that in the insurance life are based upon investments done in the past. So this is a kind of arbitrage that is done by our customers. It's not the willingness of the bank to move in this way. And basically you can see equivalent effects in any retail bank in France or Italy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the impact on interest rate &#x2013; of interest rate. You have to bear in mind that well, it's difficult to give another answer for the overall bank, because we are so diversified that it's relatively different from one place to another. But what we can say, broad line. The networks tend to be favorable, rising interest rates in short-term; because the margin on deposits, on lower rates deposits is widening.</p>
          <p>That being said, this positive factor is largely hedged by the assets and liability management team. So the impact &#x2013; the net impact is not huge.</p>
          <p>But to the other hand, a business like personal finance, it tends to be in the other way around, meaning a low interest rate environment or a declining interest environment is favorable, because there is some lag in the repricing of the loan and the rising interest rate is less favorable symmetrically.</p>
          <p>As far as I think &#x2013; well, for the retail that's it. For CIB I think there is no impact at all, because the tradings gain. We don't bear any kind of carry trade or things like that. We are not a hedge fund, so there is no impact infact of the level of short-term interest rates in CIB. And on AMS, as we have said, a business like security services is currently suffering from a low interest rate environment, which is reducing the interest margin on the cash which is held and the cash balances. And so they would benefit from a higher level of interest rate. And from the rest, I think for the other businesses it's more or less neutral.</p>
          <p>So mix, but overall more significant impact, I would say. Slightly positive.  We also the steepening of the yield curve, so let's say there are a lot of effects, but let's say slightly positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you look from the capital standpoint...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have not captured your last question on the <mark type="inaudible" />, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You also have a lot of hybrid Tier 1. I'm just wondering, when we talk about &#x2013; when we talk about phasing out this type of security, whether you &#x2013; you've already started to buy back some of that, because you booked again in the corporate center. I was wondering whether that's something you intend to do more, and if you &#x2013; what that could be in terms of the financing cost impacting that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I said as Tier 2 is concerned, yes. We took advantage of the relative depreciation of the Tier 2 securities in order to buy back some with some gain, exceptional gain in the fourth quarter. We did that before the release of the Basel III paper. And now &#x2013; and before doing that, we would think it twice because why -- on Basel III they have not said that they would drop the Tier 2 requirements, something which was supposed to be maybe in the making and in practice is not proposed in the paper. So Tier 2 may remain a component of overall sort of ability which means that currently we'll adopt a wait-and-see attitude until the end rules are known.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> Two questions if I may. One on loan volumes in France and Italy and one on the credit outlook.</p>
          <p>On loan volumes, I mean, there is this agreement about 7 billion of new commitment for small &#x2013; well, small businesses in Italy. I was just wondering, I mean, can you put this into perspective, with what was done last year. First question. Then, can you so tell us how you would, well how can you manage not to lose when your credit runs out and can you respect these commitments?</p>
          <p>Also loan volumes in Italy, we can see a kind of deceleration in the fourth quarter and can you give us an outlook for 2010 in this respect?</p>
          <p>And then regarding credit outlook. One quick question on personal finance. I noted that you have a cautious prospect for next year for 2010 and in light of the change in credit fund outs. We started quite early I believe at BNP in 2008 in light also of, well, recollection teams, which were strengthened. I would have expected some decrease in 2010, so can you elaborate on this one and what are the main drivers? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Regarding the loan, regarding France first of all, we have just set this  sum of &#x20AC;7 billion to finance the medium and long-term needs of the, well very small businesses and SMEs. This lender up is increased by around 6% compared to which we've realized in '09 plus 6%. Then we will see if we need, we are not changing by any means our credit standards and we'll remain just as, well regardless as we've always been. And we will see I think, I am not sure we are going to use all of the envelope, but the objective is not to make use of the envelope. The objective is to make sure that the envelope is available and then do our business as usual. That's how we are going to act and I think that on personal finance that &#x2013; and on Italy, maybe you want to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Italy, just to give the answer for Italy, the drop is totally linked to very large corporate customers that move heavily from <mark type="inaudible" /> lending loans to markets, given the financing source, so this is basically the move. Otherwise there is no difference basically between France and Italy in this respect. And now for personal finance, yes, we moved as soon as it was necessary to move but this is a business that is strongly linked to the economy. You cannot expect that you will exit from the crisis before the economy is truly recovering, so it is quite normal that next year would see a &#x2013; we hope stabilization, even a little drop, but we cannot assume that next year or this year 2010 is going to be a huge improvement in that respect. So this is the situation, it's really a business that is totally linked to unemployment. There is no way to be in advance compared to the cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think had we not done that, the cost of goods would increase, having been fairly active in terms of those scoring, tightening and more people to &#x2013; a better collection of sorts. This is why it's now stabilized. Before the unemployment rates goes down &#x2013; actually we have disconnected cost of risk to unemployment in this market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is portfolios for strength and put first and then it is starting to go down, translates. Also it's the portfolios for <mark type="inaudible" />; it takes some time to exit from the cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But what I wanted you to stress regarding personal finance that I think this year we'll manage personal finance using the operation levels really very well in making sure that with revenues really going up and cost going down, we have &#x2013; we have seen in the last quarter the increase in gross operating income at Generale was &#x20AC;165 million and so we more than compensated the gross operating income up on the 67 offsetting the higher cost of risk. So if the cost of risk stabilizes, then we will still have the operating levels increasing the profitability.</p>
          <p>This is what we expect for next year. Part of the cost control was structural of course, part of which was decreased in marketing expenses that we're going to resume for a part of it into 2010, but still we expect to still have &#x2013; I think we're committed to two points of positive effect that should make gross operating income continue to grow and therefore have a significant level on the profitability even on the assumption of only stabilize of likely leveling off cost of risk into next year. Other questions?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Rob Down from HSBC. I've got three questions, unfortunately. The first one focuses on the PPA adjustment, the 391 million that's come through, have in mind that's higher than the forecast we've been given for Q4. I just wonder if you could give us some more clarity on what's gone into that 391 million whether that's just purely a reversal from the 2.6 billion fair-value on loans and advances or whether there're some other PPA adjustment that are coming through there?</p>
          <p>Second question is going back to CIBM business and the compensation ratio, and I just wondered if you have some sort of range in mind for that compensation ratio going forward?</p>
          <p>And then the final question, and this may be an unfair question to ask at this stage, but Basel III is introducing the concept to a much higher weighting for counterparty credit-risk within the businesses. And last year you very kindly gave us a range for the potential uplift in your market rated risks from Basel 2.5, I was just wondering if you've done any work at this stage on the counter-party credit-risk elements under Basel III and whether or not you had a sort of range of potential risks or uplifts that would come through from that front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Three good questions for this year, sure. Well, on the PPA, while we made a first kind of assessment in June in order to provide you with the kind of first figure and that we came to &#x20AC;815 million, we kept working and going through all the balance sheet figures and so we are coming up with more, much more precise and now close to final figures at 835, so it's almost the same, only 20 million additional battery. We have &#x2013; technically, we have one full year in order &#x2013; so we may change again until next May, but it's &#x2013; well, it's not likely, I mean now we have gone already through a lot of details. On the &#x2013; yes, and I'll come back on Basel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the compensation ratio I would like, first to make some comments. Due to first of all the rating of BNP Paribas, lot of news, let say, captured by the fact that we are BNP Paribas with this strong rating and this strong competitive position during 208 and especially 209.</p>
          <p>And so let's say I've seen globally that probably 27% is probably a low level. We have nothing in mind, we have just to look at what will do our competitors because as I've seen Baudouin mention this morning, we have two objectives. First, to be strictly compliant with G20 letter and spirit. Second, just to stay in the market as a competitive position for all our staffs, so we will see &#x2013; we have seen during the end of last year some, let's say, modification of behavior, we will see early in the year what will be the situation and we will have in mind function of our &#x2013; the mind of our competitor. So, let's say it's much too early to answer to your question of what will happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the CCR are concerned, we already taking CCR into account in our internal models. It's &#x2013; well, we &#x2013; well being, I would say, one of the major derivative houses in the world, I mean we are taking a great care of counterparty risk and we are measuring it in detail and the capital allocated to that risk is even bigger than the capital allocated to market risk quotum. So we &#x2013; and the model, which we are already using is taking into account some stressed parameters and so we're already quite close to the Basel III proposals to that respect I would say. Now, we have to &#x2013; well, there will be some technical functioning with the Basel Committee that we have to wait until we have the final rules before being more precise, but it's something which is not the minimum territory for us, far from that, far from that. Again, we currently have more capital allocated to CCR than to market risk, just to give you an idea.</p>

          <p>Hi. <mark type="inaudible" />. Just two questions, first, can you just give us some indication of the Net Stable Funding ratio of about 80 to 90%...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> can you articulate that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly on the Net Stable Funding ratio I'm not able to see that indication of where around 80 to 90%. And I was wondering if you could give some idea of where you would stand under the current rules that are in the proposal?</p>
          <p>And secondly on the Fortis, on the cost base what's the impact of the lower market revenues both on the cost, I think that's a reduction of 120 million specifically on a quarter-on-quarter basis? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Net Stable Funding ratio, I am not going to give you any figure because I mean it's typically the ratio you add back to and depending on the rules, you manage to adapt to the ratio. The only thing I would like to say is that this ratio is clearly acknowledging the stability of retail deposits and being the first bank in the Eurozone in terms of retail deposits, we &#x2013; I mean we feel in a relative good position compared with our competitors as far this ratio is concerned.</p>
          <p>The second thing is that in any case the end result is that it will increase the need for medium and long-term funding and &#x2013; for all the banks &#x2013; and hence it will penalize more banks with a high cost of funding. And well we insist on the fact that our CDS spread is at the lower &#x2013; the lowest end &#x2013; the lower end &#x2013; sorry, of the industry and is really consistently low compared with the competitors. So again for us it's going to be a competitive advantage. And I think that &#x2013; I would say as a conclusion I would say that this ratio clearly introduces more differentiation between well weighted banks and others, between deposit-rich banks especially with fund gathering capabilities coming from domestic networks and others. So we &#x2013; I mean whatever the end results of the technicality of that ratio it's going to be favorable for us compared with the others.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. For the cost base of Fortis <mark type="inaudible" /> we didn't get any positive effect from this slowdown in revenue because basically slowdown was linked to outsourcing deposit base of the assets under management and this didn't give a hand to the cost base and maybe in addition we get some negative effect with the split with the Dutch part because we had some de-synergies. So the 120 millions are really the results of positive actions and not the results of let's say some positive aspect linked to a slowdown in the business. This is the situation.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have two quick questions on Fortis, the first one relates to risk-weighted assets. You have basically the sound of about 20 billion risk-weighted assets for BNP Paribas Fortis, I was just wondering whether you intend to reduce that further and if that's the case are we talking about a single-digits, billions or more than that?</p>
          <p>And the second questions relates to the constant risk at Fortis and in the fourth quarter we have some provisions, which were portfolio based, so if you exclude that it's actually increasing a bit, and could you maybe give us some indication on where this is going and if you see provisions stabilizing or should we expect a decline in 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the first point, well, we did &#x2013; let's say good part of the plan, so let's see what's going to happen next year 2010 and 2011, but we did already a good part of the synergies in terms of risk-weighted assets, so this is first point.</p>
          <p>Second point, well, let's say it's difficult to expand &#x2013; but let's say that as for <mark type="inaudible" /> is concerned, Belgium and Luxembourg  cost of risk is very much in the domestic business close to the one we have in French Retail Banking then there's close. In the Merchant Bank the finance business is close to the one we have within CIB. We had some I would say additional, exceptional media effects in the last quarter linked to leading in which we had a business that obviously tend to be much more risky than the leading business from BNP Paribas. And also some additional cost of fees coming from the business &#x2013; the network business centers in Europe that is quite heavily, I would say, financing small caps outside of the domestic base. So maybe these are the two main differences when we look at Fortis compared to the BNP Paribas, knowing that these figures are already figures taking into account adjustments according to the risk policy of BNP Paribas. So this maybe what we can say to that.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I'm Anke from Execution. I have two questions please. And the first one is on your comment on the loan loss charge for 2010, can you please confirm in that are you referring to the 8.4 billion reported or are you talking about decline of assets to the 7.4, i.e. ex the capital markets related charge and with the debt &#x2013; I mean, for most of the divisions like French Retail, BNL, Personal Finance, you were basically talking about a plateauing, so the decline basically largely coming from BancWest and CIB. And then just basically in terms of the cost trend, for example, in French Retail, BNL or other divisions, I see the very favorable trend year-over-year, but I was a bit surprised in some divisions in the second half effect. So is this more like a seasonality that we should expect in 2010 as well or was this more like a one-off due to the quite unusual market trend in the course of the year? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the cost of risk, yes, I think on the cost of risk, I've already given &#x2013; yeah, I think we should that &#x2013; as I said, we expect to see into next year some decline at the group level in the cost of risk to continue to materialize quarter-after-quarter, because I've seen that overall the divisions of the group's, mainly CIB, BancWest, Emerging Markets, and Personal Finance where costs were going to either stabilize or go down, are more important than the divisions where the costs will continue to &#x2013; at a slower pace, that continue to increase, which are French Retail and BNL so that's the view I have on the cost of risk. I don't think I can be more specific on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. Basically then you're referring to the number ex the capital markets?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No. No.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No. To be very precise, when we are speaking of cost of risk, we are referring to the whole of the cost of risk.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the, yes, the declines from the whole figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the trends, on the costs on &#x2013; yes, I think I understand that the question was regarding the trend, regarding costs in the French Retail and the BNL, if I understood well, the question was is the trend for cost...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And I was just wondering, I was surprised, I see a very good cost trend year-over-year, but I thought the seasonality was &#x2013; I was relatively surprised about the seasonality in the fourth quarter, but also second half of those numbers French Retail, is the seasonality &#x2013; would you say that seasonality was exceptionally strong in 2009 and should we expect more favorable trend or don't you see the seasonality as exceptionally high in 2009, because I mean, French Retail with the costs there, didn't really come down in fourth quarter and yet I thought third quarter included sort of one off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The French Retail is quite typical in the fourth quarter we have an additional impact of the negotiation with the unions that cost roughly &#x20AC;50 million because we had to pay an exceptional, let's say, item so this is basically the situation for the first quarter in French Retail, but away from this, nothing else than the regular trend of the network. So we do not expect anything different for 2010 as compared to the previous years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically the inflation point in October of last year was basically higher than we expect &#x2013; that we've still had budgeted and this impacted the cost base and that as a run-off for the  third and fourth quarter of last year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. The first question, many thanks on your slide 42 regarding the data averaging of the balance sheet. I just want to check if you have some further targets for 2009. Second point would be a question regarding Jean-Laurent, why there are some outflows in Q4, if you can specify a bit more on that side? And third question will be for Jean-Laurent, you are speaking about the extension, additional branches in Italy. I remember that you had 55 at the time of D&amp;L invested all that. Usually the branches were acheiving break even after a certain period of time, but I'm not able to find it again. So if you can answer on that side and also a very technical one, on the personal finance. The cost of risk in the Eastern Europe is at 15, can you just try to quantify the risk as part of Ukraine or what &#x2013; why it's so high currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that regarding that &#x2013; before regarding balance sheet maybe we have no target and certainly not target set into the market in terms of balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The only thing we can say is that we have started optimizing the balance sheet because it becomes an issue, so we started. And as usual when you do that it's -you start with the easiest part. And so you can't expect &#x2013; in 2010, you can't expect a reduction of the same magnitude than in 2009 but we'll keep trying to optimize the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Concerning investment solution, it's mainly due to private banking in the first quarter, let's say, due to the cost of G20 move and mainly due to the Italian scope with some &#x2013; a lot of assets from, let's say, offshore or private banking to inshore private banking. And we are not able to capture anything -- all the things mainly in Italy, but globally it comes from private banking and probably it will not continue for 2010.</p>
          <p>And for the branches in Italy, well, if you look at the situation on the marginal approach, you should be profitable during the third year in, let's say, cumulative cash flow, you could be profitable, let's say, in the fourth year. If you look at the situation, with, let's say, indirect costs that are charged in, let's say, six to seven years. So you can look at the situation in number of different ways, what is very clear that opening branches is much more efficient than buying branches in Italy for a number of reasons. It's not only the financial aspect, it is also the fact that well you really choose the franchise, you choose the persons you have in the branches, so it's really different.</p>
          <p>And for personal finance in Eastern Europe, well total outstanding represents only 3% of the total. And this is no Bulgaria and Romania that is giving some &#x2013; that are providing us with some bad venues than Ukraine. So it's a very remote part of the business, only 3% of the total and basically this is Romania and Bulgaria that as of today was on the wrong side of the cycle.</p>

          <p>I can confirm the answer I've made previously. Let's say, missing bad attempts, and we think that the beginning of the year was not too bad and speaking as a whole year, we have no specific outlooks just to outperform our competitors.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could eventually give us some more numbers regarding one of the depreciation in investment portfolio of BancWest and I would say not only the last quarter but the previous one also.</p>
          <p>Second the deferred bonuses that you are referring to in your presentation, I'm not sure I got the exact number you had to include in the last quarter that was not included in the third one. And when I look at the cost ratio of capital market, we are coming from a range between 40 to 50 in the first three quarter, we are at 62 in the fourth quarter, then obviously there was a one-off impact there and I wanted to quantify this one-off effect?</p>
          <p>The third question is on Ukraine, you were talking with optimism very recently but in my &#x2013; if my calculation are right, you have still 300 million left to provision there if there is still a target of 20% losses on your loan book?</p>
          <p>And the last when you were saying in the presentation that you were planning to issue medium, long-term less than the 38 billion you issued in 2009. Could you eventually give us some more precise number on these issues, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the last question &#x2013; I don't think there are, and I'm sorry the last question, the answer is no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the exact amount we are going to issue this year, yeah, we give the guidance that we've given last year, 38. We don't give another public number.  One of the reasons is that it will depend on market conditions and so we already have the &#x2013; it should be below 38, and that's the only indication we can give. And on the &#x2013; on deferred benefits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On deferred benefits we don't disclose the exact figures, because it's very difficult to &#x2013; a lot of different rules, confounding rules. Because first of all I would like to explain that on the third quarter we are a little change our accounting was deferred accounting, 50% only of the deferred compensation, which was new and the clear world at that time, the cost accounted in the third quarter, precisely in the third quarter. But, I mentioned is that &#x2013; coming back according to one more percent accounting was to differ naturally, it has a huge effect.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, as I mentioned also- we were very, very compliant during the last quarter to the G20 rules decreases, let's say the part allocated to the global basis, so it's very difficult to be exactly precise between the two additional what we can clearly explain is what we have written in the slide explaining not in this one, but in 28 I think two slides before. These are excluding that specific case of the accounting with the pre-tax income, which appear to be &#x20AC;400 million lower in first quarter is in fact in underlying condition higher. So, we can easily understand that the effect is more than 400 million.</p>
          <p>We don't want to disclose more high &#x2013; if you can make the figure exactly. And then that shows that concerning the cost income ratio you mentioned the cost income ratio was high in the first quarter due to the accretion reason. The fact is that the cost income ratio of BNP Paribas is much lower than our competitors, our message and our outlook is that it will continue to be lower than our competitors, but we don't want to out look any absolute figures in absolute terms, because we will see lots about the revenues and lots about the costs the costs depending on sort of the position of our competitors, as I mentioned before another question.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About Ukraine, the impact of the crisis has been much closer than any one could have, I would say focused it. It is clear that 2010 is going to be again a difficult year, this is why we are continuously adapting the &#x2013; to this new situation and this is the same for all the banking industry in this country. Let's say that over to the past &#x2013; may be the positive point is that the currency, let's say will stabilize and this can give some, let's say positive relief for the economy. 2010 is going to be again a difficult year and the bank has to be adapted for the future. So, BancWest I am afraid that we're not giving more information on the portfolio. Philip, so &#x2013; On that basis we are not giving additional information about the portfolio.</p>

          <p>We will now take our next question from Jon Peace of Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, everybody, I just wanted to address two final questions. Firstly on fixed income trading. I can understand you are not wanting to give a forecast, but I wondered if there is anyway you could give us a rough idea of how your fixed income revenues might have broken out in 2009 between the major area site credits and raised currency, so we can maybe have a bit more of an informed guess about the 2010 run-rate?</p>
          <p>And then the second question was just on the kind of group outlook, are you reasonably confident that the decline in the cost of risk as well as the growth in some of the more stable businesses is going to offset the cyclical decline in trading, so that we see some reasonable growth in EPS from the 520 you've done in 2009? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the fixed income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't disclose real rates for part of each part of the business line of fixed income. What I can explain is that we are specifically very strong in simple derivatives in enjoying strong interest rates, which are basic operation with clients, it will continue very strongly. And so, let's say, we are presumably confident about fixed income. If the client and I think it will be the case, will continue to issue bonds because when we issue bonds we have not only, let's say, the fees for bonds but we actually also to swap which comes with a bond issues normally and it seems to be -- to continue and specially when you see the big clients I mean insurance company and banks.</p>
          <p>We mentioned that our program of issuing bonds was lower than 38, but if you add all the needs of all the C clients, there are a lot of needs. So, as we are very well placed in that business, we have cautiously let's say positive about that type of trends and then we will see the market globally and so it's very difficult. On top of that, we also took commodities derivatives -- commodity derivatives which is we trust very well and we think it will continue to work very well, so all in all we think that to better align the business -- will be very strong in 2010. Naturally, probably to beat on that, we lower if the market is normalizing. If we see something, small crisis somewhere probably to be therefore we'll increase a bit of first price and that will increase. And so it's very difficult to make precise comment on that we will see quarter-after-quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of Group outlook, we are not huge that BNP Paribas' management to make any forecast. But I would still say that altogether we expect that the revenue grows altogether at group level, cost control and the trend although down in the cost of risk should make group profits this year higher than last year. That's what we're looking for.</p>
