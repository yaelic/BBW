          <p>Good morning and welcome to National Australia Bank's Interim Result for 2008. I'd like to welcome all of you here in the room, those on the phone and those watching via the webcast. Today's formalities will be, John will stand up shortly, give you an overview of our financial results as well as some comments around the operating environment. Mark Joiner will then deliver his maiden CFO analysis of the results and the details of the financials and then we will be taking Q&amp;As which I'll come back and chair.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'd like to hand over to John.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hany and good morning everyone. Last November, I said to you that all of our businesses were in great shape. Now that is still the case. Let me use this slide to show. You've got the Australian region, UK region, New Zealand and nabCapital. These are the March results, these are the equivalent results in '07 and you can see this is the improvement: 17, 5, 13, 10. But that's in Australian dollars. So if you really want to see how these businesses are performing I would argue, you should look at local currency. I mean if you look at local currency you see 17, 17, 14, 11. So they are in great position.</p>
          <p>Now, these are cash earnings. Let me make that clear. They have provisions in each business; they have funding costs in each business. The main thing that's not there is a higher liquidity cost which we hold at the corporate center. Let me just say a few words about each one of these. The Australian region, 17%, an excellent return. What we will do a little bit later though is breakout the Australian Bank into the business and private bank and the retail bank for the first time. So you will see how those banks are traveling. The turmoil that's gone in, gone on in financial markets has been much worse in the UK than it has here in Australia as you would know and if you look at the UK region at 17% in local currency, that is a great result.</p>
          <p>There is though a transfer of business from nabCapital to Australian -- from nabCapital to the UK region in that and so that's probably about 12, 13%. Now having said that in the UK with the disruption that's gone on, 12, 13% are probably one of the best performances in the UK and in fact Mark will show you a bit of peer comparison later which confirms that.</p>
          <p>You've probably seen many times that New Zealand market is challenging and against that 15% cash earnings increase is good. What I particularly like is this is six halves in a row that they have kept their cost flat. Why do I like that so much? Because the New Zealand economy is slowing and it's slowing pretty fast. So asset growth is going to more difficult to get there, for income is going to be more difficult and so a nice firm cost control is just what we need.</p>
          <p>And nabCapital has been in the eye of the storm in financial markets. What I want to highlight here is the underlying profit. Now underlying profit for six months, so the sequential is up 46%. On a 12 month basis underlying profit is up 60%. Clearly is brought down by bad and doubtful debts to end up there as 12% and that is mostly a collective provision that we have in respect of funding to our conduits. Now what's going to happen later is Mark is going to clarify our position, exactly what we have in our conduits and why we've chosen to take that collective provision. So all in all, the underlying businesses, the way the businesses are running &#x2013; not the external events, of course &#x2013; are very healthy, just as good as they were last November.</p>
          <p>So let me now put these results into context of the market disruption that we have been living through. Quite frankly, my view is this has been an extraordinary time. I have been in banking for 30 years and I have never seen anything like what we have just been through. I mean if you had said to me a year ago that trillion dollar markets like the term debt market or the RMBS securitization markets could almost close, I would have said it's impossible. In fact they wouldn't close for a day or two. But they've virtually closed for nine months, because that's exactly what's happened.</p>
          <p>Going into this crisis if you like, things were bad. Early on in this half it went from bad to worse in my situation. So let me just share with you what I was saying to my troops when we saw the market getting as tough as it was, because they all know that I am a keen sailor. So I likened them, and asked them to imagine themselves as being the crew of an offshore racing yacht. I reminded them that we have spend four years repairing the boat, getting it in fit condition because it wasn't fit in 2004 and getting it a match ready, and last year we were doing well. We saw what the boat could really do because we put in some great results last November.</p>
          <p>And then the storm hit, and it was a severe storm. Now I have been at sea, in a race when you get storms like that and what any sensible skipper does is he rigs the boat, he resets the boat if you like and what you do is concentrate on keeping the boat strong and keeping the boat safe and not on maximizing speed. And that's exactly what we've done in this half. We've reset our settings in the bank to keep the bank strong and not maximize earnings. That was the right thing to do. This has been a scary time we've been through I think you've got to keep the bank absolutely strong.</p>
          <p>Now, we had conservative settings as we went into this crisis. And I'll talk a little bit about that later. But when we realized how difficult the markets where getting, the team at the center Mark and I and the others took conscious decisions to take even more conservative settings. I mean we held huge levels of liquidity. We'll go through this in more detail later. We stuck to a funding plan no matter how difficult that was. This is our term funding plan; no matter how expensive that was getting. And there were times when every time you went out, it got more expensive.</p>
          <p>This is a time to be capital strong, and so we've allowed our ratios to start coming up to the top of our range, not in middle of the range. But importantly, we engaged with the businesses and we started to recalibrate the way the businesses where set. We asked them to concentrate much more on liabilities, especially deposits. To be very selective about asset growth and in some cases restrict it deliberately, and take a very prudent approach to provisions. These are the settings we've got currently, so if markets stay difficult and I'll talk about my opinion on that later, then we are well set. We are weathering the storm well; we will continue to weather it well. If on the other hand, markets ease, then we can ease some our settings and we can do more business. It's very dynamic.</p>
          <p>Now against that backdrop, I am very pleased with our group results which hopefully will come up in second, here we are. Cash around 8% in group level, our ROE as you can see is 16.8%, that's quite frankly less than what I would like it to be. Under the circumstances though, I'm satisfied. Our income is up just over 7 and our expenses are down 3%, and as you can see we're confident to increase our dividend by $0.02 sequentially and $0.10 over VCP.</p>
          <p>Let me just go back our income and our expenses. That's obviously a jaws of 10%. Now I just want to say, or go to how we've got into that position, because in 2004, when remember our costs were spiraling, and income was hard to get. It was very tempting for us just to kick-off yet another cost program. Goodness, NAB had done it many times. But many of us who've been around for while know exactly how those cost programs can go wrong. They work for a while and then eventually the costs bounce back and you end up in the same position you were.</p>
          <p>So we realized that what we did had to be sustainable and we started off by saying, because we were repairing the bank anyway, this had to work the way manufacturers work. It has to improve the customer experience and in our case, the banker experience. Now to do that you're going to have to remove inefficiency, you're going to have to remove clutter and take out the redundant processes. The other thing when you do that, is you need to embed into the culture, and that's really difficult. But if you don't do that, you are only going to hand up quite frankly with a quick fix.</p>
          <p>We've been at this since '05, so that's three years now and we're just about now, I think, getting to that tipping point where we're achieving the cultural embedding. In other words, this is the way things are done around here. I wanted to just give you one example which happens to be Australian Bank and they have a program that's been running since '05 called EQS which is Efficiency, Quality and Service. And you will see since we started this, what has happened to their expense line, their cost line &#x2013; it's almost flat.</p>
          <p>But more importantly, I mentioned to you this isn't about holding cost back, it's about improving efficiency, because quite frankly at 54.3 we were not efficient. All right? That was a fact of life and we have to do something about it in a sustainable way and we can see now we've got a very respectable 42.6% which is good. Now I mentioned earlier that what we are trying to do is pick up the lessons that manufacturers have been using for years. Now for a financial services company, I've got to tell you, that is a multi-year journey. We think we are really just at the start of it. We think we are approximately here. So we're at the stage of this tipping point of getting it embedded. Where we want to be is up here, where it is literally built in and all of the businesses are working on process improvement all the time.</p>
          <p>Now when you do this type of program, there is no silver bullet, right? So what underpins this in the Australian Bank is actually hundreds of projects all working on a customer improvement or a banker improvement. Let me give you some idea of that. When we looked at the process for our retail loans, it used to take six days to issue one. We've got that down to 36 hours. The drawdown used to take three days; it's now 24 hours. When we automated the bill rollover process we saved 50% of the bankers' time. So the reason we get our staff so engaged with this is it's doing something for the customer and it's doing something for the banker, and what we get is the costs fall out. The costs fall out because we improved the process on a sustainable basis.</p>
          <p>Every one of our businesses has a similar &#x2013; not identical, but a similar program and that is why we feel confident to give guidance to for the next 2.5 years to 2010 that we can keep our costs below inflation. And that is not stopping investing in the business, because over the last 2.5 years when we have done this, we have invested between 8 and $900 million a year. And that's what we are budgeting for the next 2.5 years. Roughly between 8 and 900 million a year and that is within the cost guidance that I am giving you.</p>
          <p>Now I said a second go I would talk about how I saw the market. Look, I think there is quite a bit of evidence that turmoil has eased somewhat in the last few weeks. But I would just caution you that we've seen this before. We've seen a few false dawns, especially last year. If you recall, things got better, debt markets started to open up, and crunch, it went away. So just remember how jittery the market is and how event driven the market is. You just need a big event and then you get the same emotion coming back into it.</p>
          <p>And a lot of it, in my opinion, will depend on what happens in the US. The US financial sector will determine really, how quick or slow any recovery is. And we've got to say, that one of the least effected places on the financial world was actually Australia. The Australian banking system has done really well, and I think we need to be pay tribute not only to the government but to the regulators, and the way that they've had a measured and appropriate response, as we've come through this crisis.</p>
          <p>Okay. So if there are no further major surprises &#x2013; I don't mean just banks coming out with what their write-offs are, but I mean major surprises &#x2013; I think we'll look back and we'll point to the bottom of the market as being the weekend of 15, 16 of March. And if you recall that was the weekend where the Fed in the US helped with the rescue of Bear Stearns.</p>
          <p>Another word of caution; I don't think there is going to be a V-shaped recovery, right. I think it's going to be a long slow recovery. It is going to more saucer shaped and is going to be a bumpy saucer at that, because if you look at the problems in those markets, you have to add to that inflationary pressure, which is happening globally now. Certainly, you are seeing it happen here in Australia. Also in Australia, the economy is starting to slow. So our outlook for the future and the way that, if you like, we are running the ship is that the future is uncertain. It could go either way. It could get a bit worse, and it could get a bit better. We are going to assume the worst just now.</p>
          <p>Now I mentioned early that before we even went into this crisis, we had conservative settings. Let me explain what I meant by that. As we started to repair the banks back in 2005, it was obvious to us that banking, certainly in Australia was as good as it was going to get. So there was no point in us repairing the bank and assuming that the boom times of the Australian economy was going to go on forever. So we started to prepare for more difficult times.</p>
          <p>Now I believe you can be successful in any conditions as long as you've got your settings right. You have got to get your company set up the right way. So what we did is we reviewed a lot of our credit exposures. We did this in '06, we did it again at the very beginning of '07, and we exited and we reduced a lot of exposures and I've got to tell you, I'm glad we did. We've dodged a few bullets since then that would've been a hit had we not.</p>
          <p>We also have not got tempted to boost our income by going for high risk and high margin business like credit cards, above system or low doc, low doc mortgages because the economy is booming, there is nothing to worry about. But perhaps the most important thing was the one I mentioned earlier. We invested heavily in people and we invested in the techniques to make sure we could get our cost base under control because if we got to tough times, that would the line that mattered most of all.</p>
          <p>Now you should be familiar with this slide. It's our five value drivers and I spoke quite a bit about this in November. The top box is strong revenue growth in our chosen segments and that's really about relationship-based capability. Now let me give you an example of what we mean by chosen segments because I guess about 18 months ago we said to you that we were taking this specialization that we used in Agri, and we were going to take it into healthcare, education and government. Now the capabilities I am talking about here are really two things. The iFS [integrated financial solutions] model that we've used in the UK and the specialization model that we've used here in Agri and it's a combination of both of those things. When you look at those three new businesses, we were in the businesses before, so what I am saying is what difference has specialization made. In revenue terms, healthcare is up 26% on the PCP. Education is up 34%. Government is up 38%.</p>
          <p>Second box here is sustainable expense base. I've spoken about that before. I won't repeat that other than to say, when the future is uncertain then asset growth is going to be more difficult to get, therefore income is going to be more difficult. I think it will still be there, but you certainly don't want heroic assumptions for your income. So keeping your costs well under control is a good position to be going into it.</p>
          <p>Capability and value-driven based investment. Let me just make this clear that our growth over the next year or three years in terms of cash earnings improving our ROE and I'll speak more about that in minute, will be done by organic means only. All right? So we are confident in our businesses the way they're set up. We do not need any M&amp;A activity, so if there is M&amp;A activity it is almost certainly going to be to accelerate organic growth.</p>
          <p>Now you'll know that we bought Great Western Bank in the UK (sic). Now, that transaction hasn't closed; it should close quite soon. It's traveling very well indeed, it is not experiencing any of the problems going on in the UK (sic). More importantly there are &#x2013; US &#x2013; sorry, I meant to say the US, our US team that are on the ground for Agri business are even more optimistic now about developing an Agri business there in the Midwest. Now again for the avoidance of doubt we can build that business in the Midwest, right in fact across the States without any other material acquisitions. We don't need more acquisitions to drive that business. If you think of the way an Agri business works, the banker comes to visit you in the farm. It's not done in the office or in your branch.</p>
          <p>Now, group-wide focus on ROE and disciplined capital management. If you just recall what I was saying to you few minutes ago about the techniques and the sustainability we've put in to expense management, we've now been doing the same thing on capital for a year. So you're not going to see much results over a year. We're just getting it in, getting the techniques in. But we will be using exactly the same techniques for the next few years on capital management which will come out as an improved ROE, and you should see a steady improvement in ROE, just in the same way as you've seen it in cost control and expenses.</p>
          <p>Now you know how our enthusiastic we are about talent management and therefore our management bench strength is something that's really important to us. And we're investing a lot of money and a lot of time into that even in these difficult times. And I'm going to tell you, personally very proud of our team and I think the almost 40,000 people who work for this group are just doing a wonderful job looking after our customers.</p>
          <p>So let me finish by saying, look I think the future's uncertain. We are hoping for the best but quite frankly we're planning for the worst. And I think that's the sensible thing to do just now, because it gives us flexibility. It means we've got tight cost control and tight credit settings. So if things stay bad, we're fine. We'll just keep weathering the storm, as we're doing just now. But if things ease up, as I said earlier we can release some of those settings and we can do even more business.</p>
          <p>Now, that makes me confident to say that this bank is strong and it can deal with any conditions that the market throws at us. And that's for three reasons really. One you saw on the first slide; all of our businesses are in great condition. Secondly, we've been weathering the worst storm in financial markets that I've ever seen, and weathered it well. Thirdly, we have the flexibility I've just spoken about. We have options for moving forward.</p>
          <p>So, on that note let me stop and hand over to Mark Joiner, who will take you through the results in more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everybody. It's my pleasure to take you through the results and disclosures in a little more detail and after that we will invite your questions.</p>
          <p>Before I get into the numbers, I wanted to pick up on some of the points that John had raised, and just give you a sense of how we're managing the business in the current environment, given that it's so substantially different to even when we stood here six months ago. And we can really capture it under these three themes; that we are managing the business tightly, we're being very conservative in our settings and very focused around our development priorities. So some of this you've heard but let me just summarize it for you.</p>
          <p>First of all as John said, we are really at a tipping point on cost and service and we are not going to let up at all in our focus on that front. We want to sustain the momentum we have, and push this over the tipping point into the DNA of the organization. So you can expect us to stay relentlessly focused on that front. And of course the jaws that creates between the revenue and the cost line for this bank will give us protection in the event where there is revenue softness to be dealt with.</p>
          <p>Secondly, re-pricing, I think everybody would acknowledge that the financial system has been mispricing risk for years. And we have got to get proper pricing for risk back into the system and we've got to fully recover the inputs. By our estimates, we incurred an extra $131 million in the first half and I think we probably only recovered about half of that.</p>
          <p>Now some asset classes present re-pricing opportunities earlier than others, but there are parts of our book that will come within range and we will move on for both these reasons to get our re-pricing back to a new equilibrium.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, on asset quality, I want you to be assured that we have done many deep dives into our asset portfolio. We've looked at commercial property, we've looked at credit cards, we've looked at conduits, we've looked at margin loans and we're finding nothing systemic in our portfolio at all. But that doesn't mean that we're about to declare victory on this. We're going to stay extremely vigilant on asset quality and adjust our business settings as we go along in response to what we learn and what we find.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on conservative settings and John touched I think on all of these points. We have significantly enhanced our liquidity. We're over 60 billion in liquidity holdings today. Of course, which comes at some cost to earnings but our priority at the moment is to keep the bank strong and optimize to the right hand side of the balance sheet, not the left hand side of the balance sheet and liquidity is a part of that.</p>
          <p>We entered this period with a very strong liability mix. There had been efforts over the last few years to link the maturity profiles and the like. We have continued to emphasis that. We're well placed on our liquidity raisings. We've been gaining share in customer deposits and we have also been as I'll show you strengthening the maturities even at the short end. So we're very comfortable on the funding side. We will continue to emphasis it and continue to strengthen it.</p>
          <p>And then you'll see in this result, we've moved generally to higher provisioning levels and we're moving towards the top of our capital ranges as well and that's were we intend to operate until conditions suggest that we should do something otherwise.</p>
          <p>And then finally around business development. We're coming to focus much more on the untapped potential within our business. As John talked about the extraordinary growth rates we're getting in our SME portfolio in Australia through specialization, just one example of that. And so our emphasis is very much around the latent potential thus far under-tapped in our franchises. And we are seeing new ways to monetize customer relationships. And that is firmly our focus.</p>
          <p>We're in the mode of supporting our core customers. We're being selective about new customers that we allow to come on to our balance sheet and there are a lot because particularly at the institutional end there's a lot of desire to move back to bank balance sheets. And we're focused on which customers will be of long-term franchise value. So we're staying away from opportunistic situations.</p>
          <p>And finally as John said we are really elevating ROE in our focus. We're starting see teams form in the businesses. We've got a good view over the next two to three years of what we can get on the capital side and we will run that much like we run the cost process. And we've been armed with a deep dive this year that's going right down to micro levels in channels and products and we know exactly where the lazy capital is in the organization and we will work to deal with that.</p>
          <p>Okay. Let me quickly then go through the results at the aggregate level. As John foreshadowed, we have a net operating income on a PCP basis growing at 7.1%. That's on a reported basis. On a pre-FX basis and I'll take you through this in a minute, it's actually 10.1%. So if you want a sense of what the underlying businesses are actually doing, it's just over 10% in revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Our operating expenses fell 3%, again on a FX basis they're pretty much flat. So you're seeing quite marked foreign exchange effects there, but obviously being flat is an outcome we're proud of. That gives an underlying profit growth of 18%. We have an 86% increase in BDD and we'll take you through the specifics of that a little later flowing down to a cash earnings on ongoing operations increase of 8%.</p>
          <p>And then just some of the key statistics at the bottom there, our RWA growth at 16.3% actually spread reasonably evenly between the two six-month periods, so we're not seeing any slowing on the asset side. Our cash ROE is up on a PCP marginally, down sequentially because of some particular mix issues and there you have the increased funding cost at the bottom stated gross at 131 million.</p>
          <p>This gives you a pictorial view of the jaws in the business and really there are two takeaways from this. One, that we are sustaining very healthy jaws; and the second that these jaws have been increasing through time. So if you take the equivalent periods in '06, '07 and '08, so we're taking the half 106 versus half 105, we had 9.8% revenue growth, 6.3% expense growth, 3.5% jaws. A year later 6.7% jaws and a year later whether you look it on our pre- or a post FX basis 10.1% jaws. So we're getting momentum in our business on the revenue side far outweighing the equally important positive of holding our flat &#x2013; costs flat on the other side. And you will see our group banking cost to income ratio falling at precipitous rate: 54.4, 51.8, 47.0 and we're not finished on that. Now I don't want anybody to extrapolate from these numbers and assume that we are going to be having negative or no cost growth over the year. We're still confirming our guidance that our cost growth will be at or below inflation and so I don't want people to get too carried away with one data point.</p>
          <p>Just to show that the cost disciplines are widely held across the group, what you see here is for the last four halves for each of our four businesses, that in the three traditional banking businesses flat costs and falling cost to income ratios. John showed you the Australian story. It's equally true in New Zealand moving from 54 to 47.8 and the UK 60 down to 58.3 with flat costs, despite substantial investment in feeding the growth in the iFS business. In nabCapital we have got a slight rise in costs over recent periods because we are consciously investing in people and systems capabilities, many of which have actually borne fruit for us in the current volatility as you will see. But nabCapital has won the race to the first business into the 30s in cost to income with a 36% cost to income ratio.</p>
          <p>This cost outcome is achieved without succumbing to the temptation to short-term the business. We are maintaining our investment. This slide gives you a sense of the investment spend over the last three halve. Now the first half '08 is a lower spend, 343 million. We are still expecting for the full year to come into the 8 to $900 million range that we have indicated is the level we feel allows us to sustain the business with a healthy level of reinvestment.</p>
          <p>And you will see that while there's still some regulatory spend around Basel II and anti-money laundering, increasingly it's efficiency in customer-facing systems that are getting the spend. So we will &#x2013; as is normal, we have a skew towards the second half and we will have a higher level of investment spending in the second half.</p>
          <p>There's been some interest in IT spending recently. We have been working on our group IT strategy and we'll be announcing that strategy later this year. But and that could be a very substantial spent, 800 million or a billion dollars. But it is our intent and it's an important point that we will accommodate that spend within this run rate. So we will clarify that as we come to announce the strategy, but the intent is to accommodate the re-platforming within this 800 to $900 million annual spend that we are operating at.</p>
          <p>John showed you this slide, so I won't spend any time on it, just showing the regional results in Australian dollars and at the local level. Now &#x2013; so that says at the local level we have a 16.2% cash earnings contribution. I just wanted to show how we get from that down to an 8% result, so you understand what are the differences and it really comes down to these six things. First of all the currency effects on the business units earnings, we don't hedge our US dollar and sterling exposures in particular, was a $43 million cash earnings drag. That's a policy. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose on currency and in this environment it's a negative. It has the potential of course to contribute the other way.</p>
          <p>Our additional liquidity holdings &#x2013; this is just the increment &#x2013; have cost us $33 million in cash earnings and they will remain as long as it's sensible but there is the potential to wind them back at an appropriate stage. And we have consciously stepped up our spend in business development at the center. And I'll take you through some of the focus for that spend, so that's $14 million, another 0.6.</p>
          <p>And than other than that, the distributions have risen; partly rate and partly volume around hybrids and the like. The IROE in this environment has gone negative from 21 positive contribution in the prior period to a nine negative in the current given what's happened to equity markets. And then the central function's 33 is actually more about things that happened in March '07 such as some gains that were realized that didn't recur. The actual cost base of the group head office is flat.</p>
          <p>So that give you a sense of how you step from the 16.2 down to the 8.0 and hopefully that provides a roadmap for that.</p>
          <p>As to bad and doubtful debts, in large part in a business as usual sense we're not seeing anything. As we get into talk about asset quality you'll see that we are seeing tiny, tiny changes in the quality of the assets in the underlying portfolios. And the result we have is a very situational result. That's not to say that asset quality will be sustained forever in the underlying portfolios, but it's not showing through in any respect at the moment.</p>
          <p>So we've operated over the last couple of halves at about 400 million. If you regarded as BAU this part, we'd be at 465, although this 400 does include some of the big name companies that have got into particular difficulties that you been reading about. There are some provisions in here for there. And then on top we have two situations. One is an $80 million provision against the Allco [Finance Group] margin loan, where we have since disposed of the security and realized just less than $10 million of a gain, so that $10 million will be coming back in the second half. And then 181 million we've taken against the standby loans we provide to the conduit facilities and I'll take you through that in the nabCapital section.</p>
          <p>BDDs in the UK, still a marginal positive trend and immaterial change in New Zealand as well; although we are seeing some more uptick in the underlying metric there. So that's the picture on BDDs.</p>
          <p>Just to deal with a few more things at the Group level. This is on the asset quality side in aggregate. I apologize for the busyness of the slide but it brings out a lot of things you're used to seeing in the presentation. I'd really like to just point out three things on here.</p>
          <p>One is this total 90-day past due and gross impaired assets as a percentage of GLA. This is a continuing upward trend. You won't be able to read it off the scale, but the points there actually move from 0.58 to 0.68 between these two periods. However, if we put aside the one-offs, what I was talking about, the big name companies that have got themselves into particular difficulties in this period. The underlying rise in this line is only three basis points, from 0.58 to 0.61. So that's an indication of what we are seeing in the underlying portfolios.</p>
          <p>And then just to touch on two other things. As John said we are now at $3 billion of provisioning, which is the largest in Australian Banking industry. And there are total provisions as a percent of GLA has risen from 0.59 to 0.71%. So we are starting to feel a lot more comfortably provisioned on the balance sheet. And then I know it's a lag indicator but if you look down here to what's going on in write-offs, we are actually seeing nothing happening on the write-offs front at this stage.</p>
          <p>Okay to the important issue of funding and liquidity, I said already that we entered with a strong liability structure. What we use internally to measure how we are going is the stable funding index, which puts customer deposits and term funding with more than 12 months to go as a percentage and our ratio has stayed above 70% over all of the last four halves. We are very comfortable with that. In terms of the term funding program, we have completed $16 billion of our term funding to March and another billion since. So indicating 11 billion for the second half, which is ahead of where we were last year, in terms of our -- at that point in terms of our term funding program.</p>
          <p>In addition and not counted in here, we have raised $4 billion of 12-month funding, so we are not mixing 12-month funding with real term funding and a further 4 billion in the six to 12-month part of the curve. These are parts of the curve we have not traditionally tapped in any volume and the effect has been to lengthen our short-term maturities as well as sustain our ratio on long-term maturities. So our average short-term maturity at issuance is now 113 days. It was 105 days prior.</p>
          <p>This first half of funding has been done at an average of 4.2 years maturity and at 57 basis points over BBSW [Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate], whereas traditionally we would be paying 12. Our estimate for next year is $27 billion funding requirement. That actually assumes fairly healthy growth rates in assets. Under some scenarios where we see slower asset growth, that number could be as low as $19 billion and we will see as we go forward exactly what that is, but it's in that range of 19 to 27.</p>
          <p>And then on the liquid asset side, traditionally carrying 29 billion, we brought that up immediately that the situation changed and have since increased it to 58 billion. And we have now done an internal securitization of mortgage assets as many of our peers have done of 8 billion, which will go to 11 billion over the next few weeks. So we will have 11 billion in that repo-able form. So we feel very comfortable on this. As John said, we feel like we've passed the bottom and the term funding markets are going to be more active going forward, so we feel very comfortable with this situation.</p>
          <p>Then on the capital front, just dealing with ACE and Tier 1. Underlying, our ACE ratio and Tier 1 ratios have come down slightly 4.9 to 4.61; 6.67 to 6.51. Those things are really non-core. It's to do with Great Western Bank goodwill and a different treatment for an internally generated wealth profit, which we've discussed publicly before. We have accrued in to these numbers the DRP participation in the mid-40%, and we will underwrite the DRP, specifically to bring us &#x2013; this is on a pro forma basis, once it's executed in July &#x2013; back to the top of our ratio on Tier 1. And of course we continue to work towards Basel II accreditation, which while we're not in a position to provide any accurate estimates of the impact, we think would substantially nevertheless improve this picture. So, we will hopefully get that clarified before we stand here with the September results.</p>
          <p>So we're feeling very good on the capital side and I'd like to finish the Group discussion and then turn to the businesses by just giving you a sense of what we're doing on the business development front. I said we were spending $14 million more and it's really focused around these three areas.</p>
          <p>First of all, on the Agri side, our priority in Agri is to make Great Western a success and to lever off that in organic terms to develop an Agri franchise in the Midwest, so we are funding some efforts around that. Even though we haven't taken possession of Great Western, they already have well developed plans for Agri centers and interestingly iFS centers as well, so we have teams working there as well as thinking about how to lever off it organically. The group has been encouraging the rollout of iFS across the regions. Really the group is stepping back from that now and the regions are taking over and iFS has already been launched in Australia particularly in the specialty lines and by the end of this financial year for us, will also be in a position to be launched in New Zealand. So we are really testing the transferability and adaptability of those capabilities.</p>
          <p>Secondly, while the businesses have their own momentum on costs, the group is at pains to support those. So we have formed a service company. This is not a massive recentralization of back offices back to the group center; it's a service company that I chair, and all of the business units CEOs are Directors of. It will be by attraction, so it will orchestrate, it will facilitate, it will be a center of excellence. In some cases it may operate. It will oversee our outsourcing contracts and so forth. And it will become the vehicle through which some of our higher cost to income businesses can benefit directly from the scale of our lower cost to income businesses. So that will be one way to sustain and even accelerate our cost performance. And the group is also supporting the embedding in the culture of the cost capabilities through supporting the NAB academy. A substantial part of its training agenda will around the way we approach systems improvement and the like.</p>
          <p>And then finally, the group is also incubating nabInvest. You will have seen that nabInvest has made a couple of small investments in the asset management side. The mandate at nabInvest is very much to exploit unique origination capabilities that we have in the group and turn them into product that we can feed to very strong wealth distribution. So it's happening between the businesses, drawing all sorts of origination opportunities and matching them with distribution strength. So it's &#x2013; all of this is really planning in the gaps if you like and helping to fill out the connectedness and the sort of mutual support that the various businesses in the portfolio have the potential to offer to each other.</p>
          <p>Okay. Let me turn then to the four businesses. First of all, Australia Banking; here, I've given you the '07-'06 as well as the '08-'07 just to show you that the momentum is being sustained. In fact we have acceleration in net operating income growth to 11.4%. Again, strong performance on the cost side over a PCP rising only $2 million, giving us tremendous leverage at the underlying profit line with a 21.5% growth for the Australian bank. This numbers of course, include at the bad debts line the $80 million for Allco, which nevertheless still leaves the business generating a 16.8% underlying profit. You'll see lower down there NIM at 2.36 which is completely explained by the funding headwind and in actual fact we are very, very happy with what is a very stable NIM situation in this business being extended another period, and cost to income we've already discussed.</p>
          <p>Under pressure from the analyst community we have decided to, for the first time reveal BPA versus retail bank. I think this very quickly shows just the strength of the BPA business within this franchise. Just taking one period the change on March '07 of 14.8% growth in revenue, there's actually a 17% growth in volumes underlying that. Operating expenses rose only marginally 1% giving us 24.5% growth over PCP of the underlying profit line. This business picked up the Allco expense. Minus Allco, its bad debts are up about $10 million and even with Allco the cash earnings growth is 18.2%. So we take great comfort from the strengths of this franchise and its incredible momentum and the additional momentum we're starting to see come through in the lines of specialization.</p>
          <p>Secondly then on the retail banking side. We actually have in the March '07 numbers for retail, 23 million from the sale of MasterCard, which is inflating the comparative, so it's reporting 6.4% net operating income growth. In reality underlying, it's more like 8%. It actually contracted its cost base by 1%, underlying profit including the MasterCard effect 15.7 and a slight uptick in the bad and doubtful debts, but that's more to do with what happened in March '07 with some provision adjustment than it is about any underlying uptick in the asset quality metrics.</p>
          <p>In fact 90-day past dues are up one basis point in this business over PCP, and two-thirds of the 90-day past due are mortgages where our long run loss rate is one to two basis points. So we are really not seeing anything come though there. At the bottom line 13.9% I think taking MasterCard out, it's more like 16 or 17% underlying growth. So this is no laggard either. The retail bank is also performing extremely well.</p>
          <p>Just a sense of volumes and shares, it's a little hard to get reliable share data, I am sure you know around BPA, but our estimate is that we have grown volumes 8% sequentially and 17% as I said PCP which is faster than we believe the credit in the sector has grown. We are also taking share in payments in every sub category of customer, segmenting by customer size which of course brings very attractive deposit volumes with it as well and high margin.</p>
          <p>On the deposit side, we emphasized deposits about 18 months ago and had terrific momentum coming into this troubled period on deposits, where we passed a competitor to become the number two retail deposit-holding bank in Australia and it continues to be an area of focus. As I say, with as much emphasis on the payment side as there is on just attracting deposits per se.</p>
          <p>On the housing side we have been losing some share. That's been conscious. We are not running this business to win in every segment. In the proprietary channels where we believe all the profitability is, we've been growing at or above system depending on which period you take and in the broker and introducer, which by the way we think has an order of magnitude higher contribution to 90-day past dues and bad and doubtful debts, we have been significantly below system. So we're comfortable with what we are taking off the table on the housing side.</p>
          <p>On the Australian Bank NIM, it's really three things to point to here. One, this is over a 12 month period of course. There was price competition through the period particularly in the first 6 months. This 0.6 (sic) [0.06] shows that competition net of re-pricing that we've been able to do in this segment. You will see that our NIM on deposits actually grew. We are not competing on price to bring in deposits. We are trying to do it in more intelligent ways. Deposits have been growing faster than assets. So we're getting a positive effect from that and this is the funding headwind that this business incurred, which net-net accounts for all of the diminishment in NIM and as we progress with re-pricing we will begin to eat further into that.</p>
          <p>And then on MLC obviously the wealth management businesses in the industry were hit hard by the substantial change in equity markets. Nevertheless we're very pleased with a) how MLC handled the situation and b) competitively how that sees MLC emerge. So on the net income side MLC did have reduction, 677 down to 646 that responded extremely well on the expense side taking $35 million out of its expense base in this period for a sequential this is 9.4% reduction in its expenses. So at the cash earnings pre-IROE was actually able to hold the line and generate as much profitability as it had in the boom period of the prior six months.</p>
          <p>IROE as I said earlier has gone negative, from 21 PCP down to negative 9. The funds under management are still healthy at 106 billion. We had 4.5 billion of net flows in this last period although two of that was institutional and will probably flow out again. But nevertheless was still strong on the net flows here. And then down below just splitting it between investments and insurance you can see that insurance contributed by having a particularly strong period through here, and both of these continued to benefit from increase cross sell through the Australian Bank where the profit margins on the fund side and particularly on the insurance side are substantially higher. So, as we grow that cross sale is just averages of the profitability of the volumes that we get in these businesses.</p>
          <p>Now competitively the MLC guys get very excited when we get into volatile or bear markets, because they believe in the flight to quality. And we are seeing that; their flagship Number Four Horizon Fund is now in the top quartile of performance over one months, three months, 12 months, three year performance and that's an indication of how MLC tends to lag in boom markets because it doesn't narrowly deploy its assets. It believes in greater diversification. And as we've got into more difficult times that diversification is carried out the top in performance.</p>
          <p>We are also seeing high quality advisors realizing at the end of the bull market, it's a good time to shift from commissions-based environment to a fee-for-service based environment, and so we are starting see quality advisors come across to this franchise. So we feel very good about how MLC has handled the situation and how it's set up to compete going forward.</p>
          <p>Okay. On nabCapital, the nabCapital result is really characterized by two things in the main. One is tremendous strength on the revenue side. You'll see as we get into it, a great contribution from the market sales and trading. We have been investing in people and systems capabilities and they were set up superbly to benefit from the volatility that we experienced. And that has really driven a strong result at the operating income &#x2013; the net operating income line. We are investing in this business so its expense growth is 5.4 on a PCP and 6.6 for the prior, as we are adding FTEs and adding capabilities. So underlying profit up 59.6% on a PCP versus 28% for the same period the prior year. This is the business that's pick up the bad and doubtful debt expense, because it is all triggered by the impact of the volatile liquidity situation on certain corporate structures, but nevertheless nabCapital has managed to deliver a bottom line of 373, which is a 10.4% growth in Aussie dollars. As I've said 3.6 cost to income and the RORWA is affected by fairly substantial funding of conduits at very low margins, and so that's averaging down that result.</p>
          <p>Just to unpick the revenue side, you'll see here the PCP revenue and then the extension of that in the lines of business. This market sales really the represents the cross sell with the SME portfolio and we did see a lot more cross selling out of the SME base as business owners realized they had risks they needed to manage in the volatile condition, be they currency or interest rate or whatever. And then armed with being able to build the positions that their customer flow created and armed with their technology and teams, they did an excellent job in managing those positions for gain over the period. So this is not a lot &#x2013; this is not proprietary trading. This is managing the positions created by customer demand. So there is no substantial change in our approach to risk or the amount of risk we take in this business.</p>
          <p>We have some gain in structuring and investments in part from mark-to-market gains in our capital management activities; in particular CDS. But the unrealized mark-to-market gains have about a $30 million impact on this result. So, you're not seeing low quality earnings here but a whole bunch of things that are going to unwind in future periods. It's about a $30 million effect and of course we manage those actively and in some cases, we'll realize the gains and so forth so.</p>
          <p>And then on the institutional lending side a number of Australian banks have had a purple patch in lending. We have been little bit more restrained, probably growing at about half the rate of ANZ and Westpac in the last six month period. But we are of course getting substantial re-pricing as facilities mature. And about one-sixth of facilities mature every six months, so we will progressively eat our way through that backlog.</p>
          <p>Okay, with respect to the BDD, we obviously had a very benign period combined with a shrinking of the asset base back here in September '05 through September '06, then had a return to some level of bad and doubtful debts through here. And this period we really have three things, we have two particular corporate exposures, which have resulted in $84 million of provisioning here and the 181 that we took against the conduits. Now conduits are not something we've talked about very much in the past. The main reason being that the bank actually doesn't own the conduits, they are owned by trusts and they are not reported in any of our accounts. But obviously, as we now find ourselves substantially funding this things, they are more relevant.</p>
          <p>So I just wanted to give a bit of context about them. Conduits are vehicles used by many large banks, consistent with the originate-warehouse-distribute model to bring corporate customers and facilitate their access directly to commercial paper markets. That results in lower cost to customers and it is efficient from a bank point of view because they attract no capital. The way that you get conduits going is that you typically buy assets into conduits to seed them and give them volume so you can get the commercial paper going, and then you originate into them and eventually your own originated assets outweigh the purchased assets. So let me then you give you a snapshot of the NAB conduits.</p>
          <p>First of all we're funding our conduits to about $9 billion. I think last time we reported we said it was 5.7 and the feasible range was anything up to about 10.5. So this number fluctuates depending on what's going on in commercial paper issuance. And nabCapital is working hard to increase the commonality and transparency of underlying asset pools to continue to maximize the extent to which the commercial paper funding of the conduits contributes. On the assets side, if you look in to the NAB conduits what you have is really two sets of assets. You have $9 billion of NAB-originated investment grade assets that are indistinguishable from other things in our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>You have $5 billion of purchased assets that were put there to seed the conduits in the way that I was describing. These purchased assets after recent credit rating reviews are 80% of AAA, AA and are no issue are far as we are concerned. 20% or ten particular purchased assets were downgraded. If you remember Standard and Poor said in December that they were entirely comfortable with their methodology and didn't plan any changes and then at the end of January they announced 5000 downgrades and ten of our instruments were included in those downgrades.</p>
          <p>The downgrades, therefore statistically drive some provisioning against the quality of the standby lines as an asset in our balance sheet. Now the models suggested that we should take a $56 million provision based just statistically on the credit ratings of the underlying securities. Our response was to do a forensic deep dive into this portfolio and make sure we understood it at the individual credit level, down below, which we have done. And that review showed to us that all the contractual obligations of the underlying credits are being met. Secondly these are in a hold-to-maturity environment, not a mark-to-market environment and many have a decade or more to run. And so they look to us to be in good credits for a very long period of time. And also within these portfolios there are various protection mechanisms that exist. So, there are people who have taken first losses. There are insurance wrappers. There is, for example 250 million of cash collateralization and so forth.</p>
          <p>So we've weighed all of that and stress test the assumptions and put some fairly bleak assumptions into the models. And therefore, decided to take the 181 as opposed to the 56 million that was indicated at the first pass. So that is how we have decided to do that. And the idea is to take a strong provisioning position that protects our balance sheet against whatever may come out of these in a credit sense in the future and of course we're now shifting to an active management of the situation rather than a passive. And we're finding opportunities to mitigate our risk in this respect.</p>
          <p>Okay. Moving on then to the UK. The UK net operating income grew. We're very proud actually of the UK result, because the UK was by far the most affected market in the current conditions. In particular it was very, very difficult to re-price assets in that market. So the basis risk and then the wholesale funding costs were a significant headwind. But net operating income grew 4.4%, expenses were flat and the underlying profit result was 11.4% higher.</p>
          <p>We're seeing continued improvement on the BDD side in part because of the migration in our portfolio mix. So at the cash earnings level, we have 17.8% bottom line result. Just to be completely transparent we also transferred &#xA3;2 billion of customers -- customer assets from nabCapital to the UK in this period which inflates this -- inflates all these numbers but the 17.8 would be 13.1 without that transfer. So we still think it's a very creditable result in the UK market to deliver 13.1% bottom line growth. NIM has continued to come down but I think there's actually a positive story in NIM, which I'll show you a minute and the cost to income ratio, we discussed a little earlier.</p>
          <p>This is just the comparison between the UK business &#x2013; this is on now on a cash earnings before tax basis, where it's a 12.1% growth against the peers. And we don't call them Lloyds, HSBC and the like because what we actually do is disaggregate those banks and try and put them on a like-for-like basis. So we wouldn't like to say its Lloyds or anybody else because you won't recognize it in the published numbers. But nevertheless the bank for the second reporting period running that we've been presenting this way is clearly at the top end of UK banking performance and substantially ahead of some others.</p>
          <p>This is the NIM picture in that the decay in NIM has of course been one of the issues that we are &#x2013; that we have been dealing with reflecting the portfolio mix. Now in fact, the NIM has gone: 3.41, 3.16, 2.96, 2.66. That's the reality of the situation. In September '07 the basis risk started to contribute to this decline. In March '08 the basis risk and the transfer in of the nabCapital assets, which were at a much lower spread as we think those customers are going to be much better managed in an iFS environment and we will improve their performance. But nevertheless they're averaging down this number.</p>
          <p>So if we look at the adjusted performance for the NIM: down 25, down 15, down 12 and we actually see it coming in for a soft landing around peer levels. So we feel comfortable with the way that is traveling. And of course the UK Bank is now redoubling its efforts on re-pricing, in fact UK mortgages on the front book, are at least 80, sometimes 100 basis points more attractive than on the back book. So as we write new business, we average our returns up.</p>
          <p>And then finally on the portfolio mix side, iFS has now grown to be almost 40% of revenue. The retail bank is also at about 40% of revenue. The retail bank grew in line actually with the system in the UK which was very soft. iFS of course is growing much faster than the system and there was a sale I think of a leasing business in here which is part of the clean up of the portfolio. So in terms of these two businesses we are pretty much in balance now with iFS continuing to grow quickly.</p>
          <p>On New Zealand, New Zealand a very creditable result in a tough environment as we have said many times. We have some slowing in the revenue growth, I think reflecting in part the conditions in that economy, but continued real strength on the cost side with costs actually falling 3 million half to half, our underlying profit is up 11%. We are seeing really nothing on the BDD line. The 90-days past dues I think went from 13 basis points to 22 which is quite a significant increase but it still substantially below Australia which is at 33 basis points, so it's heading in the wrong direction, but in absolute terms it's still very good. And you would probably seen yesterday some announcements around unemployment and the like shifting quite markedly. So there is definitely a negative trend there, but it's not really showing up substantially yet either in our portfolio and certainly not therefore in our provisioning. A very solid performance on the NIM and the cost-to-income ratio continues to fall.</p>
          <p>And then just highlighting here both the jaws of this business with the growth in revenues relative to the flat costs over quite a long period of time and to give you sense of the focus of management in this business. Lots of incremental innovative contributions on the revenue side, in particular the "out of the box" banking which has driven much more a substantial cross sale within the branches. Beginning to think about the branches as a merchandising opportunity and retail opportunity as much as service center. New Zealand probably led the way originally and continuous to innovate around simplification. The Kaizan capabilities, process reengineering and at the same time delivering the highest New Zealand banking satisfaction and the best call center in New Zealand. So, just showing that process reengineering and product and process simplification actually has attendant customer and staff benefits at the same time. And the New Zealand organization has also achieved a marked shift in culture and engagement, which is something we are very proud of.</p>
          <p>So I'd like to conclude by coming back to where I started and that is just giving you a sense and reiterating how we are managing this business. We're managing very tightly under these conditions. We're very focused on re-pricing and getting back to an equilibrium pricing for risk and for input costs. We're pushing to institutionalize our cost capabilities for the benefits at the cost line and the customer and staff line and we're active management of asset quality, very watchful, adjusting our settings where we feel that is appropriate.</p>
          <p>On the group settings, we're going maintain the liquidity and the contingent liquidity as long as it's sensible. Of course we can change these any time if we feel we've moved into a different environment, but we're going to focus on the right hand side of the balance sheet, high liquidity, emphasis on deposits, funding and importantly payments where we are getting real traction, and solid funding and capital ratios, with Basel II coming in over the top hopefully in the next six months.</p>
          <p>And then clear development priorities, we're going to grow in and around our main franchises. We're going to support our core customers, but still realizing that in difficult periods market shares are more fluid than they are in boom periods and so we will mindful to take share in segments that we particularly cover. And we're going to elevate the ROE focus and make that a real widely held discipline within the organization as John foreshadowed.</p>
          <p>So overall, it's a pleasing result. We have very good momentum in the underlying businesses. We're seeing nothing on the asset quality that's systemic. We have very healthy jaws that we believe gives us protection in the event that anything is slower. We feel strong, we feel well-provisioned and we look forward very much to the second half.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much. And we'd like to invite your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. It's James Ellis here from Credit Suisse. Just a question on your outlook for the bad debt charge in the UK. Obviously you've had a very good outcome in the half you've just reported but given there is obviously going to be lag of a slowing UK economy feeding through to your bad debt charge, is there some risk that that'll eventually lead to a substantially higher charge than we're seeing now? And within that, what components of the book are you most focused on as being risky areas at the moment?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mark, mentioned a few minutes ago that we've done some deep dives and it wouldn't surprise you to know that when we saw the situation developing in the UK, we've been looking harder at the underlying credit quality there. Right now, of course, we expect it because we're going from pretty well lows. To get a bit worse -- nothing that's worrying us just now, because if you look at the mix of our UK business, we took that hit a couple of years ago on really terrible lines of secured lending. And that drove all of our ratios at quite high levels. So the UK is still historically sitting at quite a high level. It is just that there is less of that stuff coming through. That's dropping out and it is tending to really level. I mean the UK over last six months were pretty well flat. Do you want to talk to that, Mark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, one area of focus that people have is around the UK commercial property exposures. Particularly, growing in an iFS environment you tend to attract that sort of business more easily. So, we've had a very good look at that. A number of commentators have said that UK commercial property prices have already fallen 15 or 20% and we are not seeing any stress in our portfolio. And in fact if you segment it, the problem tends to be inner city apartments and speculative development, which is not something we have in our in our portfolio. Ours is much more cash flow lending, high quality retail tenants, and affordable housing developments, and the like. So we just feel very comfortable about the UK property portfolio the way things are today.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Wondering if you still had it. Just perhaps I can start by asking, put your hand up if you want John's job, but there's been quite a bit of press commentary and statements by the company with respect to succession. Could you provide some clarity for us on the succession issues within the group? Perhaps a comment from Ahmed [Fahour, Executive Director &amp; Chief Executive Officer, Australia] about his own ambitions? It's just a little unclear from some of the things I have been reading and I haven't heard anything straight from Ahmed. And does it all fit with the Groups' ambitions in terms of restoring Group returns and being a truly competitive organization again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Craig. Let me take that one, straight on. We have invested a lot of time and money in talent management and in succession planning. And we have told you that in the past; you can see an example of succession planning sitting right next to me. So, Mark Joiner came into the organization, we trained Mark up, and Mark has taken over from Michael [Ullmer] who is still in the team and so you've seen one of the key jobs with a seamless baton pass. And we do that for all of our top jobs, right? And that will include my job.</p>
          <p>So, at a time that the Board think is appropriate, then guess what guys, they're going to tap me on the shoulder and say maybe in six months John you should be doing a bit more sailing. That will depend on two things probably, when they think that there is a person that they have chosen and they have a choice; and I very much hope, Craig, it will be an internal appointment -- pretty confident it will be -- and the other thing would be the markets. All right. So in other words they will want to hand over when things are reasonably stable, so that it is seamless baton pass just the way I have suggested.</p>
          <p>So, look, will I be here in five years, Craig, I hope not, I think I'll be doing something else by that time. But I hope it's going to be something that you will look back on and say, "That was done well."</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>James Freeman, Goldman Sachs JBWere. I just had two questions, firstly just on the 74 million provision you have take below the line, just wanted to get an idea whether that has been included as in your cost guidance of below inflation? And then the second one &#x2013; I'll just put them all out there now &#x2013; just the 214 million provision again below the line, just wanted to some commentary around how that will actually be impacting the cash earnings in future years? Will you be expensing all bad debts through the cash line and not touching this 214 million, bit confused as to how that's working?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, on the business development provision, which is the first you mentioned, that is a below the line treatment because it's not part of BAU at all. But since we &#x2013; and therefore it's legitimate to separate it and not treat it as part of our guidance. I am sure when we get a couple of periods in, given that that spend by the way will be over the next 2.5 years or so, I am sure there will be enough room between the cost performance we deliver and inflation for you to treat it any way you like and we'd still be within our guidance.</p>
          <p>Then as to the 214 million bad debt provision, again that's a provision taken for what may be in the portfolio that we can't see. So it's legitimate treated below the line. If ever we use that provision or bring it back to profits we will do so below the line.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Matt Davison from Merrill Lynch. My question was on the very strong cost result you've delivered. If we have a look at your FTEs [Full-Time Employees], they are still increasing about 1% and you have seen your personnel costs fall. So I guess one of the outcomes of many of the programs you've implemented is a lower cost per head across the staff base. So just wondering if you could give a bit more color on how that's being achieved, given the sort of backdrop of salary growth around 4%? And then within that maybe a comment on the nabCapital business, because that probably had the greatest gap between revenue growth and what flowed through to the cost line in terms of variable pay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start off with the people part. Look we've discussed in the past about our average cost per FTE appear high. We've told you that would take us some time to work on that. I mean part of it is changing the mixture, which does take years between fixed remuneration, and remuneration that's at risk, and you eventually get the benefit of that. The other thing that has been happening there, but not to a huge extent, but we have been offshoring. We've been public about how we are doing that. And that's helped that line as well; and Ahmed, do you want to comment on that a little bit more? Have we got a microphone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's &#x2013; excuse me I am not standing up, I apologize; I've just got a small back problem. That happened because I missed a certain cost number for John but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was at 0.9%. He doesn't like that, Scottish.</p>
          <p>I think John pretty much summarized the exact answer, which was around a combination of mix and so forth, but also I just want to remind people that in the earlier years, we were actively recruiting and building up our talent. And when you build up your high quality talent, you tend to have a lot of one-off costs that you build into your personnel line that you don't get time and time again. And so some of those costs are gone.</p>
          <p>The other part of it has also been that we've been in very heavy investment mode over the last three years. We've spent $1.3 billion and some of that has involved bringing in a lot of contractors on, to help us through with a number of these very important infrastructure and compliance-related projects. The most fantastic situation is for us now is that as time goes we have less and less need to do these items and more and more our own people can take that on. And I think that's going to be hallmark of the years to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ahmed, would you pass microphone along to John Hooper, who can comment about nabCapital; nabCapital has had an outstanding half in terms of income. John do you want to tell us where this comes from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's the story really is when you look at our cost to income ratio as you would know in businesses like nabCapital it'll jump around a bit. Cost to income ratio &#x2013; it is great to be the first business to get under 40%. Appreciated the plug. Thank you. But if you look we actually have cost growth. The story is about excellent revenue growth as well. So the cost growth comes from variable remuneration, we have done a lot with our staffing structure to make sure that we pay people well when they perform and we all suck in a bit when we don't perform so well. So that's one of the reasons we got cost growth. It reflects the revenue growth, although obviously in a disproportionate sense. And that's why you see very big jaws and lower cost to income ratio. That helps?</p>

          <p>It's Brian Johnson, JPMorgan. First of all it's got to be said Mark you got to be congratulated to produce the first NAB result consistently with the same way it's been produced in the preceding half. This is the biggest achievement and it's one that should be noted because its eight years since we have seen this consistency. But that being said...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not saying there aren't some strange things in there, but they are reported consistently strangely. I had question just about the dividend. If you have look at the dividend you basically smash the consensus expectation, certainly smashed my number, but the payout ratio hasn't come down. We are seeing you basically underwrite the dividend reinvestment which means to have this high dividend you are going to be issuing more shares which dilutes the future EPS. Can you just -- and by the way you're doing that off a much lower share price, at a 2.5% discount. Can we just get some explanation for robbing Peter to pay Paul?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The choice of dividend is really a function of the comfort we have in the underlying businesses and the momentum those businesses have. We're also because of the strength in the Australian parts of our franchise we're very high on franking credits and so we have a responsibility to the get the franking credits out to our shareholders. And we see no reason why the growth in dividends can't and shouldn't be sustained.</p>
          <p>So as to DRP and bringing capital back, as you saw from the slide we're comfortable on our capital ratios. But we've made a conscious decision to move to the top of the range. So we're seeing this is a one-off on the DRP although we will certainly reconsider where we are in September. So it's really just a function on the DRP side of staying strong.</p>
          <p>So the other thing I would say is that as we get on top of the ROE situation and you know that ROE is our Achilles' Heel in terms of core capital generation. We are close to an equilibrium already where the businesses can generate enough core capital to sustain reasonable asset growth in the conditions we are coming in to. We don't expect there to be a lot of core capital consumption. But as we get on top of ROE which we're going to do quickly we'll be in a surplus position anyway. So we feel comfortable with the whole algorithm, if you like, around the dividend.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it is a lower share price, but at least through DRP you are making it with a discount available to all shareholders proportionally, so no one needs to get diluted in that situation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley, just another question on capital, even after the DRP, your T1 is going to below 7%. It is inside your current target range. Obviously you might get some benefit from Basel II, but do you expect to review the target range in the Basel II environment? And where would you like to be relative to the peers that are now operating in a Basel II world.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard for the time being, we won't be reviewing our target ranges. Our objective, and both Mark and I said it, right now is to keep the bank strong. So in every measure we realize we might be running inefficiently, but I sleep better at night that way and so do the other members of the Board. We would expect to get a lift from Basel II and quite frankly we will just take the benefits of that and any review of ranges would only happen when we saw the storm clouds lifting and we felt much more certain about the future than we feel right now.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Hany, yeah. Jeff Emmanuel from UBS. John, I have got a couple of question if I can, firstly on asset growth one for Mark. Mark, the conduits being taken back on the balance sheet represent a fair part of your loan growth for the half. So just a better feel for the core growth and how you saw that against peers, in terms of market share. And then John, I had two questions, one on the UK. Do you still see the UK as a growth opportunity given the environment and are you deploying more capital into the UK at the moment to take advantage of the environment and secondly the in terms of non-performing loans, the numbers weren't up quite a lot. So I'm just keen to get your thoughts on how you see that looking forward the next couple of halves, whether you see that stabilizing or coming back down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jeff, non-performing loans was that in respect to the UK or Generally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Generally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Generally, okay. Mark, why don't you &#x2013; well I'll tell you what, let me answer the UK question. You can think about the asset growth question. The UK &#x2013; yes we do see it still is growth because it's only about maybe 1 or 2% market share. Jeff, so even though the system is slowing, we are in a nice niche and we can actually keep pushing on. If anything we are constraining them just now, because what I said earlier and hinted at is that in keeping the ship safe, we are making sure that we manage capital and the capital that all the businesses are using and how they deploy it. So it isn't just go and get as much business as you want. It's very strict and we are looking exactly what asset classes they're putting it into. So in that sense we probably are not seeing the UK grow as much as it really could grow if we encouraged them a bit more.</p>
          <p>For the non-performing loans if you actually take out &#x2013; and I know it's always dangerous to take things out. Because at the end of the day look, our 90-days past due have gone up, right. But if you take out of that the names we all know about and what's happened, and the fact that they are there in our provisioning and in the case of one, we've now written it off, as Mark said, underlying it's only gone up by about 3 basis points. So we are in a situation where we know things are getting worse, but there are actually right now getting worse slowly and I think they will continue to get worst, but we're not actually seeing a major upward trend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then on the asset growth, I'm doing some quick mental arithmetic here, but just taking out the liquidity holdings and the conduits, all of the businesses over the 12 months period grew in range 9.2 to 10.5 in their spot balance sheets. So 9 to 10.5% growth is true for all four of the businesses. If you want a forward-looking statement, I'll have to refer you to one of the CEOs if you are particularly interested in one of them?</p>

          <p>Jared Martin, ABN Amro. I have been surprised that none of my colleagues have asked the question whether you buying ABN Amro, Australia. I'll just leave that out there for the time being. And Citi as well for you, Craig? And UBS, Jeff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I take there is a question there somewhere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let that lie. The question is actually on the bad debt charge particularly with the collective provision for the conduits. I want to understand how that moves going forward. Is it a factor of bringing more on balance sheet? Is it a possibility that that actually is just a one-off or gets written back in next period? Just forward looking comment of how that charge is likely to move.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start that and then hand over to Mark. It could go both ways because markets could get much worse, and if markets got worse then what we &#x2013; I don't think they are going to &#x2013; but if they did, then you could have more downgrades in the underlying bonds and in the CDOs; and if we have more downgrades we will go through it again and we will come to a certain number. Now remember the number we came to, it was about mid 50s -- wasn't it -- about 55, so we stress tested this when we put 181 in. So we feel we have got a safety margin.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, things could get much better. Now remember, every one of these bonds &#x2013; every single one &#x2013; has not defaulted. There is not one payment being missed for any of them. We have got quite a lot of protection on most of them, so you could end up that that is written back at some time; but it won't be anytime soon, right? Because these are hold-to-maturity, so we are not going to be jumping up and down and changing our provision. Do you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you summarized it perfectly, I mean it -- if indeed we pass the bottom and things trend upwards then we may progressively get more comfortable, but as John says if it's a false bottom and the market &#x2013; the world goes to hell in a handbasket, then it's not only that part of our portfolio we would worry about, it's all parts of our portfolio. So it's very situational. It's hard to give any meaningful guidance on the thing but we have decided to put a solid position in place to start, in the hope that will handle any volatility within reasonable bounds.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think we -- we look at our conduits, which now starting to manage it as if they were our own assets, so we've got a team in there running all the securities booked in the conduits. I am very much with &#x2013; John's a bit more optimistic than I am of &#x2013; which is unusual actually -- about the future. It's not the sort of provision that's going to come whipping back as Mark has said, but we think it's a sensible provision and we're working our way through these securities and we'll see what the weather brings, as to whether there is additional provisioning or actually the situation turns out to be better than we expected. But that will take some time to evolve. It's a banking book problem, it's not a markets &#x2013; mark-to-market problem.</p>

          <p>Tom Quarmby from Macquarie. I am still very interested in the decision to exclude the economic cycle adjustment from cash earnings. In your statements here you say that that adjustment allows for losses within the portfolio attributable to volatile global markets and other cyclical economic factors, but -- and then you exclude it from cash earnings, but I would suggest that those same volatile global markets have also allowed you to re-price assets, reduce competition. They've allowed for reintimediation and probably assisted with the trading results of nabCapital due to volatility in markets. Why wouldn't you exclude those items as well?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for that. What we did, because of the approach that we're taking, there are really no points for being under-provided just now, as we did a bottom-up work with every single business, and every business is properly provisioned, right? It has got the provisions that we think are right, Mark thinks is right, the auditors think are right. Then we've got a windfall, okay? And what we do with that windfall? We decided let's just have a buffer for a rainy day; it's as simple as that. That's where we put it. Do you want to add to it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean I think the important point to note is that our bad and doubtful debt expense for this half is not $1 different than it would have been had we not had that provision. It is genuinely something we put in for whatever is in the portfolio that doesn't show up in our ratios yet, but after 15 benign years in Australia, if we end up in a recession or something like that, you know stuffs going to come out of the portfolio. So that's why it's there.</p>
          <p>As we hold true to that, as the ratios begin to tick up in terms of delinquencies and the like, we will continue to take out provisions. So I don't &#x2013; it's not going to have any impact on our expense but it certainly puts our balance sheet in a stronger position.</p>

          <p>Great, Okay. Next question to Mark McCraig.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mark McCraig, Guild. I obviously missed the previous privy on conduits and monoline insurance, so forgive me if everyone else knows the answer to this, but what's sort of economic return on both of those activities relative to the loss you've just potentially realized with the 181 million and the probable or possible loss with monoline insurance. I note in the presentation it's not been drawn down as yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't tell you, John, might be able to give you an estimate of the economics of these things but I must say that in all other respects around monolines and hedge funds and all these things that's part of the deep dive we've been doing in our portfolio and we have no issues, with respect to all of those asset classes, but John, maybe you can talk about the economics of conduits per se.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Conduits are a very common structure that's put in place. They work well for your clients. They give clients access to the commercial paper market. They allow people to raise term funding who wouldn't be able to do it in their corporate names often, and can do it by securitizing their assets. So that's the thinking behind that.</p>
          <p>And what's happened in the last nine months is that a lot of that thinking has collapsed and it's collapsed because the world's asset-backed paper markets have collapsed as you all know. And if not collapsed, significantly contracted in other circumstances. And securitization has gone with that.</p>
          <p>We were very pleased with our securitization business. It used no capital historically and it's been going for a number of years. Securitization itself has being going for 15 to 20 years as a tool. And then it's come to a crashing halt as investors have withdrawn from that market. But as is always the case when you have your &#x2013; when it goes wrong your loss exceeds your last year's profit, but that's been good profitable business for us. It's not disproportioned if that's the question you're searching for.</p>
          <p>And I would echo Mark's comments on monoline insurers and things like that. We're not big players in wrap markets and things -- just as one example, we've covered that reasonably well I think already.</p>

          <p>Brett Le Mesurier, Wilson HTM. Couple of questions, firstly you talked about how well the individual business units went, but the performance-related pay went down from the first half '07 to the first half '08. And secondly, you've talked about reducing the risk in the business, but when we look at the turnover of investments held to maturity that's increased by about 50% as has the volume of it and I didn't notice any comments on what the VAR was in your announcement or the presentation, so can you relate to your statements to what we see in the accounts please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I start off with the performance related pay. I am not sure about that one. I think some of it will be nabCapital, because nabCapital is obviously a big swing factor, and nabCapital of course had the big bad and doubtful debts situation, Brett, but we will try and find the answer to that one. Do you want to take the question on risk and we will get John to answer on VAR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I do remember also that there was a catch-up expense we took in one period around performance related pay, so it may be that but I'll have to look at it afterwards and come back to you on that, and I think on investments held to maturity. I need to look at exactly what you are looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, do you want to comment on VAR in terms of markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for those of you who know how VAR works, VAR is up across the system at the moment because it's one of the things that measure its volatility. Volatility has gone through just a huge change in one big leap from historic lows in volatility, which is what was happening in and around this period in 2007 through to historic highs in volatility in the markets that we are in. So that's foreign exchange, interest rate derivatives, and credit spread markets; it's a bit different from the stock market, but we, as you know, don't trade equities in any meaningful fashion.</p>
          <p>So, yes, everybody's VAR has gone up. It's a systemic rise in VAR. We've been rebuilding our markets division. We've built some bigger desks there, brought in credit trading. You'd expect us to be good at and active in credit trading given that we're a bank. So, we've used some VAR in new business developments but we've not been out there to use a market's term, 'yahoo-ing it'. We are using more VAR because there's more VAR needed in the system and we've built some new products. But basically our team have traded extraordinarily well and handled volatility, really well.</p>

          <p>Okay. We might need &#x2013; we have to wrap it up there. We've got a media conference that we &#x2013; that should have already started now. So can I ask the &#x2013; as soon as this completes, if we could have everyone maybe move out to the foyer, so we can actually clear the room enable the media conference to proceed. Any sort of outstanding questions that you may have, feel free to follow-up, either <mark type="inaudible" /> or myself through the course of the afternoon. And thank you for attending.</p>
