      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, <mark type="inaudible" /> and good morning everyone.  As you saw in the press release this morning, we had another very strong quarter driven by solid performance across the businesses.  Revenues were up 13% with 6 points of organic revenue growth.  Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.32 and that's up 14% over last year and includes $0.06 per share of uncovered restructuring charges.  Absent the impact of restructuring in the results for both second quarter of '07 and '08, earnings per share was up 17%.  Foreign exchange generated a net $0.04 benefit in the quarter, with the positive impact from the euro and other currencies, partially offset once again by the FX headwind at Pratt &amp; Whitney's Canadian operations.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, we remain confident about the year.  Accordingly, we've taken our earnings guidance for the full year up from to range of $4.80 to $4.95 per share.  That's up 12 to 16%, $0.15 on the bottom, $0.10 on the top of the prior range.  This increase is on the back of better earnings at Otis and UTC Fire and Security.  Both units are now expected to deliver operating profit guidance &#x2013; or operating profits higher than the guidance already built in the firm just this past February.  All the other businesses are on track with their prior profit guidance.</p>
          <p>I should note that the revised guidance does assume the euro at the current spot rate of about $1.58.  You will recall that our plan assumed a euro rate of $1.44, so a little bit of tailwind there.</p>
          <p>We're also updating our guidance on full year revenue which we now expect to be over $60 billion and on restructuring spending as well.  Year-to-date we've incurred about 130 million in restructuring costs, all of this uncovered by gains.  We do expect some gains in the second half of the year but we're also increasing today our outlook for restructuring spending for the year to about $300 million.  That's double the 150 million we forecast at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>As you know it's not unusual for us to see some lumpiness in the timing of gains and restructuring on a quarter-to-quarter basis.  We do expect that restructuring will be significantly in excess of gains for the full year.</p>
          <p>On free cash flow, that came in at 87% of net income for the quarter.  That's primarily due to Carrier's seasonality as you would expect, as well as slightly lower advances at Sikorsky.  We are encouraged however by inventory performance in the quarter.  While the overall level of inventory remains high especially at the aero businesses total inventory was essentially flat for the quarter.  Improving inventory performance remains a focus and there's still a lot of work to do.</p>
          <p>Full year cash flow, we expect the usual UTC standard of free cash flow greater than or equal to net income.  Also in the quarter, we repurchased $719 million of UTC shares, bringing the year to date total to over 1.5 billion.  For the full year, we are going to continuing to be optimistic in our repurchases and share repurchases will likely exceed the $2 billion guidance that we have for the year especially if the stock continues to trade at its decade low PE multiple.</p>
          <p>We will have <mark type="inaudible" /> take you through the business unit details in just a minute, but let me talk about some of the concerns here that we have been hearing from investors over the last few months.  Those concerns are of course commercial aerospace markets, commercial construction order trends, and commodity inflation.  Now with oil around $135 a barrel.  We are all concerned about the impact to our airline customers' profitability and the associated capacity reductions that they've all forecast.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, large commercial engine spare part sales at Pratt &amp; Whitney were about flat with last year, generally in line with Pratt's expectations going into the year and book-to-bill was marginally below one.  Hamilton Sundstrand's commercial spare parts sales in the quarter grew in the mid-single digit range.  For the year our outlook for spares at both of these divisions remain generally aligned with where they were at the start of the year but we will be watching these trends closely.</p>
          <p>As for commercial construction activity, we continue to see very strong orders at Otis, decent growth in Carrier's commercial business.  In the quarter in North America, new equipment orders at Otis grew double digits and world-wide orders were up 23%.  In Carrier's commercial HVAC business, new equipment orders in North America were essentially flat in the quarter, but commercial HVAC orders world wide were up double digits.  In Europe, new equipment orders at both companies were strong in the quarter with Otis up nearly 40%, although about half of that was from the benefit of the euro.  Otis saw particularly good growth in France, Germany and Eastern Europe.  Carrier's commercial HVAC business grew about 12% in Europe in the quarter at a constant currency rate. Asian orders for both companies continued to grow at double-digit rates.</p>
          <p>Now refrigeration orders at Carrier both in North America and Europe continued weaker in the quarter as we had previously discussed.  We are also mindful that construction industry forecasts for the US are generally down, although our order book doesn't indicate this yet.  Given this overall environment, all of our commercial businesses are continuing to focus on cost reduction and restructuring actions.</p>
          <p>The last issue I want to touch upon is commodity cost increases.  If you recall going into the year we expected gross commodity cost impact including energy to be about $200 million, with about half of that offset by pricing.  We now see these gross commodity cost increases of over 300 million, with pricing still expected to offset a little more than half of the impact. As you all know, steel prices have roughly doubled in the past year, along with the cost of oil. Some of the metals used in the aero businesses as well as copper are also up, although to a much lesser extent. On the other hand, we're getting better pricing than anticipated. In sum, higher commodity costs than anticipated at the beginning of the year but also a better pricing environment.</p>
          <p>Now, UTC's response to all of these challenges is of course to continue to work on costs and productivity. That's why we've bumped the year's restructuring to about 300 million, also why we continue to focus on the implementation of base across all of our businesses. As a result of tight cost control, restructuring and process improvements, we saw 40 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, adjusting for restructuring.</p>
          <p>Our portfolio of companies has allowed us to outperform in the past, and we expect to continue to outperform, even in the current market environment. Our target of 10% or more earnings growth annually remains unchanged. Our executive compensation incentives are all tied to this target.</p>
          <p>Let me turn it over to <mark type="inaudible" /> and have him walk you through the businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Greg. Before I begin on page four, let me mention that I talk to segment results with restructuring added back as we usually do. Otis delivered another very good quarter. Revenues increased 19%, with growth in all geographic regions, let by double-digit growth in North America, France, Russia and China. This reflects the strong new equipment backlog entering the year as well as high modernization and repair sales in Europe, which benefited from changes to elevator safety laws in France and Spain.</p>
          <p>Operating profit grew 25%, as higher volumes, product cost reductions and other cost containment initiatives more than offset headwinds from input cost increases. Favorable foreign exchange contributed approximately half of the improvement in revenues and profit. As a result of all of the above, operating margin expanded by 90 basis points to 19.8%. Otis new equipment orders went up 23% in the quarter, as Greg mentioned, 14% at constant currency, reflecting double-digit increases in all geographic areas.</p>
          <p>In light of very strong first half performance and Otis current expectations, we are now increasing profit growth guidance for Otis from 10% plus to nearly 20% for the full year. Also, we are increasing revenue growth guidance from high single-digits to low-teens.</p>
          <p>At Carrier, operating profit increased 9% on 7% higher revenue.  Foreign exchange contributed about five points of revenue growth and six points of the profit growth.  Operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 12.2%. Benefits from product cost reductions and prior restructuring actions in the commercial HVAC and North American residential businesses more than offset $30 million of net commodity headwind in the quarter and adverse shifts towards lower margin segments in the refrigeration and international residential businesses.</p>
          <p>The commercial HVAC business remains solid with mid single-digit revenue growth.  On the negative side, however, we still have the US housing recession.  Cooling season started poorly in Europe and commercial refrigeration markets were down both in Europe and North America.</p>
          <p>In the face of market softness Carrier has launched significant restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives.  As a result, we remain comfortable with Carrier's full-year earnings growth guidance of 10% plus on mid single-digit increase in revenue.</p>
          <p>UTC Fire and Security performance was also strong.  Revenue grew 29% with acquisitions contributing 18 points and foreign exchange seven points of this growth.  Organic growth was 4% with the fire-safety businesses in Europe and the Americas up mid single digits, the security business in Europe up low single digits <mark type="inaudible" /> down moderately in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating profit increased 46% with foreign exchange contributing eight points of the growth.  Benefits of restructuring actions and continuing productivity initiatives along with the profit contribution from acquisitions were partially offset by the impact of lower US residential volume.</p>
          <p>Operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 8.8%.  Based on performance to date, we are increasing UTC Fire and Security's full-year operating profit growth guidance from 25% to 30%.  We are also increasing the revenue growth guidance from high single digits to mid-teens.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the Aerospace businesses.  On Slide 7 Pratt &amp; Whitney revenues increased 6% in the quarter led by continued engine volume growth at Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada.  Revenues improved over 20% at Pratt Canada.  Revenues at Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne and Power Systems also grew over 10% while military revenues were essentially flat.</p>
          <p>Large commercial engine aftermarket grew low single digits with spares about flat.  Operating profit also improved 6% in the quarter led by the Military business on favorable aftermarket performance and improved engine mix.  This was partially offset by adverse <mark type="inaudible" /> mix in the large commercial engine aftermarket business.</p>
          <p>Profit contribution from higher revenues at Pratt Canada was largely offset by the unfavorable foreign currency impact from the weaker US dollar.  <mark type="inaudible" /> for Pratt was essentially flat in the quarter.  We continue to expect Pratt &amp; Whitney revenues to be up mid-single digits and operating profit to be up approximately 10% for the year.</p>
          <p>Hamilton Sundstrand revenues were up 18% with aerospace OEM and industrial businesses up nearly 20% each.  Commercial aftermarket revenues were up double digit.  Operating profit grew 11% and margin contracted in the quarter primarily from adverse mix. Lower margin development revenues grew by about 20% while higher margin commercial space revenues grew only mid-single digits.  Hamilton also faced pressure from commodity and input cost increases during the quarter.</p>
          <p>For 2008, we now expect revenues at Hamilton to be higher, up low teens.  We continue to see operating profit up 10% or 100 million dollars as indicated last December.</p>
          <p>At Sikorsky operating profit grew 28% on 9% higher revenue.  Operating margin expanded 120 basis points in the quarter to 8.5% from higher military volume and favorable mix.  During the quarter Sikorsky shipped a total of 53 large helicopters, 37 military and 16 commercial. Sikorsky remains committed to its guidance of more than 200 large aircraft deliveries for the year.  Sikorsky continues to expect mid-teens revenue growth with operating profit up approximately 25% in 2008.</p>
          <p>Let me turn back to Greg to wrap up.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks <mark type="inaudible" />  Before we open the call up to questions, let me just hit on a couple of the significant new product milestones that we've achieved just this past quarter.</p>
          <p>First on the 787 Program, Boeing as you've no doubt heard has successfully completed 787 power on testing with the support of Hamilton Sundstrand.  The next big milestone on the 787 of course is First Flight, which is scheduled for later this year.</p>
          <p>The second big milestone for UTC of course is the GTF or PurePower PW1000 as we now call it, which flew successfully for over six hours at our 747 test bed this past week.  Most importantly, the engine met or exceeded all of its pretest performance targets.  This will of course power the new Bombardier C-Series aircraft which was formally launched earlier this week. In a letter of interest we're up to 60 aircraft on Lufthansa.</p>
          <p>Finally in the commercial space UTC Power secured an order to supply 12 of our brand new 400 kilowatt fuel cells to the Freedom Tower and three other towers at the World Trade Center site in New York.</p>
          <p>All right summing it all up, it's been a very good quarter.  More noteworthy given the economic uncertainties that we're all dealing with.  Revenues up 13%, EPS 14%, net of restructuring 17%. We increased guidance $0.15 on the bottom of the range and a dime at the top.  We now expect 12 to 16% EPS growth for the year.  It's not unusual performance for UTC.  It's more of the same type of performance that you've come to expect.  Balance across geographies and products, tough restructuring, cost and productivity mentality, especially in more challenging times and an unusually strong string of product launches which look to be highly successful in their markets.  Of course cash content and net income supporting increased cash returns to shareholders.</p>
          <p>It's too soon to talk about 2009 specifically.  You should know that we're all focused on double digit earnings and cash flow growth.  With that let's open up the call for questions.  <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We'll take our first question from the Nicole Parent with Credit Suisse.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Nicole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess first when we think about commercial, the order numbers across Otis and Carrier on the commercial side look very strong.  Can you just talk I guess a little bit about, are you seeing any cancellations, where you guys feel you are in terms of the order process you know when you think about what your products are going into?  And kind of the comfort with the sustainability of the orders that you're seeing and I guess with respect to how do you look ahead when you just look at the backdrop of the environment and the <mark type="inaudible" /> in terms of thinking going forward.  You know do we see cancellations in some of these orders that you're getting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Nicole that's a great question.  I wish I had a crystal ball to tell you exactly what's going to happen in a couple of quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Me too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we can tell you, what we see out there in the market is we have not seen order cancellations to any extent.  I mean there's always the odd that are one-off cancellations.  But we have not seen large scale cancellations anywhere.  I think the one soft spot, as we've continued to note, is kind of at the lower end of the product line, in some of the low- and mid-rise office buildings as well as on anything that touches the retail. So strip malls and in the retail side for Carrier's HVAC business here in the US; but China, still very, very strong and Europe actually surprised us, I would say, with the strength that we've seen there. We all see what the indicators are out there. We all hear that things should be slowing down. We just have not yet seen any significant slowdown in any of our businesses outside of, let's say, commercial refrigeration in the US and Europe; and again, I attribute that more to the retail spend than the general commercial construction. Though, so far so good and we're obviously watching it closely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. For sector restructuring you guys absorbed an enormous amount of restructuring in the quarter. When we say it's probably reasonable to think about the restructuring efforts at Carrier but you also ramped it up at Fire and Security and Pratt, probably relative to my expectations and prior quarters. Could you just give us some sense on what's going on there and how we should think about that number for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we did, as I said, about $130 million year-to-date. We've done a lot of restructuring at Carrier, obviously, in response to what's going on in the residential market there as well as on the refrigeration side of the business. I think what you're going to see for the rest of the year is just more of the same. These actions have been primarily people-related; and we have closed a couple of factories and taken out about a million square feet. The actions to date have affected about 2,500 people, that's about 1% of our worldwide work force. I think, as you go to the second half of the year, more of the same. More restructuring at Pratt, more restructuring at Carrier, and continued restructuring at Fire and Security; but, I'd say no big change there, it's just a focus on taking cost out to continue to be competitive in this very difficult environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Super, and one last one, just on M&amp;A as we see the commercial aerospace names get hit on concerns about the end of the cycle. Could you give us a sense of what your thought is on aerospace acquisitions, and then also give us an update on Diebold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Nicole, this is Jim. I think, obviously, with the decline in the market aerospace valuations are more attractive. For many of them, though, they've only been more attractive for a couple of weeks, so I think it might take awhile for sellers, potential sellers' expectations to reset. We're a buyer in aerospace. That's clear, and hopefully that opportunity or opportunities in aerospace will arise and they'll be greater than they've been in the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>On Diebold, you know, it's a good property. It has very good ATM share, has a great global footprint, and obviously there's margin expansion opportunity because it's in mid-single-digits, and UTC runs its businesses in double-digits; but it's never been a must-have. We made our proposal back at the end of February, and a lot of time has passed and there are other opportunities in the world including buying UTX stock.  So we'll have to see.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Deane Dray with Goldman Sachs.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Dean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify on Nicole's last question.  A couple data points used to provide on the backlogs of both on the commercial side, Otis and Carrier.  Otis was at 18 months on the last update and six months on Carrier.  Where do those stand today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say they're just about the same. We've seen them get strong order growth or continued strong order growth at Otis.  Backlog is relatively constant.  So I'd tell you, we still have about 18 months of visibility on the new equipment side.  It's the same on Carrier, but just to be specific. It's Carrier's BSS or commercial business that we're talking about.  We've got six months of visibility to.  Those orders outside of the US have remained relatively strong.  Backlog looks pretty good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then the second question relates and I know you've said that you'll be light on 2009 specifics, but with regard to the press release comments and intro comments regarding the potential slowing and expected slowing in commercial aftermarket on the aero side, can you talk a bit about what the offsets might be?  What would be different in '09 versus '08 in terms of your mix?  Let's say that Power by the Hour contracts, the number of deliveries out of Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada.  So just give us some context, because we can certainly see the expectations about capacity coming out of the US commercial airlines.  But how is UTC positioned differently in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Dean, I'd love to get into an '09 discussion, but unfortunately I think it's just a little bit premature.  I'll tell you, we're targeting 10% plus growth as we said in the intro comments and then the release, obviously commercial aero a challenging environment.  And that becomes more difficult.  But I think that we feel pretty good about the prospects for next year.  As this year comes to a close and we see what really happens with the airlines and what happens with oil, I think we'll have a better feel for it.  But I'll tell you right now we've got confidence that we can continue to grow earnings no matter what the environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I asked it this way could you tell us what the economics are as you today have your Power by the Hour contracts?  What you can do in terms of expense control and management there and what the offset might be, just conceptually, not looking for a P&amp;L impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know about 40% of Pratt's aftermarket is FMP or Power by the Hour type contracts.  It's a similar number at Hamilton.  So obviously those contracts or revenue associated with those are all going to be based on flight hours as opposed to RPMs so, planes are still flying and revenue still looks pretty good there.  In terms of cost control I think it's just back to the UTC playbook we're going to take cost out where we can, we're going to try and increase productivity, use the ACE operating systems to improve back office as well as the factory productivity.  And it's just going to be the basic playbook, Deane.  I can't give you a lot of specifics unfortunately, but we are confident as we look forward.</p>

          <p>Hello, George.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of quick ones, the revenue increase at OTIS and Fire and Security, is that all just reflecting your currency change or is there actually some organic increase that you're seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>George, at OTIS, about half of the revenue increase or half of the 19% approximately was currency, so about 10% organic growth there, in case of Fire and Security, about 4% organic growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what I mean is the increased revenue guidance that you provided for the year, is that all currency related or is it also some organic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a combination of the two, there is some currency in there, but there is a lot of operating performance both in Otis and Fire and Security.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then if we look at the Hamilton Sundstrand, you mentioned small &#x2013; spares up mid-single digits but the whole aftermarket up double digits, what's the mix there between the maintenance business and the spares business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>George, as we look at the Hamilton Sundstrand business, we said that commercial aftermarket was still pretty good with spares up kind of mid-single digits, the repair side was actually up almost 20% in the quarter.  We continue to see good input into the shops, which is actually I think a good indicator as we go forward that the aerospace business is not perhaps in as dire straits as people might have thought. So good input into the shops. We actually saw the same thing at Pratt &amp; Whitney where we saw better inductions in the second quarter than the first quarter into the engine shops.  Though again, unfortunately the problem with the repair operations is that it's much lower margins then what we see on spares, still indicative of a pretty robust market out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Greg what's the rough mix between the two in the aftermarket?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Repair is up slightly above 50% of the commercial aero.  But they are about equal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, about equal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then just back on OTIS and Carrier, I found it ironic that the order growth this quarter was actually greater than the order growth that you had detailed in the first quarter and some of it might have been a little bit extra currency but is there any areas that you actually saw relatively better this quarter than the first quarter to account for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Europe was probably the surprise for us or especially Otis where you saw almost 40% growth in quarters.  Again half of that being currency but still very strong underlying growth as I said in France, Germany and Eastern Europe specifically in Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and maybe one last one Greg.  In Pratt &amp; Whitney you've done a remarkable job of holding the margins up where they are despite zero spares growth.  In how you look at it, what would have to happen for those margins to start to come down at Pratt &amp; Whitney?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well obviously if you had a significant slowdown in spare part sales.  It is still a large percentage of Pratt &amp; Whitney's profitability tied to spares.  But you know as you try and size that Pratt is more than just commercial aerospace and the commercial aerospace is about $4.5 billion of Pratt's $13 billion or so of revenue.  So you'd have to have I think more than just commercial aerospace turn down to really see a big decline in margins at Pratt.  You've got good strength at Pratt Canada, you've got good strength on the military side, Rocketdyne is doing well.  I mean it is a big, well-balanced company just like UTC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good.  Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question is from Howard Rubel with Jefferies &amp; Company.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  First could you talk for a moment a little bit about Sikorsky, some progress but still maybe not the margins you'd like to see?  And then Greg also address the Maritime Helicopter Program please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I would if I might take a little bit of umbrage with your first question there.  I think actually we saw pretty good performance out of Sikorsky this quarter.  They delivered 53 helicopters, that's up from 30 in the first quarter.  They saw 120 basis points of margin expansions to 8.5%.  So it's good performance.  Is it where we want them to be ultimately? Absolutely not.  There's still room to go there.  We've talked and Jeff has talked about you know double digit business here in the next couple of years or next three years I guess.  But they are making progress.  You know we're still committed &#x2013; Jeff and team are still committed to deliver over 200 large helicopters this year.</p>
          <p>There's more than just, I would tell you the helicopter deliveries that's about half of their revenue.  They're also doing well in the development side with the CH-53 and some of their other big programs.  So I think it was a very good quarter and again it's just indication that they're on the right track and they're on the right trajectory for this year and into the future.</p>
          <p>As far as the Canadian Maritime program I don't have much of an update other than to say that we're working very closely with the Canadian government.  We will be late with the helicopter as we've talked about before, probably up to 24 months late at this time.  We're working closely though to make sure that the helicopter meets the requirements of the Canadian government both from a schedule and cost standpoint.  And at the end of the day it's going to be the world's best search and rescue helicopter that the Canadian government is going to be buying from Sikorsky.  So the program is, I would say, back on track.  Flight tests will happen later this year and deliveries will start probably in around 2010 I guess at this point, 2011.  So a little late.  The first helicopters will be a little more expensive but overall from a program standpoint it's still a great program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I hear you and that's encouraging and I appreciate that.  And yes I guess I concede 8.5 is clearly a move in the right direction.  You didn't talk about Industrial at Hamilton Sundstrand.  My guess is elements of that business continue to be very strong.  And could you just talk for a moment on that and then I have one other item.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  It was actually a very strong quarter at Industrial.  They had revenues up about 20% and as we would expect the businesses that are impacted by growth in China and Asia very, very strong. We saw a little bit of a slowdown in some of the US Centric construction business.  Any of the hydro-carbon processing work there, primarily Sundyne, Milton Roy, all of those businesses continue to be very strong.  Order growth was a little less than the 20% but still strong.  I think they're going to have a pretty good year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Greg, finally one of the challenges is always trying to figure out how Fire and Security, organic growth is being measured.  And could you or maybe <mark type="inaudible" /> because he's so familiar with that business address?  Good hand off, right?  But seriously some of the metrics that you could talk about either customer adds or other things that you can point to where there is organic growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We saw good growth, Howard, in the fire safety side of the business.  As you recall fire safety is about two-thirds or 60% of the total revenue base revenue for Fire and Security.  And that grew in mid single digit which was good to see both in North America and Europe.  In fact inside of North America the reservation business which we had talked about last time in first quarter as being down 30% was down 16% this quarter as well, yet the overall fire safety business in North America grew mid single digits.  So we're very encouraged with all the focus and efforts that Bill and team are putting on the organic growth side.  Security EMEA which was a little bit down also in first quarter was up low single digits, so again encouraging signs there.  I think the team is focusing on organic growth and hopefully will report better numbers going forward on that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Greg, Jim and <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you just, I have just two things. One is, you've given us a lot of information, most of which is reasonably constructive about order rates in the various businesses and the various global markets; but rather than business-wise, is it possible to piece together Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, China and so on. Just kind of go around the world? I'm struck, for example, you've got such strength in Otis, but then you're off to a slow cooling market in Europe and then you've got weak refrigeration. Is there a way to kind of pull this together, region by region, so that we can see whether your views of what seems to be going on taken in the aggregate is really that different from what we read in the paper and so on?</p>
          <p>Then the second question, I'll just give it to you right now, is whether or not we think we can, can we achieve 10% margin in Fire and Security or are we backing off from that with the strength in the revenue growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me start, Joe, on the geographic overview if you will. I don't think there were any surprises when you look at where we're strong and where there's a little bit of slowness. If you think about the US, overall, from the UTC perspective now, growth there is kind of mid-single-digits in terms of revenues for the quarter. Obviously the weakness in the US residential market is a big piece of that slowdown. I think we actually saw some encouraging signs, I think, in the residential market today where housing starts actually were up in June; and Carrier's res business is actually getting a little better traction I would tell you in a down market, mostly on the back of cost reduction; but the US kind of mid-single-digit growth. It was the slowest growing area around the world.</p>
          <p>Europe, I think maybe that's the surprise to everybody here. Again, we saw very strong growth at Otis as well as Carrier. And again that is mostly, I would say, France, Germany and Eastern Europe. There's still a lot of slowness in the UK, Spain, Italy, both in the cooling markets as well as at the elevator business. So, again, no surprises, I think it coincides pretty well with what you guys probably see in the paper.</p>
          <p>Asia, again, very, very strong. We're talking about double-digit growth there and I have to differentiate. China continues more than 20% growth rates across our businesses in China. Japan, that's slow; Korea is slow; but Asia in general, in total including India, up strong double-digits. So I don't think there's a dichotomy here in terms of what we're seeing versus what you're reading. It's just that we're being very successful in those markets that are expanding especially in the emerging markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, on Fire and Security you'll see very strong profit growth for the year, but I think on 10% margins we'll come up just shy of that.  And there's no shame in being a little bit short of 10% margins for the year.  We wanted to sell and announce the sale of some of the low margin man-guarding businesses.  But the valuation wasn't there in this tough market.  So we decided to retain some of those businesses.  And they have margins that are low to mid-single digits.  So it just dilutes the margin.  But you still get the same earnings growth that we talked about early in the year and actually a little bit more with foreign exchange.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Jim, that change in the resulting margin the earlier guidance assumed that you'd be able to get rid of some of those?  And so really the businesses are stronger ex-that rather than weaker and it's just the sum of them if I understand it correctly, that's pulling the average margin down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, you said it better than I said it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And our next question is from Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  So Otis margins, 19-20% I think that's a record up 90 bps year-on-year.  So the story last year was mix is offsetting the top-line growth, and that's keeping the margin leverage below trend.  But we're not seeing that now.  I'm just wondering are we starting to see the impact of operating leverage on the bottom growth offsetting that mix impact?  And maybe if you could just comment on what the OE margin is doing right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nigel, Firstly the mix in the quarter was not &#x2013; did not change unfavorably.  And that's because the service revenues grew almost as fast as the OEM revenues grew for the quarter.  That was certainly not a headwind as we talked about in the past.  The second thing is, we truly are seeing tremendous operating leverage, the high volumes on OEMs.  The product cost reduction actions and other cost actions that Ari and now Didier and team are taking in Otis is just great execution there.  And you are seeing the benefits of OEM margins expanding and the mix really not changing as service revenues grow about at the same rate as OEM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I'm surprised that service revenues grew at the same level as the OEs.  Is that sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, keep in mind that Europe is where we have a larger proportion of service revenues as a percentage of total revenues.  And then you have the currency benefit in euro like we have seen that helps at the actual currencies, the mix part a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I understand.  And then Greg mentioned the traction in the resi market in the US which is on the HVAC side which is interesting.   I just wondered if you could just expand on that.  And you know on the pricing side of the residential, obviously you announced the price increase last quarter, we're starting to see some good pricing coming through in the PPI numbers for air conditioning. I'm just wondering are you seeing that pricing action sticking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start first maybe on the overall market. We saw some preliminary statistics which would say that the market was down about 9% or 10%, this is overall split-systems market in the US in the second quarter, the preliminary numbers. Our revenues were about flat year-over-year, so that would tell us that we are gaining a little bit of traction in the market. That's really continuing the trend that we saw in the first quarter so, again I think they were addressing some of the concerns that were out there in distribution and in the cost side and they're doing a lot of things to try and take back a little bit of share and that's been going quite well.</p>
          <p>As far as the pricing, we did announce a price increase last month which was effective actually July 15th and we are getting a little bit of traction with pricing which is good news. I think, we've seen pricing from the competitors as well but in this environment where we see input costs going up, we're actually getting I would say better pricing than we have historically seen on the res side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just one final one. I think you talked about some gains offsetting the restructuring in the second half of the year. Can you just give us a bit more color on those items?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've got a few gains although I can't give you a specific number on them today. We've got a small business that Pratt just disposed of here in the first -- beginning of the third quarter which will generate a small gain. We've also &#x2013; we're working on a tax settlement related to 2000 and 2003. I can't really be very specific because I just don't have that finalized yet with our friends at the Internal Revenue Service, but we expect that that will be resolved by the end of the year and we expect that, that will -- will be a fairly sizable reversal there, but I just can't give you a specific number on it. What I do know is that restructuring is going to be very strong in the back half of the year. Obviously we've done 130 million so far, we see a least another 170 million and the gains could be up to that level or maybe even a little higher, we'll have to just wait and see what happens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then just a -- I was a little bit surprised that the Pratt restructuring wasn't a little bit higher, given that's where a lot of the pressure's going to be felt in '09 I presume. Can you just maybe comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, as always, I think all the units are teeing up restructuring as they think about 2009 and Pratt certainly has been focused on this and I think as you go into the third quarter, that 170 million that we just mentioned, you'll see Pratt be a fairly large participant in that pool.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Greg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. It looks like you know if you're going to hit your target, that you'll see a pick up in commercial helicopter deliveries in the second half, and I believe those have lower margins than the military.  Can you improve your margins at Sikorsky from where you were in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely Cai.  I think you know, we saw very good progress, 120 basis points.  I think we will continue to see margin traction there throughout the year.  I'm not going to say 120 basis points, but we should continue to see costs come down, especially out of the helicopter production line.  Hours have to continue to come down.  They have to come down not just from a cost standpoint but also from a delivery standpoint so that we have the capacity to deliver these next 120 helicopters or so in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, sequentially you should be able to improve the margins from the 8.5 not year-over-year, obviously, except for the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And then, can you give us the number of industrial gas turbines that you shipped in the quarter and give us some color?  That market appears to be relatively strong, talk about order intake, what you expect for the year and kind of momentum you might have going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually shipped about 20 of the industrial gas turbines, that is actually up 100% from what we saw last year in the second quarter.  And that market continues to be very robust around the globe as the people are looking for peaking and standby energy.  I don't know that we have, I'm just looking to <mark type="inaudible" /> here to see if we have the order intake for industrial, if not maybe we can get back to you with a call if that will be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, so what do you expect to do &#x2013; what's the plan for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if I have a forecast for the year for industrial gas turbine shipments.  Again, what I'll do is I'll ask <mark type="inaudible" /> to try and get that data for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then the last one; Greg, you mentioned that the non-recurring gains in the second half, you know could equal or exceed the 170 million, which would mean as opposed to being a headwind of 128 million in the first half, restructuring would be essentially neutralized in the second half, to the extent business goes well, what's your inclination in terms &#x2013; like if you have a bigger non-recurring gain, what's your inclination in terms of even pushing that restructuring higher because you're really implying a decline in the run rate from where you were in the second quarter versus letting more of the earnings flow through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as you think about the year 2008 we've taken the guidance up to the top end, about 4.95 and we've contemplated in that the restructuring up to 300 million.  I would tell you given what we see for '09 today I would suspect that we would probably want to do more restructuring as opposed to flowing it through to earnings at this point.  And I think that we saw that here in the first half of the year and I think we'll have that playbook in the second half of the year.  If there's appetite for restructuring we want to make investments for the long term here.  We're going to do what is right for the business over the long term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and the last one in terms of the timing of the non-recurring items.  Can you give us any sense if it's like 150 of kind of whatever it is?  What are the key items that could contribute to that and when might they fall in the third and the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Cai, really again, we've got one small gain that we know that's already closed here early in the third quarter is the Pratt disposition.  But in terms of the larger gain as it relates to the tax or a few of the other things that we're working on, I can't tell you whether that's third quarter or fourth quarter today.  We'll certainly let you know as we know about those things so that there's no surprises here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it should be one big lump in either the third or the fourth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes.  It could be one big lump.  It could be some other things as well.  I just can't give you a specific in terms of timing today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That's great.  Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cai, just to close the loop on the industrial gas turbine forecast.  I think that's &#x2013; we had about 35 shipped in the first and second quarter and we're full year forecasting between 55 and 60.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe [Joseph Nadol] wanted me to say hi, too.  He's on a flight back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So a couple of quick questions because of most of mine have been answered.  You referred earlier to some of the capacity reduction announcements that the airlines have announced and a lot of those planes are Pratt engine MD-80s.  And we were just curious to see what percentage of the Pratt installed base you expect might be parked over the next year or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, I don't know that I would have a percentage.  As you think about the announcements that have happened so far I think American has talked about taking 50 or 60 MD-80s and reducing that capacity here in the third or fourth quarter.  The bigger capacity reductions actually been announced I believe at United where they're talking about taking old 737s which are actually CFM powered as opposed to the Pratt powered aircraft.</p>
          <p>As you think about Pratt's aftermarket, commercial aftermarket's about 3.5 billion.  We've given these numbers before but 10% of that is kind of the older model engines, the JT8s, the JT9s.  And I think what's important is to keep it in perspective is five years ago that business was about double the size it is today.  We've already seen a fairly large reduction in spares sales related to those older models, so.  Again, there could be some further capacity reductions beyond what's just been announced and it is painful to the extent it impacts spares, but it's not catastrophic in any way.  I think it's just something we will have to manage at Pratt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, no that sounds good, thank you. And then shifting gears a little bit; commercial refrigeration has been relatively weaker in the first half of the year.  How do you think about that going forward for the rest of the year and maybe into next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of commercial refrigeration, we have seen some weakness both in the US as well as in Europe.  Again that's really more retail spending related, so I don't know that I would call a rebound in that market in the near term, I think again it will depend upon what happens in the US economy as well as broader European economy. We've got good position still, though.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that refrigeration weakness split over kind of like the store-based sort of products and containers or is that more one or the other?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I think what Greg was talking about is more the display case business, which is the store-based product as you are calling it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but container remains good?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, container was down in the quarter. We actually saw weakness in the container shipments for the quarter versus last year.  Again it is hard to call. We look at containers are pretty lumpy business, so down in the quarter, but I think for the year we're still pretty optimistic that containers are going to come back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then you have spoken about I guess truck trailer before. How is that going in the US and Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well US truck trailer has been very strong. It has come back quite a bit from last year's depressed levels, so we're seeing good growth there.  Europe has actually started to moderate and that's a bigger business than the US truck trailer but it's also very profitable business, so that was actually down a little bit in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Doug.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On commercial construction and I'd say both Otis and Carrier are commercial.  When you talked about the growth you are seeing in orders, can you characterize that versus market growth and obviously that depends on geography, but I am trying to understand are you seeing growth in the market or are you capturing share gains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jim. I think we're seeing both. I think we're seeing the market continue to grow, I think we have good products, both with Gen 2 Otis and some of the Carrier commercial products allowing us to take share gain.  I would note because we've talked a lot about it this morning though, that we've had good backlog growth and particularly at Otis we've been getting pricing in this market.  I think we've been executing part of the reason you see higher margins.  But you know as we look forward, architectural billings are down and we have seen a little bit lower quoting activity and that usually precedes orders.  So I think we've had very good backlog growth but I don't think we're going to sustain these very high growth rates and backlog growth rates into the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But what I was getting at is outside of the US are you able to compensate some for any slowing we may see by some share gain in some of these other markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'll have to see, but to date we've had both.  We've had growing share in robust markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on Fire and Security.  You talked about organic growth and the FX affect.  Could you talk a little bit more specifically about the part &#x2013; the piece that's acquisitions, the non-organic part of this?  And then what the actions you're taking that lead to restructuring charges, in other words what are you doing there that's leading to fairly substantial restructuring charges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with regard to the acquisitions actually both questions are related to some extent because the acquisitions of Initial [Initial Electronic Security] which we announced third quarter of last year is driving part of the restructuring charges as well.  And what is happening there is that was more of a density play. If you recall we had a position in UK, France, and Netherlands and with Initial coming on top of that it gives us an opportunity to drive in the combined revenue to a lower infrastructure in terms of low number of branches, single head office etc.  And so that's driving some of the restructuring.  The integration of Initial is going very, very well we seem to be on track with that and that's part of the reason why Bill is expecting some margin expansion in the second half of '08 larger than what we've seen thus far.</p>
          <p>The other acquisition of significance was Marioff which was fourth quarter last year and again the order rate there continues to be very strong.  The business is doing extremely well and we are very, very happy with those plays that were made in Fire and Security.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when you look forward and you talked about 10% margins this year, and I was assuming that was 10% including restructuring before.  Are you on a track for something like that?  And when you look long term at the 15% goal that you've described, is that all pretty much intact?  Or long term could it even be stronger given what you've done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very much on track is what I would say, Doug, at this point.  I think the immediate half margin guidance is always adjusted for restructuring costs. Certainly we have the benefits of restructuring in those guidance numbers and that continues to be the reason why we feel we have a good path to get to the 15%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. All right, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. One more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Due to time restraints, our final question comes from Lee Rawlings from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Lee.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nice quarter. Just a few questions, when you talk about your new equipment order growth, I'm taking that's in dollars. Could you characterize that in units overall? I think you said it was 40% in Europe. Could you do that for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's tough to talk about units, Lee, only because units is made up of so many different sizes and types and components, it becomes difficult for us to characterize that. Clearly, the way to look at it is the FX that we talked about, 50% of the 40% is the, roughly, FX, if you adjust for that at constant currency, we're about 19, 20%; and I think on a unit basis, again, all this plays very well in the higher end. So the dollars per unit for all these wins are typically larger than the market in some cases, but to give you an exact number in units, that's tough for us to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. Then in the US, could you tell us maybe regionally where the strength is coming from and maybe in Europe, maybe country by country for Otis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Europe is easier to talk about. Let me start with that. I think that one is more, I think as Greg said, France. Certainly for Otis we've seen strength in France, Germany, Eastern Europe particularly Russia. Weaknesses, on the other hand, have been basically UK, to some extent Italy and Spain to a smaller extent. With regards to US, I think that's a little something maybe I can take it later on on the call, I could talk to you about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll try to get you some more detail here. Give Aqil a call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just to switch it up a bit. I know for going into Power On, I think Hamilton had a few outstanding items that weren't necessary to be complete for Power On; just wondering, could you give us an update there and what's going on with the program, what are you guys working on? Any surprises, positive or negative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't characterize any, that we had any real surprises. It's a development program, so you always have things that you may have to rework as part of the process, but I would tell you the Power On process, from a Hamilton perspective, was about as good as we could have ever expected. We're obviously supporting first flight certification hardware so we've got a couple of outstanding items there.  I expect all of that will be done by the end of this month, the end of July to support first flight which of course won't happen until sometime toward the end of the year.  So I feel very good about the program.  I think Dave Hess and team, Tim Morris have all done just a great job in supporting Boeing through this very long and difficult development process.  But they're not done yet, still spending money but I feel &#x2013; or all feel very good about the program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  What are the systems that are outstanding for first flight?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, Lee, I don't know that I have those specifics.  I know a lot of it has to do with the certification of software and it's primarily going to be related to electric power distribution systems.  But I'm sure there's more kind of nits and nats that have to be completed as well.  I just don't have a rundown for you here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure and then I think Nicole asked about an update on Diebold. I don't remember the answer, the question being addressed.  If you did I apologize but could you give us an update there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes actually I'll give an update.  I did speak about it about 15 minutes ago and actually my response is going to be similar to what it was 15 minutes ago but the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's all right.  I was going to say actually the response is going to be the same it was an hour ago and as it was four months ago, which is: we really like the property but it's not a must have.  There are other opportunities in the world and we'll have to see how it goes.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>Okay. Well I just want to thank everybody for dialing in and listening in this morning.  Obviously a very strong quarter and we've got a lot of confidence in the year.  The focus right now as we've mentioned many times on this call is about preparing for '09 and dealing with the economic uncertainties we all face.  But we feel very good about where we are, we've got great products, great people and I think we're going to have a great year.  Thank you very much.</p>
