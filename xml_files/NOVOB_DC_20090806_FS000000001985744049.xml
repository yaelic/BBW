          <p>Good day and welcome to the Novo Nordisk Quarter Two 2009 Earnings Conference Call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. This is Novo Nordisk's conference call regarding our results for the first six months of 2009 which we released earlier today.</p>
          <p>I am Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, the CEO of Novo Nordisk; and with me, I have our Chief Financial Officer, Jesper Brandgaard; Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, our Chief Science Officer; and also present are our Investor Relations officers.</p>
          <p>Today's earnings release is available on our homepage, novonordisk.com, along with the slides that we will be using for this conference call. The conference call is scheduled to last approximately one hour. As usual, we'll start with the presentation as outlined on slide number two. Q&amp;A session will begin in about 25 minutes.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number three. As always, I need to advise you that this call will contain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations. For further information on the risk factors, please see the earnings release and the slides prepared for this presentation.</p>
          <p>Also of note, as was mentioned, the conference call is being webcast live, and a replay will be made available on Novo Nordisk's website after the call.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number four. We're satisfied with the sales performance for the first six months of this year, with a sales growth of 17% as reported and 11% in local currencies. The performance was driven by continued penetration of our modern insulins in all key markets.</p>
          <p>North America continues to expand its position as the largest sales region for Novo Nordisk, with a sales growth of 34% in first six months of 2009 in reported terms and 18% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>We have now launched Victoza in the United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark. The first indications from these markets are encouraging, and there is very high level of awareness from key opinion leaders, endocrinologists and general practitioners across these countries. The pan-European rollout of Victoza will continue throughout this year and into 2010.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with the new data from the clinical study comparing Victoza treatment with sitagliptin, a DPP-IV inhibitor. The study included around 650 people with Type 2 diabetes, and the results show that glucose controlled reductions and weight reductions were statistically significantly better with liraglutide 1.8 and 1.2 mg compared to sitagliptin. Mads Krogsgaard will provide more details on this later.</p>
          <p>In the United States, Novo Nordisk continues the constructive dialogue with the United States FDA regarding the regulatory process for liraglutide. Formal feedback from the FDA is expected later this quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to financials where we, once again, saw a solid improvement in gross margin. Operating profit grew by 39% reported, and by more than 15% adjusted for the impact from currencies and costs related to the closure of the pulmonary diabetes projects.</p>
          <p>For 2009, we have today raised our guidance for growth in operating profit, measured in local currencies, from previously at least 10% to now 12 to 14%. Measured in reported terms, the growth in operating profit is expected to be around four percentage points higher than the growth in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number five for an update on the sales performance. First six months 2009, the portfolio of modern insulins was the main growth driver, accounting for more than 80% of total sales growth in local currencies. Our portfolio of modern insulins continues to show strong performance overall. Sales of modern insulins now constitutes 64% of Novo Nordisk's sales of insulin, biopharmaceuticals grew 70% reported and 10% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide. The U.S. market has, during the last five years, been growing at a compounded annual growth rate of around 6% in volume and 20% in value. While the volume growth in the U.S. market primarily has been generated by increasing number of people with diabetes, the additional value growth is largely caused by the conversion to modern insulins.</p>
          <p>The modern insulins now constitutes 67% of the insulin market, measured in volume compared to 62% the year before. Another important factor in realizing the high value growth is increasing the widest penetration in the United States where almost 40% of all modern insulins now are sold in the FlexPen device.</p>
          <p>In the modern insulin market, Novo Nordisk holds a market share of 34% measured in volume. Novo Nordisk has consistently been increasing its market share in all three insulin segments. In short-acting, the premix insulin segment, NovoLog and NovoLog Mix are expanding their leadership position, and furthermore, Novo Nordisk is expanding its market share in the long-acting segment with a continued penetration of Levemir.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for an update on the European market. During the last five years, the European market has been growing at a compounded annual growth rate of around 6% in volume terms and 9% in value. However, in more recent quarters, the overall insulin volume growth in Europe has slowed down and current growth rates are below this level.</p>
          <p>The penetration of modern insulin continues to progress, and by the end of the first quarter of 2009, we have reached 60% in terms of volume compared to 55% in same time last year. Within the modern insulin segment, Novo Nordisk maintains its market leadership position with a modern insulin market share of around 51%.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number eight for an update on the sales of NovoSeven. NovoSeven sales increased 19% in reported terms and 13% in local currencies in the first six months of 2009. Sales growth of NovoSeven was primarily realized in Europe and international operations. Sales growth for NovoSeven primarily reflected increased sales within the congenital bleeding disorder segment which remains the largest area of use.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number nine which provides you with an update on our human growth hormone franchise. Norditropin continues to show strong growth momentum. Sales increased 16% reported and 8% in local currencies. North America and Europe were the main contributors to growth measured in local currencies. Novo Nordisk still is the second largest company in the global growth hormone market with 30% market share measured by volume.</p>
          <p>And with this, I would like to hand it over to Mads who will give you an update on the development within our clinical pipeline.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Before direction to your attention to the slides, I would like to comment on the new study that builds on the landmark Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, DCCT, and its follow-up study, termed EDIC [Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications]. The Type 1 diabetes DCCT study, which was initiated in 1983, compared intensive insulin therapy to conventional therapy, and highly positive results were announced at the ADA Meeting in Las Vegas in 1993. Good glucose control led to a substantial reduction in microvascular complications.</p>
          <p>The EDIC study group has ever since followed the DCCT patients to track the long-term consequences of differential glucose control. The newly announced study follow-up investigated diabetes complications 30 years after diagnosis both in the original DCCT patients and in a subset of conventionally treated patients from an observational NIH study. Intriguingly, those randomized to a few years of intensive insulin treatment 30 years ago had more than 50% reduction in the risk of eye and kidney damage today. And importantly, they also had substantially reduced occurrence of cardiovascular events two decades after trial completion.</p>
          <p>Further meditation of the negative consequences of poor control came from the added observational NIH study. The described health impact of the so called metabolic memory is so pronounced that the risk of blindness, amputation or dialysis 30 years after diagnosis is reduced to only 1%.</p>
          <p>Metabolic memory has also been termed the legacy effect of glucose control in last year's long-term follow-up to the UKPS Type 2 diabetes study that demonstrated similar positive findings. Both the principle author, David Nathan, and one of the EDIC study Co-Chairman subsequently commented that while excellent glucose control is difficult to achieve and maintain, it should be targeted from disease diagnosis since it may be fundamentally change the course of diabetes.</p>
          <p>On this high note, now please turn to slide 10 for an update on the regulatory status for liraglutide.</p>
          <p>As announced last month, the European Commission has granted marketing authorization for Victoza for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes in adults. The authorization covers all 27 European Union member states. Victoza is the brand name approved in Europe for liraglutide, the first once-daily human GLP-1 analogue developed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <p>The marketing authorization covers treatment in combination with metformin or a sulphonylurea in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite using maximally tolerated dose of monotherapy with these agents. Furthermore, the authorization covers combination treatment with metformin and a sulphonylurea, or metformin and a thiazolidinedione in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite these two therapies.</p>
          <p>In the beginning of July, Novo Nordisk launched Victoza in the U.K., Germany and Denmark, and we expect to launch Victoza in the remaining European markets during the second half of this year and throughout 2010.</p>
          <p>In the United States, Novo Nordisk continues the constructive dialogue with the FDA regarding the regulatory approval process for liraglutide. Novo Nordisk expects to receive formal feedback from the Agency for liraglutide later this quarter, and needless to say, we'll provide an update immediately thereafter.</p>
          <p>Outside Europe and the U.S., the approval processes for liraglutide are progressing well. In Japan, the regulatory process continues to progress as expected, and we now expect a formal PMDA decision in the first half of 2010. Finally, in China, we plan to submit the regulatory dossier within the month of August.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 11. In a recently completed study, the effect of liraglutide was compared to sitagliptin, both administered as add-on therapy to metformin in people with Type 2 diabetes. The study was a 26-week randomized open-label, multinational trial in which daily doses of 1.2 and 1.8 mg of liraglutide were compared to the highest approved dose of 100 mg sitagliptin daily.</p>
          <p>The trial enrolled approximately 650 subjects with Type 2 diabetes failing to reach an A1c level of below 7.5% after daily treatment with at least 1500 mg of metformin. From a baseline of around 8.5% A1c, A1c decreased by 1.5 percentage points in the 1.8 mg liraglutide arm and 1.2 percentage points in the 1.2 mg liraglutide arm, compared to 0.9 percentage points in the sitagliptin treatment arm. The ADA target for HbA1c of below 7% was reached in approximately 55, 40 and 20% of the patients in the 1.8 mg liraglutide, 1.2 mg liraglutide and sitagliptin treatment arms, respectively. In the same groups, the weight loss of around 3.5 kilo, three kilo and one kilo was found, respectively.</p>
          <p>All the above differences were statistically significant in favor of both doses of liraglutide compared to treatment with sitagliptin. The safety profile of liraglutide in this study was comparable to the profile observed in the previous clinical studies in the LEAD program.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. I'm pleased to announce that Novo Nordisk recently received marketing authorization for Levemir in China from the Chinese regulatory authority, SFDA. Novo Nordisk expects to launch Levemir in China in the beginning of 2010 and, with this, we will also in China be the only company to market all three types of modern insulins for people with diabetes.</p>
          <p>The new generation of modern insulins &#x2013; SIBA, soluble insulin basal analogue, NN1250; and SIAC, soluble insulin analogue combination, NN5401 &#x2013; are both expected to start Phase III clinical trials in the third quarter this year. SIBA is a neutral, soluble, long-acting basal insulin developed to provide a duration of more than 24 hours and a flat and predictable profile. SIAC is the first neutral, soluble, fixed-combination of a long-acting basal insulin and a fast-acting insulin, without a need for resuspensions.</p>
          <p>The trial programs for the two insulins are named BEGIN and BOOST, respectively. The large trial program would be executed sequentially in waves, and the final endpoint would be changes in hemoglobin A1c, with hypoglycemia and other general safety measures as the most important secondary endpoints.</p>
          <p>In total, the BEGIN program is expected to include around 7,000 patients, whereas the BOOST program is expected to include approximately 3,000 patients. The first wave of the BEGIN program will include direct comparison with insulin glargine in insulin-na&#xEF;ve Type 2 diabetics, as well as trials investigating the use of the new insulin in a basal-bolus treatment regimen for people with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <p>For the BOOST program, the first wave includes a trial investigating the use of the novel combination product compared to Levemir in a basal-bolus treatment regimen in people with Type 1 diabetes. As mentioned, the first wave of the two programs is expected to be initiated this quarter, and the subsequent waves are expected to be initiated in the fourth quarter of 2009 and in the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Finally, with regard to the liraglutide Phase III program for the treatment of obesity, the first of</p>
          <p>three Phase III trials is progressing according to plans. The decision to initiate the remaining two Phase III trials is expected to be taken after completion of the U.S. regulatory process for liraglutide in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an update on our biopharmaceuticals pipeline.</p>
          <p>In June 2009, at the Endocrine Society's Annual Meeting in Washington DC, United States, results were presented from the Phase 2 study with the once-weekly growth hormone compound, 0083, in adults with growth hormone deficiency, AGHD. The study included 32 patients that were randomized to one of three different doses of active treatment or placebo. The patients received weekly doses of either the growth hormone or placebo subcutaneously for three weeks. The study demonstrated a solid biomarker-based efficacy profile that lives up to the criterion for once-weekly administration of the compound.</p>
          <p>IGF-1 was measured as a biomarker of growth hormone action, and in fact, the entire therapeutically relevant range of endogenous IGF-1 levels were explored through the use of the selective growth hormone doses in the study. Thus, dose selection for further studies can now be undertaken. Importantly, the compound was generally well tolerated.</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk has now initiated a Phase 2a single-dose study in children with growth hormone deficiency, with enrollment of 32 subjects, and results of this trial are expected in the beginning of next year.</p>
          <p>Within the area of haemostasis, please note that the European regulatory body, EMEA, in June approved a label update for NovoSeven. The updated label states that the safety and efficacy of NovoSeven have not been established outside the approved indications, and also that increase in material <mark type="inaudible" /> has been observed outside of approved indications. The label update does not reflect the different risk profile of NovoSeven within licensed indications, and it is not expected to impact NovoSeven performance.</p>
          <p>With regards to our pipeline within haemostasis, Novo Nordisk has initiated a randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial with the recombinant factor XIII in cardiac surgery. The aim of the prophylaxis trial is to investigate the safety and efficacy of factor XIII on transfusion needs in patients undergoing heart surgery. The trial is expected to enroll around 400 patients, and results are expected early 2011.</p>
          <p>The Phase 1 trial with subcutaneous injection of recombinant factor VIIa has now been completed. While the study showed that subcutaneous dosage is possible, the bioavailability did not favor further development. Hence, Novo Nordisk has decided not to continue into Phase 2 clinical development with subcutaneous administration of this compound, and will instead focus on subcutaneous administration of a long-acting factor VII analogue expected to enter clinical development subcutaneously this year.</p>
          <p>In addition, Novo Nordisk expects to start Phase 2 clinical development in the third quarter of this year with a long-acting recombinant factor VIIa derivative, NN7128, intended for prophylactic treatment of hemophilia patients with inhibitors and administered intravenously. The Phase 2 trial will include 24 patients and results are expected in 2011. Furthermore, Novo Nordisk expects to start a Phase 1 file with a recombinant once-weekly factor IX compound in the third quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>The trial is expect to enroll around 20 hemophilia B patients in a dose-finding regime, and the study is expected to be completed mid next year.</p>
          <p>Finally, within the area of inflammation, we also have initiated a Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety of single and multiple dosing of a novel undisclosed monoclonal antibody in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. With this, Novo Nordisk now has a total of three projects in clinical</p>
          <p>development within inflammatory disorders.</p>
          <p>With that, over to you, Jesper, for an update on the financials.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mads. Please turn to slide 14.</p>
          <p>We are satisfied with the financial results for the first six months of 2009. Total sales growth for this period was 17% as reported and 11% in local currencies. Growth was realized both within diabetes care and biopharmaceuticals. The primary growth contribution originated from the modern insulins and NovoSeven.</p>
          <p>The growth margin increased to 79.9% compare to 77.1 in the same period of 2008. This improvement reflects improved production efficiency, higher average selling prices in the U.S., and a positive product mix effect. The gross margin was positively impacted by around 1.3 percentage point from the currency development, primarily the higher value of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus the Danish kroner compared to the first six months of 2008.</p>
          <p>In the first six months of 2009, total non-production related costs increased by 12% to 12.6 billion. Close to half of the increase in non-production related costs reflects the higher value of key currencies versus the Danish kroner. The underlying development in non-production related costs relates to the expanded sales force in especially U.S., U.K., Germany and China, countered by lower research and development costs.</p>
          <p>The lower research and development cost is primarily reflecting the timing of Phase III clinical trial programs, as well as the non recurring cost of 375 million in the first six months of 2008 related to the discontinuation of pulmonary diabetes projects.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in the first six months of 2009 increased by 39% to 7.9 billion. Adjusted for the impact from currencies and non-recurring costs in 2008 related to the discontinuation of all pulmonary delivery projects, underlying operating profit increased by more than 15%.</p>
          <p>Net financials in total showed a net expense of 511 million in the first six months of 2009 compared to a net income of 444 million in the same period of 2008.</p>
          <p>For the first six months of 2009, the foreign exchange result was an expense of 501 million compared with an income of 474 million in the first six months of last year. This development reflects losses on foreign exchange hedging of especially U.S. dollars and Japanese yen due to the significant depreciation of these currencies versus Danish kroner in the first six months of 2009, compared to the exchange rate level prevailing in 2008.</p>
          <p>The market value of foreign exchange hedging contracts for future income recognition is now positive, with the loss of approximately 300 million expected to be recognized as an expense in the second half of 2009 being more than offset by an income of approximately 500 million to be recognized in 2010.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate in the first six months of 2009 was 23%. Net profit increased by 22% to 5,690 million.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 15, providing an overview of the current currency exposure. During the second quarter of 2009, the U.S. dollar has depreciated compared to the Danish kroner. However, compared to the second quarter of 2008, the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen have still appreciated substantially. While the appreciation of the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen has a long-term positive impact on Novo Nordisk's financial outlook, it also results in foreign exchange hedging losses in the near-term as already mentioned. The expected annual impact on operating profit of a 5% movement in the currencies is stated on the slide and is in line with the previous estimates.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for the financial outlook for 2009.</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk still expects sales growth in 2009 at the level of 10% measured in local currencies. This is based on the expectations of continued market penetration for Novo Nordisk's key strategic products within diabetes care and biopharmaceuticals, as well as the expectations of continued intense competition during 2009. Given the current level of exchange rates versus Danish kroner, the reported sales growth is now expected to be around two percentage points higher than the growth rate measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>For 2009, growth in operating profit is now expected to be 12 to 14% measured in local currencies. The increase reflects an expected lower level of research and development costs for 2009 due to the timing of Phase III clinical trial programs.</p>
          <p>Further, the forecast is based on assumptions of a continuous improvement in the growth margin and increased spending for sales and distribution relative to sales due to the increase in Novo Nordisk's global sales force. Given the current level of exchange rate versus Danish kroner, the reported operating profit growth is now expected to be around four percentage points higher than the growth rate measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>The outlook for 2009 is assuming that the expected operating profit growth will be lower in the second half of 2009 compared to the first half of 2009. The reasons for these assumptions are tied to the expected development in operating costs and exchange rate.</p>
          <p>On the operating cost side, especially the distribution of research and development costs is expected to be uneven over the quarters in 2009 reflecting the timing of major clinical trails. Of notable importance is the initiation of Phase III clinical trials for the new generation of insulins in the third quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the currency development in 2008 and so far in 2009 has had a substantial positive impact on sales in the first two quarters of 2009. However, with the current rates, this positive impact is expected to be less significant in the third quarter of 2009, while a negative impact is expected for the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>For the full-year 2009, Novo Nordisk now expects a net financial expense of 900 million Danish kroner. This expectation reflects significant foreign exchange hedging losses, especially related to U.S. dollar and Japanese yen.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate for 2009 is still expected to be around 23%, positively impacted by a higher contribution to the total profit before-tax from our biopharmaceutical business.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures are still expected to be around three billion in 2009. Expectations for depreciation, amortization and impairment losses of around 2.6 billion are unchanged. And free cash flow is now expected to be more than 10 billion, reflecting slightly higher expectations for net profit.</p>
          <p>All of the above expectations are based on the assumption that the global economic downturn will not significantly change the business environment for Novo Nordisk during the remaining part of 2009. In addition, all of the above expectations are provided that the currency exchange rate, especially the U.S. dollar, remain at the current level versus Danish Kroner for the rest of 2009.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. Slide 17 outlines Novo Nordisk's cash return to shareholders in the recent years with an increasing trend for both dividends and the share repurchase programs.</p>
          <p>The ongoing share repurchase program of 18.5 billion has now been increased by 0.5 billion to 19 billion, reflecting the improved outlook for free cash flow generation in 2009. Novo Nordisk still expects to finalize the share repurchase program before the end of 2009. As a consequence, Novo Nordisk now expects to repurchase B shares equal to a cash value of around 6.5 billion in 2009 in total, of which three billion has been repurchased so far. In the period from 2006 to 2008, Novo Nordisk repurchased B shares equal to a cash value of 12.5 billion in total.</p>
          <p>This concludes our presentation of the financial results. Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen will now moderate the Q&amp;A session. Please note that there will be a maximum limit of two questions per individual, with the objective of allowing as many conference participants as possible to have the opportunity to ask questions.</p>

          <p>Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. A few questions on Victoza <mark type="inaudible" />. Firstly, in terms of the formal feedback you expected. I just want to be clear if you think all options remain on the table as you communicate with the ADA? And then, just related to that, should we get formal approval, do you need to officially submit the data before the end of the quarter, or if &#x2013; I think as you termed it, sharing the data &#x2013; sufficient for that? And then secondly, just on the timeline: is that an official FDA timeline or your expectation, and if it's your expectation, what drives that? Just some color on the process you've had since we last communicated. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Mads Krogsgaard, any comments to the expected formal feedback, all options still open, and what do you base the timeline on?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Sachin, first of all inherently and by definition, until we have formal action from the Agency, all options i.e. from straightforward approval all the way through Class 1 and 2 resubmissions to resubmission based on further studies, and even rejection of course, in principal on the table. So that's kind of repeating what we've been saying for some time.</p>
          <p>With respect to the kind of timing of us saying now that we expect formal action in this quarter, it is based on the talks and dialogue we are having with Agency. It's not based on any formal or official PDUFA action date extension or anything like that. It's based on the interpretation that we have from the dialogue where we've been informed that we should expect to hear formal feedback during this quarter.</p>

          <p>We are constantly submitting all kinds of information as per request from the Agency. I think the issue is with the FDA that as they have a huge amount of reviewers looking into all the details of such a product dossier, there will be questions all the way to the end and they are typically e-mail and electronic submissions is an ongoing process. In contrast to the EU, where you typically have large amounts of questions coming in, in one lump, and then you respond in one big lump, and that happens in an iterative way until you are at the end of the cycle. Here, it is really an ongoing to them, from them to us and back again process that we are undertaking.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, can I just pick up on the last point from Mads. This idea of constantly submitting data through effectively a rolling-filing. Is that the same terminology you are using for what you previously have said in terms of sharing the additional data from the LEAD trials? Are you using that sharing as synonymous with the constantly-submitting? Are we talking about the same thing or are we talking about two different things where, one, you believe there is a rolling filing and are using electronic submission to answer and get back to the FDA; but then separately from that, you've shared this data although not formally submitted it? Or are we taking about everything in the same bucket here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think, Andrew, it's very important to state that what I am talking is not new data from new investigations. It's clarifying questions &#x2013; answers to questions of clarification from the Agency i.e. so that they have been and they are looking into the details of whatever may have been submitted a long time ago, and they are in their good right to ask detailed questions right until the very end.</p>
          <p>So, it's not a question of us submitting new data from new studies, and hence it's not a rolling submission with an update of the dossier, and hence, the label and so on. It is really clarification of issues that have originated from the file, originally in May last year, and the subsequent updates that have been provided. So, I think the discussion we're having with the FDA kind of early June is the one where new data were discussed including the LEAD-6 studies and the two-year calcitonin data from the open-league extensions to the LEAD-2 and 3 studies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Michael Novod from Handelsbanken. Two questions, one is to Europe. We can also see that volumes are weak, and you have a weak quarter starting in Europe again. Now with the launch of Victoza, could you try to elaborate on your long-term strategy? Will that be a way of trying to kick start Europe again?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly on NovoSeven, what should we expect going forward? Now you say that this quarter is really driven by very solid underlying demand. Previously, we've seen some extraordinary items such as inventory buildings and timing of tenders. Going forward, are you more bullish now on the prospects for NovoSeven?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is Lars Rebien here. Yes, it's correct that we have seen and it's surprising some, how weak growth in demand for our insulin in the European markets, whereas we would normally say that on an annual basis that we are expecting growth in volume of five, 6%. It is lower at the moment. The recent quarters have been around three to 4%, and we have submitted &#x2013; it's very difficult for us to explain, because we don't see any underlying changes in demographics that should warrant this.</p>
          <p>But historically, we have had difficulties in giving good guidance on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So our long-term projections are still adhered to to, that we are expecting that the demand overall in the European market should expand with around 5% on an annualized basis.</p>
          <p>With regard to Victoza and the impact and the strategy in Europe, it is clear that we have now been &#x2013; our sales force has now been marketing modern insulins for the last 10 years in the European scene, and although it's very exciting products and we are very encouraged with the progress. This Victoza offers a completely new window in insulin treatment of Type 2 diabetes, it creates excitement on the part of our sales force. And I cannot help believing that it also creates interest which will allow us to have a dialogue about modern insulins.</p>
          <p>So hopefully, we will get two bites of the same coin, in that we will be able to position Victoza with excellent results, and then get second details on our modern insulins with increased interest and increased motivation and energy from our sales force.</p>
          <p>With regard to NovoSeven, it is correct that we have been abysmal in forecasting the growth of NovoSeven couple of years actually; it has surprised us. We are now running at rates which are higher than what we had predicted when we started 2009, and when we look at the expansion in the second quarter for NovoSeven, it was 8%. This is more like the historical levels that we would have predicted. We had, however, a very strong first quarter.</p>
          <p>And so, I am looking at a guidance which is around 10% for this year, and we have been positively surprised by the impact of the room temperature-stable version of NovoSeven, which perhaps we have underestimated the importance of. And it just confirms the overall strategy of Novo Nordisk of continuing to update our products with line extensions, being it formulations and devices, and that has a stronger growth impact than what perhaps even ourselves had predicted.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Next question, please?</p>

          <p>Our next question is from Henrik Simonsen from SEB Enskilda. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Henrik Simonsen, Enskilda. Also a Victoza question. Mads, you mentioned you have a constructive dialogue with the FDA. Are you willing to say &#x2013; shed any light onto what those constructive dialogues include? Are they accepting the two-year calcitonin data, or can you shed any light on that?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, as an add-on to Michael's question, we're also seeing some slowdown in your insulin growth in international operations and Japan-Oceania over the past several quarters. Could you comment a little bit on that and what you intend to do with that slowdown in growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Henrik, this is Lars Rebien. Mads Krogsgaard, would you like to walk around the Victoza question yet again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think we, as such, do not want to comment on the dialogue which we believe should be between the Agency and us. I will say though that the two-year calcitonin data, when that was brought up and discussed formally at the meeting early June, that was not just on the basis of Novo Nordisk wanting to do so. That was on the basis of a pre-agreed-to agenda between the Agency and Novo Nordisk. Hence, the two-year calcitonin data are a important element in the analysis that the FDA has been undertaking since the Advisory Committee Meeting, because it was a formal part of the agenda, together with the efficacy update which included LEAD-6, but by no means any of the data that we've been discussing today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, it's me, Lars Rebien here. On the development of our business in Japan, yes it's correct. With Oceania, especially in Japan, where we have the situation that we have a somewhat faster conversion of human insulins to modern insulins, and when patients are transferred from human insulins to modern insulins, in particular in the starter segment, there are more patients who are switching to Lantus than switching to our product. And that means that we will be losing our, somewhat market share, in current quarters and that might continue for some quarters.</p>
          <p>What we have done in the meantime is that we have decided to expand our sales force in Japan to counter these competitive moves from sanofi-aventis. So, I think you should expect to see continued weak development of our performance in Japan for the remaining of this year, with the hope that we can stabilize the trend into 2010.</p>
          <p>And then, of course we are expecting regulatory approval of Victoza in Japan, and that then hopefully can create the same excitement. And I know it will, because Victoza is ideally suited for the Japanese population, and that will create excitement again, much the same story that I gave you just a minute ago on Europe. So --.</p>

          <p>Yes, well that was always going to come through international operation. We have seen growth rates in China and in India coming down &#x2013; from the very, very, very high level of 30% plus in China and 20% plus in India &#x2013; going down to around 25% in China and around 10% in India currently. Whether or not this is a signal that there is an impact of the financial crisis on demand in these countries, where a lot of the medical consumption is privately paid, is somewhat uncertain by us. But we'll give you a more heads-up and light on that as we see further quarters coming in.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Victoza, again. Sorry, but the process you've given, still unclear to me. Just to come back, I mean the PDUFA rights originally to do from March 23 was extended to May 23. So what actually happens at that time? So did you receive a complete response at that time, or was the PDUFA date extended or VNGA anointed? Also, for Victoza Europe, how the pricing compares with BYETTA, please?</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the original PDUFA date was extended from March 23 to May 23?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And was your comment &#x2013; is that still the same PDUFA date that we're operating under with a slight extension?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so let me be extremely detailed on this one. You will recall that the original PDUFA action date was 10 months after the submission, and that essentially meant on March 23. We then realized already late last year, that there would be a extension of two months which we notified in the form of a company announcement.</p>
          <p>What has happened since then is not only the Advisory Committee on April 2, but also an important meeting on both benefit/risk aspects and risk management planning surrounding Victoza, or liraglutide, in the U.S. setting which happened early June.</p>
          <p>Now since then, there has not been the receival (sic) [receipt] of any neither complete response letter nor any other form of feedback from the Agency. What we are guiding is that the Agency is now digesting, analyzing and concluding upon the discussions they have had with Novo Nordisk and the clarifying answers to the questions that they have posed us to the files since then, in such a way that they will be able to take a formal action during this quarter. So that will be the formal action.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then with regards to the pricing in Europe of Victoza, we can communicate that the pricing of the 1.2 mg dosage of Victoza is similar to that of BYETTA. And of course the extent to which patients will be graduating to 1.8 mg, it will be a higher treatment cost, obviously.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And good afternoon. Thank you. Just to follow-up on Victoza in Europe, I think you discussed, or mentioned earlier, that there is a strong awareness. Is that more awareness among specialists, or are you seeing that the closer to primary care, doctors as well? And how are you approaching the launch here? Is it going to be a blanket approach, both primary and specialists? I don't know if there's any differences in different countries.</p>
          <p>And then, just on &#x2013; there's a possible impact of Lantus and the safety issues there. Have you seen any impact &#x2013;  you've only really talked about Germany as to where there is no <mark type="inaudible" /> Are you seeing any impact on Levemir, either positive or negative, and is it something that your sales reps are actively discussing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, this is Lars Rebien here. I think I'll try to answer both questions. And with regards to the marketing approach, it has been a classic approach that we would normally do with our injectable products, meaning that we have certain targets for getting specialist awareness, and after that follows certain targets for building awareness on the part of GPs, and these targets should be met before launch. And then, after launch of course when we start rolling out, we roll out broadly both to the specialists and to the GPs. And as I mentioned, the reception has been positive, but we are of course also slightly biased &#x2013; we think it's a great product. So, so far so good.</p>
          <p>With regard to Lantus, what we can say is that we have not noticed any significant impact or trend shift in the prescription of Lantus, nor Levemir, nor NPH. Our main concern was of course that we were very adamant about, in showing the public and the patients that our modern insulin, Levemir, is a safe product and we are not at all impacted and implicated in the ongoing discussion about the importance of IGF-1 receptor binding and any potential risk that that confers in terms of cancer. But we have not seen any noticeable significant changes in the pattern. However, we are very encouraged to see continued strong growth of our Levemir product, which to us gives an indication that the public has accepted our differentiation of Levemir. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are the reps actually receiving questions on this topic, or is it just almost like a non-event, if I may?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think initially the reps received quite a number of requests, and our medical departments have been communicating to the extent there has been interest to receive medical information from our medical departments in each individual countries. And we have specifically been able to disseminate information from already published articles, which in fact also are included in the product specifications of our Levemir product, where we have for years been demonstrating that we test our insulins' IGF-1 binding, and hence ensure that we do not have too high links of IGF-1 binding.</p>
          <p>You will probably remember that Novo Nordisk was late to launch a long-acting modern insulin, the reason being the first long-acting modern insulins that we researched was products that had too high affinity for the IGF-1 receptor. And hence, we elected not to pursue these types of modern insulins, rather wait until we found an insulin, which in our case became Levemir, that had a more benign profile in terms of IGF-1 binding. So, we deferred from making a quick entry into the market on that. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for taking my quick question. I'm just focused a bit on some of the other items in your P&amp;L here. If you look at OADs in the quarter, they seem extremely strong and you also of course mention that it could be related to timing of orders. Have you felt any type of impact from the fact that you have lost patent exclusivity for the OAD in Europe and U.S.? And could you give us any type of color on what you expect for the full year for this product class?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, a quick question to Jesper regarding CapEx. You mentioned that you'll keep your expectations unchanged for DKK3 billion in CapEx. Isn't so that much of your CapEx is nominated in U.S. dollars? So my question is &#x2013; are you underlying at the same level or have you maybe upped your CapEx investments for 2009 a little bit? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This is Lars Rebien here. With regard to &#x2013;  let me answer the OAD question, and then Jesper can talk to the CapEx situation. The formal patent expiration in Europe is December this year and it was in April in the United States. And because of a ongoing legal dispute with a potential generic entry in the U.S. market, there has been so far no generic entries into the U.S. market. The reason why we see unusually strong sales in Q2 is that we had a very weak sales in Q2 2008 because China was almost nil in that quarter. So, it's this quarterly comparison which influences the numbers rather than anything else. Jesper, on the CapEx?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Carsten. You're right that we maintained our CapEx guidance of three billion Danish kroner, and you're also noting that the most significant international investment we're undertaking is the building of our new facility into China with the Tianjin filling facility. The movement in the currencies here may make a difference to the tune of 50 million Danish kroner on the remaining part of 2009, and that's not the levels where we would indicate there are changes or no significant changes on CapEx expected.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. One question, just returning to Victoza &#x2013; just could you help me to clarify what is new data and what isn't? In terms of the submission of the calcitonin data that was submitted to the FDA &#x2013;  the two-year calcitonin after obviously the PDUFA dates have passed and for the ADA Meeting &#x2013;  that doesn't seem to me for managing this question, to being formally submitted. So, does &#x2013;  if the CACO can rely on that data for approval, would that mean a need a formal communication i.e. would it need a complete response letter? Could you just help us with the process there?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on the gross margin, obviously very, very good improvements. Still, I wondered if you could give us any color on the future gross margin improvements? I think there is maybe 100 million we're expecting for 2010. But I wondered if you could give us any longer-term thoughts on how production efficiencies may trend into the future? Many thanks.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Mads, would it be so that the data which has been shared after the Advisory Committee Meeting in June this year, which was a two-year calcitonin data, would have to be formally submitted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, Richard, let me shed a little bit of light on how the process is vis-&#xE0;-vis these calcitonin discussions that we had in June together with the risk management and the efficacy discussions, benefit-risk. Essentially, preceding such a meeting which is a rather big event with major participation from both parties, there is a long discussion phase in which it becomes evident exactly what kind of statistical analysis, what kind of format, what kind of reporting and pre-meeting package delivery the Agency expects.</p>
          <p>So, it not so that there has not been a reporting of these data to the Agency. That actually took place prior to the Meeting in a relatively extensive form as per their request. However, if you're asking the question whether this needs to take place in the form of a Class 1 or 2 kind of resubmission, at this point that is of course not for us to decide. But we have in fact submitted the LEAD-2 and 3 calcitonin data in a very extensive format already prior to the Meeting and subsequent analysis as per request &#x2013; additional analysis from statistics and elsewhere had. of course, also been  conducted and submitted as per Agency request.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mads. Then for gross margin discussion, Jesper?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Richard, you appreciate that we have made an underlying improvement in the first half of 150 basis points, and we're expecting for the full year to have slightly more than 100 basis points in improvement for the full year as the comparisons become more challenging in the second half. Also note just on currency that the very positive currency impact of 130 basis points for the first two quarters will turn into a full-year positive currency effect of around 50 basis points.</p>
          <p>But if we look at the underlying development of 150 basis points this year, it's close to 100 which are relating to improved efficiency, still predominately coming from more efficient fill -- and production of our insulins, and the other parts coming from filling the insulin especially insulin as far as it moved up in volume.</p>
          <p>We're also this year benefiting a slight mix effect as our NovoSeven franchise has grown faster than the average, and it is the highest margin in our portfolio. So, that's been a positive. And then, pricing in the U.S. has also slightly benefited the gross margin this year.</p>
          <p>If we look to next year, of course making predictions on product mix and especially prices in the U.S. and global prices are tough. But if we just look at the production efficiency and look at what can we realistically achieve next year and also in 2011, it remains our expectation that the continued penetration of our modern insulins will enable us to deliver improvements in our gross margin in local currency terms in the ballpark of 50 to 100 basis points, 2010 over 2009, and an additional 50 to 100 basis points in '11 over '10.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Just a question back on to Victoza. At the ADA Meeting, I think you used the phrase that you would give us more clarity at the 6th of August conference call. And I don't know if I am missing, but I'm not actually sensing any particularly extra clarity here. That, in combination with the fact that you've pushed out the Phase III trails in the obesity setting &#x2013;  can you just comment on those two points that I've just raised and whether I should read anything into that in terms of how your discussions with the FDA may be going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is Lars Rebien here. Mads Krogsgaard, would you like to take a turn around again on Victoza?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the answer to your last question is no i.e. you should not read anything into the update we are providing in terms of how the dialogue is going. Because what we said at the ADA, which I recall very distinctly, is indeed that we'd seek to provide an update at the first half release and increase clarity to the extent that we could. And the clarity we are providing today is that we can now inform you that we expect a formal feedback this quarter from the Agency.</p>
          <p>And it is based on this relatively soon-to-come feedback from the Agency, that we have made the decision to not initiate the remaining two out of the three Phase III obesity trials for liraglutide until we know &#x2013; whenever that may happen &#x2013; that we have an approved label for Type 2 diabetes with a label and precautions that we understand such that we can build-in those elements into the final protocols that are then kind of released for Phase III trial conduct. That is the decision to not initiate further studies until we have the clarity. And hopefully, once we have clarity, we will be able to decide on future Phase III development. The first trial in obesity was recruited very rapidly, and is of course ongoing as we speak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, and just my second question relates to R&amp;D. Can you give us some feel for where you expect that to fall for the full year in terms of a percentage of sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's Jesper Brandgaard will answer that question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The consequence of the delay in the start of the obesity trials have left us with an unusually low level of R&amp;D, but also on the other hand, a unusually high operating margin &#x2013; in fact, reported terms exceeding our long-term target of 30%. We intend in the second half to invest significantly more in R&amp;D as we start the large trials with the second generation modern insulins. And the guidance for full-year R&amp;D would be in the ballpark of 15.5%, and that would leave the ratio in the second half of the year at around 17% of sales. So we expect a significant higher level in second half of this year.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Martin Parkh&#xF8;i from Danske Bank. Firstly, I have a question to Mads regarding the NovoSeven product that you terminate within the subcutaneous injections. How can you feel so confident in the long-acting subcutaneous injection? And then, second question which is again back to Europe where we have seen some poor growth rates in insulin in the last few quarters.  If we assume that this will not pick-up in the coming quarters, when will it actually be difficult for Novo Nordisk as a group to continuously grow double-digits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Mads Krogsgaard, a comment on the program and also around subcutaneous injection of NovoSeven for inhibitor patients?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, Martin, the way we test our compounds before making the decision to go into human clinical studies is, in this case, based on bioavailability assessments in certain monkeys. And the fact is that the bioavailability of the recombinant factor VIIa native protein seemed to be acceptable when we made the decision to move into Phase 1, but we have come below the threshold for where we find it commercially viable for that compound.</p>
          <p>However, for the long-acting derivative which is currently and soon going into the clinic, the situation is different because the bioavailability in the very same monkey model was actually higher. And I can, some other point, elaborate on the finer clinical details of why that may be, but I think that should wait for another time. But this is the reason behind why we find it relevant to move into the clinic with a long-acting analogue, subcutaneously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Martin, this is Lars Rebien here. About the performance in Europe, it is not our expectations long-term that the market growth of insulins should be around 3% in Europe. As I mentioned before, we believe that the demand should be rather on 5%, and if possible after that 5%, as the quarters progress and we'll put those assessments into our forecast when we give you guidance as for future performance in Europe.</p>
          <p>Then in addition to that, we have the Victoza which is going to be significant for Europe, and we have a significant negative demand with the patent expiration of NovoLog in Europe which is going to impact in our first.</p>
          <p>So, we basically will be giving you an expected update on the growth outlook in 2010, at least some top-line numbers in Q3 when we announce the Q3 numbers. Then we'll start to give you the heads-up where we'll factor all of this in.</p>
          <p>And then, we'd like to congratulate with your championship in marathon again this year.</p>

          <p>All right. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for listening in to this first-half release for Novo Nordisk, and we'd be looking forward to talking to you over the phone with our Investor Relations officers and we'll be back with the Q3 update. And certainly also, if and when we receive information from the Agency, we will be communicating immediately as you can imagine. Thank you.</p>
