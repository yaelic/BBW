          <p>Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to FEMSA's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>During this conference call, management may discuss certain forward-looking statements concerning FEMSA's future performance and should be considered as good faith estimates made by the company. These forward-looking statements reflect management expectations and are based upon currently available data. Actual results are subject to future events and uncertainties, which can materially impact the company's actual performance.</p>
          <p>At this time, I will now turn the conference over to Javier Astaburuaga, FEMSA's CFO. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to FEMSA's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Results Earnings Conference Call. Juan Fonseca and <mark type="ph" /> Jos&#xE9; Castro (0:54) are with us today as well.</p>
          <p>In terms of the operating results, we will focus on the consolidated figures for FEMSA and on FEMSA Comercio's results, since many of you probably had the opportunity to participate in Coca-Cola FEMSA's conference call earlier today. As you have also no doubt read our press release and seen our detailed results, we will use this call to discuss some of the highlights and main trends we are seeing in our businesses.</p>
          <p>Let me begin by commenting on some of the highlights of what turned to be a strong 2011 for our company. Despite the volatile economic environment, demand for our products remained healthy and we managed to convert that demand into robust financial results by focusing our time, efforts and resources on the extraordinary opportunities for Coca-Cola FEMSA and OXXO.</p>
          <p>For Coca-Cola FEMSA this was a historic year. We leveraged our financial and operating flexibility to firmly advance on our strategy to grow through accretive mergers and acquisitions, from our incursion into the dairy category, through our joint acquisition of Grupo Industrias Lacteas in Panama, to our mergers with the beverage divisions of Grupo Tampico, Grupo CIMSA, and Grupo Fomento Queretano in Mexico.</p>
          <p>And at FEMSA Comercio, our robust top-line growth in 2011 was driven by our continuing store expansion and our comparable same-store sales growth of 9.2%, ahead of trend and reinforcing our position as an industry benchmark. Our progress in mapping and understanding consumers' needs and adjusting our value proposition to better fulfill those needs significantly contributed to our same-store sales growth.</p>
          <p>We also made great strides in our sustainability efforts, from launching joint watershed conservation initiatives with world class NGOs, to making significant progress in our renewable energy programs, particularly our large wind power project in the State of Oaxaca, to ensuring that every one of our managers now incorporates sustainability objectives in their annual performance metrics.</p>
          <p>In particular, today we are happy to note that the financing is in place to build this wind farm, the largest in Latin America, which will generate almost 400 megawatts of clean renewable power and will supply the Mexican operations to FEMSA and Heineken for 20 years. We have successfully exited our short-term role as investors and will now remain solely as energy off-takers.</p>
          <p>This project underscores our commitment to derive as much as 85% of our energy needs from renewable sources, while making perfect economic sense. So, in many ways, 2011 was a very good example of what we believe our business model can achieve: sustainable organic growth across our businesses, leveraging our operations and our skill set, complemented with value-creating mergers and acquisitions.</p>
          <p>As we often do in these calls, let's spend a brief moment on our perception of the environment on the drivers for consumption, particularly in our key Mexico market, where we have a slightly improving picture in the last few months. GDP and manufacturing activity, as measured by the <mark type="ph" /> GI (4:24) are up mid-single digit, while the Mexico consumer confidence index has rebounded and seems to be back on an upward leg. Unemployment levels are also showing a favorable trend, with indicators well below 5% during the fourth quarter. Having said that, as you have seen, our results in Mexico during 2011 exceeded the macro trends, driven by our business execution but also helped by external factors such as dry and warm weather, particularly during the first half of the year. You should expect the results this year to track the macro data a bit more closely, absent extraordinary factors.</p>
          <p>Moving on briefly to the macro environment in other markets where we operate in 2011, Colombia and Argentina performed better than Venezuela and Brazil. In Colombia, low unemployment and low inflation contributed to deliver mid-single digit GDP growth, while in Argentina GDP grew in the high-single digits but in the face of low-double digit reported inflation.</p>
          <p>For its part, Brazil experienced a slowdown, with GDP growing only in the low-single, while Venezuela showed moderate growth, but with very high inflation, approaching 30%.</p>
          <p>Moving on to discuss our consolidated quarterly numbers, we are again encouraged by the results. Total revenues increased 24.5% and operating income grew 25%. On an organic basis, excluding the integration of three months of Grupo Tampico and one month of CIMSA, total revenue increased by a couple of points less. These results were driven by double-digit growth in total revenues and operating income at both Coca-Cola FEMSA and FEMSA Comercio. As has been the case since the Heineken transaction in 2010, these figures do not include the results of the beer operations.</p>
          <p>For the full year, including acquisitions, total revenues increased 19.6% and operating income grew 19.4%. On an organic basis, accretion total revenues was similar at 19%. For the quarter, the line labeled Participation in Heineken results, represents FEMSA's implied 20% participation in Heineken's fourth quarter net income. Importantly, for the full year, the line represents FEMSA's actual 20% participation in Heineken's net income derived from Heineken's full year numbers reported approximately two weeks ago.</p>
          <p>And before leaving the subject of net income, we see the net income from continuing operations increased 9.3% in the fourth quarter and 15.2% for the year. As we explained in our press release, this increase reflects growth in income from operations and the variation in FEMSA's 20% participation in Heineken's net income, which more than compensated the effect of non-recurring items. These items include the fact that in the second half of 2010 we'd registered income from the sale of Mundet and of our flexible packaging business, setting up a tough comparison for 2011. It also incorporates the impact from the write-off of certain non-productive assets at Coca-Cola FEMSA.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate was 25.6% for the quarter and 27.1% for the year. And going forward, we expect our tax rate will fluctuate around similar levels; that is in the mid to high-single 20s.</p>
          <p>Moving to our cash position, during the fourth quarter, we went from having a consolidated net cash of Ps. 7 billion at the end of September to having a consolidated net debt position of Ps. 1.1 billion at the end of December, reflecting the assumption of approximately Ps. 4.8 billion of debt related to the Tampico and CIMSA transactions, outflows related to short-term backend-loaded CapEx at Coca-Cola FEMSA, as well as our second dividend payment for the year, all of which were partially offset by strong cash generation, mainly at Coca-Cola FEMSA.</p>
          <p>And staying on the subject of dividends, our Board of Directors agreed yesterday to propose a dividend of Ps. 6.2 billion to be paid in 2012, subject to approval by our shareholders at our meeting to be held in March. This amount represents an increase of 35% over the amount paid in 2011 and is consistent with our long-term objective of increasing our return of cash to shareholders, while retaining our financial and strategic flexibility. In fact, our dividend has increased by a factor of almost 4X since 2009.</p>
          <p>Moving on to discuss our operations and beginning with FEMSA Comercio, we should highlight that the rollout of new store openings continues to move forward according to plan. We opened 413 net new stores during the fourth quarter, which means we opened 1,135 stores in the last 12 months, slightly ahead of our objective for 2011. For 2012 you should expect a similar number of net new stores openings, slightly above 1,100.</p>
          <p>Revenues increased 17% during the quarter. Same-store sales were up a healthy 8%, reflecting improvements in average traffic as well as ticket. Our average ticket increased 4% and traffic grows 4.1%, continued to reflect progress in our management of category and purchase and occasion mix.</p>
          <p>We continued to benefit from price increases taken earlier in the year by several of our suppliers for important categories, such as soft drinks, beer, pastries, cigarettes and others, as well as from OXXO's continuous fine-tuning of its value proposition within the store, as we keep improving the fit between that value proposition and a growing range of consumer needs.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, gross margin expanded 70 basis points, again, driven mainly by a positive mix shift, due to the growth of higher-margin categories and more effective collaboration and execution with our key supplier partners, combined with a more efficient use of promotion-related marketing resources. In turn, these drivers and trends have allowed gross margin to expand by 60 basis points for the full year.</p>
          <p>In terms of operating margin, this quarter, FEMSA Comercio posted a 10 basis point margin contraction, reflecting mainly incremental expenses, such as the strengthening of FEMSA's Comercio organizational structure, mainly IT-related, as well as certain targeted marketing efforts to promote key initiatives toward the end of the year in specific categories.</p>
          <p>Also, as is always the case, the rapid pace of store openings put some pressure on the selling expense line, as the new stores generate expenses from day one, where revenues take a while to get up to speed. For the full year, FEMSA Comercio's operating margin expanded 10 basis points, very much in line with our long-term expectation.</p>
          <p>However, as we have stated before, we will maintain the pace of investment required to strengthen our platform and develop the capabilities that we need to keep Comercio growing into a cutting-edge retailer. In other words, we will always privilege investing in the long-term fundamentals of the business over managing the margins for the short-term.</p>
          <p>And finally, Coca-Cola FEMSA revenues for the quarter increased 29% versus the comparable period of 2010, as a result of strong revenue growth mainly in Mexico, Central America, Colombia and Argentina and reflecting the incorporation of three months of the Tampico operations and one month of CIMSA in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Operating income increased 25% on the same basis. If we exclude integration of Grupo Tampico and Grupo CIMSA, total revenues grew approximately 24%, and if you were unable to participate in Coke FEMSA's conference call earlier today, you can access a replay of their webcast for additional details on the results.</p>
          <p>As we start the new year, we have our work cut out for us. At Coca-Cola FEMSA, we have to focus on integrating and capturing the potential synergies from our recent acquisitions, while keeping the foot on the gas in our pursuit of organic growth. As you know, last week Coke announced that it has entered into 12-month exclusivity agreement with The Coca-Cola Company to evaluate the potential acquisition of a controlling ownership stake in the bottling operations of the Philippines.</p>
          <p>We believe that costs, expertise and substantial track record operating in fragmented markets and emerging economies can be effectively deployed in this territory and contribute significantly towards expanding the penetration of and consumer preference for The Coca-Cola Company's brand in these markets. We will keep you posted on this development as appropriate.</p>
          <p>And at FEMSA Comercio we have to maintain the rapid pace of store openings, while continuing to fine-tune our value proposition to keep driving same-store sales. And while we do all these, we must continue to be vigilant in our search for incremental transactions that may enable us to put our financial and strategic flexibility to work. And this must be done against difficult comparison bases and a fairly challenging backdrop. While we can count on our operators to continue to execute the strategy and to continue to improve our businesses, we cannot count on the weather being as warm and as dry this year as it was last year and we cannot count on such a constructive pricing environment for us and for our suppliers either.</p>
          <p>Yes, many of our suppliers have already taken moderate price hikes in 2012 but not necessarily of the same magnitude as a year ago. On the other hand, this will be an election year in many of our territories, including Mexico, and that usually fosters economic activity that in turn supports our growth. But there are also significant headwinds in the environment so we have to redouble our efforts.</p>
          <p>We also expect 2012 to be a year of significant investment in our operations, largely driven by a rapid pace of growth and the resulting needs for increased capacity. CapEx for Coca-Cola FEMSA should reach $710 million, including half of the investment needed to build our new plants in Brazil and Colombia, while FEMSA Comercio expects to deploy $350 million for a total of CapEx of approximately $1.1 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>And on a final housekeeping note, as you know, we will begin reporting under IFRS as of the first quarter of this year, in accordance with the timetable set by Mexican Securities Regulation. However, in order to make the transition smoother, we will be releasing our 2011 quarterly and full year numbers under IFRS before the end of March, and our Investor Relations team will be fully available to walk you through the adjustments we are making to comply with IFRS. That way, hopefully, you will be completely familiar with the changes ahead of our first quarter 2010 results due out in late April.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would like now to open the call for your questions. Operator, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take the first question from Lauren Torres with HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Javier, it seems like you are getting a bit more positive with respect to the consumer environment and the macro data, compared to what we heard over the last couple quarters. I was just curious how you think that translates into your results? This year you've had great same-store sales growth at OXXO, coming off of maybe a more difficult comparison. Do you think you could replicate those types of growth rates? And if you do think so, how do you do that? Is it through ticket sales? Is it more traffic? I'm just trying to get a better sense on the consumer? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, Lauren. Yes, I think that in the end of 2011, it turned out to be a better year than anticipated when we started the year. And I would say that going forward our intention and the main thrust of the whole organization in OXXO is do whatever it takes to keep the pace of same-store sales growth. If you look at what we've been doing is pretty much, again, fine-tuning the value proposition and I would say that the main contributor for growth have been the traffic. We tend to believe that that will continue to going into 2012.</p>
          <p>The effect of the traffic coming a little bit down has a number of components, basically the mix of the products that people are buying, the composition of the average ticket because of the behavior of the categories, which are important, such as air time and the likes. We feel more confident then to grow the same-store sales growth through the traffic lever than through the tickets lever.</p>
          <p>So all-in-all, yes, we feel that, I would say the macro environment combined with the elections taking place in 2012, coupled with what we have been doing inside the store to bring more people into it, I think we're confident that we will continue, I wouldn't say at the same pace of growth, but at least on positive numbers on the same-store sales growth indicator, Lauren.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. And just on the cost side too at OXXO you were able to improve margins and we saw good cost management there. Is that something that you think is also achievable this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most &#x2013; most of the improvement at the gross margin, again, it's coming from a change in mix on, I mean, the higher gross margin categories have been growing faster than the lower margin. We think that should continue. Nevertheless, the expansion in 2012 I'm just guessing might be maybe smaller than the one we had in 2011, which was huge at 70 basis. So &#x2013; but all-in-all, we think that the work that we're doing in terms of, again, building a healthy business financially in terms of the gross margin platform, we think we're going to be again successful doing that again in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hi, Javier.  A quick question. I just want to confirm a number regarding the net cash that you have outside of Coca-Cola FEMSA at the holding level, even post the dividend payment, because I'm getting a big number? And I'll ask you a follow-up on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, just on the top of my head, I think it's about $600 million, Alan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm getting $650 million...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sure our Investor Relations teams can follow that offline with you later, but for everybody on the line, I think it's slightly above $600 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, no, the number that I'm getting. I'm getting $650 million. So, I mean, it's a big number, what are the preferred uses of that? How should we see that number evolving going forward? And, specifically, let me ask you two questions that are related to that. One of them, I'm noting that there's about $0.5 billion dollars of CapEx that is not related to OXXO, that's not related to Coca-Cola FEMSA, so if you could remind us if this is logistics or is it refrigerators? Or is there something new going on there? And the last question that I have is, if you could give us an update regarding your thinking in terms of OXXO's international expansion. I assume that you're not thinking of taking OXXO in the Philippines right now, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That was a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:24)...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was a joke.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, besides OXXO and Coca-Cola FEMSA actually the &#x2013; I mean, the remaining CapEx is, should be less than around $50 million, not $0.5 billion, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, pesos, pesos, I said pesos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's very small stuff; most of it related with the expansion of FEMSA Logistica going into Coca-Cola FEMSA's territories in Latin America, very successfully, I have to say so, in Brazil, in Colombia and Costa Rica. And so that's basically it. A little bit of that also it's towards improving our capacity of refrigerators as well, but that's most of it. And we have said that, again, we recognize that $600 million excess cash at the ex-cost system is a lot of money. The preferred use for that, again, will be to find opportunities that, again, leverage what we know to do in terms of small format retail in Latin America environment. And I would say that we feel very, very confident, I cannot really be more specific on that, Alan, for the time being, but we feel very confident we will find uses for that cash during 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And those uses are related to OXXO, or related to retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're related to the businesses in which FEMSA believes, which are Coca-Cola FEMSA and small format retail. And there is OXXO today, as we know it. But, as you know, we have also been looking at some opportunities in small format retail, which are pretty much complementary with the skill set required to operate  <mark type="ph" /> its sister (23:18).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, no, I hear you, I hear you. Thanks so much for the answer, Javier. All the best.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good day, everybody. Javier, I had a question with respect to occupancy, pre-operating expenses, and I was curious as to how those are trending? And then as you build densities in your existing markets, I was curious as to whether or not you're finding it easier or more difficult to find locations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Bob. I think as we have discussed this in the past, we have a criteria to measure the quality of our openings, which we call the batting average, which is pretty much a measure that reflects on what we estimate the performance of a certain new store would look like on a certain timeframe, as opposed to reality. And I am pleased to comment that our batting average is pretty much at all-time highs, with exception of mainly maybe three or four out of the more than 60 cities in which we operate. But, all-in-all, it is pretty, pretty healthy. So I would say that if you look at the amount of stores we're opening on a yearly basis, as opposed to the base, we're, I would say slightly increasing the number of stores. So, the pre-operating expenses to pretty much open a store, I would say are pretty much in line with the historic level. So we don't really have there a change in the dynamics of the business.</p>
          <p>And on your last point, to tell you the truth, in certain places and very selective places where we have very, very high penetration, but we might have I would say a little bit more work to do in order to secure the best locations for new openings. But we are still very far away, even in those cities in which we feel we have a very, very high penetration already, to get to a point of saturation. And I'm speaking about selected cities in the north, namely Tijuana, Mexicali and Monterrey, for example, which have some of the highest ratios of the number of stores per population. We still are finding ways again to open new stores in places in which in the past we were not able to do so, either because the value proposition was not suitable for the environment in which those stores are now being located, as well as now having the ability to operate a smaller store, in terms of the selling space and bringing down the fixed costs and, therefore, bringing down the required sales to meet the point of equilibrium throughout the store.</p>
          <p>So all-in-all I would say that it's &#x2013; I would say in OXXO, the same phenomena that I'm sure Hector Trevi&#xF1;o shared with you on the conference call on Coca-Cola FEMSA, which is, even though we have the highest penetration of Coca-Cola brand products and, specifically, Coca-Cola brand in Mexico, the brand continues to grow. And I think that merits a lot the work that our people do in terms of finding, again, a better way to satisfy consumer needs for different consumption occasions through packaging, through availability, through promotional activity and, of course, through selecting the right price points for our products. So I would say that in OXXO we're still experiencing the same phenomena as I explained, Bob.</p>

          <p>That's great. Thank you. And then with respect to the occupancy part of the question, are you seeing any changes in terms of occupancy costs? And then you addressed your expansion for this year, you said about 1,100 stores, but could you let us know how Colombia is going and what you expect in Colombia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. No, occupancy costs I would say are &#x2013; we're not experiencing in Mexico, as in some other parts of the world, a radical change either upwards and downwards on the cost of the leases that we're having, so I think that that's an element that we have under control. So there is not really anything different there from what we've been experiencing in the past.</p>
          <p>And Colombia, this is going I would say, well, still under the phase of, again, finding the right value proposition. We opened less than 10 stores in 2011, we think that we will open more than 10 stores in 2012. Some of those stores that will be opened are now going into places which we're now going to start testing different things, such as habits of consumption of different segments of consumers. And so it's still part of the phase in which we are, again, refining our value proposition. So &#x2013; but we're pleased with the results that we're achieving. We are testing, again, a combination of format which is typical to store with a little bit more emphasis on the fast food offering, in combination with a local retailer in Colombia. So we're pleased with the progress. Of course, we would like it to be faster so we can start getting into the expansion phase more rapidly. But we're I would say that we're pleased so far on how things are going.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, Javier, and everyone. Javier, going back to the question of use of cash, given that Coca-Cola may be selling assets to you this year, would you also take that as an opportunity to potentially buy some of their Coca-Cola FEMSA shares from them in order to go back to your &#x2013; to your previous holding percentage &#x2013; holding in KOF, which has been diluted lately?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask two questions. Javier, one is just to get your perspective. I guess it's almost two years from the sale of the beer company to Heineken in exchange for the 20% stake. And any kind of observations you have for us in terms of and how you think about that as part of the portfolio for FEMSA over the medium-term?</p>
          <p>And then on OXXO I wanted to ask a question, maybe there's two parts of it. I mean, OXXO has just done a phenomenal job in terms of the expansion over the last few years but it seems to be now &#x2013; the kind of &#x2013; they're settling into this sort of 1100 stores a year, which is phenomenal, I mean, it's three stores a day or something. But clearly when you see the opportunity in that space and you've got the access to capital, is there or is it just sort of physically that's what OXXO's capable of? Or could you possibly accelerate the expansion? And as part of that, when you talk about $350 million of CapEx, maybe I haven't been thinking about the numbers enough, but I was thinking that OXXO normally spends about $250 million, so there seems to be some incremental spending in OXXO and if you could give us any sense of what that incremental spending is dedicated to? So, sorry I think there's about three questions in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, there are three questions actually. Lore, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first one I think, again, I really do not have nothing new to say regarding that. We're &#x2013; I mean, as you 're saying, we're two years into having this stake of Heineken and still one year more to go until the lock-off expires. So far I think what I can basically share is that, again, we have been working very closely with the company in terms of trying to contribute to some of our thinking and sharing some of our experiences in developing our businesses in this part of the world, as well as trying to support them as much as we can.</p>
          <p>And, again, I just only can reiterate at this point of time that we are, again, thinking about what's best for the business for the long-term, as if we will remain a long-term investors with the business, recognizing that we have the flexibility to decide what's most convenient for FEMSA shareholders for the long-term regarding this investment; so, sorry, but there's really not a new insight or anything new to share so far on that behalf.</p>
          <p>And on the OXXO expansion I think you raised the good point. We have, again, debated a lot about the convenience or not of increasing the pace of growth. And you might argue that at least on a moderate way, we might have taken that route. But if you look at what we're trying to do at the same time, we still think that this is the right level of opening of stores. Once you look &#x2013; if you think of OXXO and you look at this numbers of stores on a yearly basis being opened, the numbers comes to be mind-boggling. But the truth of the matter is that the company works as a system. So it takes advantage of having more than 50 organizations doing this kind of work. So once you split the more than 1,000 between those 50 areas, then you find out that each area needs to open a little bit more than 20 stores a year. So you cannot think of this large group of people put together in a room trying to open 1,100 stores a year. But, again, a very decentralized organization but following very, very structured and precise criteria to do that job.</p>
          <p>But when you think about the number of other stuff that are taking place in those cities in which we have already close to 10,000 stores, this is a right number that would have come up in terms of, again, balancing the act of changing the way we do things within the store, created a lot of new infrastructure outside of the door of the stores, which are supposed to be facilitating and potentially leveraging new capabilities going forward for the stores. So we have come back again, and we have made exercises, and we have thought about and debated a lot about if it was good for us to move to the 1,200 or 1,300 level in terms of store openings and we have concluded that this is the right balance of expanding and improving the business as we think of it. So we will remain I think in the 1,100 arena, hopefully, going closer 1,200, but still within that range.</p>
          <p>And finally the CapEx number, I would say that the slowly but surely increase of now coming to $350 million for 2012, I would say it's a combination of, again, a slightly increase in the number of stores, a higher amount of CapEx dedicated to refurbishing and maintenance of those existing store base, which as it continues to grow, it could require maintenance CapEx, which are accounted in that way, as well as the deployment of our point-of-sale system, which is also a big CapEx project from the IT point of view.</p>
          <p>So, all-in-all, I would say that those things are pretty much the reasons behind the amount. And if you look at our total CapEx investment, as a percentage of sales, I think that has basically stayed pretty, pretty stable among time, even going into 2012?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about the taxes paid in 2011 or this quarter. There was a big increase and I just want to know what &#x2013; is this increase going to be permanent? And exactly how much was paid out in cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Hillary. This is Juan. Actually, what we mentioned or Javier mentioned in his opening remarks, the effective tax rate that you see this quarter is very much in line with what you should expect going forward, which is in the mid to high 20s. Last year, we had an abnormally low effective tax rate, but that was really more of a one-off situation. So it's really not that you see an increase from normal levels. It's really that we are where we will be going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the second part of your question, most of the taxes are paid throughout the year. We have the obligation to make monthly payments on the income tax. So even though you see prohibitions within the quarter, I would say there is not a significant difference on what we create as a provision, as compared with the payment. There is always a lagging effect on that, which is basically close, the difference between the provision of payments and the definite payments, which takes place every April. So &#x2013; but you shouldn't &#x2013; if you're looking at or trying to define the &#x2013; in terms of cash flow what it meant, you shouldn't assume a very different figure for cash flow as the one you're seeing for the P&amp;L.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Javier, I have two questions. The first one is just a follow-up from your CapEx plans. You mentioned you're investing in new IT systems in your point of sales. What is actually &#x2013; exactly is that investment is? And at what stage you are of the investment? And the second question is when you think about the use of cash that you have, and you mentioned that you're studying the possibility of entering to new formats, I imagine in Mexico, how you would think about going &#x2013; you would grow on the greenfield route or would you prefer to enter a new retail segment via acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure. The POS, the point of sale system project in OXXO is a multi-year project, which implies buying of a software off the shelf and then making the adaptations required. And now it's in the phase of deploying that into the store base. And I would say that's a project which can be measured on tens of millions of dollars, which should be taking the bulk of the investment within 2012 and 2013. And so that's basically the first question. And the second one...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's I would say we think, again, that we've &#x2013; that we would be better off if we can get a foothold through small acquisitions that we can grow from there, as opposed to starting from greenfield but we are not discarding any of the two.</p>
