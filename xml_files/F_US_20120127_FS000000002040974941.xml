          <p>Great day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Ford Motor Company Fixed Income Conference Call. My name is Catina and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards the end of the presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Sean Ryan, Manager, Ford Fixed Income Investor Relations. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Catina, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team I would like to thank you for spending time with us this morning.</p>
          <p>Presenting today will be Bob Shanks, Ford Vice President and Controller; Michael Seneski, Ford Credit Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Schloss, Ford Vice President and Treasurer. We also have some other management who are joining us for the call, including Marion Harris, Assistant Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Global Accounting and George Sharp, Executive Director Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Before we begin I would like to review a couple of items. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the slides we will be using today have been posted on Ford Motor Company's Investor and Media websites for your reference.</p>
          <p>The financial results discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our Form 10-K. Additionally, the financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis. Any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide deck.</p>
          <p>Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual, quarterly and current reports to the SEC.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ford Vice President and Controller, Bob Shanks. Bob?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sean, and we'll start on slide 1 with an overall summary of our 2011 fourth quarter and full year results.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter results reflected higher volume and net revenue. They were our tenth consecutive quarterly pre-tax operating profit, and we also generated positive automotive operating-related cash flow.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, North America drove our automotive profitability with strong performance. Since the third quarter earnings call, however, the deteriorating external environment impacted most of our automotive operations outside of North America. In addition, commodity costs, exchange rates and the floods in Thailand all had a greater than expected adverse impact. As a result, our margins were somewhat lower than the guidance that we provided in October.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we improved total company pre-tax operating profit and improved automotive operating-related cash flow, enabling us to further strengthen our balance sheet. In addition, Ford Credit continued to perform strongly, providing significant contribution to our overall profit, consistent with our guidance. And during the quarter and throughout the year, we continued to invest for future growth and the stronger product lineup around the world.</p>
          <p>Now turning to 2012, we expect to continue improving our business and deliver solid profits and strong automotive operating-related cash flow while working to strengthen our operations in Europe and South America and continue to grow. We believe our 2011 performance, as well as our guidance for next year confirm that we're well on track to achieve the mid-decade outlook we provided in the middle of last year.</p>
          <p>Now let's look more closely at the financial highlights of the quarter and full-year 2011. Slide 2 summarizes our fourth quarter and full year business results, compared with a year ago. In the fourth quarter, vehicle wholesales were 1.4 million units, up 30,000 units or 3% from 2010. Revenue was about $35 billion, an increase of about $2 billion, or 6%. Pre-tax operating profit excluding special items was $1.1 billion; $189 million lower than a year ago. Earnings were $0.20 per share. Net income attributable to Ford was $13.6 billion, which includes a favorable special item in our taxes totaling $12.4 billion. This reflects a release of almost all of the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. We also had favorable pre-tax special items of $349 million. Earnings were $3.40 per share.</p>
          <p>Automotive operating-related cash flow was $700 million, which was the seventh consecutive quarter of positive performance. In the full year, compared with the year-ago, vehicle wholesales increased by 7% and revenue improved 13%. Full year pre-tax operating profit excluding special items was $8.8 billion, a $463 million improvement, and net income attributable to Ford was $20.2 billion, which was $13.7 billion higher than a year ago, reflecting mainly the tax valuation allowance release.</p>
          <p>Operating-related cash flow was $5.6 billion for the year, and we ended the year with $22.9 billion of automotive gross cash, and with automotive gross cash exceeding debt by $9.8 billion. This is a net cash improvement of $8.4 billion, compared with a year ago, and it's $1.7 billion higher than the third quarter. Despite a challenging external environment, we had a good fourth quarter and a strong full year, reflecting the strength of our business and our One Ford plan.</p>
          <p>Now turning to slide 3 and our automotive gross cash and operating-related cash flow, as I mentioned, we ended the quarter with $22.9 billion of automotive gross cash, which was an increase of $2.1 billion from the end of the third quarter. As mentioned, our automotive operating-related cash flow was $700 million, and our cash flow before changes in debt and pension contributions was $1.9 billion, including receipts from financial services of $1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Net debt inflows in the quarter totaled $300 million, which reflected primarily an increase in the low-cost loans for development of advanced technologies. We made payments of $100 million to our non-U.S. funded pension plans. For the full year, automotive operating-related cash flow was $5.6 billion and cash flow before changes in debt and pension contributions totaled $9.3 billion. Looking ahead to 2012, we expect strong, positive automotive operating-related cash flow.</p>
          <p>Slide 4 summarizes our automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of the fourth quarter. Automotive debt was $13.1 billion at the end of the year, and we continued to make significant progress in improving our balance sheet. We ended the year with net cash of $9.8 billion, which was an improvement of $8.4 billion from the end of 2010. Our automotive liquidity is now more than $32 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 5 summarizes 2011 results for our planning assumptions and key metrics, compared with the plan that we shared at the beginning of the year. Overall, we achieved solid results across the business in 2011, meeting or exceeding our plan in most instances. Importantly, we delivered improved total company pre-tax operating profit and automotive operating-related cash flow, compared with 2010.</p>
          <p>U.S. and Europe industry sales were in line with our expectations, and we met or exceeded our share targets for the U.S. Both structural and commodity costs increased in 2011 as we had expected, and capital spending was less than we projected due mainly to efficiencies. Shortfalls to our plan occurred in quality in the U.S., and with our automotive operating margin. We believe we have the quality issues well in hand, and are back on track to deliver quality levels that are among the best in the business. Our operating margin shortfall can be more than explained by higher commodity costs, which reduced our margin by nearly two percentage points. So, in summary, 2011 was a strong year, and it kept us well on track to our mid-decade outlook.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to 2012 on slide 6. The entire Ford organization is energized as we enter this year, keenly aware of the challenges, but also the opportunities that we face in the current environment. While the uncertainties surrounding the European debt crisis, and its impact on the global economy presents a challenge for everyone, our strong product portfolio, and the prospect of global economic growth offer opportunities for our business going forward.</p>
          <p>Although we'll keep a close eye on the economic environment throughout the year, we're sharing key current planning assumptions as follows: first, we expect full-year industry volume to range from 13.5 million to 14.5 million units in the U.S. and from 14 million to 15 million units in Europe. We project our full-year market share in the U.S. and Europe to be about the same compared with 2011. And for quality, we expect to deliver year-over-year improvement.</p>
          <p>Compared with 2011, we expect our 2012 financial performance to reflect the following: first, automotive pre-tax operating profit to improve; next, Ford Credit to be solidly profitable, although at a lower level than 2011, which will be discussed later in the presentation; third, total-company pre-tax operating profit excluding special items to be about equal; and automotive structural costs to increase by less than $2 billion as we continue to support higher volumes, new product launches and our growth plans; and finally, we expect our automotive operating margin to improve.</p>
          <p>In terms of our capital spending outlook, we expect it to range from $5.5 to $6 billion and, although it's not shown on the slide, we are expecting a non-material increase in commodity costs for 2012. Overall, we expect 2012 to be a solid year for Ford Motor Company, consistent with our glide path to our mid-decade outlook. We're off to a good start with the overwhelmingly positive reaction to recently introduced global products, including the all-new Fusion in Detroit, the all-new EcoSport in Delhi and the all-new Escape in L.A.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob. We'll now turn our attention to Ford Credit's performance.</p>
          <p>Ford Credit had another strong year with pre-tax profit of $2.4 billion for the full year, and $506 million for the fourth quarter. Net income for the year was $1.8 billion and in the fourth quarter was $611 million. The year-over-year increase is more than explained by a favorable one-time non-cash item recorded in the quarter related to our net deferred tax liability. We've concluded that a portion of our non-U.S. earnings will be retained in market for the foreseeable future, in part to support the growth inherent in our business plan. We believe our ongoing effective tax rate will be about 33%.</p>
          <p>We had higher managed receivables at the end of 2011. They were $85 billion, up $2 billion from 2010 and up $3 billion from the third quarter. We had higher Ford and Lincoln receivables, which were partially offset by the run off of our discontinued brands and unfavorable exchange rates. We brought down full-year charge offs substantially to $201 million from $415 million in 2010. Fourth quarter charge offs of $52 million were half the level of a year ago. Our full-year lost receivables ratio was 24 basis points, the lowest level in the past 10 years and the ratio was 25 basis points for the fourth quarter. At December 31, the allowance for credit losses or reserve was $534 million, or 63 basis points of receivables.</p>
          <p>We continued our strong support of Ford, paying significant distributions of $3 billion, including $300 million in the fourth quarter. We also made $1.4 billion in tax payments in 2011. We continued to make progress in our managed leverage, which was 8.3 to 1 at December 31, 2011, up from 8 to 1 at September 30. At the end of the fourth quarter, our equity was $8.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 8, this slide compares fourth quarter pre-tax results of a year ago by causal factor. In line with our expectations, the results are more than explained by fewer leases being terminated, which resulted in fewer vehicles sold at a gain, offset partially by other, reflecting primarily foreign currency translation adjustments related to the discontinuation of financing in Australia. As shown in the memo, Ford Credit's pre-tax profit decreased by $75 million, compared with the third quarter, more than explained by the same lease factor just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Slide 9 provides an explanation of the change in Ford Credit's full-year results, compared with 2010 by causal factor. Ford Credit reported full-year pre-tax profit of $2.4 billion, a $650 million decrease. As guided, the decline reflects fewer leases being terminated, which resulted in fewer vehicles sold at a gain, as well as lower credit loss reserve reductions. For the full-year 2012 we expect to be solidly profitable, but at a lower level than 2011, reflecting primarily the same factors just mentioned. The pre-tax profit contribution related to the lease and credit loss reserve factors was about $800 million favorable in 2011, and these factors are expected to be minimal in 2012. In addition, we expect to pay distributions of between $500 million and $1 billion, and at year-end 2012 we anticipate managed receivables in the range of $85 billion to $95 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 shows the annual key metrics for our worldwide portfolio over the past five years. We also have included information in the appendix on our fourth quarter credit loss performance, which was consistent with the full-year trends and continued to be favorable for all regions versus prior year.</p>
          <p>Our charge-offs are down from 2010 levels, primarily reflecting lower repossessions in the U.S. and lower losses in Europe, offset partially by lower recoveries in the Unites States. The lost receivables ratio is almost 50% lower than 2010, and is the lowest we have seen in the last decade. Reserves and reserves as a percent of end-of-period receivables are both lower than a year ago, reflecting the decrease in charge-offs.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 shows the annual trends of our U.S. Ford and Lincoln retail and lease business, which comprises about 70% of our consumer portfolio. From a quality of input perspective, we've mentioned several times in the past about our consistent underwriting standards since 2003 and the high quality maintained in our portfolio. The upper left box shows our average placement FICO. The increase in FICO scores reflect primarily an increase in the credit quality of Ford customers coming through the door.</p>
          <p>The rest of the metrics on the page give you a sense of how the portfolio is performing. Over 60-day delinquencies and repossessions continue to be low. Severity of $6,500 in 2011 was $400 lower than a year ago, primarily reflecting improvements in auction values in the used vehicle market, offset partially by an increase in the amount buying in from a higher mix of 72-month contracts. Charge-offs and the lost receivables ratio in 2011 decreased from a year ago, reflecting primarily lower repossessions offset partially by lower recoveries.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 shows the annual trends of the lease residual performance for our U.S. Ford and Lincoln brands over the past five years. As we've been highlighting all year, lease return volumes in 2011 were almost 50% lower than last year, reflecting primarily the lower lease placements in 2008 and 2009. In addition, the 2011 lease return rate was 56%, down 9% points, compared with 2010, reflecting the increase in used vehicle prices.</p>
          <p>In 2011 our strong auction values for 36-month vehicles continued, up $740 per unit from 2010. Again, we have included the fourth quarter lease residual results in the appendix, and they also show the same trends as the annual data. Our worldwide net investment in operating leases was $11.1 billion at the end of 2011, up from $10 billion in 2010.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 13, we delivered our 2011 full-year funding plan despite volatile market conditions, completing $35 billion of funding for the year, including $11 billion in the fourth quarter. We also completed $19 billion in the public market and $16 billion in the private securitization market.</p>
          <p>Our funding strategy remains focused on diversification. In 2011, we created and launched the FUEL Notes program, completing two transactions totaling $2.5 billion. We also reintroduced the Ford Credit U.S. Retail Notes program and issued over $800 million during the year. We plan to continue accessing a variety of markets, channels and investors. We ended the year with about $33 billion of committed capacity, renewing $5 billion in the fourth quarter. Throughout 2011, we saw lower renewal costs across most facilities. Our liquidity remains strong, and we will maintain cash balances and committed capacity that meet our business and funding requirements in all global market conditions.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 shows our trend in funding of our managed receivables. At the end of 2011, managed receivables were $85 billion. We ended the year with $12 billion in cash and securitized funding was 55% of managed receivables. We are projecting 2012 year-end managed receivables in the range of $85 billion to $95 billion and securitized funding is expected to represent 49% to 54% of total managed receivables. The lower end of this range reflects in part FUEL Notes converting to unsecured debt. It is our expectation that the securitized funding as a percent of managed receivables will decline as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 shows our actual 2011 and projected 2012 term funding plan for Ford Credit, excluding our short-term funding programs. As I mentioned earlier, we completed $35 billion of funding in 2011. About $19 billion of this was public funding in the U.S., Canada and Europe, including over $8 billion of unsecured debt. In addition, we completed about $16 billion of funding through our private securitization channels across all our major asset classes and regions. For 2012, we project full year public term funding in the range of $18 billion to $23 billion, consisting of $8 billion to $11 billion of unsecured debt and $10 billion to $12 billion of public securitizations. We will also &#x2013; are projecting public issuance &#x2013; private issuance of $10 billion to $13 billion from those sources.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 details our liquidity programs and utilization. The top box shows Ford Credit's committed capacity, which includes unsecured credit facilities, FCAR asset-backed commercial paper lines and other asset-backed bank capacity. At year-end, we had $44.7 billion of committed capacity and cash. After excluding securitization cash and adjusting for available assets, liquidity was $38.6 billion, of which $21.5 billion was utilized, leaving about $17 billion of liquidity available for use. Committed capacity at year-end was $32.6 billion, about $1.4 billion higher than third quarter. We ended the year with about $2.4 billion of excess committed capacity providing a funding source for future originations and flexibility to transfer capacity among markets and asset classes where most needed.</p>
          <p>So in summary on slide 17 Ford had a strong 2011 with pre-tax operating profits, excluding special items, of $8.8 billion for the full year. This was Ford's second straight year of pre-tax profits over $8 billion. Full-year net income attributable to Ford was $20.2 billion, $12.4 billion of which was due to a favorable one-time non-cash special item related to our net deferred tax asset. We ended the year with automotive gross cash of $22.9 billion and automotive liquidity of $32.4 billion, including $9.5 billion of available automotive credit facilities. We reduced automotive debt in 2011 by $6 billion and ended the year with automotive cash net of debt of $9.8 billion, $8.4 billion better than year-end 2010.</p>
          <p>Ford Credit had a strong full year pre-tax profit of $2.4 billion and full-year net income of $1.8 billion. Ford Credit continued its significant contribution to Ford's business with $3 billion in distributions in 2011, including $300 million in the fourth quarter. Ford Credit achieved its full year funding plan with $35 billion in term funded, and we ended the year with substantial liquidity available for use of about $17 billion. Importantly, the strength of our business positions us well to further improve our balance sheet as we progress to strong investment grade ratings at both Ford and Ford Credit.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it back to Sean to begin the Q&amp;A session.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Neil. Before starting the question-and-answer session, I would like to mention that for the next fixed income call, which will cover first quarter results, we will no longer be, including the first few slides that we have traditionally discussed at the beginning of the fixed income presentation. These slides will still be available in the earnings presentation. We will start the first quarter call with Ford Credit's results. We are making this change based on feedback we have received from investors with the goal of making more efficient use of investors' time. There will be no changes to the management team attending the calls.</p>
          <p>With that, we'll start the question-and-answer session. Catina, can we please have the first question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, guys. Thank you. I had a few questions. One was a follow-up from the earlier Ford call. You guys touched on South America and discussed issues around pricing. Can you give us a little more color around that business and maybe more importantly the outlook for 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Bob. Thanks for the question. As Lewis said and just kind of stepping back a bit, it's a great market for us, a great region for us. It's had over 30 quarters of consecutive profitability, and I think we have to kind of understand where our business is at the moment. We're just at the point of getting ready, as Lewis said earlier, to completely transform the product lineup from a lineup that was all legacy products to one that will be completely represented by global One Ford products. And that will start in the first half of the year with the introduction of the Ranger. And then in the second half, the EcoSport, which is hugely important to the South American business, will be launched.</p>
          <p>And when we look at the fourth quarter, about half of the profit decline was due to exchange rates. Now, we priced for some of that. But it was a pretty big decline in the period. It fell off relatively quickly as the local currencies weakened. As we look at next year &#x2013; \we've guided that we expect the profits to be solid. We expect them to be down somewhat. Some of that's related to the launch costs associated with the new products that I talked about, Dave (sic). But also, when you look at that fourth quarter decline in terms of exchange rates, and just forecasting the effectiveness of 2012, at least at the moment, we're seeing a pretty significant impact in terms of exchange as we look at 2012 for the business in South America.</p>
          <p>And if you go back and look at it, that's not unusual. It's very volatile in some years. We get a lot of good news in some years. We get a lot of bad news. It's just part of the business there. But that's certainly going to be one of the headwinds for next year. And I just got a note telling me that I called you Dave instead of Doug. So, I apologize.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Laughter] No problem. Well that's a good answer. Thank you for that. And I wanted to just maybe touch on slide 10. I've never seen the charge-off percentage at 24 basis points. And I'm wondering is that something that we can expect to maybe go up as we grow the book? And what's really driving that? Is it the FICO scores of 738? Or is it the economy better? Or are you guys doing something different? Does it need to be that low?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, it's Mike. We've never seen that low either. It's really, we think, a function of a number of things. First, obviously, we have not changed our underwriting standards. We've been consistent, and we have been since 2003. What we're seeing is better and better performance of our portfolio, combined with improvements in the auction values, right? The auction values are going to affect the severity. As we've said before, can't really explain why customers are paying their bills a little bit more, but some people have said it's due in part to the fact that many people don't have equity any longer in their homes, and they view transportation as a more important bill to pay. Obviously, these are near historic lows, and we wouldn't expect them to continue at those levels, but we'll continue working our portfolio as we move forward.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Just have one broad question and some housekeeping. Himanshu, I think, asked the question about the consumer credit in Europe, and you guys said it's stable. Was that a response to the availability of credit, or actual delinquencies on the ground? And I'd like to just know how have delinquencies trended fourth quarter versus third quarter? Is there any discernible trend there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay, Eric. Just a couple of things, remember, North America is a predominant share of Ford Credit's profits. In our presence in Europe, Germany and the U.K. are by far our largest markets, followed by Italy, France, and Spain. When you look at Europe in total, and we look at quarter-over-quarter, quarter 4 of '11 versus quarter 4 of '10, our losses are lower, and our delinquencies are lower. If we look at quarter 4 versus quarter 3, our losses are about flat, at a very low level obviously, and our delinquencies are actually lower on a total-Europe basis. So, I think a large part of that is driven by our footprint in Europe and some of the economies there that are, as Lewis said earlier, doing okay, because that's where we're largest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Eric -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll tell you, your flat sequential pricing was impressive, and obviously, we've seen a rebound in Western European sales. So, I guess that portends for what we're seeing there. That's good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, just in response to the bank or the availability from the bank side, I think we're not seeing anything much changing. The committed facilities on the asset-backed side that are up for renewal are getting renewed. The ones that are in Europe are getting renewed, and so we don't see anything yet. We keep having folks call us and tell us &#x2013; are wondering why we're not, but so far it has not changed from the standpoint of our availability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's a general demand for cash surrogates that actually have any yield above zero. So, I think that's lifting a lot of risk within a lot of markets. So, hopefully, that's a good sign.</p>
          <p>Secondly, just looking at that pension, I guess your contributions were around $1.1 billion, or at like $1.5 billion this year, and you said you were going to get up to $3.5 billion next year. Is that incremental $2 billion special contribution, a; is it cash? And b; should we look at that kind of &#x2013; obviously the agencies look at pension, is that just going to reduce under-fundedness? You guys are just going to make a big nut towards getting that thing funded?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it is cash. The $2 billion is incremental voluntary and yes, it will reduce the under-funded status.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. And then, on the Ford Credit dividend, I think it's &#x2013; that is not inclusive &#x2013; that $500 million to $1 billion distribution is not inclusive of the tax reconciliation, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so it's down from like $1.5 billion from in '11, something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, our distributions were $3 billion in 2011. We say they're going to be about $500 million to $1 billion in '12. Our tax payments in '11 were $1.4 billion, and we haven't given any guidance for -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, good. And I guess that answers my next question that your funding &#x2013; you went over your funding, it's down slightly while your assets grow, is that basically because you're going to retain more of your earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's actually we have less maturities, both on the unsecured and secured side in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, you guys said that net interest is going to be flat. Does that mean the other automotive profit line is basically zero? Is there anything else in that line that we should be thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean year-over-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only other thing in there would be the Mazda valuation, and that obviously fluctuates based on the stock price of the Mazda shares. And just to remind everybody, we have 3.5% of Mazda.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, that could actually be &#x2013; I mean, assuming the stock market goes up, that could be a positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally, just &#x2013; I don't mean to mince words, but the auto operating cash flow improvement, is that up year-over-year or just a positive, hey-we're-going-to-generate-cash comment?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It says that auto operating cash flow is going to improve, and does that mean it's going to improve I think from the -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it says it's going to be strong and I think in this morning's call, Lewis provided a little bit more guidance from a standpoint if you think of the 2011 performance, and you adjust it for the increase in CapEx that we're projecting in 2012, that you'll be pretty close to where operating cash guidance would be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, you basically did $5.9 billion; CapEx is going up $1 billion, so maybe like $5 billion in the &#x2013; in that top part of the level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we did $5.6 billion in 2011, and CapEx is going to grow from $4.3 billion to between $5.5 billion and $6 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. Well, I will cede to everybody. I really appreciate the time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks. A couple questions on Ford Credit, the one being just on the leverage. You're at managed leverage now of around 8.3, and I know in the past you've said that you'll take that up closer to 11.5. I mean, it kind of looks like given the clip it's been going up over the last couple years, that you'll probably come pretty close to that, presumably by the end of this year. Is that kind of a fair way to look at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, actually what we've said, you remember, we have an agreement with the Motor Company that we won't exceed an 11.5 to 1 leverage, and we've given our mid-decade guidance to say that we'd probably be in the range of 10 to 11 to 1. Obviously, when we look at leverage, we consider market conditions, risk characteristics of the business, and as we look forward to 2012, we've guided about $500 million to $1 billion of distributions this year, and we think that's appropriate. So, for this year, you'll see managed leverage increase, but probably not nearly as meaningfully as you did in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just to get back to Eric's question. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but the way it sounded on the earnings call, it sounded like operating-related cash flow, when you adjust, if you were to kind of adjust for CapEx, that it would be up. But when you factor in the CapEx being higher that it sounds like it'll be flat year-over-year. I mean, am I reading that right? I just want to be clear on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think what he said is that if you take 2011's performance, which had CapEx in it of $4.3 billion, and adjust that for CapEx in 2012 of between $5.5 billion and $6 billion, you would get close to the operating cash flow number. So, it's actually down year-over-year reflecting our increase in CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, makes sense. And then a couple quick housekeeping questions. One on DOE loans, so it looks like you took up another $400 million roughly in the quarter, and if you could just remind us again what's left? I mean, I think there's another what $800 million or something like that left, and kind of when that ends? I believe it's third quarter of this year. And then the other housekeeping is just, what's the percentage of the lease, of leases in the portfolio now at Ford Credit? Where did you end the year for full year in total leases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the first one and then, Mike, you can pick up the lease penetration question. You are correct that we basically have two more quarters of draw for the full amount, and then they start paying off in the third quarter of this year as well. And the way they work is each draw is an equivalent of a 10-year amortizing loan. So, the draws that we had I guess when the loan started will start amortizing off. So, it basically just &#x2013; the pace of payoffs will build over time, but we'll fully draw by the end of June and then start paying it off in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Brian, as it relates to leases, as we said before, we kind of ended 2011 at about a 10% lease share in the U.S. When you look at this past year, obviously leasing is going to be a function of how the Motor Company marketing wants to go to market, and we'll go jointly with them, but that actually increased to about 15% in the U.S. for 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just to be clear, I think you guys have expressed that Ford Motor Credit's underlying run rate excluding the residual gains this year and the lower credit losses was probably closer to $1.6 billion. Going into 2012, how should we think about the net effect from moving your funding more to unsecured versus secured? as well as growing the managed receivable book? Should those fully offset and kind of think about 2012 as roughly flat year-over-year for Ford Motor Credit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Dan, when you think about it, we've obviously guided the $800 million, as it relates to the credit loss and lease factors, credit loss reserve and lease factors. And then what we've said is obviously we have a strategy to get back to an investment grade balance sheet, which entails among other things an increase in our unsecured debt versus ABS, which is obviously higher cost. So, there's going to be some margin pressure, as Lewis indicated in this morning's call.</p>
          <p>Your question is will volume offset that. Remember, our revenue is really earned on average receivables not end of period. So, when you look at our receivable guidance of between 85 and 95, on an average year basis that can only be zero to five. If you look at Credit University, and we say we earn about 3% or so margin on an average year basis, that's not going to be a lot of money. And remember, every time we put a new receivable on, you book the credit loss reserve right away. So, at this stage, I think we'd see a little bit higher margin pressure, not fully offsetting any volume growth.</p>
