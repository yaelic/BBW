            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Good afternoon welcome to News Corp. announcing their Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Release. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Here with our opening remarks and to introduce the executive team is Executive Vice President, Mr. Gary Ginsberg. Happy New Year, sir, and please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brent. Happy New Year to you. It's nice to have you back on our call. Thank you very much to all of you on the call and welcome to our Second Quarter Fiscal 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of News Corp.; Peter Chernin, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dave DeVoe, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>As is our custom, Dave will begin the call with a brief summary of the results focusing on our items not immediately obvious from the reading of the earnings release. Rupert will then give some general commentary on the quarter, followed by Peter, who will talk about the durability of some of our key growth drivers, and then as Brent told you, we'll take your questions.</p>
          <p>Today's call is, of course, governed by the Safe Harbor provisions. On this call, we'll make statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those described in any of the public filings with the SEC that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements. And finally, please note that certain financial measures we will use on this call, such as EPS and net income, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude other net in the second quarter of fiscal '07. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is posted on our website on our investor relations earning release page.</p>
          <p>And with all that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Gary, thank you, and good afternoon everyone. As you've seeing in today's earnings release, we are continuing the strong growth trends we reported in the first quarter. For the second quarter of fiscal '08, we are again reporting record results. Revenues up 10%, operating profit up 24%, earnings per share, adjusted for BskyB's ITV writedown at a buck's gain, up 12%. Nearly all of our operating segments reported double digit earnings increases.</p>
          <p>The results were led by excellent performances at our television, cable, SKY Italia, and Fox interactive businesses. And was achieved despite absorbing approximately $100 million in incremental losses related to growth initiatives, such as Fox Business Channel, Big Ten Channel, start up television operations in Turkey, Poland and Serbia. Now given that you all have the details contained within our earnings release, I like to provide additional context on the recent performance of just a few of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Our Film segments operating income was $403 million in the quarter. This is a great result, even though down from a year ago. I want to remind you that the year ago results were the highest ever for the film segment, reflecting the DVD and theatrical successes of such blockbuster releases as Ice Age 2, X-Men 3, Borat, and Night at the Museum. So despite this difficult financial comparison, we had a very solid result this year, reflecting strong home entertainment releases, including The Simpsons movie and the most recent Die Hard film. We had the pay-TV availability of previous hits, including Night at the Museum, Borat, and Little Miss Sunshine. And additionally, we expect good results for the rest of the year as the yet to come from theatrical release in the quarter of Alvin and the Chipmunks, and Juno.</p>
          <p>At our Television segment, second quarter operating profit more than doubled above the year ago levels, despite station earnings, which were down compared to last year, primarily from a 90% reduction in political advertising. The strong growth in the television segment largely reflects substantial improvement at My Network TV. This is from lower programming cost. And very strong profit growth at the Fox Broadcasting network from increased ratings in ad pricing for both our entertainment and sports programming. Reduced postseason baseball programming, as most of you know, we no longer air the divisional playoffs, and from lower program cancellations and marketing costs. It should be noted that the writers' strike did not have any material impact on the quarter's results and we also expect political revenues to improve as we head towards the November elections.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the Cable Networks. Again, here we had very strong growth at this segment, a 23% improvement in operating profit to $337 million. This is an especially strong result when you consider the inclusion of total start-up losses of roughly $50 million for the Big Ten and Fox Business Channel launches. The largest year-over-year gains were from the Fox News Channel and this reflects new affiliate deals and higher advertising sales. The RSNs as well reflect affiliate rate increases and subscriber increases. The international channels from advertising and affiliate increases led by our Latin American and European channels. The segment result also includes the consolidation of National Geographic Channels, which were not consolidated a year ago.</p>
          <p>At SKY Italia, again, another very strong financial performance. With local currency revenues up 12%, operating income of $62 million, this is a $74 million improvement from the last year. And this marks the first time we achieved second-quarter operating profit at SKY Italia. The financial improvements are driven largely by net subscriber additions of 400,000 over the last 12 months. This results in 4.43 million subscribers at the end of the quarter. SKY acquired 189,000 net new subscribers in the quarter. This is down slightly from year ago levels. And year-to-date SKY has added 233,000 net new subscribers. And this is 16% ahead of the net new additions in the same six-month period a year ago.</p>
          <p>Sky's churn in the quarter was below last year's level and is on track to achieve an annual churn rate of around 10%. ARPU for the quarter was 45 euros. This is consistent with a year ago and SAC of approximately 270 euros in the quarter was roughly in line with last year. You can see, given these healthy metrics, it's quite clear that SKY is on track for delivering another strong year of earnings growth.</p>
          <p>At our Newspapers and Information Service segment, they also reported a strong quarter with operating income of $196 million, and this is up 15% over the second quarter from a year ago. This segment was previously referred to as Newspapers. This now includes all of the Dow Jones businesses. However, the second quarter included only two weeks of Dow Jones operations, reflecting its mid-December close. And therefore, there was virtually no operating income contribution in this quarter.</p>
          <p>At our Australian newspapers, they reported a 14% increase in operating profit with advertising revenues up 7% in local currency terms. And this is driven by ad growth across most key categories and by higher classified advertising and employment advertising. The Australian marketplace continued to prosper. Our newspaper properties have benefited from the solid economic conditions there, and we look forward to continued growth in our papers in the next quarter.</p>
          <p>In the United Kingdom, underlying advertising circulation revenue trends, they're relatively flat compared with a year ago. Although our earnings are down, primarily reflecting the final quarter of accelerated depreciation on our printing plants that we will retire in the third quarter. The plants project is nearing completion. We should start to see some of the savings associated with a more efficient operation in our fourth fiscal quarter.</p>
          <p>At our Other segment, we generated an operating profit of $23 million. This is a $22 million increase from the second quarter a year ago. This improvement is primarily due to the strong growth at Fox Interactive Media and it's offset in part by start-up losses related to our Eastern European TV initiatives. FIM's total revenue in the quarter of $233 million was up 87% from the same quarter a year ago. This is primarily due to search and advertising revenue growth at MySpace. Of the total FIM revenue, $62 million was from our search deal with Google. Ad revenues at FIM increased 43% versus last year and 31% from the first quarter. Operating profit for FIM was $47 million as compared to a loss of $11 million in the same quarter a year ago. So the profit growth reflects the revenue increases and lower management retention amortization and is offset by our continued investment in the cost base and expansion of this high-growth business.</p>
          <p>And finally just a couple of more points. You may have noticed that we just raised the annual dividend on our News Corporation class B shares by $0.02 to $0.12 a share. This equalizes the dividend on the class B shares to that of the class A shares, which is consistent with the requirements of our re-incorporation to the United States back in late 2004.</p>
          <p>And finally let me address our guidance for fiscal 2008. Three months ago we reiterated an expectation of operating income growth for fiscal 2008 to be in the low teens. This guidance excluded the gain expected from the sale of property in the United Kingdom, as well as any results from the Dow Jones acquisition. Based on our actual results to date and on the assumptions inherent in our projections, we are raising our guidance as we now expect our operating profit growth for fiscal 2008 will be in the mid teens range. Note that this guidance is like to like as it continues to exclude the land sale gain in Dow Jones results.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rupert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Dave. Good afternoon everyone. Today's headline is certainly this. News Corporation just purchased the highest operating income quarter in the company's 54-year history. The result is all the more remarkable given we incurred significant start-up costs launching new businesses during the quarter and completing the final phase of our expenditures, putting in our new huge United Kingdom printing presses.</p>
          <p>So we're very satisfied and pleased with our financial and operating strength. But, of course, we're never content. But we are comfortable enough with our momentum to raise our guidance for the year as Dave just indicated. And I must say I'm even more comfortable about our longer-term growth prospects after spending the past several weeks working intensively with our newest acquisition, the Dow Jones Company. We always expected from afar that Dow Jones, properly leveraged as part of a larger global media company, had boundless potential. And if possible, I'm even more excited about its prospects now than in the previous months leading to our takeover.</p>
          <p>49 days is not enough time to get a perfect picture of a company, but I'm happy to share with you a few early observations. First, I'm tremendously impressed with the quality and potential of the assets we've acquired at Dow Jones. While we're still in the early days of our stewardship, we are really deep into finding ways to expand and strengthen the company's flagship paper, The Wall Street Journal. We're launching a luxury lifestyle magazine in September that will initially reach more than 800,000 people. And we're looking at ways to broaden the paper's readership and advertising by augmenting its editorial content featuring more political, international, cultural and general national news. As good as the paper already is, and it's one of the best in the world, we still think there's opportunity to make it better, to make it more urgent, more accessible, more relevant to a wider audience.</p>
          <p>We've already initiated several changes in its look beginning with today's redesign of the front page and more change is in the works. We think these changes will enable us to attract more readers and more advertisers at more attractive pricing, allowing us to outperform the general newspaper industry. As much as we know we can improve the paper's financials, we see the greatest growth opportunity is really in our ability to strengthen Dow Jones's online assets. It's there where we are spending our most concentrated time and where we think we can achieve exponential growth with several new initiatives. Like the paper itself, we expect to add more free content to the online Journal. This month, we made all of its opinion article available for free; stories from personal finance, politics and the business of life, as well as the Journal's blogs and videos will be made available to non-subscribers. But the bulk of the Journal's core business coverage will remain behind the subscription wall as an exclusive intelligence service for serious business people and investors. This will allow us to broaden our global reach while increasing subscription revenue that makes the online Journal the most profitable subscription-based financial site on the Internet today.</p>
          <p>The Journal has also started working closely with Fox properties to share video, news and business content. We've begun exploring printing and delivery and synergies between the Journal and the New York Post operations and between News International and The Wall Street Journal in Europe. And of course we expect to see efficiencies between Dow Jones and News Corp to realize the tens of millions of dollars in savings we've always anticipated.</p>
          <p>So as I've said, I'm more bullish than ever. There's a great opportunity to innovate and to grow and significantly bolster the future of one of the world's most venerable institutions. It's an exciting and energizing mission and we're only beginning.</p>
          <p>Now I know other big questions are on all of our minds besides how Eli Manning was able to elude that sack and hit Tyree to set up the Giants' game winning touchdown. It's the resilience of the United States economy. Actually, before I talk about the economy, let me just say a word about last night. The most watched Super Bowl in history, the most watched TV show in 25 years, and the second most watched show in history. A night when the Fox network and television stations generated more than $250 million in gross revenue, the biggest day in our company's history. And to top it off, a game for the ages, a night that couldn't have gone better for us.</p>
          <p>Clearly though, we're facing potential challenges in our economic environment, ever challenging and for how long no one knows. What is certain, however, is how better positioned we are than any other media company to weather whatever comes. Just look at the last quarter. Despite some softening in the overall economy, we posted extraordinary numbers, a powerful sign that our businesses are durable and positioned for the longer term. The reasons are threefold: First, we put major effort over the past 10 years into rapidly developing our subscription businesses, including building out our cable channels. This mix of revenue is now far more heavily skewed to affiliate revenue than advertising. Second, we've expanded internationally, including potential high growth markets in Eastern Europe, Turkey, and Indonesia. And third, we've invested smartly in the media where we think the greatest growth potential lies, including social networking and other online extensions of our mature businesses. The result, today we are structurally a more sound company, with significantly lower exposure than the vagaries of the advertising markets.</p>
          <p>In fact, today, less than a quarter of our revenues are dependent on the American television advertising business. And given our geographic and product diversification during this same period we're no longer as dependent on the strength of any one market or medium.</p>
          <p>For instance, two subscription driven businesses that didn't even meaningfully exist in the last recession, Sky in Italy and the Fox international channels, are now major growth drivers for the company. Sky in Italy is rapidly becoming the profit and cash generator we envisaged when launching this business back in early fiscal 2004. And with pay-TV penetration at only 20% in Italy, the subscription driven contributions from this business are still in their infancy. The Fox international cable channel business is also in rapid expansion mode, with organic growth and the consolidation of new businesses generating an incremental $74 million in operating income in just the last six months.</p>
          <p>Another key to our unique positioning, Fox Interactive Media, is experiencing accelerated operational and financial momentum demonstrated by its 87% revenue growth and $58 million profit improvement in the most recent quarter compared to a year ago. These results add confidence to our $1 billion revenue and 20% margin targets for this business this year. So we're very pleased with the progress we're making at FIM and we should have much more growth ahead.</p>
          <p>So overall, the company is in great shape. Our growth drivers are durable, our structure is sound, our management is stable and superior, and our future bright. And with that, I'm happy to turn this over to Peter, who will spend a few minutes on the performance of some of our independent businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Rupert, and good afternoon everyone. You've heard about our results and our resiliency. Thank you Rupert and good afternoon everyone. I'm sorry, I think the mic was off.</p>
          <p>You've heard about our results and our resiliency. Now I'd like to take a few minutes to offer some perspective on a few of our biggest growth drivers. Let's start with the Fox Broadcasting Company.</p>
          <p>With last night's historic results, the Super Bowl extended Fox's lead for the season among adults 18 to 49 to 0.9 of a rating point over our nearest competitor. And I'd like to point out that's the largest lead at this point in the season for anyone in 10 years since the 1997/98 broadcast season and probably the largest percentage lead in a far longer period.</p>
          <p>Even without the Super Bowl, we would still win this season handily. We are the only network up year on year; we were up 9% in our ratings even before the Super Bowl and this will mark our fourth consecutive year as the number one network among adults 18 to 49. Now I think this speaks to the strength and diversity of our programming; sports, scripted series, and reality.</p>
          <p>We have, we're in the middle of what I think is probably the best sports lineup in broadcasting history. Already this year, we have had the World Series, the Bowl Championship Series, the Super Bowl. And coming up, we have the 50th running of the Daytona 500, and the final Major League baseball All-Star game to be played in Yankee Stadium. We've also had a great season with established scripted hits. House is now the second highest rated scripted show among adults 18 to 49 on television, growing its ratings year on year. The same can be said for Bones and Family Guy, which are both, also are both up year over year.</p>
          <p>And our reality fare has also performed extremely well. We launched a new series, The Moment of Truth, two weeks ago. It was the highest rated premiere on any network in almost a year among adults 18 to 49. And of course, American Idol remains by far the most valuable show in television. It returned for its seventh season last month, with ratings more than 60% greater than any other series on television except our own Moment of Truth. The strength and depth of our reality programming, along with a full slate of our animated series and several upcoming scripted series premieres, give us an arsenal of programming that will allow us to stray strong and dominant throughout the spring and summer.</p>
          <p>Now I know that there are concerns about the health of the ad market, but we here at Fox have not seen any weakness to date. Pricing remains very strong for both entertainment and sports. We have low cancellations on all of our upcoming commitments. Given the strength of our ratings, we are not in a make good position so we are able to capitalize on the current strong scatter market. In fact, our advertising revenues at the network last quarter were up double digits year on year and regardless of what happens to the ad market in the months ahead, our consistent ratings success will allow us to capture a lion's share of the available ad dollars.</p>
          <p>Now, our network is the not the only place where advertising continues to be strong. We also had double-digit ad growth across our cable group, led by Fox News Channel and continued expansion in our international cable channels. And ad growth is only part of our cable success. Affiliate revenues were also up double digits. Now, clearly a chunk of that came from our Fox News re-negotiations, but we also had double-digit growth at our RSNs, Speed Channel, Fox Movie Channel and Fox Soccer. At the same time, we continue to expand our reach internationally.</p>
          <p>This past quarter alone, we launched nine new channels, including two each in Italy, Portugal and Turkey. So we have plenty of momentum on both the affiliate and advertising side, which will allow us to deliver strong growth throughout the remainder of '08 even as we absorb spending on our two newest channels, Big Ten Network and Fox Business Network.</p>
          <p>Now turning to FIM, we're starting to see real progress on the advertising front as advertisers are beginning to understand and see the value of social networking. Now I know there were some concerns following our first quarter when we admitted we got off to a slow start, but we have unquestionably gained our momentum both operationally and financially. No place is this more evident than the response we've gotten to our advertising targeting initiative.</p>
          <p>We launched our enthusiast targeting initiative during September, dividing our audience into 10 core segments, from movies to autos to fashion to finance, etcetera. And each segment represented somewhere in the three to five million people range. Interestingly, some of our most popular segments thus far have included fashion, consumer electronics, video games, and financial services. These are segments where advertisers historically had shied away from My Space and where they are now embracing the opportunity to reach a targeted audience for their products. We've now grown those original 10 enthusiast segments to more than 750 targeted segments. For example, you know we moved from a general sports segment to targeted things like the New York Giants, or soccer, or archery, etcetera, and each segment has at least 10,000 people. Thus far, over 100 advertisers have begun using this feature and the results have been overwhelmingly positive. Some campaigns have achieved as much as a 300% quick through lift with no campaign seeing less than 20% improvement. ECPMs are up close to 50%, and advertisers using this targeting are spending twice as much as those not yet participating.</p>
          <p>We expect to expand the 750 target segments to over 1,000 segments by July, further offering advertisers a wide array of choices for their brands. But it's not just our targeting initiatives, which have helped us regain our footing. We are very excited about our involvement with open social as was our own effort to open the MySpace platform to external developers. And it demonstrates how we embrace the rigid e offering advertisers a wide array of choices for their brands. It's not just our targeting initiatives which is help us regain their footing. We are very excited about the involvement of open social as well as our own effort to open the MySpace platform to external developers. And it demonstrates how we embrace the Widget Ecosystem and supports our belief in establishing standards that foster innovation. Given our scale, we provide the largest and most attractive platform for developers. And we think we'll be a home for innovation in social network applications. And it positions us to reap the rewards from new concepts that our user base desires.</p>
          <p>We're also excited about the ad opportunity from our self-serve initiative. This will launch in beta this quarter and focuses on display ads for small businesses that they can create themselves, a market which is typically undeserved. Currently, we believe we have around 10 million small businesses that have MySpace profiles and we think this provides a unique advertising opportunity for us. So clearly, we've regained our momentum in MySpace and we're fully on track to hit our targets at FIM.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me talk briefly about the success of our film business. I think a lot of people felt that we weren't going to be able to maintain our momentum in film, but we just delivered the fourth highest quarter in the history of our film segment. Now I know some concern exists over the future of DVDs, but we're not seeing this business fall off a cliff by any means. In 2007, as an industry, sell through spending in the market was down only about 2.7%, and spending on new releases was actually up. As a company, once again we outperformed the market and did better than that. If you deliver quality films that audiences enjoy in the theater, you should still see strong sales on DVD. And that's certainly what happened to us with Simpsons, which I think was the best converting title among all studios in the fourth quarter and Die Hard. And again, what we are expecting from our upcoming theatrical hits; Alvin and the Chipmunks, and Juno later this year.</p>
          <p>And speaking of Alvin and Juno, I think they're representative of how we run our studio, maximizing returns on individual projects rather than chasing market share. Alvin was made for a fraction of the cost of a typical CG-animated film and yet it's passed more than $200 million domestically and more than $100 million internationally. Even stronger from a margin perspective is Juno, which we produced for under $10 million in budget and has now generated more than $110 million in box office, actually making it the highest-grossing Fox Searchlight film ever. We expect this strong theatrical run to continue, given its slate of Academy Award nominations, including a nomination for best picture.</p>
          <p>Both of these films will be extremely profitable for us as they complete their theatrical runs and enter the DVD window later this fiscal year. We also expect an up-tick in 2008 from the sale of BluRay DVDs now that Warner Brothers has announced its exclusive support of the format. Consumer spending on BluRay DVDs should grow to over $1 billion in 2008, and with higher margins for us. Additionally, we've recently announced two steps that will allow us to expand the digital exploitation of our movies. First, we started adding digital copies on our DVD discs, allowing consumers to move a digital copy of the film straight from the DVD to their PC and portable devices. And second, last month we announced a new video-on-demand deal with Apple's iTunes. So while we are keen on protecting our lucrative DVD business, we're also mindful that consumers are changing their habits. And we need to provide them with access to our product in whatever manner they desire.</p>
          <p>So overall, with the network, cable, FIM, and our studio all performing strongly and fueling our ongoing growth we continue to have positive momentum across the company. And with that, Rupert, Dave and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there's anything to elaborate, we're not making a bid. So I think Rupert said it pretty succinctly. In terms of the Google call, I didn't hear the call. But a couple of things I'd like to point out, Jessica. First of all, clearly our revenue from Google is guaranteed, so that's not a particular issue for us. Secondly, the assumptions on which that deal were made always suggested that Google expected the deal to reach break even towards the latter part of the 3-year period, and for the deal to function as a loss leader during the early period. So I think their performance is no surprise. That being said, we are regularly working with them to continue to improve their performance. We think they are an important partner to us and we want to see them continue to grow their revenue. And that has all sorts of things. It's trying to do a better job monetizing the data. It's, were constantly looking at the placement of the search box on the page, the size of the search box, where we deliver the ads, how to get higher click-through rates. And I would say that we have a very positive working relationship, and to be fair, I think an improving working relationship over the past year with Google. So we are working together. We'd like to see them improve their results. And we expect, but it is important to note that that deal from their own model--and it's certainly what they told us--they expected it to reach break even towards the end of the deal, not right at the beginning.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Peter, I have one for you, one topic. This was the most profitable second quarter in broadcast TV for you guys as far back as our model goes. So I wondered, in light of your revenue position, do you think we're at a sustainable pace for Fox profits? And then, in light of the strike, what kind of cost can you take out? What kind of cost can you take out and when will that be seen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think first of all there were costs that came out, that have come out of the first 6 months of the year, but most of them are not strike-related. They tend to be more sports-related, we had some bigger abandonments the year before, etcetera. We do think there are more &#x2013; I think you'll start seeing some costs coming out, not out of our own volition, but we clearly haven't made pilots yet. We've had fewer scripted series because we started running out of episodes in the strike, so more costs will come out. But look, long-term, I think the key to the business, we're not looking to cost cut our way to success into the network. We are committed to continue to grow our revenues and that's the most important thing. And we'll do that by putting on the best shows we can and continue to grow our ratings. And while we had a good cost side on the network, I think the much more important thing is the growth in our ratings and the growth in our CPMs, particularly in the sports business. I think that's what we're happiest about on the network side in the first half of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I don't have a breakout of how much they were up ex-baseball, but we had higher ratings and higher CPMs. So I think they were up somewhere in the range of about $50 million on the entertainment side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. So, I think I've got a four-part single question. I think in the last call you mentioned that you wanted to re-build your cash position, get some of your asset sales done before you'd consider more aggressive share repurchases. And given the operating momentum you laid out, your stock on the A-shares is now under 20. I'm curious where you stand on the concept of share repurchases and deployment capital? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have three negotiations. We've completed negotiations for the sale of a small number of television stations for $1,200 million. That will take 6 or 7 months to close because of all the usual regulatory matters. And we're certainly not going to spend it before we see it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we are really in the same position we were at the last call because we've completed the asset sales, but they haven't closed yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I guess the question is at what price do you get more aggressive repurchasing shares?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will depend on what opportunities are around. The great opportunity may be in the shares. I think they're a great opportunity now, but who knows what bargains will be around in the next 6 months. We're not committing ourselves at this stage.</p>

And given the current financial situation with respect to markets and debt markets, we're waiting to close on these asset sales we've announced and after we've done that we will reevaluate where we are.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a question on MySpace. You made a comment about what its search revenues were. I'm trying to understand what is the mix currently between search and display revenues for MySpace on a global basis? And then just a housekeeping question for Dave, in terms of Nat Geo, you mentioned it was consolidated for the first time. Can you just give us a sense of why it ended up being consolidated and how much that added from an operating profit, revenue and operating profit to the quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say on the first question, search represents between about 1/4 and 1/3 of FIM revenues. Most of FIM revenues are MySpace. So the rest of it is a mix of both display and performance advertising. But that should give you a sense of what the size of the search is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that year was consolidated because we now control the operation, both internationally and domestically. And Rich, roughly, I think you asked for revenues and operating profit; $125 million of revenue and approximately $35 million in operating income in the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

And we are continuing to -- I think we are seeing Facebook grow in certain markets, although I don't think they are growing nearly as quickly as we are from a monetization point of view. And we continue to see good strong growth internationally and are pleased with our progress. And are continuing to make investments and continuing to improve the consumer, the user experience.</p>

          <p>&lt;Q &#x2013; Spencer Wang: Thanks, good afternoon, just a quick question for Dave on the guidance. So you guys have grown EBIT about 24% through the first half. I guess with your new guidance, I guess that implies EBIT growth in the second half of the fiscal year in the high single digits I guess. So could you just shed a little bit of light on the growth dynamics in the back half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think what you have in last year, we will have tough comps as we go into the second half of the year on the film company. We had a different comp, our comps with respect to Fox News will get tougher because our first contract started to come in with the new affiliate rates in the last half of the year. And we have continued spending and investment spending for both Fox Business and the Big Ten channel, neither of which we had a year ago. So those are the dynamics.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Turning to some of the older economy assets, newspapers, which I think is more than 20% of your business. It does seem as though, especially on the international side, that your publishing and newspaper businesses have fared better than the US businesses. And I'm just wondering why that is and if that's sustainable? Does that speak to your Internet presence on some of the national papers in UK and Australia? Or is it less exposure to real estate or classified? And then how do you think of that in terms of a global slowdown and exposure to international/non-US advertising? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our newspapers, with one or two exceptions, don't have major classified revenues. And in Britain, we're absolutely dominant in every &#x2013; it's very competitive, we're dominant in each section of the market. And our revenues there are strong and good. I wouldn't say that they couldn't be better, but they're fine. And in Australia, they're going gangbusters. The economy is great, and that was really the home run in Australia. Next, and from now on of course, we will have gone through our special write-offs and the changeover of all our printing arrangements in Britain, and that should also get better. As for in the U.S., the Post is very small, but we are probably the only newspaper that's up in revenue. We're up 9% so far this fiscal year. So we'd like it to be better, but that's pretty good. And these figures don't take account of anything for The Wall Street Journal. But our present pacing is, we're down a little bit in January and we appear to be making budget or ahead of it in the next 2 months. And we will be &#x2013; and Dow Jones generally, which is not included in any of our forecasts, will be a bit better than they were last year. And a lot of savings will be coming through, but some of those savings we'll be spending in expansion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The MyNetwork, while we are still losing money and frankly losing money at a pace that we are not satisfied with, we do think we've made a lot of progress. We've taken a lot of costs out of the business and we've seen our ratings grow significantly. And so we had budgeted to improve pretty significantly, this year over last year we're actually out performing our budget quite a bit. I think we want to see the advertisers begin to catch up with the improved ratings and we'd like to see some more ratings progress. But certainly, in this quarter alone, for example, we had about a $30 million reduction in program costs and still managed to deliver significantly higher ratings than we had been with the old formats. So we're on the right track, where the right track is going faster than we had expected. But not as fast as we'd like and we'll keep the pressure on to get it back to break even.</p>

Can you provide us with an update on the writers' strike talks and maybe just give a little color on why the directors were able to negotiate and avoid strike and the writers still seem to be dragging on? And also in terms of television, do you think that this could be a catalyst for change in terms of things like the up front, rolling out the season all at one time in the fall? Or would you expect things to go back to business as usual if this gets resolved? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't really have much to add to the writers' strike negotiations. We are under a press blackout, but I am optimistic and I think we're having positive discussions, and I'm optimistic that we will get to some resolution. The directors -- I can't speak to -- you'd have to ask them as to why we were able to get a deal done more quickly with them. In terms of -- we are certainly examining every part of our business, although to be honest, we were examining every part of our business before the strike. I think you are not going to see Fox abandon the up front. We believe the up front is a valuable way to interact with our advertisers, a valuable platform to interact with our advertisers. And frankly, from a marketer point of view, is a good opportunity for them to plan their spending in advance for the year. So we think it's a valuable part of the process for both sides. We have been looking at our scripted development process. We were moving towards probably making fewer pilots and trying to get some waste out of that system before the strike and we're continuing to look at that. But I would say that, sure, the strike may be a catalyst, but we've also been exploring and re-evaluating all parts of that business on an ongoing business (sic) [basis] as I think is only appropriate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say -- I'll go first maybe, and Rupert you can pick up. I think the performance of the channel is right on track. It's exactly where we would expect it to be. I guess the only thing I'd say personally is that I think to start a 24-hour channel from scratch, I think the programming is probably a little bit stronger than I would have expected six months ago. I think it's been a great achievement to be able to put up that quality programming right from the get go. You're beginning to see them scoop the competition on various things. So I think I would say qualitatively probably better, and quantitatively exactly what we expected.</p>

Our ratings are extremely strong, and as we're in basketball season right now, more frequent, we're on more nights a week. And we know the performance in the satellite homes, in the cable homes who are taking us, and the telco homes who are taking us is very strong.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't have a lot of specific statistics in front of me. In general, we find that people who have been on a year or longer actually get more engaged. They have more friends. They've gotten involved in more different aspects. They've customized their pages more. They've added more bands, etcetera, etcetera. So in general, we think the trends grow over time and users become more engaged. And I think in terms of increasing that, I think the opening up of a platform to the open social thing, starting to put on a lot new social networking applications will only increase that. We think it will make the sort of ecosystem richer, more interactive, have more features on there. Not only the features we develop and the things we add but opening up to outside developers to do that. So I think that will only increase that engagement.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks. A great result gentlemen, just a quick question. What do we expect on the closure of DIRECTV and what is the holdup there? When should we expect that to close, number one? And number two, I know you're seeing no impact from the sub prime thing, but I guess my question is typically it does take a little bit of a lag. Do you think it might be a 2009 issue? Or is that a bridge too far right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has taken far too long. It's certainly not been our fault and we expect to have closure very soon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Typically, it does take a little bit of time for the financial market issues to roll through into actual slower advertising revenues and volumes. Do you think that, that might be a 2009 issue for you? Or is it too early to call?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, it's hard to predict. We're obviously mindful and obviously diligent looking for signs. And we're certainly examining our cost structure aggressively to make sure we're well positioned. But beyond that we haven't seen -- we've seen a little bit of exposure in some markets that have been particularly hard hit by sub prime, foreclosures etcetera, some of the local markets. But on a national basis, we're not seeing the signs, but we'll be diligent and pay attention if we start seeing them. But right now, business seems pretty strong.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good afternoon. Rupert, you talked at the outset about The Journal and Dow Jones and the investments there, and online being a key to the growth story. Can you talk a little bit about the decision to keep the core content pay? What is behind that and if that is still something that you're thinking about changing down the road? And in terms of staffing and technology infrastructure at The Journal, is there a lot of investment that needs to be done ahead of it? And how does that investment level sort of compare to the cost saving opportunities you see at the paper now that it's part of the News Corp. corporation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that as far as online goes, the fact is that those items, those matters that are basically commodities and that you can get free elsewhere or those subjects, that will be in our new, wider more open online service. But we have unique financial information, it is clearly of tremendous value to people, and we think we ought to charge for it the same as everybody else does. And as we open new niche -- <mark type="inaudible" /> niche online sites, some of them will be extremely valuable, and we're expecting &#x2013; it'll take -- it's not going to happen in the next three months. But we are having talks with a lot of financial institutions who seem to be welcoming this approach. And we're hoping that over the next couple of years, we'll have major increases in revenue in the enterprise group.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And In terms of the spending ahead of you in the near term in terms of investing in either the staff levels or the technology assets, the infrastructure at the paper versus the cost savings? Is that sort of a push? Or do you expect to see...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you have paper and price increases coming through I think in the next year. No, we're doing things, we talked about savings for instance. We're just making changes in our -- a small thing, our printing in Colorado, a lot of which we're moving to Utah. It's going to save a fortune in transport. The actual closing down of our plant, and the changeover may cost $2.5 million. We expect to get it back in 12 months. Equally we're going to move -- we are in negotiations, I shouldn't preempt them, with the Tribune Company and Gannett and others to be printing in more places at certainly no increase in cost. But giving a much better product, a much later edited product to all our subscribers.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I guess I wanted to first clarify one of the numbers I heard from Rupert on the call, $250 million for the Super Bowl related advertising. I guess the first question is that -- just presuming that does not include MySpace. And if I can confirm that that number, that Super Bowl is substantially beyond break even operation, that would be helpful. And to my real question would be on the recent appointment of James to head the international operations. I was hoping that perhaps Rupert can share with us the top three priorities that he has been mandated to focus on. And perhaps given the success that he had at BSkyB, I was hoping that perhaps Rupert can address some of the core transferable skills that he brings along to News Corp. to benefit News Corp.'s shareholders? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I believe that we are very lucky in the people we have and we are uniquely good at sports broadcasting. Now the $250 million yesterday, that was for the television network from when you start up in the morning until we close after the episode of House in the evening. It was an all day, all evening effort, but still a very big one. Was it profitable? Certainly. How profitable? I couldn't tell you, it wasn't that much, paid plenty for the Super Bowl .</p>

          <p>Thank you. Gentlemen, I was wondering is there anything you're trying to do business-wise with the looming recession even if you think the economy is pretty resistant and resilient, anything you can do to strengthen your operations right now in case we do slum into a recession?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think we're running the company pretty well. We can always do better, and we're trying to. But we're not going to -- we're running a pretty slim operation. We're not going to turn around and fire hundreds of people just for safety's sake.</p>

          <p>Hi. I was wondering if you could address the situation with Jamba right now and where you think that's headed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think so far business is pretty stable. And I think the main thing there is we just announced last week the hiring of a new CEO, Mauro Montanaro from Nokia. And so I  think he has been on the job about four days now. And so we're expecting results from him next week. [laughter]</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="33" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think that the European focus is going to help Jamba?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think &#x2013; look, the company was European focused when we acquired it. And the European mobile market has been more developed, but we would also like to see the company expand more into U.S. and more into other markets. I think it evolved out of Europe but we'd like to see it evolve to a wider geographic focus.</p>

      <speaker id="34" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that. Mr. Murdoch, if your son Lachlan's takeover bid for Consolidated Media in Australia succeeds, his company would share some investments with News and compete with News in some other areas. Would that put his position on the News Corp. Board in doubt at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If there is any conflict at all, the Board would certainly face up to that, but we don't anticipate or see that at all. In the two areas where we would be associated which is Fox News and Foxtel, News Corp. has clear contractual management control.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="34" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could there be any synergistic benefit about having I guess an ally on the Board, would you say Lachlan is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are no conflicts there and we never had any conflicts when it was just solely Mr. Packer and we don't see any conflicts with Lachlan on the Board. These are management, it's really about management. And we appoint the management and they answer to our management in Australia. So that's not, yeah, I would hope it would be a very friendly relationship and continue to be.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Two quick ones please. Could you guys supply any more detail on the settlement that you reached with Judith Regan, is one? And the second one is, Rupert, you mentioned earlier that the holdup with the DTV closing was not anything from your side. Could you give us more detail about what exactly is holding up that deal, please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>we're not able to, certainly we're bound not to say anything about the Judith Regan settlement. But no, it was, I think probably I better not say anything, but it was that the Justice Department, which took quite a long time to come through, it's not the FCC.</p>

          <p>Mr. Murdoch, you mentioned earlier that you thought the Australian economy was going great and you might've even used the word gang busters in relation to Australian operations. But are you aware that the Australian government is facing, or the Reserve Bank in Australia, is facing challenges on the inflation front. And while rates are being cut in the United States, they're on the rise here in Australia. Are you concerned about the impact of a rising interest rate scenario in Australia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it certainly doesn't affect us directly. If they try to slow the economy down, they could be doing that domestically. I think it would be very hard on people. The price of food is rising, the price of gasoline is rising, and these are world things, which have nothing to do with the Australian economy. But I'm not an economist and I'm certainly not an expert on the thinking of the Australian Reserve Bank. I'm sorry not to be more helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And thank you Mr. Ryan. Well, with that, Mr. Murdoch, Mr. Chernin, our host panel, I'll turn the call back to you for any closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there aren't any closing remarks. Thank you all for joining us. And if you have any questions, feel free to call us in New York. Good night and Happy new Year.</p>
