        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Caterpillar's year-end earnings conference call. I'm Mike DeWalt, the Director of Investor Relations, and I'm pleased to have with me today two group presidents, Doug Oberhelman and Ed Rapp, and our CFO Dave Burritt. Jim Owens, our Chairman and CEO, is a participant at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland today and isn't with us, but he does look forward to talking with you at our analyst meeting at CONEXPO in Las Vegas on March 11th.</p>
          <p>Just a reminder, this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc. Any use, recording or transmission of any portion of this call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript you can go to the SEC filings area of the investor section of our cat.com website or to the SEC's website where it will be filed as an 8-K.</p>
          <p>In addition, certain information relating to projections of our results that we'll be discussing today is forward looking and involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking information.</p>
          <p>A discussion of some of the factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A: Business Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of 2007.</p>
          <p>Earlier this morning we reported fourth quarter and full year 2007 results. And I think the headline of our release was very positive and it did a great job of summing up the essence of what's happened over the past year and what we expect in 2008. It read: "Global Strength Powers Caterpillar to Record Sales and Profit. Company Reaffirms 2008 Outlook for Another Record Year of Sales and Profit."</p>
          <p>I'll summarize the quarter, the year and our outlook for 2008 in just a minute. But the big points are these: The fourth quarter was the best ever of any quarter for sales and revenues. In terms of profit, it was our best fourth quarter ever. 2007, the year, was our fifth consecutive record of sales and revenues and our fourth consecutive year of record profit. Machinery and Engines operating cash flow increased in 2007 $800 million to 5.4 billion. And we're maintaining our positive outlook for 2008 and are expecting another year of improvements and new record results.</p>
          <p>With that, let's get into the fourth-quarter numbers. Sales and revenues in the fourth quarter were 12,144,000,000, and that's an increase of over a billion dollars or of about 10% from the fourth quarter of 2006.</p>
          <p>Profit per share was $1.50, and that's up $0.18 from Q4 of 2006. Again, the fourth quarter was our best sales and revenues quarter ever and our first to exceed 12 billion in sales and revenues. And it was up 6% from the third quarter, which was the previous record.</p>
          <p>A couple of points about sales and revenues in the quarter. First, unlike the first half of 2007, this comparison is apples to apples with Progress Rail. We acquired Progress Rail in mid-June of 2006, and it was included in our third and fourth quarter results in '06.</p>
          <p>It was a great quarter for sales and revenues, with growth driven by continued and significant strength in sales outside North America and continued strength in a number of key global end-markets like mining, oil and gas, electric power generation, marine and industrial engine applications.</p>
          <p>In fact, sales and revenues increased 34% in the Europe-Africa-Middle East region, 36% in Asia/Pacific, and 17% in Latin America. On the other hand, sales and revenues in North America were down 11%. And interestingly, this quarter-over-quarter change by region is remarkably consistent with what we saw in Q3.</p>
          <p>From an end-market standpoint, inside North America it was a weak picture for many of the industries we serve. U.S. housing was down significantly. Nonresidential construction was weak. And on-highway truck engines were down substantially from last year's very huge fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>From an end-market perspective outside the United States, almost everything was up. And some end-markets like mining and oil and gas are booming.</p>
          <p>The sales story, though, was more than volume. Price realization also improved and was up $392 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2006. And a weaker dollar in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter last year was positive 334 million for sales.</p>
          <p>To cap off this quick review of fourth-quarter sales, it's important to summarize what happened to dealer inventories. Overall dealer machine inventories were about flat in the fourth quarter. No region had an increase or a decrease of over 40 million from the end of the third quarter, and in total for all regions the change was less than 50 million. The bottom line is that dealer inventory changes did not have much of an impact on the fourth quarter of 2007. However, if you go back to the fourth quarter of 2006, dealer inventories were up a little, in an order of magnitude of about 200 million.</p>
          <p>Okay, let's turn to fourth-quarter profit. Profit per share was $1.50. That's $0.18 a share ahead of Q4 2006. And again our best fourth quarter ever and our second best all-time quarter.</p>
          <p>The improvement versus last year was largely a result of the 392 million of price realization and the impact of higher physical sales volume, and those improvements were partially offset by higher core operating costs of 296 million. The core operating cost increase was primarily related to manufacturing costs, and it was in three major buckets: efficiency, material costs and higher depreciation.</p>
          <p>The impact of currency on our operating profit was also negative in the quarter, 24 million. And what that 24 million reflects is that our sales were benefited 334 million, but operating costs were up 358 million as a result of currency changes. And operating profit as a percent of sales was hurt about half a percentage point as a result.</p>
          <p>Okay, that's a quick summary of the quarter. Let's move on to the year. Without a doubt, 2007 was a remarkable year for Caterpillar. U.S. economic growth was weak. The U.S. housing industry essentially collapsed. The on-highway truck engine business suffered a dramatic decline. And the word "dramatic" doesn't really cover it. Coal-mining activity in the United States declined as a result of weak coal prices and abundant inventory. And our machine sales to the coal fields dropped significantly.</p>
          <p>As a result of this rather gloomy picture, dealer sales in North America were down double digits in 2007. On top of the decline in dealer sales, Caterpillar sales of new machines and engines were down even further, as our dealers in North America shed $1.1 billion of machine inventory during the year.</p>
          <p>As I look back, I cannot think of a time in my 27 years with this company that I could rattle off a list of negatives like that about business in the United States and follow it with the statement: "We're pleased to report record sales and revenues and record profit for the year."</p>
          <p>2007 demonstrates a lot of what we've been saying now for a long time. We have an increasingly diverse international business. In fact, about 60% of our sales and revenues were outside North America in the fourth quarter. And remember in our categorization of North America that includes Canada. And if you were just looking at the United States, the number would be closer to 70% than 60%.</p>
          <p>From an employment perspective, 2007 was the first time in our history when we had more employees outside the United States than inside.</p>
          <p>From an end market perspective, we are very diverse: Housing, nonresidential building, infrastructure, mining, waste, energy, electric power, marine, and the list goes on.</p>
          <p>Let me give just one example that illustrates that diverse end market point. Who would have thought that in a year, when on-highway truck engines were down so dramatically that we would be reporting record levels of operating profits for our collective engine businesses? And integrated service businesses are an increasing piece of Caterpillar. And that has helped stabilize sales and profit, even in North America. Our total sales in North America were down 11% in 2007.</p>
          <p>That is an overall drop that is quite a bit less than our sales of new machines and engines in North America.</p>
          <p>Okay, the numbers for this remarkable year. Sales and revenues of just about 45 billion. That is up 8% from last year, 2006, and 123% over the past five years. Profit per share was 5.37, up 20 cents from '06, and up 367% over the past five years. That is positive news, but we did have our challenges in 2007. While physical sales volume was up modestly, it certainly was not uniform throughout the company. We were operating well below capacity at our engine facilities that make on-highway truck engines, and that hurt efficiency. We were down at our U.S. factories that make small and compact machines for North America, and that hurt efficiency. On the flip side of that, we were and still are very tight on large machines and engines where demand is high and the backlog is long. We worked hard to get incremental production up in 2007, and that coupled with a very tight supply chain in general did not help efficiency.</p>
          <p>In total, core operating costs were up 1.2 billion, with virtually all of the increase related to cost of goods sold. SG&amp;A and R&amp;D spending were very well managed in 2007 and were about flat with 2006 despite inflationary pressures and higher volume. Manufacturing costs increased as a result of unfavorable factory efficiency, higher material costs that increased just under 1.5%, lower than inflation but higher than we expected when we started the year. As in most of the economy, we experienced wage and benefit cost inflation. Warranty costs were higher largely as a result of the number of new products we've introduced, and depreciation was up, a result of increasing</p>
          <p>CapEx.</p>
          <p>I started this discussion with the point that 2007 was a remarkable year. And while we have had our challenges, overall, it was very positive. Price realization improved over $900 million in a very tough pricing environment. Progress Rail added almost 800 million in sales. Physical sales volume excluding progress Rail was up about half a billion dollars. Currency impacts added 900 million to sales and Financial Products revenues were up almost 350 million. Machinery and Engines operating cash flow was 5.4 billion, up 833 million from 2006.</p>
          <p>We raised the quarterly dividend in 2007 20%. We repurchased over 33 million shares of Caterpillar stock, with a net reduction in shares outstanding at year-end of almost 22 million shares. We spent 1.7 billion in our Machinery and Engines businesses on capital expenditures, much of it to increase capacity. And we ended the year with a very strong financial position. Our Machinery and Engines debt to capital ratio was 31.2%, and that's down from 38.6% at the end of 2006, and our lowest debt to cap ratio in 20 years.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to the 2008 outlook. In this morning's release we were very pleased in these uncertain times to reaffirm our outlook for 2008. We expect sales and revenues to be up 5 to 10%, and profit per share to be up 5 to 15% from 2007. Earlier I said that 2007 was a remarkable year, and it certainly was. But our outlook for 2008 reflects what is possibly even a more remarkable year. The decline in the U.S. economy continues, and our forecast of full-year GDP growth is just 1%. U.S. housing should continue its slide, and the on-highway truck market should get a little bit better, but not back to anything that you would consider normal. But we expect continued growth throughout most of the rest of the world, albeit at a slower rate than 2007. We are starting the year with a record order backlog that is up more than 20% from the end of 2006. And I am not giving guidance for 2009, but it is possible that 2008 could be the bottom of the North American machinery cycle.</p>
          <p>If we continue this decline, as is included in our 2008 outlook, this decline will have lasted around 2.5 years, starting in the second quarter of 2006. With the interest rate cuts that the Fed has already made, and our expectation that there are more rate cuts to come, and presuming that the U.S. government implements a timely stimulus plan, it is possible that after more than two years of decline that 2008 could be the bottom of this North American machinery cycle. And the idea that Caterpillar is expecting higher sales and profit and a record year at what could be the bottom of a North American machinery cycle -- well, to those of you that have followed us for a long time know, that is truly remarkable.</p>
          <p>Let me quickly summarize the pluses and minuses for 2008, and then we will get to the Q&amp;A. In terms of the top line, North America, we're looking for flat to up 5% in terms of top line. And I know that may sound very bullish at first glance, but remember, dealers took out $1.1 billion of inventory last year. We are expecting a little improvement in on-highway truck engine sales. We expect sales to coal mining to be up coming off a very depressed 2007. And sales in Canada, particularly the oil sands, should continue to improve. And sales related to metals, mining, and oil and gas in general should still be in good shape. Outside North America, the picture still looks good with sales up 5-10% in Europe, Africa, Middle East, 10-15% in Latin America, and 10-15% in Asia/Pacific. That's good growth to be sure, but at a slower rate than 2007. For profit, we are expecting an increase in EPS of 5-15%. And the key positive profit drivers are better price realization and sales volume somewhat offset by higher costs.</p>
          <p>We expect core operating costs to be up 2-2.5% in 2008, but with a little different profile than 2007. We expect that SG&amp;A and R&amp;D costs will rise in 2008. And remember, in 2007 they were about flat. R&amp;D costs are going to be up significantly as a result of work on emissions and Tier 4 products begin to ramp up. And after holding SG&amp;A pretty flat and offsetting inflation in 2007, we do expect some increase in 2008. That said, we do not expect that SG&amp;A as a percent of sales will be up. And we are forecasting material costs to increase something like 2007, up, but probably less than inflation. And we believe that manufacturing, labor, and overhead costs will be about flat with 2007, with the impact of inflation about offset with modest operating improvements from the Cat Production System.</p>
          <p>Okay, let's just punctuate a couple of points, and then we will end here. First, more of our sales are outside the United States than are inside. We see continued growth outside the United States in 2007. We see a tough economic picture for 2008 in the U.S., but our sales in North America should still perform better than 2007. Again, that is because of the dealer inventory impact, more truck engines, better coal mining, and continued strength in the commodity related sectors. We are very tight on capacity and expect to increase our CapEx in 2008 to about 2.3 billion. We are very confident in the need for world infrastructure growth over the next 10 years, and we simply need more capacity.</p>
          <p>We are starting 2008 with the highest order backlog in our history, again up over 20% from the end of '06. We are confident in our comprehensive approach to improving operations, and that is the Cat Production System. And we expect more progress in 2008. Our financial position and cash flow are very strong, and give us great flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that may arise. In short, we have a lot we need to work on, but all in all, we are in a pretty good position. With the growth that we think will occur in the developing world over the next decade and the need for basic infrastructure to support it, the world will need more of what we make.</p>
          <p>Okay, that is it for the prepared remarks. We are ready to move on to the Q&amp;A portion of the call. We want to get as many questions in as we can in the remaining 40 minutes, so please limit yourself to one question and a follow up, and we will try and be quick on our answers.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today is coming from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Mike, I guess my first question: the R&amp;D up 15 to 20% was surprising to me. You did give some color on emissions and new product introductions, but I guess -- can you elaborate on that increase and should we be concerned that any of that is being used for legacy issues, perhaps on the engine side or even on the machinery side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think the bulk of it is really what we said in the release. We are in an environment where Tier 4a quickly followed by Tier 4b will be upon us in a few years. We have more spend to do on emission. No, I think it is new products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Doug Oberhelman here. I'd just like to add to that. There's virtually no material increase, if any increase, in any legacy product, specifically truck engines. We're in a major ramp-up for Tier 4 around the world. We feel we want to and will nail that with technology that's better than we have ever released. And we are doing that.</p>
          <p>In addition, we're kind of behind -- not behind necessarily, but we have been on the lower end of where we wanted to be the last few years in overall R&amp;D. So this recognizes what volume opportunities we have out there the next few years that &#x2013; in the various geographic regions where we want to be, that we have got to do some extra things, and that's really what it is. But I want to emphasize there's virtually no -- and certainly no material increase for any legacy products of any kind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have a follow-up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, my follow-up question, Mike; just in terms of disclosure, on the outlook for operating profit, you used to have the waterfall chart. In order to get to, you know -- in order for us -- we have to make a lot of assumptions, I guess, to see what your core operating costs are going to be up on a dollar basis, whereas before you disclosed that, so why change the disclosure, especially when this has been such an issue with Cat? Should I read into that? How should we measure your success on the manufacturing and supply-chain side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's pretty easy to calculate the number. There is a definition of core operating cost in the glossary, and essentially, it's cost of goods sold, R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. And we normalize out the impacts of volume on variable costs and the impacts of currency. So if you take SG&amp;A, R&amp;D, and cost of goods sold and apply the 2-2.5% number, that will give you a pretty good idea of where we are at. And if memory serves me right, I think it's in the 850 to 1.1 billion, that kind of range. The reason for the change in the disclosure is really a couple of things. One, I think the waterfall implied a lot more precision on the individual elements in the outlook than there really was. What we decided to do is move to a little bit more of an explanatory mode. In fact, if you look at our disclosure, we are talking a lot more about the individual elements, and putting ranges around them because projecting the future is not a very exact science, and we actually feel a little bit more comfortable with the ranges.</p>

          <p>Be sure on an actual basis, though, we are going to continue to show those bucket charts for clarity.</p>

          <p>Wachovia Securities. Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Andy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess a follow-up on Jamie's question. With the operating cost outlook to grow in the 2-2.5 range for '08, is that kind of equally weighted first half/second half? I am trying to gauge the improvement that you expect in Cat Production System.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think improvements in the Cat Production System -- and this is consistent with what we have said before -- we expect some gradual improvement. I'd fully expect that the second half of the year we will get more than we have in the first half. I do not really have a forecast of operating profit by quarter. Heck, we do not even give overall guidance by quarter, so I am going to beg off on that a little bit. But what I would suggest to you that I think that we will have a continuing ramp of benefits from Cat Production System.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay; thanks. Second question: diving into the power generation piece of the business on the outlook, what are you seeing in North America? Is that kind of booked for '08, or is there still room in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do not know specifically what the order backlog is on EPG for North America, but I can tell you in general the big products have, particularly the 3500 kind of series products, the solar big power gen products, have pretty extended backlogs right now. I think for almost all applications of big engines, there is a lot of impact of how much can we actually get out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just add to that, at about 250-300 kW and up, there is no change from what we have been saying. It is a backlog; it is solid, driven significantly by data centers and the drive for power quality. Below 250, the smaller you go down, we had a slight swoon last year. That has come back a little bit. Some of that is housing related, I think, and non-res. But generally, that is a pretty stable situation at the moment as we are looking into 2008. EPG is kind of the same story that we have been on, but maybe with a little bit different variable on the low end.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Daniel Dowd from Bernstein. Let me actually follow up on Cat Production System as well. The Solar business has already successfully made a transition to almost 100% poll, and obviously that &#x2013; I realize you do not disclose margins there, but that certainly has improved their margins presumably pretty dramatically. Can you talk about other places in the business where you made a lot of progress on the Cat Production System, and can you talk about some places where you still have a lot of room to run?</p>

          <p>I will just make a couple of generalities. I think we have room to improve probably in all of our facilities, but certainly there are some that are further ahead. You used Solar as an example. We could put in Cat Brazil, we could put in Sagami and Akashi in Japan, who were facilities that were part of the blueprint for what we decided to do in the rest of the company. So they are farther ahead. I think if you were to look at our large older facilities in Europe and North America, we probably have more room to go in those facilities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but let me turn to the issue of the core operating costs, particularly the operating inefficiencies category. You mentioned that new product introductions -- there is going to be some of that ongoing. It strikes me that given the regulatory cycle, the net new product introductions over the next several years should be relatively lower than they have been over the last several years. Is that correct? And secondly...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is absolutely correct. It is not that there is nothing in 2008, but if you look at the breadth and depth and risk of the 2008 introductions as compared with '05 and '06, it is very small by comparison. Yes, I think if you look at the scope of new products -- Tier 3 is for the most part largely behind us, and Tier 4a, we still have a couple of years to go before we get there. I think we have much more stability at least in terms of the product in the factories and product changeover. That ought to be a benefit, a positive to our operating efficiency over the next few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah; I think that is a good point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what we should expect is that at least the operating inefficiencies category of the core operating costs should be net declining.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mike, my question involves the capital spending cycle because it is really surging this coming year, 2.3 billion versus 1.7. And obviously you stated why. You need capacity, but I am wondering if this is a one-year surge, or can you describe what your entire spending bubble looks like, and how much more we might expect in '09 and even '10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not going to get too far out beyond the outlook that we have, but I will say that if you go back to a few years ago when we laid out our 2010 goals, we said 50 billion. And since then, the midpoint of our outlook is not too far from that in 2008. And we have, I think, a better view of the sales increase going forward than we had a couple of years ago. We are aggressively moving in areas like China. We are kind of out of capacity on big engines and a lot of big machines, so I think the need for capacity is there, particularly in locations where we see future growth coming. I mean, the increase in CapEx is about 35% from this year, and based on our view of the future, we need it. But I am not going to get too predictive on the future. I think there is still a lot of water to go under the bridge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The follow-up to that, Mike, is that you are putting up some greenfield facilities, but I imagine that most of the spending is going to be in existing plants, which means there is the probability of manufacturing disruptions as you are applying and installing all this capital. So I am wondering: will '08 be sort of the peak of this and we really get a benefit in your efficiencies in '09, or is this likely to be a more extended spending cycle, and the inefficiencies kind of drop away gradually?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, it is Doug Oberhelman here. I will take a shot at that one. You will recall all the way back to 2004, we were still in '03, and '02 and '01 and back to the previous peak in '98, we were kind of at the low end of our historical rate of CapEx to sales. We have found through this ramp up that we are paying the price for that in everything from machine tools that are wearing out that we put it in place from the PUF days in the 1980's, the needed capacity for mining trucks and large engines, and you name it. We stepped it up in '08 to about 4.7% of sales. I think '07's number was about 3.8. I'm not going to make a prediction either past that, but I would think that with the outlook that we have and capacity we are going to need in our Vision 2020, and objectives past 2010, we're going to be at probably the upper ends of that range now for a little while as we go forward. You are exactly right. A lot of this $2.3 billion in '08 is going to go in existing facilities. That is a big piece of Cat Production System, more modern tools to really increase our efficiency within those plants. What we have found in Lafayette, as we have put the two phases of 3500 capacity increase over there, is that we have not paid any price in terms of operating efficiency as we have essentially redone that plant inside. It is a city within a city over there right now as they add that capacity and straighten out what it is they are doing, and we are ramping up those units almost every month. So we have examples where we can do that, and that is our intention. I really think this is a CapEx cycle like a business cycle that we are going to be stepping up to for a while.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Citigroup. Regarding the guidance, I'm just trying to think through the midpoint of your sales guidance. And making some pretty reasonable, if not conservative assumptions below the operating profit line, it looks like you are implying, using your $5.90 midpoint for EPS, you are implying about 40 basis points of margin improvement. And given we just came off a year where sales were up even if you back out the Progress Rail two quarters of benefit, sales up 6%, obviously a very tough year operationally, and you saw EBIT margins go down 110. When I think through next year, only 40 basis points of improvement baked in, obviously I can appreciate being conservative on the operational improvement story, but when it comes to mix, obviously everything we're talking about what is currently strong historically has been a net positive to the margins, and I am just trying to think through it, are we still capacity constrained? Can I no longer think of oil and gas and mining and so forth as outside the margins relative to company average the way we used to? Because I am just not figuring exactly why coming off such a weak base of '07 margins, with that mix and that kind of revenue growth, why am I getting almost no leverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of things, David. A couple of things. One, if you look at about 1.5 points of our sales growth next year, it is related to an average weaker dollar in '08 versus the average of 2007. So we have about 1.5 points of sales that are going to have slightly more of an impact on cost, kind of like this year. We had about almost a billion dollar impact on cost, and only about a 900 million dollar impact on sales, and that brought down the margin rate, and that will be negative for the rate again next year. Your presumptions about oil and gas and mining being good for margin, absolutely true. Those are positive. But what we also saw in a situation that we have is that we also have a geographic mix, and that geographic mix has been negative. Our margin rates generally speaking outside of the U.S. are lower than in North America -- I should not say the U.S. We had a mix shift from a geographic standpoint in 2007, and that is likely to continue a bit, although not quite as dramatic into 2008. One thing that negatively impacted, I think, the '07 comparison a little bit more than what we have in the '08 comparison, too, is price realization versus cost. I mean it was a net negative in 2007, and that relationship is a little bit more neutral in our outlook for 2008. But it is a case when you think about we are adding 1.5% of sales with currency with no margin coming with it, actually not a huge volume change. We have positive mix on products, we have negative mix on geography. It is a recipe for I think modest improvement in operating profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have got to say here, David, from a broader perspective, we have got a significant amount of our end markets in a very depressed state in the U.S. And we have had in the past a lot of discussions with investors and you all about diversifying our business into services, into geographies, and elsewhere, that in the event we had a downturn in the U.S., we would report improved earnings. And I would hazard to say with you, David, if you and I and others, maybe some of our own employees, sat down in 2002 or 2003 and said that we would see the truck engine market where it is, the housing market where it is, non-res where it is in the U.S. and $100 oil, and we would report record sales and earnings in '07 and '08, nobody would have believed it. But yet here we are.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate that, but one thing I would say is different to what Mike just mentioned, your geographic mix in '08 is better than it was in '07. In '07 North America Machine and Engines were down over 12%. Given your geographic guidance, you're adverse geographic mix will be less in '08 than in '07.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the amount of change year-over-year is, but we still have sales outside the U.S. up 8-13%, and we have sales inside North America flat to up 5.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I totally appreciate that, but given the dramatic drawdowns you were having in some production in North America in '07, the same way for example dealer inventory reductions are less in '08 than '07, I have to believe that is a positive, -- I have to believe the hit operationally in '08 -</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The upside to the guidance, that's great. But if you get 40 bps with that '08 top line would be a bit interesting. And the one last thing, your stock right now is at a free cash flow yield at almost 9%. Unless I missed it, I know the CapEx is going up almost $500-600 million or 700 million. Have you given an operating cash flow guidance? I am trying to get a feel for what the stock is trading on 2008 on cash flow.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to ask you about your pricing, which was obviously very solid in the quarter, and bifurcate it into international and North America. And effectively, was there anything in particular that allowed you to take more pricing internationally? Is it just trying to normalize that geographic differential? Is it that since costs have gone up for your competitors as well as you, or is it just the markets are hot? And also in North America, obviously, we understand why it has been weak, it was better this quarter, and what was able to pop that up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in fact that &#x2013; this is a good point. I should have brought this up I think in the preamble. We had an improvement in price realization quarter over quarter, so if you look at third versus third and fourth versus fourth, it looked like something happened in the fourth quarter. And in fact, what happened was the fourth quarter of '06 deteriorated from the third quarter of '06. If you are actually looking at absolute levels of price realization and you are comparing &#x2013; you know, forget about the '06 comparison. If you are just looking at fourth quarter versus third quarter, price realization actually declined slightly in our fourth quarter because of geographic mix. We had more outside. I think the issue in what made this fourth quarter price realization look so good was that fourth quarter of '06 really started seeing some deterioration, particularly in North America. And your point about price realization being better outside the U.S. than inside the U.S., absolutely, that is the case. Even in the fourth quarter, where we had I'd say let's say easier comps in North America, outside North America was still quite a bit better. In fact, for the full year in North America, we got less in dollars in fact from machines than we did in Europe, Africa, Middle East, and Asia/Pacific, despite the fact that it is such a &#x2013; relatively speaking a bigger market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry. That was very helpful. Can I ask a follow-up just on the materials side as it relates to pricing? You started the year in '07 looking for sort of flattish and you got 1 up to 1.5, so I do not know whether your raw materials or your materials costs rather were getting worse toward the end of the year. And if that's the case, what gives you the confidence in the 1 to 1.5? Is that based on what you have already got locked in or is it based on trends in 4Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at versus our expectations where we came into 2007, we actually had commodity prices lower than they actually turned out to be, just that sort of one impact. And we are looking for next year just kind of based on what we have seen over the last few quarters, our discussions with suppliers, our prediction about commodity prices next year, it just looks to us like it is going to be more of the same. As this year, it could be higher if commodity prices go down more than we think. It could be lower. But it is kind of based on what we know today, what we see coming through. That is what we expect.</p>

We realized that and obviously we reported it all through the year. We have taken I think a little more conservative look at that for '08 and called it to 1 to 1.5.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Merrill Lynch. Just a question on the impact of Cat Production System. I appreciate the fact that it will take some time to see the impact on the margin eventually. But as I looked at your cash flow for the quarter, which was pretty good, it seems that most of the improvements in the quarter was driven by changing payment terms rather than inventory reduction, and if I look at a company that is so focused on Lean as you are and putting in the time and effort, I am surprised that it has been over a year and we are still not seeing the cash flow. I would expect to see it first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Andrew, I think inventory performance this year has been a disappointment for us. We expected an improvement in turn during the year that we did not get. Although I will say in the fourth quarter, we did pretty well, particularly near the end of the fourth quarter, inventory came down. With the Cat Production System, consultants tell us the first thing you see is safety, then quality, and then you start seeing capacity, velocity, and costs. And we actually have an expectation that inventory turns are going to improve. We think we are doing the right things to drive that. Stability in terms of the point we talked about earlier, in terms of NPI and product change should help. Our expectation is that we are going to have an improvement in turns of &#x2013; in inventory in 2008. But to your point, 2007 was a pretty flat year relatively speaking on turns, and we had hoped to do better.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, and as Mike said, most people who have been down this journey this rapid  have seen it come first in safety, then in quality, then in the velocity side. We have seen good movement in terms in terms of safety and quality in '07. That combined with the fact that we do have some facilities that are well down this path, Solar, Caterpillar Brazil and others who are also seeing it in the velocity side. We are optimistic that it is going to come. We recognize the fact that it has not come as fast as we earlier predicted, but it is out there.</p>

          <p>Let me ask a follow up question. If I look at your volume metric alone, it is surprising how little volume benefit you get given your revenue growth number. Even accounting for negative business mix between North America and rest of the world, what is driving this very low operating leverage in this particular quarter, if I strip out pricing and if I strip out operating inefficiency?</p>

          <p>Andrew, I tell you, we can go through the math maybe off line.

But maybe if we can talk later today, we can go through the actual numbers, what you are pulling out and which numbers you are picking up.</p>

          <p>Hi; it is Barry Bannister at Stifel Nicolaus. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Barry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned in your press release that Western European -- there was an 8% decline in housing permits; we know Japan has been soft. Has there been any spillover from the U.S. into the mature Western economies in terms of the slowdown? And the second part of the question is: any progress on the Shin Cat/Mitsubishi, where the margins are much lower than ours, and we are worried about the price being too high?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start with the first. I do not know if I would call it spillover, but certainly in Western Europe it looks like housing there is certainly off from its highs, and I think that is not a surprise to anybody. Interesting point about our EAME [Europe Africa Middle East] region, though, if you look at the growth that we are expecting in EAME, more of the growth is in CIS, Africa, Middle East, where there is big infrastructure spending and commodity-related spending for mining and oil and gas. So really I think we do see a weaker picture for Western Europe than we do for the entire EAME region.</p>
          <p>Another point that I'll just sort of bring up: in our release, we talk about an overall growth rate for Europe. Sometimes people confuse that or think about that as Euroland. But we also include Central Europe in our Europe numbers, so places that are outside of the Eurozone. And growth in Central Europe is a bit better, so that brings the average up a little bit.</p>
          <p>On SCM, it is progressing, and we would like to be in a position here pretty soon to talk about it with you in more detail, and we are certainly trying very hard not to pay too much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just a point of fact on the comment that was made earlier for Doug. If you include the expenditure for equipment leased to others of 1.34 billion in '07 and assume the same in '08, then your consolidated capital expenditures as a percentage of consolidated revenues would be about equal to the post-World War II average, so that does back up what you said about just reverting to a normal spend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a -- you have to be a little careful with putting the Cat Financial number in there as well. Remember, that is essentially for their leasing business, and their volumes are growing faster than the rest of the company. So we would expect that and hope that and like that to go up.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi; good morning. Bear Stearns. My question is around your 2010 goal. Mike, you noted that you could hit your revenue target of over 50 billion two years early. But in that context, you will be two to four dollars short of your earnings goal. Should we expect an update on that earnings goal when we meet with Jim at CONEXPO?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we'll have a -- Jim is planning on a thorough download of the state of the business and update on 2010, and we will address that. There is no implication of any changes of that today, but that will be under his speech at that time, Ann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is it something you talk about internally in terms of -- you hit the revenue target but not the earnings target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have not hit the revenue target yet, nor have we hit the earnings target. Our goals are, as we have said, and we are pretty excited about them. I know he is excited to give you an update at that time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just to follow up on the gross margins going forward. If indeed your CapEx spend is going to increase significantly over the next couple of years, depreciation will also increase. Why would not we expect then that structurally your gross margins will be lower going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you have to look at that increase in relation to our volume growth. I mean, we're talking about order of magnitude of about a 100-million increase next year, and we do have higher sales. Some of the capacity we are going to get from Cat Production System and Lean, so not all of the increase in volume is going to come from higher spending on capacity. There are so many factors that are involved, Ann -- how we do on costs in the Cat Production System, but we did have, I think, below trend spending on CapEx in the early part of this decade. It is going to be a little more than that for a little while. Did you have a follow-up, Ann? I am sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a quick follow-up. Doug, you noted earlier that your R&amp;D spend as a percent of sales is still low I think you said initially? But 4% of sales for R&amp;D, that is well above peer average of 3-3.5%. What kind of normalized spend rate do you expect to have on R&amp;D going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify, that was on M&amp;E only, not consolidated, just for everybody's benefit. That's how we tend to talk about that. We do not include Cat Financial in that. In the last few years, we were at the low end of a long- term historical average, and now we are pushing that up, frankly. We have got lots of 2010 goals and beyond for sales around the world that frankly we do not have the capacity in place for. A classic example, and I know Jim is going to talk about this at CONEXPO, is what we are doing in China and India. We were just woefully short of capacity to address that market, which today is a huge part of the potential for us in the next 10 or 15 years. That alone will drive a significant piece, as will the modernization piece inside our existing factories, as we catch up from what now is the aged machine tools and M&amp;E from the PUF days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But normalized spend as a percent of sales, what do you think it is going to be going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last year it was in the mid threes. I think in '08 we are looking at just under four, and --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do not know, I would say probably higher than 2007 at 33, which was 33 I think. We are not going to put &#x2013; four may be as high as it gets, but it may sustain itself in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One thing on R&amp;D, just I'll make one editorializing comment, and that is these emissions regulations off-highway are coming at a pretty regular rate, and that is an R&amp;D cost driver. We just got through a big Tier 3, and now we are going to a big Tier 4. So they come pretty regularly, and as opposed to the days when there weren't those kinds of regulations, it is a driver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing I might add Mike, is on Tier 4, and one thing that you will see a bit different, we're going to pull some of that spend forward and spend a lot more time up front in terms of developing common platforms that can be leveraged across multiple product lines, so you'll probably get more of a level spend over the period as opposed to some of the peaks toward the end of emissions like we have had in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Wall Street Access. In view of the huge and ramping CapEx, can you give us some more definition on that just by telling us what the two or three big projects were last year and what the two or three big projects are this year? For example, is last year 3500 Lafayette, that kind of detail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was a big piece in '07, it will be a big piece in '08 and a fairly big equal piece in '09 for that example, for Lafayette.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Charlie, there is not any one or two jumbo items that do the whole thing. In Aurora, for example, they have been on about a two-year program to replace all the robotic welding capacity. So it kind of depends on the facility you go in. For this year, we have got greenfield sites in China coming up. We have got an engine facility starting in China. We have got a component facility in China starting. We are building a wheel loader facility in Suzhou. So it is not any one or two big things. Although to Doug's point, Lafayette was pretty heavy spending last year and this year, but it is all over.</p>

          <p>Oh, I see. I am sorry Charlie. I think the reason we do that kind of in the Q&amp;A there is that it is a big strategic issue that is facing us right now. We need to come to conclusion, we get asked about it all the time, but it is, we're sort of in process, seems to be accelerating, but we are not at the point yet where we can talk about it.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, almost good afternoon, I guess. One clarification, and if we</p>
          <p>could go back to this cost stuff. You had $932 million of price realization which was about 300 million under the core manufacturing costs, and your 2% pricing and core manufacturing costs suggests that you are not catching up on those numbers. Is there an intent there at all to catch up that cost price squeeze that's going on within the corporation at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the intent is always there. It is market ability to make it happen. We were a little underwater in 2007. We had a less price than we had cost. It looks like a little more balanced picture as we go forward out to '08. If we look at Q4, it was net positive in Q4, we had 392 of price and think about 293 if memory serves me, for cost. It looks to us like that situation will get a little bit better, but not a lot better in 2008. It is still a pretty tough pricing environment out there. North America is weak. Small machines in Europe are tightening up with the housing down there. It is kind of a different picture depending upon the region and the price. We certainly push it as far as we think we can.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Ingalls &amp; Snyder. I just made it in. People have been dancing around this I think most of the day, but if you look at the incremental margins in the fourth quarter, they were down both -- they were poor both year-over-year, 8% on the increase in sales year over year, and 6% on the increase in sales quarter over quarter. So the gross margin is what I am talking about. It was down 134 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points quarter over quarter. It was not that you came into the quarter with the lower margins. Something happened there and you have touched on it before. Can we get even more specific on what was different about the fourth quarter versus the third quarter and versus a year ago?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, very quickly. Fourth quarter versus third quarter, a couple of things. Actually, price realization was a little bit lower, fourth versus third.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Geographic mix was negative. Product mix going from third to fourth was negative. Sales were up, but it was mostly new machines and engines, less of an aftermarket component. The aftermarket piece is a lot more stable, so product mix third to fourth was a little worse. And cost actually in terms of absolute dollars, fourth quarter is kind of seasonally a high cost quarter for us. There tends to be a run up right at year end. And then followed -</p>

          <p>Yeah, I think there were three main buckets.

          <p>Doug Oberhelman. I would just like to conclude and wrap up here today, again coming back to a point I made earlier, this company has worked hard for really since the last trough in 2001 and 2002 to get to the point where we can announce record sales and record earnings in 2007 and 2008 with what has happened to us in North America. We are pretty proud of that, and in fact, we all know that there are improvements out there before us that can take it even further beyond what we have talked about, a la our 2010 goals, which Jim will update in Las Vegas. But I think it is remarkable. It is a story we are telling our employees that just five years ago, who would have guessed where we are today in '07 and '08 with results like this, and still knowing what is before us? More to come, but we are just extremely pleased that we can report to our shareholders record sales and record profits with the state of the economy in the United States.</p>
