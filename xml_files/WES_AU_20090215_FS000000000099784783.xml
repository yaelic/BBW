          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for holding and welcome to the Wesfarmers 2009 Half Year Results Announcement. Your lines will be muted during the presentation. However, you will have an opportunity to ask questions immediately afterward and instructions will be provided on how to do this at that time. A copy of the presentation can be downloaded from the Wesfarmers website or alternatively can be viewed on the live webcast. In addition to the PowerPoint presentation, there is also an information pack which provides additional information regarding the half year performance. This pack can also be downloaded from the Wesfarmers website.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the call over the Managing Director of Wesfarmers Limited, Mr. Richard Goyder. Thank you and please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Good morning or good afternoon everyone. Firstly, I understand that the problem with the live webcast. So, people will be listening in to this &#x2013; the webcast will be archived and you'd be able to watch that later on if anyone wants to and I apologize for the technical issues that have caused this problem.</p>
          <p>I'm joined here in Perth by Gene Tilbrook, John Gillam, Ian McLeod, Launa Inman, Guy Russo, Stewart Butel, Robert Scott and Keith Gordon. They'll all be talking about their various businesses before we open up for questions. So, I'll just give a bit of an outline of the overview of the half and then I'll hand over to John, who'll commence the divisional run-throughs. So, I'm now on slide the "Group Performance" slide, slide four. And we've today announced the half year profit of after-tax of $879 million, that's after the $125 million after-tax of write-downs and provisions that we disclosed in January.</p>
          <p>Strong operating cash flow of $1.8 billion and the board today has declared the interim dividend of $0.50 per share fully franked. The detailed results are on slide five, and &#x2013; I'll let our Finance Director, Gene Tilbrook, give a bit more information on the financial aspects later on in the day.</p>
          <p>So if we move to slide six, I just want to talk briefly about how we've fared in the divisional performance. At Bunnings, as we said in the release, a very impressive result for the half. Strong comp sales growth, as John will go into, an improving trend on that front. And so a very good performance from Bunnings. And afterwards, he will talk about the improvements that we're seeing in the retail side of &#x2013; the challenges on the Direct but improvements we're seeing in the retail, particularly coming from the implementation of some of the strategies that we're putting in place in Officeworks.</p>
          <p>At Coles, Ian, will run through that performance. I want to tell you that Coles is where we thought it would be, in terms of our plans. There is some momentum in the business at the moment, which is positive. There is an enormous focus on getting the things that we want to get right in Coles at the end of the day through, and we're not going to take any shortcut on that front. There is still a lot to do in the Coles business.</p>
          <p>Target was a very good result for the first half, with strong comp sales growth and again an improving trend in that number. Launa will provide more details on Target. At Kmart, Guy will give you a bit of an update on Kmart. One of the reasons that Kmart's performance this year is below the five weeks last year's is the five weeks that we reported last year, five profitable weeks, and it's not profitable in the whole six months period, and that's one of the issues that Guy will be tackling amongst others at Kmart. So Kmart, like Coles and Officeworks, is a true turnaround, as we've said before.</p>
          <p>In the insurance business, we're very happy with the first half result for Insurance, particularly had a break and we're seeing a turnaround at Lumley, New Zealand. There are some challenges in the underwriting businesses, although the forecast in terms of rates in that business is very, very positive. Of course, our investment income, like others, will be under pressure because of lower interest rates going forward.</p>
          <p>On the Industrial businesses, Resources had a very strong first half in view of the write-down, with record sales, record production, record profits. Keith Gordon will run through the Industrial &amp; Safety, particularly the Energy division. We are really pleased with the Industrial &amp; Safety division performance; continued the improvement, the performance in that business for the first half. CSBP and Energy both effected by Varanus Island gas issues, also some inventory write-down in both those businesses and there's been be very &#x2013; fertilizer volume has been down in the first half.</p>
          <p>On slide seven, we talk about the provisions and write-downs that we've previously disclosed. On the divisional performance, you've got their rolling through of ROC for the division, where there is no comparison to previous year. We cover dividend. And clearly, there is some work to do in a number of our businesses to get return on capital up.</p>
          <p>Which leads me into slide nine, the return on shareholder's funds, where the list demonstrates very clearly the task we have, where we bought an underperforming business and reduced gross return on equity, which is through a return on capital focus at the divisional level, leading to a strong return on equity focus on a Group level how we anticipate improving total shareholder returns over the coming years, and we have a very strong focus on that, as it always has been.</p>
          <p>And finally on &#x2013; there is a slide on cash flow and dividends and earnings per share by our per-share numbers, and John will give some more data on this slide in his presentation.</p>
          <p>I'll talk about outlook at the end. But I'll now hand over to John Gillam, who will run though the Home Improvement &amp; Office Supplies division.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Richard. I'll start at slide 14 and comment firstly on the Bunnings results. Bunnings finished the first half strongly in what is a volatile environment. Volumes in November and December were pleasing and helped lift our trading revenue growth across the half to 8.9%. Earnings for the period grew by 13.8%.</p>
          <p>Trading earnings, which we adjust to exclude property activity, grew by 14% and our overall trading margin strengthened to 12.1%. Our trading margin held despite the adverse A-dollar exchange rate movements and this is because about 40% of the products we sell is totally manufactured or grown in Australia or New Zealand, and we continue to work hard by reducing our cost base and achieving low buy-side product costs relative to our competitors.</p>
          <p>Return on capital was 31.1% on the back of a net capital investment of just over $180 million in the business in the first half. We have a strong safety focus in Bunnings and its pleasing to see these results also turning in the right direction. Turning to slide 15, the highlights of the first half were cash sales growth of 10.3%, with cash store-on-store growth of 7.7%.</p>
          <p>The retail performances held up well. Strong returns were generated from our existing store network through highly focused merchandising and good operational discipline. We are pleased with the 1.6% lift in trade sales, given the weakness in Australia and New Zealand housing markets, and this trade sales growth indicates our strategy here is on track.</p>
          <p>The Bunnings store network continues to expand. In the first half, we opened six warehouses with one of these being our important, first multi-level warehouse store in Hawthorn. We also opened two smaller format stores and six new trade centers, Details of the store network movements for the full year can be found in the supplementary packet page 25.</p>
          <p>Looking into 2009 and beyond, our new store pipeline is in good shape. Investment in bringing current building and merchandising standards into older parts of the store network continue at similar level to prior years and this work supports the returns we are achieving from our existing store network. The Bunnings business is well positioned in the current trading environment with a focus within our offer on value and ease of DIY, supported by further gains in operational efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 16, our expectation for the reminder of the financial year is to continue sales growth, albeit possibly at a lower rate, depending on needs and economic outcome. Trade sales will be sensitive to any further slowing in housing construction. And Bunnings will continue to focus on driving better customer outcomes and making further improvements to our cost efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Turning now through to slide 18, I will comment on Officeworks. Trading revenue for the first half was 602 million, which produced earnings of 25 million at an EBIT margin of 4.1% and we are looking to improve on that EBIT margin in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide nineteen, looking inside the Officeworks results, we were pleased with the 3.9% sales growth in the retail stores, underpinned by stronger growth in transaction numbers. It has been encouraging to achieve this in a period when the business was transitioning to everyday low pricing and margins were subjected to significant competitive pressure.</p>
          <p>Reinvigorating Officeworks as a long-term success is a priority for Mark Ward and this team and there were some key improvements in the first half. Good steps have been taken towards reestablishing range authority, customer-facing conflicts between the store and online channels have been eliminated. Store presentation standards have been lifted through better operational practices and targeted store livery and splitting out investment. And as I outlined in the October briefing day, after successful trials a new store look and feel has been settled, with encouraging trading results. New stores &#x2013; and there were four in the first half &#x2013; have the new look and feel and a number of refurbishments are also completed. This work is ongoing.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, adverse sales trends were experienced in both the Officeworks business segment and in the Harris Technology operations. These two channels to market have suffered due to the lack of confidence amongst their core small to medium sized business customer base, which were at the leading edge of the economy, have been heavily impacted by the current environment. There was also a disruption experienced in these businesses as the strategic direction for them was restated.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 20, trading conditions for Officeworks are expected to be difficult for the remainder of the year, with continued pressure on sales and margins, particularly in the small business sector. However, we do expect there to be moderate sales growth as the business continues to gain traction from the revised strategies that are now in place. Within the business the team is very keen to build on the hard work of 2008 and drive further gains from the strategic agenda that's now being implemented.</p>
          <p>I will now hand on to Ian.</p>

          <p>Thanks, John. I am on slide 22. Since my arrival last May, and the subsequent arrival of our senior team with proven track records in retail, our priority has been developing Phase I of the five-year recovery plan, focused on improving the basic foundation of Coles against an inheritance of years of neglect and underperformance.</p>
          <p>This is an important context which to place these results. At such an early stage of the turnaround, we find it encouraging to recognize there is still significant work to be done. The six months that brought us to December 2008 period saw us generate operating revenue of $14.6 billion, with earnings before interest and tax of $431 million. Total store sales for the half were 3.9% ahead within Food &amp; Liquor, and plus 8.9% within Convenience stores.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 23, we talk about the Coles transformation. It's worth noting that my senior team has been together for only six months; the activity on a number of fronts has been intense. We've been working hard to kickstart changes in number of areas to improve operating standards, become better at fresh, increase focus on service, revise promotions, develop new formats, improve communication and move away from the lumbering geographic, physical culture of the past. We are pleased with early progress but recognize that this is a turnaround, which to be meaningful and sustainable, will take time.</p>
          <p>But the early results were encouraging as shown on slide 24. Comp stores sales were up from 1.3% in quarter one to 3.8% in quarter two. We are seeing positive volume growth for the first time in almost two years on the back of rising customer numbers. Also the changes to our promotional program and capital finance paid dividends, and Fresh food sales are improving, particularly at Christmas where we saw strong sales growth in the areas such as Produce, Bakery and Seafood, where prawns and crayfish were actually 50% up year-on-year.</p>
          <p>In fact moving on to slide 25. our Fresh Food strategy, of course, beginning to bear fruit, however, though we stress again that is still early days and we need better consistency, better operational focus and improving supply chain to supporting better availability. We're investing capital in areas of need, such as refrigeration and checkout. Equally, we are raising the bar on our own expectations on in-store standards. After some early, trials we have landed our first store renewal refurbishment. It is not the finished article, but customer reactions are very positive.</p>
          <p>In Liquor, on slide 26, Tony Leon hit the ground running and is really making difference. He is an excellent operator and a great addition to the senior team. Our value position across all the liquor brands improved and customer numbers are improving also. Our network continues to expand with eight new 1st Choice stores opened and 66 liquor line refurbishments. Convenience stores have also performed well; new formats have been trialed and shop sales are showing at 5.3%, having increased to 5.9% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally on slide 27, going forward, it is clear the economic conditions are hardening, and consumer confidence waning, leading to a more value-conscious customer. We are seeing it already, with more customers shopping for specific budget and house brand sales rising three times faster than the brands. These conditions are aligned with Coles desire to deliver better value to our customers. But it is still early days in the turnaround, and sustainable change will take time, but the momentum is growing, and we remain confident that the recovery approach will be successfully delivered over time. Thank you.</p>
          <p>And I hand over the program to Launa.</p>

          <p>Good morning to everyone in the West and good afternoon to those in East. I am very pleased to take you through Target's financial and business highlights for the period and if we go onto basically slide 43 and 44 combined, we will talk about them.</p>
          <p>Our results overall were excellent, particularly given the market conditions in the first half of the first half, and we finished with an EBIT of 215 million in total for the half. Half EBIT margin remain very strong at 10.3, and we've continued to maintain margins overall.</p>
          <p>Our comp stores sales growth for the six month was 4%, with total sales revenue up 8% for the half. And I am pleased to report that all merchandise departments reported growth during the period. In particular, we had a very strong outcome in Ladies' Youth Apparel, also all our technology based products and toys.</p>
          <p>Target has also had an outstanding Christmas and we planned a strong campaign and certainly supported it with appropriate stock levels in key departments. Our success was also reinforced undoubtedly by the improved consumer spending in December with the government stimulation package, lower interest rates and petrol prices. However, at the same time, I can say that we were extremely focused on costs, and they were and are continuing to be, well-controlled in a difficult environment.</p>
          <p>Our inventory is remaining is fresh and is below last year, even with 11 new stores on the ground since start of the half. We've got over 5% more selling space than year ago, just to put that in context.</p>
          <p>Going forward, our margins on direct imports are also supported by hedging in the near term. However, we have to carefully monitor any potential increases that we are receiving from third party importers, and any significant cost increases for imported products will require careful price management, particularly, as our customers are really looking for value in what they buy.</p>
          <p>Target now has 283 stores at the end of the half and we've got plans to open five new stores in the next six months. Those are going to be three Target stores and two Target Countrys. We are also continuing to invest in our existing store network with 19 store refurbishment taking place in the past half and we've got 15 more planned for the remainder of this financial year.</p>
          <p>In the current economic conditions we believe Target is well-positioned to retain existing customers and certainly impact new customers that are looking for value. We are also well-placed to be beneficiaries of the recently announced second wave of the government's stimulation package. And we are working very carefully to ensure that we've got the right products at great value and great quality to attract that customer in.</p>
          <p>Although the economic outlook is undoubtedly challenging, we are confident of riding out this uncertain period and we are very much focusing on inventory levels and costs, but not losing sight of the fact that we need to be constantly offering new products and then making sure that value equation is very strong; and also, finally, ensuring that we do continue to refurbish our network so that we are well-placed for the future.</p>
          <p>All right. Thank you and Guy, I pass over to you.</p>

          <p>Well, thank you Launa. Slide 33. Welcome everybody. Good morning or afternoon. The only comment I want to make about the financials about Kmart is that its $75 million EBIT is a poor result for a business of our size. The half, was flat in sales growth, with a marginal positive increase in the second quarter of 1%. Apparels and Toys seemed to be the strongest performers during this period.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to go to slide 34. With completion now over of my first 100 days, my focus in this period was to evaluate a business doing $4 billion in annual turnover with the task of delivering a respectable profit that is expected of a business of this size. We completed all senior management changes by the end of January. We significantly reduced our inventory levels compared to last year by 20%, which in turn has also reduced the complexity for our managers of running their stores. And we had a significant focus during this period of improving in-store execution, and our focus going forward will be on our product and price offer. Our core direction here would be one of on-trend low-cost retailer. During this period, we opened one new store in Toormina and 11 refits were completed.</p>
          <p>We go to page 35. My theme again on, sorry, anticipated trading performance for the second half will be similar to the first half. My call to action for the second half will be the beginning of the renewal of Kmart. The umbrella message to the system is three parts. Delivering the best customer experience with outstanding value and quality; second, on-trend low cost retailer; and the third is the right team, with clear accountabilities. With these three guiding principles, we'll focus on wowing our customer that has honored us with their visit each week. We have a huge opportunity in this area. Second, is getting our cost base right. It's not right at present, particularly above store costs. Our aim is to reduce costs by 20% above store and reduce inventory costs by 20%. Third is to rebuild our customer's trust and fourth is ensuring that every site that we operate in across Australia and New Zealand is a success. During this first half we will open two stores, with three additional refits.</p>
          <p>And my final comments are, my team and I are keen on launching Kmart's renewal now and look to the entire system to delivering profitability that would be expected of a $4 billion business and a relentless focus on delivering outstanding customer's experience.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to hand over to Stewart.</p>

      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Guy, and I refer you to slide number 37, the Performance Summary for the Resources division. Operating revenue of $1.427 billion was 167% (sic) [169.2] above the 530 million recorded in the corresponding period last year. Earnings before interest and tax of $686 million, this 512% higher than last year's 112 million.</p>
          <p>Earnings were above last year's due to record export metallurgical and steaming coal prices, and increased sales volumes, offset by higher production cash costs, foreign exchange losses, increasing government royalty expenditure, and higher Stanwell rebate payments.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization, excluding the Stanwell rebate, includes $16.5 billion as a result of higher utilization due to the record coal production for the half. The rehabilitation provision increased and this is noted in the footnote, is a direct result of change to the discount rate from 7.2% to 4.3% and an increase in the amount of area disturbed.</p>
          <p>Coal production for the year was increased by 14% from the last year to 7.9 million tonnes. This increase was due to Curragh's total production increasing by 540,000 tonnes or 4%. Premier's production was up 460,000 tonnes or 35%, and this is due to increased demand from Verve Energy; and coal production at Bengalla remained similar to last year due to the ongoing infrastructure constraints at Port of Newcastle. Disappointingly, our lost time injuries frequency rate, at five, was slightly up on last year, but was an improvement on our Q1 '08 lost time injuries frequency rate of 6.4.</p>
          <p>I'll refer you now to slide 38, Resources Highlights. The Resources division reported record production and sales for the period, and this was due to consistent production from our Curragh mine, the reduced impact of infrastructure constraints, particularly at the port of Gladstone; and strong shipping from both Curragh and Bengalla, in the first half. The division is clearly focused on the maximizing the efforts in our mines during this period of favorable market conditions. The division experienced record coal prices for both metallurgical and steaming coal, resulting in a significant increase in divisional earnings and return on capital. The $130 million diversion of Blackwater Creek is underway.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the Resources Outlook slide 39, we continue to monitor the impact of the global economic crisis on steel production and metallurgical coal demand. Coal price negotiations are expected to progress over the next month or so. There are signs that some mining input costs are easing, such as the cost of fuel, tires and steel. Our forecast Curragh metallurgical coal sales are expected to be in the range of 6.5 to 6.9 million tonnes for the financial year 2008/09.</p>
          <p>Timing of the expansion projects are dependent on market conditions. The Stanwell rebate during the second half of this financial year 2009 is expected to be in the range of 130 to $150 million. Near-term earnings will be impacted by the closeout of foreign exchange contracts.</p>
          <p>Dragline 302the fire, that chain is planned to return to work in June 2009 with the financial impact of that fire is expected to be approximately $40 million.</p>
          <p>I would now hand it over to Rob Scott from the Insurance Division.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stewart. I will start on page 41. Insurance Division achieved 9.9% growth in gross written premium, and improved underwriting EBITA by 15.8% compared to the prior period. This was driven by higher written premiums and strong turnarounds in Lumley New Zealand, offset by higher loss ratios in the Australian businesses.</p>
          <p>The EBITA from broking was 3.6% down on the prior period, but this comparison is distorted by a $5 million revenue amount that will be recognized in the second half compared to the first half last year. On a like-for-like basis, the broking operations experienced earnings growth of 9%. This was driven by organic growth in the revenues, the contribution of broking acquisition and cost efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 42, we are now just over 12 months into the turnaround of Lumley New Zealand. This is progressing to plan with the recent achievement of earnings improvement of AUD14 million from the prior period. This benefit has been partly offset by a significant crop claims in WFI, mainly due to hailstorms in WA and higher loss ratios in Lumley Australia. The consolidation of our Australian underwriting licenses is on track for completion this financial year.</p>
          <p>Our half year results included some significant one-offs, both of a positive and negative nature, both of which cancel each other out. In line with license consolidation, we've aligned our portfolio grouping to industry practice for our Liability Adequacy Test. This resulted in a one-off benefit of 21 million. We also reported a one-off loss of $20 million associated with the effects of lower discount rates and additional investment in LAT. We achieved higher investment earnings due to higher interest rates compared to prior period and as of December yearend period end we maintained a strong capital ratio of 1.84.</p>
          <p>Turning to the outlook on page 43, in relation to the Victorian bushfires as of today, we've recorded 252 claims with a gross value of $71 million. We expect that number to continue to rise as claims come in, but our exposure will be kept to AUD13 million after reinsurance.</p>
          <p>We face increasing new appointments in Lumley Australia, Vivek Bhatia formerly COO will assume the CEO role following the retirement of David Matcher. We've also hired two highly experienced insurance executives to further strengthen our Lumley chain as we look to improve operating performance and take advantage of opportunities in the markets.</p>
          <p>The first appointment was David Richards, who was previously the Executive General Manager of Niche Markets within Promina Suncorp. And today we announced the appointment of John Nagel, who was the executive general manager of the Suncorp commercial insurance business including Vero.</p>
          <p>In recent months, we've observed more consistent pricing behavior and we've been able to achieve modest rate increase across many classes. The lower interest rates will start to constrain earnings and we also expect new business growth to be constrained by the economic environment.</p>
          <p>Given the effect of the Victorian bushfires, crop claims, and the performance of Lumley Australia, I expect a decline in our operating ratios to be slightly above that reported last year. However, our longer term outlook regarding divisional earnings is more positive as a result of various business initiatives.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Keith Gordon.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon everyone. I'll start with the Industrial &amp; Safety division, run by Olivier Chretien, on slide 45. Operating revenues for the first half was $687 million, an increase of 7% over the corresponding period last year. Revenue growth in Australia was driven by strong performance within Blackwood, Protector Alsafe and Bullivants, and the New Zealand businesses also recorded increased revenue in New Zealand dollar terms.</p>
          <p>Market conditions deteriorated during the period. West Australian and Queensland markets remained relatively strong. But in the Southeastern states, markets have declined further. Market conditions in New Zealand are fairly challenging.</p>
          <p>EBIT increased by 11.5% to $68 million for the six months. Margin's expected improvement was achieved, despite competitive pressures, due to further competitiveness in the product and service offering, improving delivery performance, increased global sourcing capability, as well as the benefit from business improvement initiatives implemented across the various businesses. Return on capital increased to 17.1% during the period, which reflected both increased earnings and the benefits of capital management initiatives.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 46, and pleasingly, the safety performance of the division continues to improve, reflecting a focus on safety at all levels throughout the organization. Over the past few years, there has been a step change in the delivered in full and on time performance of the division and that continues to improve and deliver benefits in customer service. This holds the Industrial &amp; Safety businesses in good step in competing for new business.</p>
          <p>Along with delivering performance, business has had good success in increasing its share gains through the working hard at having steady and consistent process in place for all of it customers. Over the past six months, the rollout of number of growth initiatives has continued. Those include value-adding services, improved merchandising and the continuing benefits of global sourcing.</p>
          <p>Market conditions are expected to be more challenging in the second half. Some customers are scaling back production and project finance and in Australia and in New Zealand, we expect to continued difficult market conditions. We're anticipating further margin pressure as the result of cost of goods inflation, the impact of the lower Australian and New Zealand dollar, and increased competitive pressures as competitors fight to maintain volumes.</p>
          <p>The strong ongoing focus of the Industrial &amp; Safety businesses on our tight expense and capital management, proactive margin management and its coupled with strong competitive foundation should however, mitigate some of the impact of the market conditions. Finally, the division continues to implement programs to increase customer share of spend, while leveraging strong competitive positions at Blackwood in its specialty businesses, with better value proposition and improved client effectiveness particularly in the high growth areas.</p>
          <p>Moving on to CSBP, run by Ian Hansen, and starting on slide 47, shows that the first half of this financial year in very good position. Chemicals revenue was up compared to the first half of last year, mainly to due to increased sales of ammonium nitrate. Fertilizer sales revenue was relatively flat, reflecting sales of lower volumes versus last year because of the but at higher average prices than last year. Depreciation increased compared to the first half last year, due to the commissioning of the new ammonium nitrate manufacturing facilities at Kwinana.</p>
          <p>EBIT for the first half was a disappointing $4 million and I'll talk to some of the major contributors to that result on the next slide. All our businesses had some challenging circumstances to deal with, leaving an impact on performance driving improvement compared to same time last year. And the team is working hard to recover earnings as some of these recent impacts on business over the last six months are resolved.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 48, and on highlights the first half for the first six months operations of the new ammonium nitrate facility at Kwinana. Notwithstanding issues around gas supply for our ammonia plant, the new AN plant operated well and showed production performance in line with our expectations prior to commencing the process.</p>
          <p>At QNP, the debottlenecking process has been completed and it's currently being commissioned and that will add 30,000 tonnes per annum of QNP capacity.</p>
          <p>Australian Vinyls had a disappointing half, but on the back of its improved plant performance, it's starting to recover from the extended plant outage last year.</p>
          <p>The Varanus Island incident had a major impact on CSBP. The business had no gas from July through December, and although our plants are now running, CSBP is still enjoying high costs of gas as not all contracted gas supplies are flowing. Although this incident is estimated to have cost CSBP $50 million in the first half, all customer demands for CSBP products were met during this period.</p>
          <p>In the fertilizer market, sales volumes were down significantly compared to same period last year. Harvesting delays and the rapid fall in commodity prices late in 2008 resulted in a significant inventory write-down across a number of CSBP products, including fertilizer.</p>
          <p>In terms of outlook, demand for mining chemicals, particularly ammonium nitrate, remains reasonably robust, although there are obviously signs that future growth may not be as strong as previously anticipated. CSBP has been advised by its gas supplier that we will have full contracted gas supply back in place by the start of June this year.</p>
          <p>The sodium cyanide expansion will be commissioned later this half, increasing our sodium cyanide commissioned manufacturing capacity, and on fertilizers the seasonal break will be critical to our performance in the second half. If we get a good break and demand condensed into a short period of time, CSBP will be well placed to the market.</p>
          <p>I'm going to slide 49 and the Energy division, which is run Tim Bult. Revenue although up by over 14%, was lower than expectation, and this is largely attributable to the Varanus Island incident, which I will come back to on the next slide. This flow-through to earnings which is $30 million for the first half and well below the first half of last year.</p>
          <p>First off, our LPG production volumes were similar to last year, but it wasn't distributed evenly across the half. In first quarter, production was adversely impacted by Varanus Island, and this time prices were at very high levels. In the second quarter, production increased significantly, but this coincided with a sharp fall in the Saudi CP price, which has led to some stock drive-down. Basic performance in division dropped off from the performance in the previous corresponding period and a number of initiatives are being pursued across the division to improve this performance.</p>
          <p>Now turn to slide 50, and the practical situation of LNG plant at Kwinana is going to supply in November. And the plant is operational although we still don't have full gas supply due to Varanus Island. The distribution infrastructure is successfully deployed to lost customers, and we continue with the market development in the heavy duty vehicle market. Pleasingly, we saw some sales growth in our industrial gas business and we look to hold that performance in the second half although the market will certainly be more challenging.</p>
          <p>Dealing with Varanus Island outage, we were able to maintain supply to LPG customers and they understood we needed imported propane to ensure stocks steady supply. On Varanus Island, the estimated impact on cost to the division for the half was $15 million and this is spread across Wesfarmers LPG, the new LNG plant through delayed commissioning, paying off debt and Air Liquide WA.</p>
          <p>World energy prices fell in the second quarter and this has had an impact on the earnings of LPG due to this decline in the Saudi contract price. . However, on this occasion we not only a lower margin on products being sold during the second quarter, but our inventory was revalued down from the carrying value when the CP dropped below the carrying value with an impact of around $9 million.</p>
          <p>On outlook, the Saudi contract price has recovered from December's low-point to reach just over US$500 in February '09, this will affect the WLPG business. In industrial gases, we expect reduced demand from Blue Star Steel, which has called forward us &#x2013; taking shut down of the blast furnaces. We're closely monitoring sales volume to our other industrial customers to make sure we're on top of trends in consumption.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And I'll hand over to Gene Tilbrook.</p>

      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Keith. Well, I'd like to recap on the recent equity raising, where with a three for seven entitlement offer through institutions, plus $900 million from a placement, we've raised $2.9 billion. The retail entitlement closes on the 23rd of February; as of last Thursday [February 12, 2009], we had about $150 million in acceptances through that, so we could see quite a bit more coming through this week. The equity raising really strengthens the balance sheet. More importantly, by combining it with a restructuring of our debt packages, we have improved the maturity profile of our debt.</p>
          <p>The following slide summarizes this, and you can see that in large part the remaining debt isn't due for refinancing until 2012 or '13. And in the meantime, proceeds from the retail entitle will also be used to most effectively pay out some of the debt that's not been paid. Retail, if you backup that slide, having information.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 [54], change of our capital management position for the half year, net debt to equity some 50% and 29% pro forma. Cash interest cover had a ratio of 5.2 times and will strengthen as a result of the raising. We were well within all of our debt covenants and following the raising, Standard &amp; Poor's took the negative outlook off the wind, now rates us BBB+ us stable and Baa1 from Moody's. Weighted average cost of debt given also some of our hedges shortly in the 8%. We expect to retain the dividend investment plan but without an underwrite through FY '09 dividends.</p>
          <p>Looking at hedging, we had a hedge book in line with policy at 31 December and in line with the undertaking now ended. We're currently rebalancing those hedge positions in order to maintain an appropriate level, and that involves paying out or offsetting significant portions of the hedges, many of which were put in place when market rates were in excess of 30%. So we'll realize the order of $150 million hedge losses as a result of reducing that overall hedge position. Indicatively, $60 million is actually recognized in the second half of the financial '09 and the remainder amortized over the term of the original hedges four years.</p>
          <p>Turning to cash flow, we continue with our focus on working capital management to generate strong free cash flow.</p>
          <p>On capital expenditure, we've given guidance earlier that we expected capital expenditure for the financial year to be under $1.8 billion, and you see here that pro-rata for the year, we are running somewhat below that. The programs in Coles, the other retail businesses, and in Resources will accelerate somewhat in the second half of the financial year. In stark comparison with last year, where there was significant expenditure in Chemicals &amp; Fertilizer and Energy, the numbers here represent the fact that those major projects were completed. So, we continue to expect CapEx below the 1.8 billion and indeed maybe significantly below. There can be quite a lot of movement around it the end of the financial year and as we look to next year, it will be t well under that figure.</p>
          <p>Just before moving on, I'll call your attention to the information text slide 101 and 102, where there is breakdown of the results from the EBIT line running though the reported profits supporting your assessment and modeling.</p>
          <p>And now I'll hand over to Richard for the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Gene. I am now on the Outlook slide 59. It is difficult for me in the current environment to make an outlook statement. As I had indicated, we expect the Coles turnaround to continue and John and Guy, I think said that the work is well underway, and Guy talked about a lot of work to do at Kmart to make those turn around.</p>
          <p>Our other businesses are in reasonably good shape. What we are doing at a Group level now is have some differences to reflect on a corporate plan on scenarios where things may improve more rapidly than otherwise expected, or deteriorate further, but is otherwise expected so that we have got strategy to place that each of our businesses to deal with a variety of the economic expected bounces and each business is looking at that and we will be quantifying our actions to dependent on the economic circumstances over the coming months and years.</p>
          <p>Clearly, there will be lower export coal prices, impacting the Resources division from April 2009. We are in the early days of those negotiations, so there is no clear outcome and we will have lower borrowing cost now as a consequence of the equity raising that we've done.</p>
          <p>Our businesses are generally in &#x2013; well, I haven't commented on, are generally in pretty good shape and in good market positions, notwithstanding the economic environment that- you have heard the division managing directors talk about growth opportunities in each of those businesses, and we expect all of those that we continue to invest in the turnarounds that we have talked about.</p>
          <p>Now before handing over to questions, it was remiss of me earlier not to mention that Terry Bowen is with us as well. Terry is here in his role as Finance Director of Coles. And I want to formally acknowledge the magnificent contribution of Gene Tilbrook in the more than 23 years at Wesfarmers, particularly the last seven years on the board, and his time as the Finance Director. Gene will be retiring later in the year, as we've indicated in the press release. I think he's made an immense contribution to the Group primarily in terms of the business development statement, the people we bought into with some of over the years. But also I think he has made a really significant contribution to business in Australia.</p>
          <p>With that we're happy to take any question.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First question is from Craig Woolford at Citi. Go ahead please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Richard and Gene.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Craig.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just want to first ask the question about the Coles business and in particular the trial format. From what I understand is two, collectively the Ivanhoe store and the Larrabee store. Can you just give some sense of what you say is, that the part of the trial that are working and what are not working? And if can also talk about the total CapEx you expect to spend on refurbishment; has that changed and when will we see a significant rollout of the new format?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not going to go into the specifics on the particular stores in detail because they are pilots and works in progress, but we are pretty encouraged by the consumer response to trials that we've relaunched particularly in Ivanhoe, which is driven by a stronger Fresh response that is sensible.</p>
          <p>I think what we said from the start strategically is that Fresh Food is in an area where we believe there are opportunities, so you go up against a more effective customer. So it's not just about how we represent in the store but it's also how you tend to support it by the training of our people and how the operate and in fact the customer in terms of service, so it's a broader integrated approach.</p>
          <p>So Ivanhoe is very encouraging. We've got plans to develop other stores similar to Ivanhoe in the not-to-distant future as well as an extended pilot. And subject to their success we'd look to go for a more aggressive roll-out during the course of the next financial year.</p>
          <p>In relation to capital, what I've said from the start really is that we won't be investing capital unless we believe we can get expected return on it. But as I said, the capital will be available for broader scale during the course of '09 and '10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the CapEx for that Ivanhoe store format within the 3 to $4 million range that seemed to be guided when you were eyeing the takeover of Coles?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think more broadly you'll be looking at CapExes for different stores, different levels depending on the size, the scale of those stores. Certainly CapEx in the order of three to four million is one which should be at the higher end, but I think in the broader stores that we brought the larger stores we've got to expand that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just touching on an issue that many on the call look at it broadly on working capital. Is there anything we should be mindful of with the working capital position, given the timing of the balance sheet? We're going to have the sign out come at the end of June where there might be a very poor second half cash flow? And just on inventory, can you give some sense of the improvement in inventory days in the Food &amp; Liquor division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll might answer that if it's okay. It's Guy. In relation to our working capital, creditors will always dance around it a bit, because we close out on our calendar, if you like, on the calendar month end and subject to the day of week that that falls on, we have some reasonably large fluctuations in our creditor payments. In relation to our December close versus the previous period, there would have been an impact of potentially up to $200 million.</p>
          <p>And if we look more broadly at run rates, because it seems to really where your question is going, we are seeing the kinds of improvement we have expected to see at this early stage in our creditor management. And we are seeing marginal improvements in inventory at the moment, because what we're seeing take place in businesses before turnover is that we're seeing long-term overstocks which we inherited come down to a third of their levels at the time of acquisition. So we're very pleased with that.</p>
          <p>What we've also been doing is reinvesting in faster leading lines and making sure we're in the right locations to ensure that our availability to the customers and on the shelf is improving and we are seeing that come true during the half and continuing to improve as well. So that's &#x2013; our working capital which is really absolutely crucial.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then just to clarify that $200 million that was a net inflow in this first half. because the cutoff of the credit of payments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be up to that amount. It's difficult for me to measure because it's obviously, it's a random bit that you'll see that potentially on the day of the week you could have fluctuations in credit of up to $400 million over a week depending on what day you close it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my last question was just on the Resources segment. In trying to understand, and I think my numbers are correct, it's changing the cash cost. What I've tried to do, understand the cash cost for the time. And if I look at that it's up 57% on the first half of '08, but if I adjust for the royalties and the one-off costs &#x2013; that mine rehabilitation &#x2013; it's still up somewhere in the order of 34%. I'm just trying to understand what drivers of that are permanent versus temporary factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll let &#x2013; that's being clearly, would allow conclusion then a lot of companies through the business. Some of them have been identified in the results sold for the increase of Stanwell rebate clearly up 22 million, increased depreciation up 16.5. Royalties up $87 million, rehabilitation is down to about 16 and the Char plant write-off off six.</p>
          <p>Looking at the last six months, compared to the previous year, our volumes are up dramatically over that period. And we've gone from up to well over seven million tonne export rate from the 6.5 of the previous year. That additional volume is through additional capital at the mines, and that is higher cost than what we would have from dragline operations. So we are seeing some costs in it.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we're very focused on driving our costs down as we go through a period over the next 12-months of considerably lower coal prices. We're starting to see fuel prices come down, fuel prices come up. But there's still clearly some higher costs that are in the business that will continue to be there in April.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Craig, You should think about this last six months as a real focus that, particularly at Curragh, is getting marginal tonnage out of the mine and onto ships at these high prices. And there is a cost associated with that, which, and a lot of those costs can be taken out of the business when you're not trying to get those extra marginal tonnes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm just looking for some, just further insight because this is going to be to increase your input given the falling coal prices. You're going to have to firewall the cash costs per tonne fall in the FY'10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are planning to see some costs come on relief, such as steel. Except for certain steel prices, we think that the costs are at the top end of the cycle now and over the next six to 12 months we'll see significant reductions. We know that those costs that are directly based over coal prices versus the Stanwell rebate. And clearly government royalties, royalties will come down in I think in the next six to 12 months as well. And we'll adjust our production rates to match the demand that's in the marketplace, and that will also have an impact on our profits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What, what proportion of cost would be labor and fuel within the cash cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's probably a 30 to 40% of total cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, guys..</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a question on Coles, if you could &#x2013; maybe if you could give me the clarity around trends in the gross margin. There is this cost of doing business; how you still hold traction to it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that Coles or coal, Philip?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Coles as in the supermarket business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think that from our operating view, we are encouraged by the progress that we're making both in terms of a sales level and a profitability level as well. There is quite a bit of work being done to try and make sure that we get the right balance, but we are looking to make sure that we retain the value proposition with our customers as well, and that can't be ignored. But I think, our focus is going to be to ensure that value is in place and look to drive volumes and get effective cash return from that particular structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm really into that I mean is there major &#x2013; I know your margin doesn't change by much, but was there any big difference; your gross margin went up significantly because your private label sales went up significantly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you've got to look at the overall mix of products; there are some benefits, demands in there where we look for further analysis that pricing effect that's what we've done. Our price &#x2013; our inflation levels has been maintained at a pretty low level, really, as we continue to deliver value and our prices are not rising as fast as well as might be. So there is a combination of effects which we are looking at reinvesting in price where we believe it's appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the last time, you touched on pricing in one of the slides, where you're at on the supply chain, I guess that three parts to that has been the infrastructure side but then is the IT implementation side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think we are making some pretty good progress actually. We're seeing an improvement in the performance of our supply chain in more recent months. So, our supply chain network is that we see is broadly complete having about one or two more to the chain in the forthcoming months. But by and large we've been leveraging more efficiently-effected delivery into our stores. As proof, the deliveries on same store improved by about 10%, and not having a result enhancements to our availability. Our availability to our customers improved in that period time as well. So all with that combined with the supply chain level are working very effectively.</p>
          <p>In terms of how we're going to use technology in the future to improve it further, we have four stores on trials at the moment and also replenishment trials. They are going well. We are very encouraged by the progress, but again it's early days, the IT systems themselves are more than fit for the process, but these processes, in my experience it's not just about flipping a switch on the IT, is about winning hearts and minds in the stores. And we're working very hard to make sure we have a needs-based approach, but we are looking to extend that pilot to more stores in the coming months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I can ask one last one, just on gross working capital. It looks very good seriously down against six months ago, so for the first six months period, but it's actually compare this balance sheet value versus the balance sheet value a year ago, and inventory is up $500-odd million. So I was wondering if there is anything unusual in that given your comment that inventory was well managed in all the non-food business?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I can comment on that. There are several areas where inventories is up, particularly, in CSBP including fertilizers as we discussed, and that's the result of market factors and some of the issues around production. There is an increase in Home Improvement and Officeworks and that's an intentional extra provision when the business is better, we'll seek to take advantage of market opportunities. But overall, if you look to combination of receivable, inventory and creditors it's been pretty badly managed, and in particular, we're getting some better creditor arrangements coming through here in the credit cut than there was couple of years ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that sort of a one-off, or is that continue of you already expect that those benefits to help creditors spend less time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Emily Van Keefe (55;42) at Deutsche Bank. Go Ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a couple of quick questions. Just looking at the Bunnings business, the margins in the half obviously excellent margins. And during half, obviously the A-dollar fell from about $0.93 down to where it is today, about 65. Just wondering if we should expect more of that the currency impact to flow through the margin in the second half. And secondly, in terms of the Coles business, just trying to reconcile of the sales growth of 3.8% in the December quarter versus what was recorded with the IDS of over 5%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Emily, it's John Gillam here. I'll pick up and let Ian follow. The A-dollar impact in running through is really bit much misunderstood I think. Firstly, as I noted before, 40% of the product we sell is probably manufactured or grown here in Australia or New Zeeland, so we had a lot less impact then a lot of other retailers. And secondly, we've been working very hard to reduce our cost base, and working very hard to lower our buy-side position relative to the creditors. And those three factors give us a lot more ability to control our destiny here than might otherwise be thought of from a simplistic analysis. We also benefit from the fact that a big chunk of our turnover is necessity-based &#x2013; with people doing things around their home &#x2013; one third to about 40% and that drives a natural sort of position that keeps volumes kicking over.</p>
          <p>Ian, I'll turn it to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of inflation in Coles, we have in diversity that was highly profitable. Our inflation in the first quarter was around 1.3, which indicates flat volume. As I mentioned in the presentation, our volumes are now positive, but we have been increasing inflation albeit smaller, and that's primarily due to a change in pricing, increase of hedges where that the early part of the half, we are experiencing deflation of around 20%; and now it's come back to flat. So we are in a strong position.</p>
          <p>There does seem to be a number of questions around how things calculated does change from the retailer to retailer, but we are very confident that the way that we've calculated is both fair and comprehensive. It includes elements such as adjusting for volume changes year-on-year, and since promotions is quite significant part of our total mix, we've had Ernst &amp; Young review it and they've confirmed it as an effective methodology as well. So what it tells us, really, is that our sales performance is on the right trends and our volumes have got positive which is very encouraging indeed in terms of our turnaround.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, maybe just on one final question to Stewart. Given the uncertainty of environment around coal volumes and pricing, just wondering and I know just &#x2013; you've included a slide we see, destination of the coal that you export. Just wondering if you would expect your coal volumes to move in line with the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Emily, I'll certainly answer that. As we move forward into this next year, really, coal cost and demand and volume will be under some pressure. To date, we've been shipping relatively strongly, certainly for the first half of this year and into January and February. I think what sets us uniquely apart from a lot of our competitors is our strong group of customers.  About 85% of our sales is into North and South Asia and we have a limited exposure into European and South American markets, where sales have not been turning up due to this current market glut. In terms of volume for next year, that will all unfold over the next month or so, as coal talks settle, but we're feeling relatively comfortable that our volumes for the next year will be similar or slightly less than our current volume.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. Just in regard to Coles, looking at the June '08 results, Wesfarmers noted that Coles's market share was stabilizing. We haven't seen or heard you guys said that. Is that something to say that in a last couple of times you've come to market. If we look at regardless of how anyone wants to measure food inflation, your comps are much lower than what your peers are. Has market share fallen, and when do you anticipate that some of the initiatives the you're embarking on will actually see market share start to stabilize and increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, we're in a situation where we're looking at the refurbishment program that's going to expand and grow over the next couple of years. And obviously others outstanding still. So as far as our sales performance is concerned, and how that's affecting market share, we actually did see a small increase in market share over the Christmas period. And our overall market share is broadly in line where it was, so it has stabilized, and actually we're seeing growth in Liquor as well. So in spite of what's been said before, I would still maintain that right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So value we're not seeing all that market share data you are getting, but if we're seeing 7.1% from your peers &#x2013; sorry, from Woolworths, that they have posted some decent numbers for the period ended October. How do you rolling out an enormous number of stores and Coles are generating 3.8%, not for the price investments, making the difference there, I mean. So if you understand how we &#x2013; I was trying hard to reconcile that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it depends very much on how you assess your overall market. I mean, you've got to remember there are 30 fresh foods competitors out there and not just four. And one of the things that we focus very heavily on is driving our improved performance out of fresh foods and where the markets are actually far more fragmented. So our overall share of market is broadly stable, as I mentioned, and in some areas we're actually seeing growth, albeit marginal. So at a time when our core marks are pretty much the same they were before and we're still today at early stages at the recovery program, we're encouraged by that position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In regards to the provision that was raised at the time of the acquisition of Coles, could you maybe just one for example, Terry can be &#x2013; how much of that provision was released in the Coles supermarket business over the first of '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might take that. The... by what provisioning you're referring to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; I think when you guys raised the 389 million provision, I think it actually increased by some eight million in regards to this half, where it's relating to the onerous contracts, I believe, some big contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The late contract we continue to relate it in the change of that we see seven million per year there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Per annum. Right. All right. And just in regards to both Launa and John, in terms of the fiscal stimulus, how much did the strength in December help your margins as you were able to clear through product at that time that's obviously a very powerful and important period of time for retailers, and how much of that margin expansion can you guys essentially point to as being positively impacted by strong sell throughs in the month of December?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just kind of answer first on Target's behalf. We've actually undoubtedly did feel an upsurge from the money that went into the economy &#x2013; there is no doubt about it. But I also have to say we don't know exactly how much it was because of course of the price of petrol going down and interest rates and the actual money going in; we benefited in total of all three, plus what we had done as we had really re-looked at our promotional program and changed it and adjusted it. And fortunately our program was intensified the very week that that additional money was felt. So we kind of &#x2013; a lot of things fell in line. We did undoubtedly benefit from it, but our margins were already well in place; where we really gained was from of our sales. But regarding margin, for a lot of our things that sold very well were the interactive toys and so on which weren't in the part of highest margin, but we were still well placed when it came to apparel and so on. So to give you the exact answer of how much was entirely direct stimulation, I actually can't do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just to add to Launa's comment. I agree with the precis she's given you there. I did make the point earlier, saying November was strong. There was no stimulus package then. Clearly, the stimulus package had an impact, but November was strong and it just keep on a little bit on top of it our perspectives by the second half of December. A bit more of an enjoyable experience in terms of overall volumes but we were in a good position leading into that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. good morning, good afternoon. A couple of questions, just first of all, I was just wondering for folks in the Coles division what's the future for Bi-Lo at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bi-Lo is about 5% of our total sales and we're actually seeing an improving trend in Bi-Lo as well. So we've certainly got no immediate plans to withdraw the brand, and really our priority is on the Coles renewal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we can expect Bi-Lo to continue at its line of business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well at least for time being. You never say, never, really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, probably not. In terms of the Coles format, you tried any number of very different formats, as you've said early you're sort of down that track a little bit, I guess with some of these business changes. What's your thinking about where you've got to position, at least in terms of format and market offer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think if anything you want a business that doesn't exclude some of the population. I don't think you can afford to do that. And therefore, you want to make sure that you are focused on delivering value to middle Australia, but also you want to make sure that you've got something, which recognizes that there are different demand patterns &#x2013; demand patterns in different parts of country. And so we want to make sure we've got format that has sufficient flexibility to reflect that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned earlier that the Ivanhoe format, and I know it's got a lot of attention, was recording fairly good numbers in terms of sales. Is it a profitable format for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we wouldn't be rolling out a format unless it was profitable. That's the key. And I said that before, so before we roll anything we were making sure that we are getting an effective return on investment, but we are extending pilots similar to the Ivanhoe format into other stores in the near future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The &#x2013; couple of things are interesting about the format. One was the complete absence of the returnable plastic crates which we've grown to love and &#x2013; whatever. What's your thinking about that is just tracked into the supply chain whether that would be changed across the network?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what you do it in any style is you want to make sure that you pilot something that's quite different and that you will obviously manage and review carefully end to end the overall level of profitability that you are going to get through that at the end of the day by that changing supply chain approach and we'll adjust accordingly if that's required.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just surprised earlier I think I want to make sure our interpreters comment correctly on CapEx. I think the comment was in the context of about 3 to $4 million CapEx at the upper end per store. Were you considering Ivanhoe or not- Ivanhoe in that sort of comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think of, Ivanhoe is a pilot, of what you'd expect to do over time is to ensure you get economies of scale through learning and broader levels of capital acquisition. So in time, you'll expect to be in a position where stores will be renewed and the level of CapEx that going to be required is going to be very much dependent of what condition these stores can withstand based upon the recurrent turnover &#x2013; that's their currently potential and the aspects to the return on capital prior that we make.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Where in terms of timing; you've been at it for 12 months. I know you've got a lot of wear behind the scene to get extremely focused. Where we are adding this sort of starting to roll out refurbishments, and what rate could you envision share doing that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the &#x2013; first I've been here for nine months, so don't write too much of my life away, so I've got a bit of left. And the team has really been placed for about six months. So as I mentioned before, I think we've done quite a bit on the ground overall. Ivanhoe is the first test. And we're pretty encouraged by the results that are coming through. We will be rolling into three or four more stores and fairly soon, and we'll be deciding to roll out further within the course of the following financial year. So that's our plan. We're not going to be guiding to a number yet, or a timing because we're going to make sure we get the investments right. But I would envisage that when we are up to a full head of steam across major and minor research, we should be in the position of redoing broadly about 100 a year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll be happy to answer that but clearly, we are looking at our insurance associated with the &#x2013; and with comparing at times. These claims do take a long time to get settled, so it's probably too premature to comment with any certitude on the outcome, or the time we expect to go in for the recovery.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's probably the potential claims and I confirm that you've take a 100% of the cost into the P&amp;L of the costs as they stand to-date. And therefore any claim that you get will be upside to the P&amp;L in future years?</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, in terms of the dropout in costs associated with channel and it goes both with the operating channel where we will capitalize the costs associated with the converted clearance, so we are actually replacing that at the -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Little bit okay. So therefore in respect to the dragline, you're thinking 20 million you are capitalizing in effect the other 20 million.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thanks for that. Turning to Coles, you referred into buyer contracts out for the renegotiation of those. Can you give us an indication please as to how far-through your supplier base you're in negotiation of the contracts has taken place so far, and how much more is to go? And give us a broad indication as to the benefits you're getting from that both in terms of terms but also lower prices?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I would say, no, I'm not going to give you any of that. But I put again, we've obviously got very good relationship with our suppliers. I've actually made all our key suppliers' personally which was my idea, and the dialogue is actually very constructive and certainly if we say one pose and one strong good market player in that marketplace. We've had a very good discussions with and I think supplier negotiations is my hobby. A point of time that's very much like usual and that risk and I won't say anything further on that.</p>

More important, we're hearing from a number of suppliers is increased creditor terms as well as expectations of either low or very limited prices for this year, despite the impact of the falling Australian dollar. Is that wildly off base or is that relatively consistent with discussions taking place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think if any, when any supplier don't &#x2013; want price increases and our &#x2013; they're obviously going to say that, but basically, but also we've got to adjust with our customers time, maintain our bank's exposure and add value. So we'll have discussion across a broad range of that base of suppliers in terms of dealing with them. So as I said, I am quite satisfied that we've got pretty good dialogue with them and start the relationships and I would -tend to believe that they're improving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Final question is, should we be looking for &#x2013; this is a Group-wide question &#x2013; should be we looking to further write-downs in the second half above the 20 million that we were talking about with the dragline, or in FY10? Or we have pretty much put all of the write-downs associated with Coles, et cetera into the P&amp;L now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are going to depend on the interest rate environment over the next few months. Because that obviously had a pretty direct impact on property valuations and discount factors associated with the lower. Other things like workers compensation, a bit more can depend on that I think.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If I could, one final question. Launa, you mentioned the trading in December, and saying you're not sure how much of that related to the stimulus versus lower interest rates or lower fuel costs, but January and February trading, is that more like December or are they more like, say, October, November?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I can say is that we are exactly on budget for January. And as we are trading in February, we're basically very comfortable with where we are. We're on budget both financially and sales wise. And in fact our inventory is below budget as well. So at the moment, we are fully on track. There has been a slowdown, of course, but I mean you also have to remember December's when everyone buys their Christmas presents and we already get that market anyway. But the fact that we were much &#x2013; we're very, very comfortable with were we are.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of questions for Ian, just for starters. Ian, how confident are you now that the further earnings that you've booked, and if you look across the '08 calendar year, sort of look at this half and the last half of FY'08 in terms of that being a base of earnings, thinking about downside risk. Should we be thinking downside risk for earnings &#x2013; is that the baseline which will exceed growth from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think it's for me to give a forecast on where our earnings are going to end up. We clear obviously have very firm eye on the profitability of the business, and we are driving our volumes in the right direction. And our sales are improving as well. And the results for January are quite encouraging, too. So our overall position on earnings is not one that is far from our mind in terms of looking to give indications that people should move something along.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What chance is there &#x2013; and I think that's been touched on little bit earlier in the line of questioning. But what chance that two different formats of marketing and strategy versus these markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not really going to commit to what are our formats might be. There will be variations on a theme, of that I am sure. You have to have that. If you've got stores that vary in size from 1,500 square meters to 4,500 square meters, inevitably you have to have variations and in terms of how you convey that to the customer. What's important that we have key plans of the representation of the format that's going to be delivered across the chain and that's what we are working on and that's the point of doing trials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And when you &#x2013; I think you referred to it couple of times already, but just to clarify on when we can expect formal rollout of whatever the new format or the finalized format might be. Did you say we would expect one rollout by the end of this calendar year? You sort of talked across '09 and '10, I just wasn't sure what you meant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I have said that we are looking in the next sort of two or three months to extend the pilot into more stores. We will be reviewing that extended pilot and on the back of this possibility, we expect to roll progressively to more stores during the course of the next financial year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a question on CapEx, and I know it's been touched on also in terms of CapEx per store. Do you feel like the CapEx guidance given as across the total for the supermarkets that you can still speak to that, even though that store format has yet to be finalized?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I am very comfortable with the level of capital that's going to be required to underpin and support any rollout program, will be within the guidelines that you has been given.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And a question for Guy on Kmart. Clearly, if you compare this half result versus the five weeks of last year, should we be implying that a 26 mil loss during the &#x2013; over 21 weeks was the way that business traded?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it would be fair to say that if you looked across the whole 12 months for Kmart, where it's got a couple of months &#x2013; a few months which hit above water and many months where it hit the low. Hence, my comment about the real focus for us to &#x2013; there are people in the marketplace that have similar volumes with returns goods, reasonable returns on that type of volume. And our aim is to head down that way as well. So there is a lot of costs to come out &#x2013; that came out that built up over the years, and we can pull them out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I am just trying to think about the non-Christmas trading run rate if you're thinking about this second half and how much the overall loss might be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the next six months will have a lot of things happening inside of it, because we're finding some things that may be pulled out. above store in particular with the cost of inventory, the cost of running the office and cost of supply chain. So all I can tell you is that over the next 12 to 18 months, our focus is to be a low cost operator and we are not. So it will be an interesting format to watch as we move forward. There is a lot changes that need to be made. And I'd say it will probably be similar to what we've already forecasted for the full year that came out as the opportunity in the user base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And one for Launa as well on Target. You talked about synergy and cost increases coming through will require price management. What does that mean exactly? Can you give a couple of examples, so we can put that into context?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, just recognizing that we do about 40% of our own direct import, which we have covered with favorable exchange rate, but recognizing that our suppliers haven't necessarily covered forward, so they are starting to come through with cost price increases, because most of our products come from offshore, particularly through Asia, as does our competitors. So, we are all on the similar boat. So what we need to do is break this and look at what do we need to do to make sure that we still offer value for the customer, but we're taking into consideration that there will be price increases. And that's one thing that we are working through that. We're very much keeping a close eye on the market and watching that some of our competitors now are already starting look at prices. So we are monitoring that and adjusting ours as we go along.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one last question back to Ian &#x2013; sorry I missed this one before. I am thinking that there has been fairly extreme weather conditions over these past few weeks. Have you already seen an impact on produce pricing and what your expectations re: that over the next quarter or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there has been, particularly on some of the produce that's coming from Queensland. We have been actually air freighting some of it out of that area and also trying to maintain some quantity of supply, particularly on areas like bananas. You know the price per kilo has gone up on the back of that &#x2013; it's going to be very much dependent on what happens with the weather over the next few weeks, to see how quickly we can get supplies moving back again. But there has been a short-term impact. It's difficult to say how extensive that's going to be, more broadly effect over time in the coming months.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right. This is interesting. I am pleased hear to what you said about recovering yours. So let me rephrase it in a different way. In terms of its going well, presumably the sales were higher not lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That'd be a fair assessment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll leave there. Can you just talk about store clustering? I mean it's a kind of complex market. I mean there are checks; sometimes, you guys like to have different formats and things to be coming under the haves and have nots. Is that a fair way to think about the Australian market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the Australian market reflects other economies as well. I think there's a general economy; we also know Australia is not as a challenged as in other areas, particularly the in UK, where it came from. They're having real challenges. I think it can express all aspects of this. I think in other space, Australia is not having that effect. I do think that consumer confidence does tend to be sensitive, and that's fairly evident, people are looking for value.</p>
          <p>And I think you look at that in a number of different ways. So in terms of having multiple formats it'll have a very precise store clustering, I think that is something, which we would be looking to do. I think you can certainly have formats of stores and utilize the product mix that you have within that particular patch which reflects it more effectively. But it doesn't necessarily mean that you have different formats and one part to the other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've put a lot more effort into that area. We've sent a team in that area as well. We're working more closely with our suppliers. We've taken a number of suppliers and take the employees to the suppliers and actually had them working, and I don't think it's wrong help support their supply chain through to improve our forecasting efficiency to work with suppliers through our supply chain, both of them, on time delivery through the supply chain as well. And then through, into the stores, as I mentioned earlier, so there is quite a lot of work taking place, trying to tighten in those specific areas and improve our performance.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you have to find the right balance between the costs that you save and the level that you invest. Selling can be profitable in any supermarket anywhere. And we want to make sure that we maintain a very strong cost-conscious ethic. We look to streamline the center and if our store positions have reduced significantly. But if we need to invest in stores, more better service and produce so, the growth will improve more efficiently throughout the organization as well. So all of those elements of have initiatives out to take place at the moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. A quick question for Guy. How is Kmart going to be different from Big W going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've spent a bit of time purchasing on the competitors around Kmart and I think the main thing where we're going to be focusing on is, we've got, as I said, this business, which is a sizable one compared with our competitors, has got costs in it that need to be pulled out, so, it came out originally ahead of this country about 40 years ago &#x2013; as we actually hit our 40th birthday this year &#x2013; wanting to be a low cost operator and selling on-stream products, as a low cost retailer. That's the part that's broken down within size of model. So I want to make that point is, it's not a bad thing; it's kind of about having a $4 billion business that's surely within its DNA to make money.</p>
          <p>The second part is the opportunity within Kmart is that we have a number of consumers that walk into our business and walk out with nothing in their hands. So, I'll put right at the top of our list of to do with in part just that we need to do a much better job in satisfying our consumers. So the bottom line is we have many of the people that visit us each week and we are not satisfying them, and we have a cost structure for a business that's probably the largest format in Australia that is not correct. So my focus for now is Kmart and executing its model correctly, which is what its original intention was 40 years ago. And then let my competitors do whatever they think best, but low cost and I'm not being particularly fast about what type of floor or ceiling I've got. I think that consumers deserve a better experience in the store, and a product that is on trend and selling to them at the best possible price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just one follow-up, there Guy. The merchandise is the problem and that's why you've got large periods of time where you're not profitable, last year &#x2013; your last year cost of sales would not be seasonal as you trail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wish you with just one item and if was just that merchandise that usually the math when you go from a $4 billion business that produces and net income of nil, if it was just one item then my predecessors would have picked that 10 times over the last four, five years. There is about, I don't know, critical elements that I've evaluated in the last 100 days, that have gone amiss with Kmart and whilst my first period of time at the store focused on what my competitor has done. I think that you can be sealed away and spend too much time looking at what they have done or haven't done instead of looking in your own backyard and my team have been very impressive. They will yell at you, tell you what went wrong in Kmart and they know there's someone listening to it and just picking the eight to 10 items and addressing them immediately, which is why I think I made the point that in the last month, we remove about $200 million worth of excess stock that has been sitting there for a good period of time, which is now gone. It's a little bit different than it's been with the package that came out in December, I think that have my own stimulus package. This is related to Kmart to get some things of outstanding value during the month of December.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon, thanks. Richard on &#x2013; there are some questions on the Resources group, I am quite concerned about coal you made it outlook for that division. The first question is, you've always in the last two or three years at least presented the chart on coal production costs and what the cash production costs per tonne for product tonnes is. Can you give us an indication of what the cash production costs per tonne is in the first half '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I will do that. David Stewart here &#x2013; yes the costs are up about 30% year on year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>30%? Year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that was because you just had get the tonnes out of the arm onto the barge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we feel we have a philosophy of getting maximizing, trying to do in the period a clearly high selling prices. But in addition to that, we see that our costs have moved in line with the increase &#x2013; we haven't seen increase in the costs compared to our competitor and we believe that we still maintain our position in the lowest quartile of costs for export at local cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Stewart, because in your volume chart a question was asked for that. When you look at about 70% of your coal goes to Japan and Korea, although they are vast and now both those countries steel industries are in a sharp recession; it's not depression; it very deep recession. I am really intrigued as to how you are going to maintain production volumes? I mean there it's previously announced production cuts of at least is 10% some are saying it could even be higher. I am just really intrigued as to how you are not going to suffer, particularly when you got 35% of your tonnages of Global PCI which seems to be as one that gets absolutely smoked in the first weeks of a downturn and there has been rumors out there that some PCI producer selling out of Leicester was selling their products of thermal coal at 70 to $73 a ton to the Koreans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's what's been said &#x2013; wouldn't surprise me at all David. &#x2013; Just looking at our export sale price that we've had so far, we're being very, very particular in terms of who we sell our coal to and to make sure that we are long term enough with those, direction that's strong and a long history. Our big target, particularly, is what we call the blue-chip consumers, particularly in Northern Asia. And while I agree in terms of general volumes there is no doubt that volume going ahead will be under pressure. But our view on that and that'll become clearer about next month or so as the coal prices and volume settle, but the impact on us will be probably a little less than what others are seeing. And that's a direct result of that marketplace that we export in, so we don't have huge exposures into that territory or what I call more difficult parts of India and Europe. Our customers are blue-chip and they are honoring their contracts with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Stewart, with the Stanwell royalty, it's really hard to forecast. Most of this would have come &#x2013; we're about 200 million in '09, and there you pretty much saying it's going to be 100, 200 in '09. In '010, assuming that the currency stays at $0.65, and which I know, I don't want to say that you think the coal prices are going to drop to this level. But let's just assume that the higher pricing coal cost drops to 120 and your volumes are around that 6.5 million tonne level, what would the Stanwell royalty be under that scenario in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look David, it's &#x2013; we've given some guidance as to what the Stanwell rebate will be in the second half, and we're expecting the full year to come in somewhere between 180 and $200 million in total in our financial year. Next year will depend on a range of things &#x2013; it will not only be the &#x2013; what we call a semi-soft or the current real prices to determine the royalty. But also it will depend on exchange rate. So basically those two settle it, and it's probably a little premature, let's just say, to give you number until that comes clear. It Certainly my intention of the next Investor Relations update in April to give more guidance in terms of volume for next year. I mean that's the appropriate time to settle, when things are lot clearer as to demand, price and let's just say that would be over the next six to 12 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's true, but investors are probably buying or selling the shares based upon 2010 earnings and the expectation of 2010 earnings. And this is a really big swing factor. If we were to assume AUD1.65, which is not unrealistic, and if we were to assume 120 hard coking coal prices and if we were to assume that tonnages were at around 6.5 million tonnes, which are the three keys that give into the Stanwell royalty, would the royalty in 2010 be around of $350 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. There is no doubt in this case that the royalty would be north of $200 million ..</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In 2010?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it would be just over of 200 million in 2010, but under 300, is that right?</p>

          <p>David, this is Gene here. We have given you clear guidance on the right sort of formula. And that's been produced for anyone who wants to look at a set of assumptions, taking into account the semi-soft coal price not our hedged coal price. They could make a reasonable estimate just using 1% --</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well let's go to the next point I want to get at. Because I want to get over to this hedging, what's happened there, in particular with the closing out of your forward book. I think you've closed out US$400 million, which I think in your information pack is going to cost you $83 million in the second half ,and $85 million in the full year '010. And that's on the basis of trend market conditions. Now I would like to understand what actually happened there because my understanding was Wesfarmers's policy was, if you did only hedge against what was known for certain and that you would never make hedges against market conditions that could potentially change. So I would like to get an understanding as to what actually happened that's going to cost you 83 million in the second half and 85 million in the full year of '10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, I'll try my best answer to your question, but clearly in October, November at the time, we'd known that this global economic crisis would have a major impact on our second half of this year and entering to the next financial year. And as you know back then, in October or prior October, exchange rates were might be tough numbers, and then we saw that exchange rate fall to less than US$0.65. We also came to the realization that the expectation for coal prices going forward was going dramatically fall. And demand was clearly unknown in terms of what impact global will come across, we'll have on still might be going to grow their demand for taking so. So we had hedge positions and pricing, and reported that to the market on previous updates. And what we took a proactive step back in October and November and into December to close that difference between those losses and that was what we did through our different strategies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But Stewart, then how you could close on that loss given that you only ever locked in what was known tonnages that were going to be sold at known prices to close out these losses to the extent of that as amount, you must have been taking speculative positions. And I note &#x2013; Note 12 in your financial statements the change in cash flow hedge reserve represents the after-tax net movement in market value of effective cash flow hedges in '08, and comprised 391 million of interest rate swaps, and 341 million of foreign exchange rate contracts. This company looks to have lost close to $750 million on hedging, which is borderlining on whether you've been taking speculative positions or whether it's just mismanagement of currency positions. That's the way I am reading it at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, as you would know, and we've announced it previously, our hedging position is supposed to be one that's an average of 50% hedging for US dollar revenues over a five-year period. In order for those to lock in hedging for years two and three and four and five, you've seen our position on volume and exchange rates. So that's essentially the situation we were both really &#x2013; the exchange rate has dropped dramatically in October and November. There was the global economic crisis that hit us severely and volumes were certainly under pressure and we have taken I think a proactive approach there to bring additional -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take it offline, Stewart, because I just don't understand how hedge losses can be this large and to this extent because from what Wesfarmers policy used to be of only hedging what was known contracts at locked-in, known prices, and I just can't see how you could make such a big loss or such a big nil of the hedging position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, that's not what our policy was, subject to two issues you raised. I mean, one, in terms of interest rates hedging, we hedged interest rate exposure; as we've indicated previously, we hedged about 50% of our debt profile and as we were required to by our bank and that total amount of $700 million you referred to and that will be the mark-to-market of that and that hasn't been realized. What will be put through the P&amp;L is what is realized as interest rates fell, because that's the interest rate. Hedging on coal price hedge, what we've said is, we will typically have hedged 50% of our coal sales out five years. And when you do that, the only known contracts for volumes and prices are firm for 12 months, and then you have to make pricing assumptions for the following five years. We've always done that at on a conservative basis. And that's how we done it, but in these circumstances, because of the rapidly depreciating Australian dollar, we closed out the hedging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was there any cost in the first half, Richard, or is all coming forward in the second half and 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To give you exact amount &#x2013; by the way all your forecasts will have the hedge positions there both currency and interest rates. Because we've been very clear about the market what we've hedged in the past on what our position is. So I don't think it should change anyone's forecast, Stewart what was the first half of that -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that will be in the second half and again, as I said, that will &#x2013; what impact there is over the longer-term will be dependent absolutely on what our net level of debt is and what you construct there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I just had question regarding in Coles, I understand that the house brand review in now complete. I just wondered what the outcome was there, are you targeting a certain percent of sales from your house brand products? Are you rationalizing the range in terms of farm land reliance et cetera or what's actually happened?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see, house brand is a very much integral part of our rates actually going forward. It gives us an opportunity for a broader return to the retailer, but also &#x2013; we actually furnish much better value for the team so it's got to be satisfied with the products that you are selling, deliver good value in terms of quality. So we instigated a review is all the 2000 different products that we have under house brand and each one of those is going through a vast independent testing, that would be determined in how we see them.</p>
          <p>I think that the results are actually very positive, we are very pleased with it. So the quality levels are actually very &#x2013; compare very favorably throughout the brand or benefit that we have in our sales as well. We've also invested in developing a test that's in-house as well. So we're looking at developing actually sales of new products, reducing total costs, and so from that growth as well and the additional adequate. So we look at the primary product not just to test there well, but also we're looking to help our operations to grow where appropriate. So we are quite optimistic about the future of house brand in Coles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So have you actually set any targets as to where you want to be in a couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we know where we'd like to be in terms of overall potential. Certainly, the share percentages of house brands is fairly -significantly below that of retailers in the UK. But the real sort of drive on house brand product growth has really come over the last three or four years. And there is a danger you can try and take too much consumers too soon without taking them with you. That's what we constantly don't want to do. We want to make sure that consumer recognize the value themselves, so we'll be progressively looking to improve our penetration over time, but not get tangled up in it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a question for John Gillam, please, in Bunnings. Of the 60% of products that's not produced in Australia and New Zealand, what's your sort of currency hedging there? I'm trying to get at when you might need to start raising your prices, to collar for the FX move?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think the hedging is at all relevant. We work very hard to drive a very strong value position for our customers. And we mightn't be needing to raise the prices on key lines; there's a lot of pressure on our buying. Volumes of course, and we've been working in stores trying to keep costs down. So we are able to negotiate stronger brands. There are some cost increases. But from our perspective, what we focus on is figuring out how to deliver a lower price relative to competitors. And we're seeing competitors who are running significant cost inflation that enable us to strengthen our position to drive more volume. So that's interesting period of the game, so it's not quite simple as income and price increase not goes that broad. We've positioned &#x2013; very strongly influenced around. But by far we've got cost base, I think, you're might going to see us in a position to driving value. These have very strong lever to win share in 2009.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you. Sorry. Just a one quick question and just given the equity raising is pretty much complete, just wondering if you're going through actively big asset sales going forward, or is it a pretty fair assumption that those plans might be put on hold for a while?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
