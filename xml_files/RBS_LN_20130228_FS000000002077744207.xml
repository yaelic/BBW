      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good day, everyone. Welcome to our call. As you are aware, our investor presentation of earlier today is available on our website. So we'll keep these opening comments brief.</p>
          <p>I'm joined today by John Cummins, our Group Treasurer. Let me start off with the key highlights of our announcement today. Number one is the excellent progress we've made delivering our safety and soundness agenda. For example, we achieved our loan to deposit ratio target of 100% a year early. We've maintained a robust core Tier 1 ratio and Non-Core, again, beat its reduction target.</p>
          <p>The next key highlight is the resiliency of our core businesses. Despite the subdued economic environment, the core businesses produced a return on equity of 10% while operating profit was up by 5%.</p>
          <p>And lastly, in Q4, we took $1.5 billion in reserves for conduct matters, bringing the year's charge to $2.2 billion. We are diligently working through a range of conduct issues and are striving to put them behind us.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to look at the numbers in a little bit of detail. The Group's full-year operating profit nearly doubled over the year to $3.5 billion. And as noted, the core operating profit was up 5% year-on-year to $6.3 billion as we tightly managed costs and impairments declined.</p>
          <p>Our core divisional performance was led by a rebound in Markets and improved performance from Citizens. The U.K. businesses continue to generate good returns.</p>
          <p>Non-Core's operating loss was $1.3 billion lower than 2011 at $2.9 billion, reflecting a fall in impairments and lower costs. At the pre-tax line, we reported a loss of $5.3 billion, largely due to the owned credit adjustment charge and a goodwill write down.</p>
          <p>We reduced the Group balance sheet by 11% or over $100 billion to $870 billion. The asset reduction was driven by Non-Core, Markets and international banking. Core Tier 1 ended the year at a robust 10.3%, up 60 basis points this year despite the loss on the regulatory RWA uplifts of around $40 billion.</p>
          <p>Performance in several divisions is worth noting. The first is Markets. We've made good progress on restructuring the business, expenses are down 15% from 2010 with 4,500 fewer heads in the business and RWAs have been reduced by almost $20 billion to $101 billion, including the significant regulatory uplifts. Despite this significant restructuring, the business performed well with a return of 10%, 13% when incorporating revenue uplifts to other divisions. We believe we can go farther in shrinking the business, while protecting franchise value and customer impacts. More details of that will follow in our half-year results.</p>
          <p>Citizens continues to make steady year-over-year improvement in profitability. Profit was up by over $200 million and ROE came close to 9%. Citizens' value is improving, given this performance trend, which we believe we can highlight and tap into through an IPO within a couple of years time.</p>
          <p>Also noteworthy, is that Ulster's loss remains stable on the year and on the quarter. We are cautiously optimistic that results will be better in 2013 given signs of economic progress, as well as asset price stabilization in Ireland.</p>
          <p>Non-Core had another excellent year. Third party assets were down $37 billion, or 40%, to $57 billion at the end of the year easily exceeding our target. As we enter the final year of active rundown of Non-Core, we remain confident in achieving our end of year target of $40 billion.</p>
          <p>2012 also saw us tick off of several important milestones. Our successes include the exit from the APS, exit of government credit support programs, resumption of private share dividends and the successful initial public offering of direct line group. The loan outstanding milestone is the branch disposal.</p>
          <p>We were disappointed that Santander pulled out of the transaction, but we remain fully engaged in completing the separation of the business. We're building out standalone capability for the business with an IPO as our new baseline, though we are considering some other alternatives.</p>
          <p>So to sum up, we feel good about what we've accomplished over 2012 and the first four years of the recovery plan. 2013 will be another year focused on risk reduction and paving the road for a brighter future. 2014 should see the emergence of a clean bank, which will be improved across multiple dimensions. We are getting there; it's not too far off.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn it over to John for some more details on our balance sheet progress. John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bruce. We've made great progress on our safety and soundness agenda, having moved from that line to a robust position. We've now met our group loan deposit ratio target of 100%, one year early. Customer deposits now represent 74% of our funding versus 66% last year and 51% at the worst point.</p>
          <p>Our key funding and liquidity metrics have all improved. Our short-term wholesale funding requirement declined to just 42 billion pounds compared to around 300 billion pounds at the worst point. The liquidity pool remains robust, increasing the last quarter to 350% of the short-term wholesale funding and just about covering our total wholesale funding.</p>
          <p>Our LCR ratio liquidity coverage ratio is already compliant with the recent basal framework, more than six years ahead of schedule. We're also compliant with the net stable funding ratio, well ahead of that schedule as well. One of our challenges continues to be the build up of liquidity. We'd like nothing better than to see an up tick in loan growth.</p>
          <p>With respect to our capital position we believe we are on a trajectory to achieve and sustain a robust capital framework. We have set our medium-term core Tier 1 ratio target at 10% to 10.5%. This exceeds both the GSIFI and the ICB/RFB requirements. With respect to our total capital ratio, we target a buffer on top of the core Tier 1 of greater than 5%, made up of Tier 1 and Tier 2 debt. At the end of this year that buffer was 4.2%.</p>
          <p>To achieve our aim we require further issuance in 2013 and 2014, a note that will be 4.2 billion pounds maturity compensation over the same period. Our preference remains a straight lower Tier 2 instruments that we are conversely considering the merits of the CoCo feature. The current government continued capital afirity <mark type="ph" /> with a 5% core Tier 1 trigger, is providing less value to the group overall. This also terminates the end of 2014, unless we can negotiate something earlier.</p>
          <p>So all in all, great progress on the balance sheet front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, John. Let me turn it back to the operator for the Q&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bruce. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from Lee Street from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, and good afternoon. And thank you very much for doing this call. I have three questions, if I may.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So firstly, this morning the government's $8 billion continuing capital line was described as being worthless to RBS, and I understand why you're doing that. I was just wondering if you could confirm whether it's still taking account within the FSA's <mark type="indiscernible" /> capital assessment and that stress test? And if so, whether you'd need to replace any or all of that with some form in the CoCo instrument when that line matures or if you terminate it early? That would be my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Why don't I just respond right away on this...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Please, do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you can go on. The answer to that is no. I think this facility has only had value in extreme stress scenarios where you would get below a core Tier 1 trigger. And as we've cleaned up our risk profile and moved up our core Tier 1 ratio, you'd have to &#x2013; it's almost nearly impossible to create a scenario where you go down below the 5%. So that's why, we said today, it has very little value to us.</p>
          <p>Of course, we have to go through a process to exit these arrangements. We did so when we wanted to exit APS and, again, the FSA holds all of the cards; the government as well since they're &#x2013; we're on the hook to pay them money. And so we'll see. We'll go through our typical stress review in March. Last year, we used that to crack open the exit for the APS in October. I don't know if we &#x2013; we will certainly petition to see if we can get out of the facility for 2014. And we'll see &#x2013; it may just be a revenue raiser for the government and there may be no way out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll have have to see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just on &#x2013; but I presume the guys of APS still use it within their accounting and it's very unlikely it'll ever be breached. Is that safe to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just say, they know it's there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure it actually comes into play, but they do &#x2013; are aware that it's still there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. Secondly, now I note in your slides you got a target of 5% plus for Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital within your pack there. And I was just wondering, do you believe that your existing Tier 1 securities that you've currently got standing, that if you don't cull those and pass their first core date, do you think they can continue to count towards that 5% buffer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have to see, basically, how the framework plays out here. So we'll, I think, adapt as we see what the framework &#x2013; how it evolves. Our view, at this point, is we anticipate $4 billion of maturities and amortizations coming from the LT2 stack, over the next three years. And so our issuance levels against that are probably $5 billion of issuance over three years in the LT2 space.</p>
          <p>One of the things that I did mention is that we'll see how the Coco market develops. I mean our preference, I think, is for straight LT2, but it may be that Barclays has cracked open a market and there's demand and we can do things at a reasonable price and I think we'd be open to that. We'll just have to see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And one final one, if I may. I think this morning it was suggested that you may need to go back to the EC in terms of the RBS branch disposal because that may just take a bit longer than it was obviously mandated. Are you able to give any commentary on the potential of additional sanctions from the EC in terms of when you get back to bear on coupons, cores or whatever else it possibly...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, look. I'd be very surprised if there was any real pushback on this. I mean, the EC understands that we have worked very aggressively on meeting all of our commitments. We sold WorldPay, we sold the Sempra commodities venture very quickly. We're in compliance on DLG. We've got a public float and a path to exit that.</p>
          <p>Any other commitments had, we've always &#x2013; we've also lived up to. The balance sheet shrink that we've done and especially on the investment banking side, is certainly responsive to some of the things that we had earmarked in the agreement with them.</p>
          <p>So I think the fact that, look, we had a deal with Santander, they pulled out. It really was not our fault. We're now moving on to plan B and we're moving as expeditiously as we can. I find it hard to think that we'd get hit with any penalty, particularly in light of that broader context I just painted for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very clear. Thank you very much for your answers to those questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Corinne Cunningham from Autonomous. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bruce. Just a quick question on the redemptions that you see. When I look through your capital structure I doesn't look as if there are any, let's say, hard &#x2013; enough hard maturity dates to give me that $4 billion of maturities. Does that mean you're contemplating redeeming some of the extended bonds in that $4 billion calculation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think that $4 billion, there's redemption dates and then there's also natural amortization, that it's worth less than the regulatory calculation. You can call back in to our debt IR team and they can give you the details behind that. But it's pretty straightforward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allen Bow <mark type="ph" /> from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks very much for the call. I was just wondering if you could give us a bit more color with regards to how you see the different treatment between retail institutional Tier 1's, step, non-step. Whether you would treat them the same or whether you'd have any differentiation with regards to the grandfathering and CRD4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well see, we're still waiting to hear form CRD4, but we wouldn't be treating &#x2013; we try to treat all investors the same. There may be different investor classes. We've seen that with some of the CoCo issuance, for example, but it's very important that we treat investors the same and they get the same transparency, the same clarity as and when we can give it. We don't discriminate against the different investors, be it private or be it retail institutional.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that true when you come to assessing the cull as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We look at everything on a case-by-case basis, whether it's a private MTN or whether it's an institutional deal in various jurisdictions. We have to look at this in the round. We can't have any special views on certain type investors verses others. That wouldn't be appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one unrelated question in regards to the calculation of your fully loaded capital ratios. You showed that you haven't taken account for deductions or financial holdings of less than 10%, because you're still pending the finalization of CRD4. What's your expectation with regards to if you were to include that, the impact you would have &#x2013; the financial impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's that significant. I think we're just covering ourselves with lots of footnotes to make sure that people know precisely how we calculated. We did bench the methodologies that we're seeing other people use to make sure that we're in line with how &#x2013; what assumptions and how other people are doing it.</p>
          <p>There's some difficulty in pushing this number out there because it's really not an audited number and it's not &#x2013; I think different banks are potentially open to making different assumptions as this point. Whereas the hard CT1 that we put out today is an audited number and it's got a framework, et cetera. But I think the best we can tell, this is in line with how others are calculating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I guess &#x2013; so the last question would be related to capital again. With your risk weighted assets uplift, in the annual reports you mentioned that there are uplifts still to come from property in 2013 of around $10 billion to $15 billion. Is that already included in that presentation number that you have which I think you have CBA, up for securitization and other. So I was just wondering where it &#x2013; if it fits in there or whether it's not included.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The FSA is in the kind of away from this calculation. So we have debt &#x2013; that would be in the underlying RWAs and &#x2013; as it was this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So are you saying that, that's already in the 460 because just for the annual reports so that's still to come in 2013 because you said often, you've already...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's going. It's getting built into the 433. So the tail &#x2013; so we took $44 billion of uplift in the RWAs this year and we have whatever ten to 13 I think it is coming next year. That is built into the 433 number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Smalley from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question and doing the call. Couple of quick questions. As you repopulate the capital stack and repopulate subordinated debt, can you give us an idea of issuer and debt geography? By that I mean as you replace subordinated debt, will you be looking to do some at the holding company? Some at the bank level? And maybe reserving some for a ring-fenced investment bank? How's your planning on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the ring-fencing, that's probably too early to say, but obviously there is a view that CoCo is probably more attractive to investors. We would on a case-by-case basis. And to be frank in terms of geography, look where the cheapest place to issue is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I mean there'll be trade-offs in that. I think there are certain things that argue to CoCo give you the most flexibility, but again we have I think a demand for issuance at the main operating bank as well. So as John said, we'll be flexible on that, but I think you'll see us do some of both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you have any idea on proportions as you're in the planning process now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's too early to say at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Moving on, you mentioned contingent capital notes as well, could you talk a little bit about how you see that market? I know that you mentioned that Barclays did a path-breaking deal for U.K. Bank <mark type="ph" />. Do you see that more as a second issuance, second type of structure for you? Or is this something that you'd be more likely to exchange outstanding Tier 1s into contingent capital notes? And if you could outline some of the opportunities and obstacles in doing something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Well again obviously the depth of the market and the costs are things to consider relative to straight LT2 issuance that we have planned. And so I think we're watching the market develop. I think there are some advantages to putting that CoCo feature in there. It certainly makes the regulators happy, and cuts off some of the tail risk and provides a bounce off of the triggers. So I think what Barclays has said is that they will have kind of a planned, a 2% bounce off of their 7% trigger, if they hit 7%, which is a pretty sizable element of CoCo's. I think it's probably about $8 billion.</p>
          <p>So I think other banks have to look at that and say, is that a valuable instrument in kind of a recovery plan. Would you actually ever let it go to 7% or would you be selling the family silverware before you got to 7%, so you'd never hit the trigger. And so you have to kind of work through that and decide are there other avenues that you have potentially to improve your capital position short of having to pay the extra costs for this contingent capital arrangement.</p>
          <p>So I think it just was interesting that where things are pricing now relative to where they were a year ago. I think you would have had a hard time conceiving that you'd want to issue one of these things. But the pricing has come in, investors are hungry for yield and so it just seems more interesting than it was before. But I think there's still some of those practical issues to think through.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Agreed. Last question. You mentioned $44 billion of uplift this year, another ten to 13 next year. We read almost daily about concerns in calculating risk weighted assets, differences between different countries, different banking systems. When you look at these amounts, are these fairly set in stone and you've talked to the FSA about this, or is this a little more perspective on your part. And what are you hearing about any significant changes in changing risk weightings in the U.K.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I would say to &#x2013; particularly for you fixed income investors out there, is that if you're investing in U.K. banks, you can rest assured that there are no give mes at all on any model that we run. So the level of conservatism that's built into PD <mark type="ph" /> assumptions, LGD assumptions, any kind of VAR modeling, any modeling that we do, is prudent and continues to be tightened.</p>
          <p>Things like having a stop GAAP slotting approach to commercial real estate, the U.K. is intensifying the RWA calculations in the face of a fairly weak economy, which you could say maybe some of that's related. But if you compare that, I think, to some other jurisdictions around the planet, maybe some of our continental peers, I'm not sure that's the case. And you seem to see opportunities. People say, well, I just fixed my model and I just knocked off 30 billion of RWAs.</p>
          <p>Well, I'll just tell you that that doesn't happen in the U.K. It tends to be traffic going in the other direction. So we'll see. I think the EBA is taking on a project to try to look at different geographies in Europe and kind of understand why there's differences.</p>
          <p>In many cases it could just be, for example, a simple product like a retail mortgage or it could be different bankruptcy requirements, different &#x2013; historical the fall patterns that there could be legitimate reasons why RWAs are different from one country to the next. But I think shinning a spotlight on that, doing some clear study around that will be helpful, because investors are suspicious. I think that's fanned by some of the rantings of central bankers and other market participants. But again, I'll just come back to the U.K. I think you can rest assured that these are conservative risk weights that we're using here.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Something along the lines of a shared national credit exam looking at capital allocations for European banks might make sense. But the reason why I think the market might be into this is because, as you know, that's &#x2013; the RWA calculation is essential in looking at the triggers for the CoCo's.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hello there, everybody. Thanks again for the call. Just a quick one, something that Rob touched on in the last questions and something we've spoken about over the last 12 months or so. And it tends to liability management and clearly you cannot give me a straight answer, and I do appreciate that, but obviously I want to know just &#x2013; if I can sort of &#x2013; reading the tea leafs, how much is in your thoughts for your capital planning going forward, especially for increasing the redundant capital instruments under CRD4? I know we can say we don't know what CRD4 is, but I think we pretty much do.</p>
          <p>And so I just wanted to know how much liability management is figuring in your plans post April 1 when you're obviously eligible to do it. And maybe even then sort of again, touching on what Rob said, how that feeds into the scope and scale and the timing and new issue of capital qualifying securities, whether you think it's worth vis-&#xE0;-vis liability management, getting that sort of first mover advantage. So as I said, I appreciate you can't give me the direct answer, but I wanted to just get your thoughts on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're fishing around here a little bit and you're right to that I'm not going to give you a direct answer. But again we have historically used liability management tactics and programs appropriately I think when we needed to raise capital and our debt was trading at fairly distressed levels. That was &#x2013; the motive behind that was really to build the core Tier 1 capital. I think now we have a very strong core Tier 1 capital base and looking at doing any further liability management would be more around how to optimize the capital base.</p>
          <p>So I don't think there's as pressing a need to do it at this point. It would have to be fairly specific and some of it would clarify I think when the final Basel rules come down the pipe. But again we've picked over quite a bit of the population through three LMEs in the last four years, and so I just don't see it as being something that's, that major in terms of our strategies going forward. But that could change depending on how the Basel rules come out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up on that. Is there any difference that you're aware in terms of how say dollar true-ups are getting treated on a sort of holistic-group basis relative to the columns named under Dodd-Frank relative to Basel III? Or are you &#x2013; do you &#x2013; does Basel III take primacy in that calculation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't see much difference there. So we are, as I said, going back to focuses, we try and treat all investors the same, so we would &#x2013; we're very focused on treating them appropriately and an LME is just one of the tools to look at in this universe.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Can we have an update on RBS N.V. please? Where we are in terms of its restructuring and with how bonds are moving across? And in particular, what factors you will be considering for the callable Aussie dollars that are callable in May? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just on the restructuring of the N.V., I think we've made very significant progress there, so we've migrated probably 80% of the balance sheet across to RBS Plc. We have a few countries that are still outstanding, largely because of the slowness of the regulatory process in bringing those across.</p>
          <p>We do have some of our liquidity, the old ABN Amro liquidity portfolio is sitting there and it's hard to move that because we have negative marks on some of it that are &#x2013; and it's inavailable for sale. And so we probably are going to leave that there and just let it kind of run off with time. So the size of this bank will be much reduced.</p>
          <p>The headquarters component is basically being shrunk dramatically and there won't be a huge amount left besides the liquidity portfolio by the end of this year. We will look at the continued movement of how to fund what's left and what we should fork over into the Plc or what we should call and potentially replace with new funding out of the Plc or out of RBS hold co. as we go through the year. I wouldn't give you any commentary at this point. There's no decisions been made about any specific instruments like that ones you're asking on. We'll just see how it plays out over the course of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We have a further question from the line of Lee Street of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Just a quick follow-up. Your Non-Core division is now $57 billion. I was just wondering, with the obviously new target for reductions in market RWAs and the few other bits, should we be thinking actually perhaps there'll be almost like another Non-Core division or some additions back into that Non-Core in terms of how we think about that Non-Core moving down, going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually it would be the opposite of that. So markets have been able to shrink their balance sheet without taking significant restructuring charges. And so I mean obviously the first one we had, this thing was a pig in terms of the balance sheet. It had 900 billion sterling of balance sheet, if you go back to 2008. And when we first set out the recovery journey we have that to run with 450 and some of that was liquid stuff that was gotten rid of. Others was moved into Non-Core and was worked down in Non-Core. That was kind of round one.</p>
          <p>Round two we announced in January of last year. We've probably taken the balance sheet down another $25 billion or $30 billion this year. And again, there was no transfer into Non-Core. It was really BAU <mark type="ph" /> and it's embedded in those results. What we haven't done at this point is clearly identify the path from this 105-ish level of RWAs down to 80. Which businesses, how does the balance sheet move, what are the people costs associated with the downsizing in the expense base, those details we'll provide to you in the half-year results at the first week of August.</p>
          <p>But I would expect, again, we would try, obviously, to minimize any kind of one-time cost because clearly if you're going to get $25 billion of RWA relief, that's equivalent to $2.5 billion of capital, you don't want to use that up on restructuring costs and so we'll be fairly judicious about how we do it. And I do think that markets can manage that program. We don't need non-core to manage that program from here.</p>
          <p>Over in on core we're at $57 billion, we expect to end the year at $40 billion. About half of that $40 billion rolls off naturally over three years. The other $20 billion is mainly either well provided distressed commercial real estate that's managed by our workout group, or it's from longer duration low-yielding assets that we just don't want to sell and take a loss on.</p>
          <p>I think we can start to shrink non-core, take those good $20 billion of assets, return those back to some of the donor divisions. We're still working through the particulars around that and just leave a fairly modest rump.</p>
          <p>So our goal is to try to ultimately disassemble non-core reasonably quickly. We're certainly going report it this year because the last year recovery plan. My guess is we'd also report it in 2014 because it will still be somewhat material, but after that I'd like to be done with it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep, sorry, just one last question and I've put my fishing rod away this time. Just wanted to know, last year, this time last year there was some fairly large interbank exposures between RBS and Ulster in terms of direct lending to Ulster or direct funding of Ulster from the group level. Could you extrapolate where those figures are now? I was having a dig though...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's quite modest at this point. So the combination of us infusing capital as we have need to cover off impairments and they've been able to grow deposits a little bit and we're not making any new loans and we've had some loan payoffs and again, the write downs. We haven't needed, we've been able to effectively pay down the IGL. I think, John, it's maybe $1.5 billion? It's quite modest.</p>
          <p>So our principle exposure left in Ireland is really just our equity investment at this point.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Okay. Well everyone, thanks for dialing in today and for your interest in RBS. I think again, as you can see from today's announcements we're making steady progress. The safety and soundness agenda continues to be first and foremost in our minds. But underneath that we have an attractive core bank that's making good returns and actually had a little positive momentum last year. We have a clear path through this year and into next year when we would hope to be a clean and normal bank and have a brighter future.</p>
          <p>So thanks for your patience and staying with us and I think over time it'll continue to be well rewarded. Thank you.</p>
