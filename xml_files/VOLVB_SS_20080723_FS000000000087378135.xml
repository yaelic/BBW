          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Volvo's Conference Call for the quarter of the First Six Months 2008. It will start with a presentation, and thereafter, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. The conference will be chaired by Mr. Leif Johansson, CEO of Volvo.</p>
          <p>Mr. Johansson, please begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon to all of you over the phone. We are happy that you're participating with us in this second quarter 2008 conference call. We will be speaking, as we walk through the Group's second quarter, with the different business area leaders and also our Chief Financial Officer, as we usually do.</p>
          <p>We will be speaking to slides that you can have available to you on volvo.com. And then, obviously, we will have a Q&amp;A session towards the end of the hour. We expect the telephone conference call -- we have to be ready by 3:30 European Time for a connection in traveling schedules here.</p>
          <p>Let me start with slide two on the second quarter in the handout from the net. Second quarter was the strongest quarter so far we've had. We had a sales growth of 13%, operating income up 17%, and earnings per share up 28%. And that came on the back of improved earnings in truck operations and Volvo CE and good growth across our different geographies, with a special note, perhaps, that we were able to offset the low US market and still be getting growth here.</p>
          <p>Business environments are much discussed today here in Europe, high deliveries but slower order intake. We'll speak more about that respectively, as we go through the different business areas. North America, increased order intake -- you could actually also say increased deliveries there. And then we have a very strong rest of the world, with South America, Asia and international markets.</p>
          <p>If you come to the slide three in the handout, this is net sales. We are now traveling at sales of above 310 billion for the last 12 months. The sales growth of 13% went into West Europe, they are at 7; Eastern Europe, at 25; Asia, at 42; and South America, at 35. So, a good geographic spread there, skewed more towards Asia and South America then and slightly lower -- or slightly less growth rates in Western Europe compared to earlier quarters.</p>
          <p>We also would like to note here that we have a strong organic growth, if you take out the effects of the currency and also which is the small effect on the composition of the Group, from acquisition point of view, the Group actually grew in real terms, if you want to call it that, of course, by 17%; and Volvo CE, for example there, at 27%.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide four, which says operating income, you'd see a margin there of 8.9%, up from 8.6 same quarter last year, and a touch below SEK7.2 billion. Margin improvement there is based on productivity and good products, but also on our ability on the basis of those competitive products, be able to get the price realization, compensating, and then some for cost increase that we have raw material or what they might be. We see a good contribution to the improvement in the operating income from top truck operations in Europe in Volvo CE. We are still dealing with the effects of the strike but also the running problems and I should say also including adjusting to the lower market in the US. We have Volvo Aero with specific issues in this quarter that contributed negatively to the results. And then we had also between the two quarters, a net R&amp;D amortization effect of 264 million negative in Q2 compared to Q2 '07 and likewise, if you do the overall currency impact we actually had a negative currency impact of 500 million in the quarter-on-quarter comparison.</p>
          <p>That takes us to slide five and the Volvo Group financial summary headline on that slide, and we have Mikael Bratt here, our CFO to speak to the next two slides.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. Then a few comments to the financial summary that you can see on page five. Yes, again a very strong quarter both for sales and profitability. We report an operating income which is up 17% compared to last year. And if you then adjust for last year's one time effects, which was the sale of Petro Stop in the US and energy here in Sweden of SEK516 million in total, we are actually up 28%, resulting then in 8.9% operating margin in the quarter for the Group. And the main contributor factors are to be found in the gross income side of the finance segment.</p>
          <p>If you're looking at R&amp;D, expenses are up SEK656 million, higher than last year, whereas SEK264 million of the increase is related to the net effect of capitalization and amortization of R&amp;D is being done from a positive 31 million in Q2 '07 to a negative 233 in this quarter.</p>
          <p>On the finance side, we see a small increase compared to last year, but on a running rate, we are reflecting out and S&amp;A is a clear focus area for us, and several initiatives are going on right now to reduce the S&amp;A spend going forward and we see positive signs in that direction. If you look at the S&amp;A in relation to sales, we're coming down from the higher levels in the end of last year.</p>
          <p>Looking at interest net; it's negative of SEK102 million, and you see some increased net interest expense compared to last year and it's mainly driven by the higher debt levels that we see in this quarter.</p>
          <p>On the other financial income and expense line we've a positive effect of SEK462 million from market evaluation of derivatives used for the customer financing portfolio in the books of Volvo Treasury and I just want to point out, and we talked about that in the past quarters as well, but just to be clear here this is not -- this evaluation is not reflecting any risk exposure in our books. It's a pure accounting effect since we have not opted for hedge accounting in this case.</p>
          <p>On the tax line you see here, tax -- greater tax rate of 31.2%, somewhat higher than the 30% that we have communicated, that you should be expecting. And it's primarily a dividend payment &#x2013; a taxable dividend payment in the US from on of the Mack subsidiaries that makes this effect.</p>
          <p>If we then move on to the next slide, page six, and focus a little bit on the operating cash flow. You can see here that we are reporting a positive cash flow of SEK4.9 billion in the quarter. And it's mainly due to the good operating income we have presented. The cash conversion cycle here of 31 days has decreased, with about six days sales growth here. However, there is a slight up-tic during the first six months, as you can see from the graph.</p>
          <p>There are a lot of activities put in to secure for the capital realization, and in order to reach our 25 days objective, which are in sight. Of the dividend payment of 11.1 billion in Q2 that went out, and with the contribution from the operating cash flow for the quarter, the net effect is that we now have a net debt position of SEK31.1 billion, and it's equal to a net debt to equity ratio of 18.4. And as I have mentioned before, you should expect us to be around 10 to 38% over time.</p>
          <p>In July we also entered into &#x2013; and it was after the quarter here, but just a week ago &#x2013; enter into a SEK 6.2 billion cross-border syndicated loan agreement in Japan. A so called Ninja Loan. It's actually a largest senior loan, so far, to a new international borrower in Japan in terms of both volume and number of banks that participated</p>
          <p>Japan is an important market for us and it's also a way for us to continue to diversify our funding sources. In April, we saw the CDS spreads continue to come down from the peak in the beginning of the year, but since May it has started to come back up again, and today it's around 100 basis points. However, our funding &#x2013; refunding cost is significantly lower than that, and we continue to be very active in the market in order to manage the volatility received right now.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, we have primarily focused on bilateral loans and agency funding, raising about 6 billion in the quarter here, through those transactions. And we see no difficulties to solve the needs from the operation as well as from our cost financing &#x2013; customer financing operation going-forward. So we will call that there. And by that will end my part of the presentation. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you, Mikael. Let's go to slide 7 and the one which has the headline which says Truck sales. We sold trucks in the quarter for almost SEK63 billion, so we had an income of 9.2% on that, up from 8.3 last year, translated into 4.8 billion. That came on good deliveries, but also increasingly high productivity, and also we should say competitive products, and with that the ability to get price realization across different geographies and markets. Its strong demand in, in Asia plus America and other international market as you will see later on. Our north American markets was actually also up, both in deliveries and in order intake, but off of low levels, and then we have a slowing demand in Europe and I'll speak a little more to that as we go through the different brands.</p>
          <p>In focus now, its obviously fertility improvement in cost efficiency and especially so perhaps in north America where we are operating at low levels and need to make sure that we can keep our key measurements in -- measuring points in relation to sales or for production there in a good way. We have integration projects with Nissan Diesel running well. And obviously, we have an issue with material cost inflation, most of which we are trying to offset through efficiency programs together with our suppliers.</p>
          <p>But somewhere in which our intention has been and so far so good, is to move that across to our customers; if you look at the next slide, there you see the heavy duty truck market in Europe, and as you remember, we had a booming quarter in quarter two 2007 with almost 47,000 orders while this quarter we instead have there around 22,000 orders. A normal Q2, if we go back to '06 and '05, would probably be somewhere around 20 -- 23 to 28,000 orders.</p>
          <p>And put in that perspective, Q2 in '08, it doesn't look that bad, put into perspective where we were in 2007, of course, it's a much lower order intake than what we had.</p>
          <p>It's easy to remind you, I think, that on the level of the order intake that we had in Q2 '07 there was no way we could produce at those numbers either. What's happening here is that we think that the -- there is a hesitation in the truck market in Europe, that is driven to some extent by expectations of, or least speculations of a downturn in Europe.</p>
          <p>We are not seeing that in transport volumes when it comes to long haulage. We don't see it in the real economic activity, which is still quite reasonable in Europe with perhaps the exception of the house building market in Europe. That way we have seen and we can see that also as it relates to construction type vehicles, more of a weaker market there than what we have on the long haulage around road situation.</p>
          <p>Our forecast remains the same for '08, and we still have quite reasonable order books, let's say, between around six months here. So it's early in date to say what would be a 2009 number. As we see it right now, you can say, the order intake for Q2 looks like a reasonable order intake, the whole question is going to be where will it be in the next couple of quarters here. But it's too early to point out whether that will happen in '09.</p>
          <p>We've also discussed through the day here in Europe more of adding total things; we are in the situation where we are switching volumes from the different brands into the new products, but also across geographies. We'll be speaking a little more to that as we look at the different brands.</p>
          <p>Turning to truck market, even though -- which is slide 9, even though the market there is beginning  to come up, we are actually seeing increased order intake there, across the brands. We still think that it's a very, it's a weak market at low levels. And I think it's too early to call a recovery there, even though the gradient is pointing in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 deals with Volvo trucks, more specifically in, you see, deliveries there, which of course at least in the case of North America is somewhat unrepresentative because we are catching up with the strike we had in Q1 there in deliveries, making sure our customers get the trucks that they had ordered for delivery in Q1. There we do see a lower order intake in Europe, very big regional differences, anecdotes from the Baltic's for example where we have had customers who claim that they have not been able to get already approved financing from banks, and therefore not been able to take truck, but that's more anecdotal. We have arrived at this conclusion here that the best way to describe Europe is to take the 22,000 and putting that into context over the next -- over that last couple of years. That's the best way that we can provide insight into what's happening in Europe.</p>
          <p>We also see regional differences in the case for example Spain and house building, which is coming down, but most of other things that we have spoken about today; it's difficult to get more guidance that what we have.</p>
          <p>With continued strong or even very strong demand from international markets we see an increased order intake in North America there. We have an active order book, management, you're aware that we are introducing a new era, a complete new product line for the autumn here. With the new FH, new FM and new FH11 truck. We are widening the product range there, that also is impacting the order book, the way we are dealing with that.</p>
          <p>We are looking at -- North America has to drive industrial productivity and we already have US 10 SCR, fuel efficient products running on the roads in the US. So that seems to be going well.</p>
          <p>A new products launched in Europe has, I think, some price increase and that is based on good fuel economy and good productivity, that seems to have settled and come across.</p>
          <p>With Renault trucks, there we have also slowdown at order intake, less compensated in the case of Renault trucks, by orders from overseas areas, simply because they don't have the same overseas footprint that Volvo trucks have. To some extent slightly more impacted also by, for example the construction market, house building markets in Southern parts of Europe.</p>
          <p>Good industrial productivity there, we have made a decision to start, adjusting down the production rates in, towards the autumn here in France. But we see that more as a fairly normal adjustment coming out of very high levels of production of Renault trucks. Good adjusted productivity as some of you saw when you visited with us in France, with the Volvo production system being executed very well in France there.</p>
          <p>And also indicate that Renault trucks, new renewal of products and extension. The new Renault Magnum, better cap and better driver facilities; the new Renault Kerax here in the construction range with a 30 liter engine, and also a new version of Renault Lander at 4x8 execution.</p>
          <p>Nissan Diesel, doing well in market share recovery. You're aware that in the beginning of last year, we had -- we were early on with very fuel efficient and green products. We had difficulties convincing customers that they should take them before a date than they absolutely had to. Now, they are taking them, so we are back at historic market shares there, which feels good.</p>
          <p>We have the market forecast for Japan there, which is same as we had last time, down 10 to 15% in 2008. We saw deliveries in the second quarter being up 41%. Much of that is driven by the market share side, but also from light trucks that we are delivering to Nissan Motors. And of course, lots of integration work, integration work on plan with Nissan Diesel and the Volvo Group.</p>
          <p>Mack trucks on slide 13. We saw deliveries actually increased by 23%. But of course, off of very low levels in the second quarter in 2007. Order intake up 34%, again, with low levels in second quarter of 2007 as a comparison, but still heading in the right direction there.</p>
          <p>UAW negotiations in front us in Q3 here. And obviously, we have a number of issues that we are discussing with unions here; flexibility, we are discussing different contract language, and, of course, also salary levels and French benefit levels coming into the next three-year period.</p>
          <p>What is very good to see at Mack Trucks is that after the initial running in problems of new seven engines we now have a very good engine rate with Mack Trucks, and good fuel economy across the whole range. And we also have good reports from the US 10 with SCR equipped trucks that we are running from our customers, when -- especially when it comes to fuel efficiency, something which is extraordinarily highlighted given the dollar or the oil price that we have around the world.</p>
          <p>With that, let me exit on the truck side, and have Tony Helsham who is with us on the telephone line from the US do Construction Equipment, slide 14. Tony?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sure, can you hear me Leif?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I can. Good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Okay. If we start quickly with the overall market conditions, we can say that the global market for Construction Equipment continues to be holding up reasonably well, but of course not quite as good as the same period last year in 2007.</p>
          <p>Mainly due to slowdown and continuing slowdown in North America, but also now we see the beginning of a slowdown here in Europe as well. This is obviously compensated to a degree by strong business in most other parts of the world.</p>
          <p>In the Heavy segment, during the second quarter, we see Europe down 3%, North America declined by 26%, while Asia and other markets were up approximately 30%.</p>
          <p>In Compact, Europe was down 23% and North America was down 17, the rest of the world up around 12 or 13%.</p>
          <p>If we look at our financial performance, you can see on the slide there that we've had continuing good growth. The net sales growth of 18%, and as Leif mentioned, if we measure just profitable growth, we had a rate of 27%.</p>
          <p>Operating income increased to SEK1.6 billion, 9.7%, and of course, we also included in that, we see an impact, a negative impact coming from some currency effects and the ongoing integration costs.</p>
          <p>In focus right now is of course to leverage the demand in Asia and the international markets, whilst at the same time doing everything we possibly can from an efficiency point of view, from a negotiation point of view with our suppliers. And also in terms of price management to offset the raw material price increases that we see coming at us on a continuous basis.</p>
          <p>I would also just like to mention, we have made an announcement, a decision to move production of certain backhoe loader models from our factory in Wroclaw in Poland. And we are moving those products, which are mainly sold in North America and we are moving the production to facility in Mexico, outside Mexico City, a facility which is currently producing Volvo buses. So for a very little investment, we will start up production of these certain backhoe loader models in the first quarter of 2009. And of course, that will shorten the lead times to those key markets, but also allow us to reduce the currency exposure and the risks associated with the currency swing.</p>
          <p>So with that Leif, I think we can feature on construction equipment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you. And we have Buses. We have slide 15 and we have H&#xE5;kan Karlsson, on another telephone line hopefully with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. And some highlights on the second quarter from Volvo Buses stand. We can see a continued good demand in the city bus segment in all our markets and that in combination with strong demands on environmental friendly vehicles. The first hybrid tender has come out in Europe during the first or the second quarter. So also Europe hybrid start will be interesting.</p>
          <p>The coach segment followed the business <mark type="inaudible" /> with Germany, North America and the softening market in Europe, so there we see downwards trend. In the second quarter we had a good order intake compared to last year from those three areas expect the Europe. The sales was slightly up. We got an important order to the Greyhound US with 50 Prevost coaches and that was the first time we sold to Greyhound, and Greyhound, they will renew their whole fleet the coming two or three years.</p>
          <p>The result was positive but weaker over last year. The underlying performance are improving, but we have a significant negative currency hit, also, in this quarter. We produced in strong currencies Brazil, Canada, Poland and Sweden and we sell most of our products in US dollars.</p>
          <p>We have also higher R&amp;D spendings form the profitability program that we consolidate our product platforms, and also the hybrid development.</p>
          <p>The profitability program follow our plans in Europe the strategy is to concentrate production to Poland continued with the closure of the Tampere plant in September and now also divestiture of the Turku plant.</p>
          <p>We also optimized our commercial organization during the second and the third quarter this year.</p>
          <p>In North America, we work hard in the construction organization in Mexico and Brazil to manage the new currency situation. Then, in Asia, we capitalized on our strong presence in India and China, with export of our Volvo products to other Asian and Middle East markets.  I think, all in all, there's still a headwind for us, but our programs continue <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good H&#xE5;kan, thank you. We have then Volvo Penta. We have slide 16 and G&#xF6;ran Gummeson to speak to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. The local demand for marine has continued to weaken during Q2, driven then by still down-going North American market and the softening European situation. For our industrial engines, on the contrary, we experienced a strong demand in all our main markets.</p>
          <p>During Q2, we have succeeded to further strengthen our market position in both Europe and North America on the marine side. And today, we are the market leader in North America, for instance, on diesel power for leisure boats among independent boat builders, thanks then to the IPS system. And I can say that our product range is very competitive, and thanks then to our IPS system, we are strengthening our position in the global in-boat market segment.</p>
          <p>In June, the volume in our order book was 20% higher than that of last year, and as I said earlier, mainly then driven by the global demand for our industrial engines. However, these engines had lower profit margins than typically the marine engines that we sell. We have and we are gaining market shares in the industrial segment and we will continue to capitalize on the global need and for mainly generator sets, and then trying to offset the negative trends that we see on the marine side.</p>
          <p>Internally we are reprioritizing our resources to secure the further growth of our IPS systems and also prepare for new a global order and deliberate situation system. Our sales increased 4% to SEK3.4 billion, as you see on the slide, and operating margin amounted to 13.7%, in line with last year, positively affected by good price realization, and negatively then by the North American market situation. That is in summary then Volvo Penta. Leif?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good G&#xF6;ran. Thanks to Volvo Penta there. Let's have Volvo Aero speak to slide 17 and Olof Persson, Head of Volvo Aero is here with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Leif. The industry backlog large commercial year has continued to increase with some order bookings of total around 1,000 units in the first half of 2008. For us, the order bookings remained strong in the component business and the order book was 12% higher, end of June, compared to last year. And if you adjust for currency, the order book was actually 29% higher than last year.</p>
          <p>In connection with Farnborough Air Show, Volvo Aero signed two major contracts with a combined estimated order value of SEK90 billion over a period of 40 year we will <mark type="inaudible" />, I would say this is a part of our capitalization of the investments we do in the Lightweight Technology, and I would say that it's a major success for this lightweight design. In the second quarter, Volvo Aero's net sales decreased by 7% mainly attributable to currency and lower volumes in the after market business. This was however partly upset by increased volumes of the ending components, and adjusted for currency and effect of the Bromma closure, sales was up with 9%.</p>
          <p>The operating income in Q2 was affected by negative currency effect, as well as an unfavorable product mix between components for new engine parts and new spare parts. However, as far as we can see today, we are looking at a return to more normal product mix during the second half of this year. The operating income was also negatively affected by investments in research for the two near ending programs that I mentioned before.</p>
          <p>In focus now will be to continue our further intensified efforts with product cost rationalization in order to offset the negative effects of the weaker US dollar. And we will also focus on the management of the production ramp up of new products, and then in particular, the G&amp;A &#x2013; GNX engine that we see in front of us. And finally, of course, an intensive phase of design and product development of newly contracted engine components base ahead for us at Aero.</p>

          <p>Overall, VFS fared well in the second quarter of 2008 with good operating income, continued growth and a high level of focus on risk management. A good volume as you can see in graph, 11.8 billion in the second quarter of 2008, mostly from our regions in Europe and international. We're seeing some slowing growth in North America.</p>
          <p>Operating income compared to the second quarter of 2007 is down, mainly due to tighter margins, increased credit provisions and currency impacts. We had a good after tax return on equity of 15.4%, compared to the second quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>You have to remember that we changed our equity ratio. We went from 10 to 8%, which gave a lift to the actual of 1.5% and we had some favorable tax adjustments of about 2%. A normalized return for the quarter is probably between 13 and 14%.</p>
          <p>We've reached a milestone in VFS. We've reached SEK 1 billion in assets under management. This is defined as assets VFS has originated services, and it includes syndicated assets as well as, in our Brazil operation, assets associated with the Cons&#xF3;rcio program.</p>
          <p>While seeing the continued turmoil in financial market, VFS has been very focused on a careful portfolio management, particularly in North America, where we've been in a downturn mode since about fourth quarter 2007. We established good asset and risk management routines. We have strong collection procedures and follow-up.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at Europe, our alignment with the Volvo sister business areas is beginning to pay dividends. We're going through a bit of a restructuring there. We are building stronger relationships and we are seeing some dividends and increase in penetration.</p>
          <p>In focus, we are continuing to look for ways to improve our growth and asset management capabilities. And we are looking to grow with Volvo Group as it grows mostly into Eastern Europe and into Asia.</p>
          <p>During the downturn we look to strengthen our market position by building on our customer industry knowledge, strong risk management principles and to provide financing while some of the lenders may no longer be active. We do this while also trying to increase margins.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to look for growth in our international markets. I'm happy to say that in the third quarter of 2008, we'll be opening up operations in Chile, and we're also conducting investigations in other markets in order to expand the VFS footprint.</p>
          <p>In summary; relatively good operating income and returns, continued growth, good asset and risk management, and a focus on capitalizing on opportunities in the downturn, as well as continued expansion into international markets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you, Sal. And that takes us to slide 19 and me summing up quickly here, before we go into Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>You saw us deliver then 2.53 earnings per share compared to 1.98, a 28% earnings per share improvement, quarter-on-quarter comparison. That came from competitive products and industrial productivity. We are looking at continuing to drive productivity and cost efficiency across the Group, both across product costs but also across S&amp;A, as Mikael was talking about earlier on.</p>
          <p>We are also in the midst of integrating acquisitions that we have made. Both on DC and on the truck side, we have major acquisitions. And so far, so good, the plan under which we are executing those acquisitions seem to be running well.</p>
          <p>We have a European demand situation, which is clearly down compared to same quarter last year. And we also have a downward trend, or at least declining growth rates, across the different business areas. So that probably means that Europe will be somewhat weaker across the next couple of quarters here in order intake.</p>
          <p>Difficult to call that, because we have still longer than normal order books than actually in order intake, which you could say, looks more normal than it did in 2007. So difficult to call how much of a downturn we have there off of high levels. And then we are quite happy with the whole of our investment, which here today of course, in the quarterly results, you see as costs when it comes to developing fuel efficient products, the new emission steps, which will be delivering Euro 5 and US 10, ultimately Euro 6 in good fuel efficient products, but also, and more immediately the introduction of hybrids on the truck and on the bus and also on the construction equipment side. Altogether then, a return on equity of 20.5%.</p>
          <p>And with that let's open up for any questions you may have.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon there. Just a follow up on a previous question I got on an earlier conference call. Could you maybe go into a bit in more detail on why your US profitability is down year-over-year despite the increase in sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we can say we have, we still have effects of the strike. We've had to call back production there and then the services are on that. We have adjusted again, that you have seen the downward -- the production output if I remember correctly we'll go about 1300 people in the New River Valley and that also effects of course, in Hagerstown. So altogether, adjustments to lower rate. And then I would say that I am not pleased yet with the productivity of all the new engines and all the new products we introduced in US '07. So that's coming gradually along.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Can I follow-up with that? Let's assume, I am not asking for a forecast, but let's assume that volumes improve in the second half of the year. How long will it take before you can ramp up production to a more normal level and get the kind of leverage you want them on those deliveries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that ramping up production in the US; if we have orders to support that wouldn't be any problem at all. I think the whole of the industry, including the supplier base is operating, as you know now, at historically very low levels. So, I don't think ramping up, or brining people back in to ramp up is a problem. Then on the efficiency side, our real target here is to make sure that we should be able to deliver even reasonable results, even while traveling at these low levels. But it takes a while to adjust for that, but probably more on the up side there, as you can see on the order intake, I don't see a problem in getting to those.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Ms. Julia Varesko. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. This is Julia Varesko from JP Morgan. I am sorry to come back to this point, but I think on orders, we going need to have more clarification considering the magnitude of decline.  I understand that comparison is a bit difficult, but still 54% decline in Q2 is quite a deterioration. So the first question I have relating to that is; could you give us some detail on how orders were developing so far this year from month-to-month? So did you see a deterioration from January to June, was the end of Q2 worse than the beginning of Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we said in Q1 that the beginning of the year was stronger than the end of Q1. But I think the best answer to your question is that Q2 has been consistent, and basically what you saw, that pace that we came out of Q1 with has been the same in Q2. So not any better, not any worse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and other question I have is: are there any countries in Europe still growing. For example, is Russia still strong in terms of order intake?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when it comes to cancellations. I understand that some of the cancellations you saw where solicited. But are you expecting more to come in terms of cancellations maybe unsolicited?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a very difficult question to really answer, and on top of that to do it across the board. We would prefer to have orders cancelled for producing the product rather than after, so you can say we are taking a fairly prudent approach to that. And at the same time we have been able to satisfy customers outside of Europe who have been looking for products for a long while both in international and Asian markets. So I can not give you a catch all number for all of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In that case maybe I could phrase it this way; have you gone through your whole order backlog to see where customers may want to cancel or have you still got customers to call on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we as far as we are aware of, we have no customers today who are sort of knocking on our books saying we would like to cancel. That's in the order intake.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. And finally, what is the implication of allocating orders from maybe Europe to other regions for mix, does it dilute your mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is -- it all depends on which countries that goes to. And it would take us into a very detailed growth there, but it would -- detailed scenario to give you the details of that. I can't really do that. But you can say our international markets, because of the lack of demand there, have had fairly high price increases. I don't think a big mix change there.</p>

        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. The deterioration that you saw in Europe, I'm just wondering because it's quite dramatic. You're saying it was flat in April, and now you're saying it's down 5 to 10. I understand the compacts is the big reason for this. But I just want to get some more color on what's happening with the general purpose equipment area and whether that is accelerating down as well in June?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Patrick, when it comes to the general purpose equipment, we're seeing the slow -- being driven mainly by the slowdown in the housing sector, starting off in Italy and in Spain, of course, and gradually moving northwards. We see it slowing in Ireland, moving into the UK, and now also, let's say, a piquing here in France and in Germany. And we expect those markets to gradually soften as well. How deep it will get in Europe is very difficult to call, just like it's difficult to call the way the trucks are going and where it will end up. Our belief right now is that the compact equipment will be affected more than the general purpose equipment. The general purpose, based on the consensus feeling is somewhere between 5 and 10% during the next few quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And Sal, a question to you then. You've been -- you said that you've been in downturn road in the US since the fourth quarter of '07. I just wanted to hear; are you in this mode now when it comes to Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say in Europe, we're seeing some signs of softness. I wouldn't say we're in the midst of a downturn. Softness we're seeing is in Spain, especially, in the construction sector. Softness in Poland, some of the Baltic States and UK and France, some signs, but not as much as we're seeing in Spain and Poland.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But still only anecdotal, the write-off increases that we're seeing in Europe. Right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. I might thank you; I have to come back to the quarters again, I'm sorry for that. My question is on the order backlog. If I remember correctly, my perception is that the order backlog has, in Europe, moved from eight months in first quarter down to six months. And I'm curious how much it's increasing deliveries and how much it's the cancellations? And my second question is when do you think that Europe, in trucks, will move back to more normal order backlog? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, not easy questions to really -- I don't have a catch-all number. You're dealing with many moving parts here, you're dealing with different countries, you're dealing with different segments across the continent. For example, I think we've said in the morning here that construction segment is more impacted than the low voltage segment of that. So I don't have a catch-all number for that. What we have tried to do is to take out as much uncertainty in the order books as we felt was prudent to do here and therefore we also don't have a forecast for cancellations, you can say though. The cancellations that are still in affecting us are out there. So I don't have a catch-all number, Hampus, for what you are asking there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, I heard on the other OEMs talking about the order books coming back in mid-second quarter '09 on the three to four months. And I was just wondering of your perception on your side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's say that we have, on an overall basis, around six months order backlog right now. We have orders coming in at 22,000 -- your guess is as good as mine or whoever it was that that made that guess. But it doesn't sound unreasonable.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I just wanted to have more position on your construction equipment business. I would to know what is the current lead-time for a construction equipment device.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, lead-times, they very much depend upon the particular product. Some products', the lead-times are quite short, leading up to the longest lead-times which would be for articulated haulers which could be still more than six months. So quite a range between compact equipment which you can probably get -- I can estimate in a very short period of time leading up to quite many months for some of the bigger products. The minus 7%; come back to me on that one. Are you talking about the market that went down minus 7%?</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Peter Testa. I had a couple of questions, please. Firstly, if you could -- can you give us any sort of feeling for the magnitude on cancellations, just to give a context to understand the difference between gross and net orders, because it's obviously a different experience Q2 versus Q1?</p>
          <p>Then, also, at the same time, can you give us any sort of sense of maybe looking at Eastern Europe versus Western Europe as a whole, to understand whether how the trends have changed there?</p>
          <p>And then you talked about moderating your production going forward. You mentioned that there were no truck plan. Could you give us any sort of sense on what you expect to do to overall production rates?</p>
          <p>And lastly, now that you've worked with, in many cases, engines merged between BCE and trucks, can you give us a sense as to whether the migration effect has on this sort of engine output on the engine factories, please?</p>

          <p>Okay. I think on the cancellation rate, I don't have a catch-all number there for the whole of the European product range and the bits and pieces, the reasons that it's moving there, we certainly have some cancellations. We've also had an impact here that I alluded to earlier, which was to solicit hesitant customers to let production slots go and we were able to use those for international and Asian markets instead. And at the same time we have a big moving piece, which is the new range of products being introduced by Volvo Trucks, which was introduced, and in June that was a short time for order intake on those. So I don't have a catch-all number there. I think, frankly, the best way to look at the 22,000 number is to say that that is probably to the best that we can say across Europe. The best indication actually, just fact, is that we had 22,000 orders and it makes all of that across the different geographies, we have commented a little and also across different segments here. If the Europe versus, Western Europe, you've already heard us talk us a little about Spain. We have, on the other hand, other markets that are growing in Europe still. We also talk about Poland and Baltic states on the more difficult side. On the other hand, other countries there in the Eastern Europe, they're doing well. So the answer -- picture across the different geographies there. Say again?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But can you give us an aggregate, say, Western European versus Eastern European experience?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I can't say that. I don't know if -- my colleagues would have any -- I'm looking around the table here that's... No, I don't think we have that altogether. You have very big countries that are moving there. We, for example, have still a very strong Russian market. We've had a weak compared to last year, which was a booming Polish market, et cetera. No, I -- we don't have actual number for you there. Then you asked me, I think, about which production rate will we have in Renault and when?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you were talking about some -- you've mentioned in the release production schedules being brought down, you specifically then talked about Renault...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Production, I was wondering if you could just give us any, sort of, sense on an aggregate basis, how you are changing your production plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our present plan is to pull down, make an adjustment in Renault's production rate in quarter three. And that is more done in, say, taking a look at the construction market, for example, that Renault has begun in Europe, that seems to be coming down more than of the long haulage side. But obviously, since we are producing in the main four customers that's a little of a speculation, but we -- given what we see here especially then construction -- because, for example, in Spain we've decided to make a little reduction in Renault there on the production rate side. So -- and we are looking at similar situation on the Volvo truck side, but so far we've been able to find customers in quarter three and quarter four here for the products that have been, for different regions, come out of the European order book there. So it could well happen in Volvo, also, that we make as whole adjustments. We don't comment those in actual numbers because they are forward looking and on top of that it's, of course, very competitive information. So we will just let you be aware of the fact that we are trending downwards slightly on the Renault Trucks side, and we are looking at the situation in Volvo trucks here at Volvo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the engine, given that you work in trucks and work on construction equipment together on many engines -- what impact this, that the two units working together have an engine production going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so far you can say on the engine production, going forward, in European and International system including Brazil. The combination of Penta's trucks and the rest of the growth around -- Volvo Penta and the rest of the group growth around international Asia have actually meant that we have held production. And as we can see today, will hold production rates up on the engine sides. With one exception, which is the US, where we have, in line with what I said before, <mark type="inaudible" /> we have made adjustments also in Hagerstown.</p>
