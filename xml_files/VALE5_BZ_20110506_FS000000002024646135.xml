        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you very much for attending this conference. The agenda today, I will talk about another outstanding quarter and the continued growth ahead.</p>
          <p>Beginning on Page 5, we see that despite very adverse weather conditions, we had a good operational performance. Comparing the first quarter 2011 with the first quarter 2010, we've seen increase in production of iron ore of 3.9% and increase in pellet production of 26.5%, increase in manganese of 25.5%, increase in ferroalloys of 3.5%, 79.7% in nickel, 107.9% copper; and 0.2% increase in coal, despite the heavy rains in Australia. This led to an outstanding financial performance and the best first quarter ever, with an operating income of $13.5 billion and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $6.5 billion, an adjusted EBIT margin of 48.9%, even higher than the last quarter, an adjusted EBITDA of $7.7 billion; and a record net earnings of $6.8 billion.</p>
          <p>We have been dealing with seasonal and cyclical cost pressures. The main cost pressures when you compare the first quarter 2011 with the last quarter of 2010, we see a $93 million increase in maintenance materials, which is seasonal, when generally we take advantage of the stoppage because of the rains to increase the maintenance activities. We had a $79 million increase in fuel and gases due to the oil prices. We had a $78 million in purchases of products, which are purchases of nickel and iron ore from third parties.</p>
          <p>However, in addition to the price increases, cost reduction was important to adjusted EBITDA performance. Moving up the EBITDA from the last quarter, we had a $1.5 billion gain on the sale of the aluminum assets. We had a $600 million gain due to the price increase. And we had a $300 million savings in SG&amp;A, cost of goods sold, and in other operating expenses. We had a negative impact on research and development of $41 million. We had an impact of exchange rate depreciation of $65 million, a negative impact in dividends, and as explained before due to weather conditions, a lower volume impacting in $1.6 billion EBITDA. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (5:36) $9.2 billion of EBITDA of first quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>Our cash generation is already well above the pre-crisis peak. The rolling 12-month EBITDA reached $32 billion in the first quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>This powerful cash flow helps to keep a healthy balance sheet with a low-risk debt portfolio. On Page 10, we can see that we increased our average debt maturity to 10 years and decreased the cost of debt to 4.7%. Our cash balances ended the first quarter with $11.8 billion and a gross debt of $23.7 billion. Our gross debt to last 12 months EBITDA decreased to 0.7 times.</p>
          <p>Now, talking about the prospectives, we see on Page 12 that the global IP, industrial production, boomed since the end of 2010, adding strength to the global demand for metals and minerals.</p>
          <p>Looking at the lead indicators on Page 13, given the change in the inventory cycle, global industrial production is expected to moderate the growth looking ahead. However, the global manufacturer purchase index &#x2013; it's still above the 50, and new orders over inventory ratio is still above 1 time. We think the decrease that happened in the beginning of the year is due to the natural disasters, and we think that these numbers will improve going forward.</p>
          <p>China remains on the fast growth path, driven by domestic demand, and Chinese GDP growth continues on a 10% range.</p>
          <p>Both fixed asset investment and industrial production are showing signs of reacceleration in China, as we can see on Page 15.</p>
          <p>China's recently released the 12th five-year plan, and the priorities are supportive of the demand for Vale's iron ore. Target average annual GDP growth of 7%, construction of 36 million units of social housing, reduction of 16% in energy consumption per unit of GDP, and 17% less carbon emissions per unit of GDP, which relates to a higher consumption of a better quality iron ore. Proportion of urban residence to reach 51.5% and a creation of 45 million urban jobs.</p>
          <p>The low-income housing starts for 2011 is targeted to 10 million houses.</p>
          <p>Now, on Page 18, we see in global carbon output is running at 1.5 billion metric tons per year expanding by 7.6% over the last quarter and China is the main growth driver with 50%. This leads to an iron ore price continue to grow over around a level, increase of global demand and supply constraints.</p>
          <p>On page 20 we see global carbon steel output is running at 1.5 billion metric tons per year, expanding by 7.6% over the last quarter. And China is the main growth driver with 50%.</p>
          <p>This leads to an iron ore price continue to hover around a level in the face of a strong global demand growth and supply constraints.</p>
          <p>On Page 20, we see global stainless steel production reached an all-time high at 8.6 million tons in the first quarter. Fast expansion in consumption expenditures in emerging markets countries will drive the long-term demand growth.</p>
          <p>This reflects on the nickel price, and the nickel market remains tight due to the broad based global demand growth despite the expansion of the nickel pig iron production.</p>
          <p>On Page 22, we see that according to analyst estimates, Vale has the highest growth potential among the large mining companies regarding copper equivalent volume growth.</p>
          <p>And on Page 23, we have our exciting pipeline of projects that from 2011 to 2015, 34 additional major projects will be delivered, contributing to shareholder value creation.</p>
          <p>It's worth mentioning our discipline in capital allocation. In this first quarter, the return on invested capital has returned to the pre-crisis level, and it's far above our cost of capital.</p>
          <p>In the strengthening infrastructure, we delivered the Estreito hydro power plant. We just delivered Vale Brasil, the first Valemax, 400,000 tons, the largest ship of the world. And it's &#x2013; we can see here by our window, in the Guanabara Bay.</p>
          <p>We're ramping up the production of Tres Valles copper mine in Chile, the nickel On&#xE7;a Puma in Brazil, and our pelletizing plant in Oman.</p>
          <p>On Page 27, it shows our global leadership in iron ore pellets. A capacity to reach 80 million metric tons by 2014..</p>
          <p>Finally, the acquisition of 9% of the Belo Monte hydropower plant project will add an average of 400 megawatts to Vale's own generation capacity, will narrow the expected increasing disequilibrium between Vale's power consumption and generation capacity in Brazil, will reduce the cost of energy as cost of self-generation is well below market prices, will mitigate the risk exposure to price and supply risk, and the expected rate of return is higher than our cost of capital.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to go to the question and answer session.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Felipe Hirai from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. So I have two questions. The first one is related to your iron ore volumes. We saw a steep decline in your volumes of iron ore from the fourth to the first quarter. I understand that it was because of the rains, but I just would like &#x2013; if it is possible for you to comment on what the outlook for the iron ore volume is going forward, if you're really going to see a recovery in the second quarter, and if we still should work with your target to sell about 310 million tons in 2011?</p>
          <p>And my second question is related to your cash flow generation. As we could see from the numbers, your leverage keeps coming down. Your net debt is coming down very fast. And we do expect to see a significant increase in your cash flow because of higher iron ore prices. And at the same time, your CapEx is coming below what we were &#x2013; below your budget. So what we expect in terms of cash flow going forward? Is your CapEx going to increase, or &#x2013; and what do you intend to do with these excess cash flows? Should we expect to see a much higher dividend for Vale going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Felipe, here is Eduard Bartolomeo. I will answer your first question about the iron ore volumes. I think seasonality is part of our business, as you know very well. We were a little bit below our budget for this quarter, but very, very close to it. It has to be noticed on the iron ore side that this year was much worse than last year. So I think we really improved in operations from this standpoint.</p>
          <p>If we look forward, our guidance is still kept. We don't see any reasons for moving from that, because as I mentioned before, we were in line with our expectations for this first quarter. And weather's improving, mainly in the south still. For some reason, Ponta Madeira's still a lot of issues with the rain, but nothing out of our targets. So I think the prospects for this year is very good.</p>
          <p>And I'll let the second question to Guilherme.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, hi, Felipe. In fact, we don't expect to reach the $24 billion target for our capital expenditures; it will probably be lower than this. And our cash generation will be higher than expected as well. As we do every year, once we have the budget for 2012, which happens around October, we analyze our surplus of cash and decide what to do with it. But one thing that you can start making some accounts is that remember that by Brazilian <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:29) we have to pay at least 25% of the net income of the previous years. So for 2012 you can start to make this kind of calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Guilherme. Thank you, Eduardo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, our next question comes from Mr. Marcos Assump&#xE7;&#xE3;o from Ita&#xFA; BBA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everybody. My first question is regarding &#x2013; if you could comment a little bit on the drivers behind the iron ore prices in the short term. Mainly on &#x2013; if you could point on the Chinese steel production, how you see the evolution in the short term. And also considering the potential increase in supply coming from Vale and Australians given the better seasonality now for volumes in the second quarter, and maybe India coming back with a little bit higher exports given the Karnataka ban that expired in April?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Martins speaking. As far as price is concerned, we believe the third quarter will keep the same price as second quarter. We have already two months gone in the price formula formation and the price is under the same level as the second quarter. So I really believe that for the third quarter the price is staying the same level.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter, as you mentioned, we have a first &#x2013; better performance from the iron ore producers, not only in Brazil, but also in Australia. We have this issue of Karnataka, but on the other hand, the monsoon, it was starting in India. So you have one thing which is positive, and the other one is negative. So &#x2013; but anyway, fourth quarter always will have a bigger supply of iron ore. And as far as Chinese steel production is concerned, we believe that it'll continue to grow, it's slightly below the last year pace, but it will continue to grow.</p>
          <p>And on top of it we have better performance in Europe for the steel makers. It's not clearly why, but they are performing better. And the whole world is performing in steelmaking, Brazil also. So I do not see too many problems as far as demand side is concerned. For sure, there will be a little bit more supply in the first quarter mainly, but I don't believe that will have a big impact. Iron ore price fundamentals continues to be very good. We saw some movement in those more liquid commodity prices, copper and nickel, but iron ore continues to be stable, and demand continues to be strong. So even with these additional volumes, I do not see too big changes in the fundamentals. Fundamentals continues to be very good, and the price perspective, at least I would say I see it stable, at least.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. If I could make just a second question, if you could just give us a sense of how do you see the Chinese iron ore production cost right now, the level of the cost of the marginal producer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very difficult to make an appraisal because you have a big range of cost producers in China. It's more than 1,000 producers. And I think the largest iron ore producer in China produces something like 50 million tons. So it's very &#x2013; I would say, it's spread, the range is very big. But on average, we believe that this cost is now moving up, because we have inflation, so wages are growing. Also their currency is becoming stronger.</p>
          <p>So all of this is adding additional cost to the iron ore cost structure in China. And probably today, they are around $100. It's moving from $80 &#x2013; that's what it used to be &#x2013; to something like $100. So I think as far as this point is concerned, we have a very, I would say, a floor price for iron ore. So I think the price of iron ore will be sustained above $100 per ton, at least if you look really long term, okay? But I do not see it happening in the short term. I do not see it happen in the short term. I think that for more than four or five years, perhaps it continues to be very strong in China and Europe. I don't lose my sleep because of iron ore price, to say the less.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. <mark type="ph" /> Hinatu Antunes (21:29) from Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions, actually. First one related to pellets. I just wanted to get your views on how you're seeing the dynamics of the pellet market over the next year. I mean, the current spread in your realized prices for pellets was at close to $55 per ton. And also in that context, if you could comment a bit on how do you see also the pellet feed material price relative to <mark type="ph" /> sythastrid, (21:58) that would be great. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question related to your C&amp;F shipments. You mentioned that you shipped close to 25% of your volumes in the quarter. On a C&amp;F basis, this is slightly down from almost 40% in the fourth quarter. I just wanted to better understand these dynamics, and if you could comment what should we expect going forward, if you have been able to capture some margin freight on your C&amp;F shipments, that would be also great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our strategy is to sell more and more C&amp;F, okay. But it will take time for us to reach this target, because many <mark type="ph" /> parts of our (22:47) customers have long-term contracts for their freight, so it's not easy negotiation to buy back these contracts and then to supply them on a C&amp;F basis. And also, we needed to look the moment that are better for doing it.</p>
          <p>So we are building our fleet of owned vessels and charted vessels. And for the time being, big part of our C&amp;F sales are based on the customers that were used to buy freight on a spot basis, so &#x2013; and this mix changes quarter by quarter. But anyway, we have a very competitive fleet cost in our fleet, and we can sell iron ore C&amp;F or we can even sell FOB and the freight separately. So we have a kind of flexibility for doing it one way or another, depending upon the circumstances.</p>
          <p>What we think is more important is Vale's shipments are not sold based on spot freight anymore, which means that being Vale or being the customers, we don't need to go to the market to buy freight on a spot basis. So &#x2013; and that will bring much more stability for freight. We don't want the freight to be too low, below the replacement cost, but we want to keep it stable long term around the $20 &#x2013; that is our target. Our strategy is to keep the long-term freight around $20, which is the replacement cost for the fleet, okay. If you have this priced too low, people will stop building vessels and we're going to have a problem in the future, because we don't have the idea to have 100% of our sales based on our own fleet.</p>
          <p>So that's our strategy, and long term, more and more of our sales will move into C&amp;F based. But we don't believe that is really an issue. The issue for us is to sell our ore and to sell the freight that we are able to supply. So then we can sell C&amp;F or we can sell FOB, and also you can sell the freight to the market. So &#x2013; but as I told you, long term you have to look that more and more our sales will be based on a C&amp;F basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. My first question is just if we can elaborate a little bit more on the decline that we could expect in the long-term for iron ore price from $180 to $100, what are the main factors behind these, and why do you think it will only happen around 2014, 2015? Clearly by the equity valuations, the investors do not believe that that will be the case, so your thoughts and comment would be appreciated.</p>
          <p>And then second question would be, can you give us an update on the Moatize project? Where are you at the moment? Are you on schedule, on time? Any comments on the railway there? As well as in the Guinea project, particularly after the agreement that Rio Tinto achieved with the Guinean government? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Carlos, this is Eduardo talking and speaking. I'll talk a little bit about Mozambique. Mozambique project on the mine side is almost commissioned. It's running from July. We are finalizing, so it's up and running from the budget date, and so it's a good news.</p>
          <p>On the logistics side, we're still discussing the infrastructure with the government. The railway line is ready, but it needs some, not upgrade, but repairs to make it feasible for the trains to run it over. So it's a threat, I would say, on the product, but it's under control still, because we're in constant discussions with the government there. And we have all the locomotives, the train &#x2013; or the engineers and the wagons already ready for that.</p>
          <p>And on the shipping side, we are doing some adjustments on the Beira Port on the general cargo port that will be also ready by August. So my expectation is that we start shipping around August to September on Moatize.</p>
          <p>I'll rather ask Martins to go over Guinea, because he's more updated on that, then go back to the other issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as Guinea is concerned, we are now under negotiation with the local government, because we have an agreement before the election and that agreement was based on the situation before the election. So now with the new government, have new ideas, and we are trying to adapt our agreement to the new situation. For the time being, we have nothing to say besides what we already told, but we are very, I would say, optimistic that we can find a good agreement and we can move ahead with the project. We are working there on the engineering side, preparing everything to start, but we need first to redefine our agreement with the local government, which is now under negotiation.</p>
          <p>For the point you raised about long-term price for iron ore, to talk about the future is kind of difficult thing. But what I can say to you is, our view about iron ore and commodities in general is very positive. <mark type="ph" /> There is a need &#x2013; (29:20) we have a huge urbanization process going on in Europe. So steel consumption is growing, not only in China &#x2013; normally we look China because it is the most, I would say, visible, example of it. But the steel consumption is growing in Middle East, the steel consumption is growing in Southeast Asia, the steel consumption is growing in India, the steel consumption is growing in Brazil, it's growing in Latin America.</p>
          <p>So steel consumption is growing everywhere besides States and Europe. Also the States and Europe, they are recovering a little bit, but in this moment, steel consumption in Europe and States is kind of 15% below the pre-crisis level. So Western Europe and, I would say, northwestern countries' consumption continues to be 60% below pre-crisis level. But all over the world, the steel consumption is growing. So &#x2013; and we don't see this changing, unless you see some stop in the urbanization process, which I don't believe it will happen.</p>
          <p>People will continue to move from the countryside to the cities, and they will need infrastructure. And steel is the most important material, with cement. So &#x2013; and this will not change. We have had a lot of movements in the economy here and there, inflation and so and so, but urbanization will continue. I think the only point that could reduce the pace of urbanization is inflation, okay. If inflation grows, countries will start cooling down their economies to avoid inflation, but the movement to urbanization will continue.</p>
          <p>So I really believe that we have a long-term good perspective for iron ore. Because on the other hand, when you look at the supply side &#x2013; we believe that the consumption of steel and iron ore will continue to grow. But on the other side, supply is facing more and more difficult to increase, based on environmental concerns, based on the institution of difficulties that you have here and there. So urbanization make consumption grows faster than you can increase the production.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and then I see for long term this scenario of kind of scarcity to remain at least five years ahead. So until this new big project starts producing, even after that, you can have one or two years of a more stable environment, and then it will pick up again. So when you look historically, it took more than 250 years from the Industrial Revolution until today for the Western world to reach the level of life we have now, and this is very much <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:41) intensity &#x2013; is very steel intensity, and also energy intensity. And it's 1 billion people living in the Western world. But when you go to Asia, it's 5 billion people living there. Only China is 1.4 billion, and China's doing in 20 years, what the Western world did in 250 years. So this is putting a huge pressure over natural resources, commodities, being iron ore, being coking coal, being energy, being food &#x2013; looks what is going on with food. People are eating more.</p>
          <p>So I got some information from some Chinese officials two weeks ago that they calculate that a guy &#x2013; when the guy moves from the countryside to the city, the guy is consuming eight to 10 times more, and that's done immediately, in the next day. When the guy moves, he starts consuming more and changing the way they live and living different thing. So &#x2013; and this is going on, okay? I don't believe we are going to have changes on this, because we have this sovereign debt in Europe or because of personnel debt in the United States too big, or because the excise rate is going this way or that way. I think when you look all those movements, you are looking the front. You are not looking the wave.</p>
          <p>So it's a big wave coming. And if you look carefully, it's not a wave, it's a tsunami. <mark type="ph" /> And so that's born, (34:19) it's coming because the earthquake started maybe 10, 15 years ago. And China has started moving huge quantities of people from the countryside to the cities, and now India is doing the same. Everybody will have the same things going on. And this is material in terms of the people. And the pressure over commodities, the pressure over raw materials, the pressure over natural resources, will continue to be very strong.</p>
          <p>For sure, we are going to have a movement here and there because of inflation, because of cooling down of the economy, because some problems here and there. But the movement has one direction, in my view. People need more things for their life, and as long as we don't change the way we live, people will need more iron ore, more food, more raw materials, more energy. And the producers are having trouble to get the supply at the same time the people need more things.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and then we have now, if you look, this inflation is worldwide movement is partly because of it, and there is a scarcity in natural resources. So iron ore is part of it, probably a little bit more benefit than the others because of the huge quantity that you need. But in the same movement, I don't see different things when I look iron ore, or I look corn, or I look at wheat or soybean; it's the same movement. People are consuming more and need things, and the producers are having difficulties and get production in place when they need.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and that's the reason I'm not concerned about the price of iron ore long term. The same way I'm not concerned about the copper or nickel or whatever price you take. I don't believe producers will have a capacity to cope with this huge movement, which means urbanization, okay? I'm not talking about population growth. I'm talking about urbanization. And that is the movement that you have to look if you want to see where the consumption of things will go. If the urbanization process continues to move in Asia mainly, or in Africa or even in Latin America, people will need more materials, and that will put pressure on prices anyway.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon, everyone. Can you comment on some of the project delays that were mentioned in the earnings press release, and do these delays affect your five-year commodity growth production timeline? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact we already showed some project delays, and we already put on the press release the postponement of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:50). This has happened around the world, as Martins mentioned, the difficulty of the producers to keep in place. We have constraints on equipment, we have workforce constraints, and we are trying to deal with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's one point. I told you before the difficulties that we are having to cope with this demand growth. Vale has a very, I would say, bold investment projects, okay? We are investing a lot of money, because we believe in the picture that I just talked here. We believe that world <mark type="ph" /> will live a long fuel (38:39) of scarcity. So we are putting a lot of money, because we believe that the demand will be there. But at the same time, we see that it's very difficult to keep the projects on time. All of our projects have some kind of delay for different reasons, okay? In Brazil, if you look now, we have this World Cup, a lot of investments being done, we look what's going on at the next Olympics, and also the pre-salt project from Petrobras.</p>
          <p>There is a huge pressure over engineering people, over raw materials, over materials that you need for this works and equipment. So &#x2013; and that's the situation, and if you go to other countries' situations, it's not that different. So &#x2013; and that's the reason we believe that this scarcity scenario will remain for a long time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And it's worth mentioning also like environmental licensing, that's one of the reasons of the delays of our projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's an additional &#x2013; yeah, sure. But even the projects that we already got the licenses, we are not able to keep the same schedule because of other different constraints that are appearing every day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And are you still maintaining your commodity production growth timelines over the next five years, or how has that changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, it will change a little, and we will show it later on this year, when we show the next year's plans later on. But some things will probably postpone it from what we showed last year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, I had a quick question on CapEx. You mentioned that you would probably not reach the $24 billion budget that you had released at the end of last year. I was wondering if you could give us a bit of a &#x2013; more of a guidance in terms of the actual budget or revised budget that you are working on right now. And also, what sort of projects might be affected? Is it the other that wasn't allocated, or is it some of the CapEx that you had allocated to particular projects, which are being possibly delayed? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far our expectation is little than the $24 billion, more on the range of $20 billion. And it's spread through all our projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I'm a Vale shareholder and admire everything you're doing. I have a concern that the $24 billion capital spending program is conspicuous and may attract attention among the illiterate Brazilian voters such as the masses that live in the shantytowns and poor neighborhoods. And that some politicians might think of Vale as a deep pocket target. Please talk about how you manage these perceptions in order to protect everyone's interests?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. First of all, it's worth mentioning that so far we've been delivering a return on invested capital far above our cost of capital, as we showed in the presentation. And also it's worth mentioning how we rank our CapEx and how we reach this number. Every year on the budgeting process, we collect from the business units the desire and their projects &#x2013; their growth projects. And then we rank them by rate of return. So for example, if this year the mainly CapEx is on iron ore and logistics related to iron ore. Why? Because the iron ore projects have the highest returns. So we rank, then, the projects by return and then make a cut where we have &#x2013; do we have enough cutback in terms of money to spend? So I think this gives the comfort that &#x2013; and also, it's worth mentioning that all our projects have a hurdle rate of 12% full equity basis. So all the projects must attend this hurdle rate. So I think this process gives comfort to the shareholders that the money will be well spent.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I was hoping you could comment a little bit about any appetite you might have for additional acquisitions? I know you've said you're pretty happy with the organic pipeline that you have. But in the past, you talked a little bit about possibly adding the copper assets, and I know that you did an acquisition earlier this year. Could you talk a little bit about any further appetite, and whether or not you're still looking and whether or not there are properties that are available?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, first, I'd like to remember that our exciting pipeline of projects that I showed, Vale is the only mining company that can double the production only with our organic growth. So organic growth is our main target, because we have this capacity. We have the reserves. And we can expand the company that way. But we do not rule out opportunistic acquisitions. So far we are always analyzing, but things like Metorex and other acquisitions on that range is likely to come if we see the opportunity in terms of value creation for the shareholder.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I just want to come back to the nickel operations in Canada and elsewhere. I know you review these operations all the time in terms of their <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:24) discussed in the case of previous question on the capital spending and also the costs and industry opportunities and all. Could we talk about the developments in the market, with respect to where you are on the cost curves and how do you see the operations in Brazil and Canada shaping out to be? There are a lot of competitive new operations coming into production, some very high capital <mark type="ph" /> accounts (46:52) as well. So how would you review and put your operations in perspective right now on a global scale? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as nickel is concerned, Canada is a very stable operation for Vale. Last year we have that long strike. We come back from the strike very well, but we faced some operational problems and had an accident in one of the furnace that is now being repaired, and it will start producing again in next month. So operationally speaking, Canada is doing very well. Also Indonesia and our operation in Asia is going very well, is the core of our operation, is doing very well as far as production and sales is concerned. Then we move to Goro, which everybody knows New Caledonia is a completely new project, a new technology. It's facing difficulties to get the production in place, but we are expecting in the next two months to restart producing there, and it's a very problematic start-up. But we are trying to fix it and to bring it to production.</p>
          <p>On&#xE7;a Puma is a new project in Brazil. It's now operating near 50% of its first line, because we put the first line operation and is now 50% of the capacity. And in the second quarter, we expect to get 100% of the first line and to start the second line. So we believe that it's a very <mark type="ph" /> dominated (48:48) technology, it's a problem that could be solved normally, and we don't expect the same difficulties that we are facing in New Caledonia. So we expect at least for next year to have On&#xE7;a Puma operating near full capacity, adding around 50,000 tons of nickel to the market. And Canada also operating regularly and Indonesia and Asia operating regularly.</p>
          <p>So this gives you a good perspective for nickel next year, the production to be above 300,000 pounds per year. Goro continues to be a matter of concern. As I told you, this technology challenge for us was bigger than we first imagined, and this hydrometallurgy system. So I cannot assure that we can have this Goro capacity on place, but for sure On&#xE7;a Puma will be in place in Canada. We will be operating regularly.</p>
          <p>As far as price, and nickel one of the most volatile metal in the LME moves very fast up and down, but we believe that the replacement cost of nickel considering operational cost flows &#x2013; capital cost is between $16 and $20 per kilo. So the price &#x2013; I don't believe the price will move below this level, because this is the level that could bring in more production. As we discussed before, with the urbanization process, nickel is a material on demand. It's needed not only for stainless steel, but for other applications. And as the society becomes more sophisticated, more nickel material is needed. So the prospective for demand is good, and the replacement cost of capacity is very high. So I really believe that this situation will sustain the nickel price around $20 per kilo, something like that. And also with some in spikes, depending on the supply and demand moment, and also how much money will come from the financial investment for the nickel business.</p>
          <p>The recent movement in nickel is clearly financial driven. It was not driven by fundamentals, but was driven by financial movements. The price reached almost $30 per kilo, and now is adjusting below $25. So the fundamentals are very stable. Demand for nickel is increasing, not as fast as iron ore, but it's increasing. So in general we believe that nickel continues this more stable situation as far as price is concerned. And the new capacity that are coming on stream, all of them are facing difficulties in starting up. So we are not, I would say, pessimists about the nickel market and about nickel prices. We do not see big gains, but on the other hand we do not see the price going down sharply or something like that.</p>
