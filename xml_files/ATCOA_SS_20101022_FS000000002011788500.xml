        <plist>
          <p>Hello and welcome. I have the honor to open this presentation with Atlas Copco, and I will leave over the speech to &#x2013; we lost it, no, no, no, and I will leave over the speech to the CFO of Atlas Copco and the moderator, Hans Ola Meyer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Peririk, and very welcome to everybody to this presentation of the third quarter results for Atlas Copco. I particularly welcome also the participants on the telephone conference, of course. We will do the usual format. I will very soon hand over to Ronnie, who will take us through his comments on the quarter results and the trends. And after that, we will immediately jump into the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>So I don't think I waste any more time than just to hand it over to you, Ronnie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Hans Ola. And as usually, I will refer to the slides, so that we are sure we are talking about the same slides.</p>
          <p>Let's go immediately to the highlights, so slide number two. We were very pleased to see the strong order growth in all the regions, if you would say, later on the slides and also we see that happening in all customer segments. Record order intake and I think it's not a surprise for anyone when you see these regions, Asia, South America and Australia. And we should not forget, but we had a very, very good development in the after-market.</p>
          <p>Record operation margins and record operating profit, also in absolute terms, coming from a good lot in all the different areas, a good after-market, solid pricing, efficiency measures, which we have taken for many, many months and the years before. And last, but not least, I think, one thing what is paying back now is also our continuous push in innovation and coming with state-of-the-art products, which our customers also like to work with.</p>
          <p>The statement also on market organization, we keep investing further intensifying our network. You have seen lately we opened also a special office in Panama and also we are having &#x2013; inaugurating two logistic centers, one in U.S. for giving better service to our customers and supporting our after-market and also in Nanjing in China for giving a better performance in Asia on that one.</p>
          <p>If we then go to a bit on the figures, 35% organic growth, which I believe is a very good achievement, revenue plus 18. I think we see stress in the supply chain, but it doesn't really affect us so much that we cannot keep it going on the output. And then maybe as third point and I would like to spend a minute on that, 21.9% as the margin, and 3.782 billion when it comes to operating profit, and of course, we also know that we had this SEK100 million restructuring. I think I would say a very strong achievement on the operating profit.</p>
          <p>And the operating cash flow, of course, now we entering another phase, we are investing in &#x2013; in our business in receivables and inventory, but Hans Ola will show you a little bit later on that, where it comes from. They summarize, I think a very good achievement in quarter three.</p>
          <p>Orders received globally, you see all very strong development in all the regions, but let's go immediately to slide number five and we talk about the Americans. A very strong North America and you see it also plus 49 and we see that as well for equipment as for after-market and we see that also in the industry, and we see also an improvement on the construction part.</p>
          <p>Rental companies are ordering, so that makes it good for us. Quincy, the acquisition we did early January is performing very well and is representing a little bit less than 10% of the growth. So if you take that away, it would be around 40%. So a very solid development in North America, which we also see in Canada and Mexico. South America continue, it is may be a boring story when I say it, but it really goes on, continuously good development in Brazil, in Peru and Chile. So that's going on, and of course, you can say only plus 30%, but they came a bit earlier in the recoup last year. So we comparing here also, we have a very strong, relative strong, if you'd say, quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Europe, I talked first on that, plus 26, okay. As is also set on the slide to be compared with weak quarter three, but anyhow plus 26, a bit of a mixed view, where we see Nordic, East Europe, Russia doing very well, where then say maybe, south of Benelux, where you can see a bit of a doubt in a development.</p>
          <p>If we then look Africa, Middle East, there we have a bit of a mixed picture, where southern part of Africa is doing &#x2013; doing well. So you see us, of course, the mining industry, where it's a little bit softer in the Middle East, but anyhow also here, we had last year a very solid quarter also. In all these areas, as well in Europe, as in Africa, Middle East, we see good development of the after-market.</p>
          <p>Asia, Australia, I don't know what I have to say on this, it all goes up, up, up. You see it also plus 60, plus 96 for Australia. We had a record order from Kazakhstan, which was the highest we ever had there, and also for the business area, so we are very proud that we got that, but we also see extremely good development in India. Everybody talks these days about China, but we should not forget that India is very strong market for us and it's now already number four for Atlas Copco.</p>
          <p>I don't say on quarter &#x2013; on slide number eight, you see, we have three quarters with very solid development. So, that is good to have. If we then take the bridge, yeah, we see structural changes, so Quincy and a couple other acquisitions account for 2%, currency is negative and we know that the Swedish krona price. We keep having good price development and this is to continue also driven by our new products, which allows us to get that price development and volume is around 34%.</p>
          <p>If then, yeah, I think slide number 10 on the ROCE, I think, everybody can see the figures. It improves &#x2013; if profit improves and we keep tight control on our working capital, we get, of course, a better ROCE.</p>
          <p>Compressor Technique, plus 25% organic, coming from a good stationary and portable compressor sales. So the small to medium size and smaller, larger ones are &#x2013; compressors are doing very well. Gas and process stays on a good solid level. So &#x2013; but not the big, big tickets for the big compressor step is not yet to come, there's quoting &#x2013; quotation going on, but we have not landed them. Then we see a very good development, yeah, I can say, except in West Europe, if you read this, the rest north and south Asia and East Europe that doesn't left much. So that is where we see still not the development, which we would like to see. Extremely good after-market all over, but especially in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>And on the operation margin 26% coming from, I think, a very good drive all the time to have better products, of course, a better lot and no one will get surprise in that, currency is playing in favor, sales mix is playing in favor, and the price is solid, which gives them this, yeah, fantastic margin we have here in Compressor Technique. And we keep investing in the business also via acquisitions, where we had, late in October, we had then the acquisition of Cirmac, a Dutch company specialized in gas treatment systems and also biogas upgrades. A fantastic quarter for Compressor Technique.</p>
          <p>If we then go to slide 13, a very strong development for CMT, this for equipment as well as for after-market, plus 47 organic included the after-market, I don't know the figures by heart on equipment, but I'm sure that will be much higher than 47.</p>
          <p>We see a continuous strong demand in the mining industry that goes on. And I don't see for the time being it going down. And we had a bit weaker &#x2013; specifically for our construction equipment, a bit weaker compared to quarter two in quarter three, but nothing something to have a drama about that. It's maybe a bit more, and you can say, seasonal either, also we got a couple of bigger orders in quarter two, which we don't landed in quarter three.</p>
          <p>Margin, 19.2, I think, I give not the right credit, if I talk about 17.8 to CMT. I think, I should say, 19.2, which was a base record operation margin for the CMT. And it's fantastic, if you can make that margin in this business. And we did an acquisition on the mobile crushing and screening, which we see the company Hartl in Austria, which we will further integrate, but there is nothing more to say on that part.</p>
          <p>We then go to Industrial Technique, also here a fantastic improvement on demand, 45% organic, a very strong Asia, so India, China are doing extremely well. And our continuous investing in the region, also last year when they had a tough period, is paying back. And yeah, we see the result also here. Of course, we also had a good aftermarket.</p>
          <p>And on the margin, remember last year, where we were cruising below the zero line, we have now here a plus 20. So it's a fantastic development also from this organization, coming of course from a better load, but also from a lot of cost savings this organization did and a good price development.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, we keep investing in that business, so we also have an acquisition of our distributor in Michigan that was also an application center. So we really strengthened our position in United States.</p>
          <p>Just to give you, I'll stay now on slide number 16, just to give you a nice example of a V-shaped recovery on profitability. If someone was looking for a nice example, I think this is fantastic example. If you can go in five quarters from zero to 20, I think that is a real congratulation to the organization.</p>
          <p>Then I would suggest Hans Ola, you take over.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>I will just comment a few of the coming slides very briefly and picking on where Ronnie has already started, on the page 17, to highlight, of course, the record operating margin and the record operating profit. When it comes to the financial net, it's roughly 100 million negative, as you have seen. And it's &#x2013; as always, it's primarily the interest net that reflects that.</p>
          <p>We have gradually, over the last two quarters, moved our interest rate profile from almost full variable to more and more fixed interest rates, which means &#x2013; and that you have seen also some comments on closing of some interest rate swaps in the last two quarters.</p>
          <p>And that is giving an effect that we will have a slightly higher interest cost going forward, but of course with the intention to be a better strategy if you look a few years ahead, of course. We believe that the impact for the next couple of quarters will be in the region of 20, 25 million more per quarter in cost compared to a year ago. So roughly, it's not the dramatic importance, but at least as an add on comment.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the tax, you've probably seen that the quarter as such had the 27.9 tax rate, which is higher than what we've had for quite some time. It reflects some one-time provisions of certain income taxes that will not be repeated to the same extent at least in the next quarter. Going forward, we believe that between 26 and 27% is probably where we will have our best guess for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>If I move to the next one, it's what we refer to as the profit bridge. And you see here on the total group, I just want to point out perhaps that still also in this quarter, you see a very strong flow through of organic growth to profit, 61%, as you can see there. And I don't have to repeat, it's because of the same comments that Ronnie already touched upon. We still have a very strong and improving load of activity in the factories, while the cost has not yet come up to the levels where we started before the crisis. So, we are still seeing a very strong flow through.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the currency, it's not a big impact on the margin, if we compare with last year. But the negative, as you can see here, of 135 on profit in the bridge comes almost entirely from the corporate side of our profit, not from the business areas. That you can appreciate on the next slide.</p>
          <p>And the only other comment I will have is that you can pick up in the second to last column to the right, the impact of the restructuring in CMT of 100. And you can also see that with somewhat varying degrees, all business areas have a similar good flow through of volume impact to profit.</p>
          <p>If we move to the balance sheet, still a very strong balance sheet, as you can appreciate. And it will be strong in the sense of financial strength, which can be appreciated even more if we look at the two next slides. One, the capital structure, the net debt to EBITDA is improving as expected, I would say. And also the next one is just confirming that we feel comfortable that we have the debt structure in good shape for the future. And that is on page 22.</p>
          <p>Finally, just on the cash flow. Ronnie already alluded to it. I only point to one thing, I think, and that is the tremendous swing in the cash flow statement compared to third quarter last year, where we actually released 2 billion from working capital in that quarter. And now we tie up about 1 billion in working capital due to the strong increase of volume and activity. In spite of that, the operating cash flow is still at a very good level at about 2.5 billion, in spite of that.</p>
          <p>So with that, I think I leave it back to you, Ronnie. You need that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I will manage. So, thank you, Hans Ola. Then I would like to highlight that very soon we have a Capital Markets Day, so looking forward to all see you there. So we have some, yeah, interesting stuff to share with you. Then near-term outlook, but before I go on the outlook, just to give you an idea also where we are and if we look back to pre-crisis. If we look to pre-crisis and we compare with today, and we take a bit to get away from West Europe, we are more or less at the level where we were pre-crisis, so one should really take into account when you look to these figures of Atlas Copco.</p>
          <p>Now, when it comes to outlook, this exactly the same as we had done in for quarter three and then at the end of quarter two and then in now our quarter three, so looking forward, looking ahead. So, we believe that we will have the continuous increase. Of course, we use that word, somewhat, because we believe already like I said, we are running already at the good strong level, where we also primarily see the growth coming, the real growth coming from emerging markets. Doesn't mean that we don't see any improvement in North America or Europe, but we still feel definitely that the majority is coming from these markets.</p>
          <p>So, I would say that is it what we have up to now. We'll go to the questions, Hans Ola?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So, if I can ask the operator, just to repeat the procedures for the telephone questions and after that we will take the first questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. So, I think while the questions are lining up on the telephone conference, we start here in Stockholm. And we have a question over here in the first table here. You will get the microphone as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Mats Liss, Swedbank here. Well, you mentioned Ronnie that you were impressed yourself by the Compressor margins. And I guess, it also indicates that you, well, you don't have that much extras within this EBIT. And my question is, have you reached another level, should we expect this to be sustainable and maybe improve further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think extra, of course, when you take profitability and profit, I think I'm sure we have some extra when it comes to profit, and that take to the absolute figure. And that is of course the whole message for the all organization when you have a profitability level of 26, and last time it was a bit more than 23. Then the message is to grow and to grow to make it bigger and that is our focus. I'm not obsessed by saying next month to get a 26.5 or whatever. We are not after the records, but we really want to make it bigger and that is the message we are going, and which we believe that it can, still in absolute value can go up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and for Ron <mark type="inaudible" /> about mining, I guess orders were very impressive in the quarter and should we &#x2013; well, could you give some more indication about lead times here? Should we expect it to &#x2013; orders returning to sales already throughout the balance of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it &#x2013; excuse me, when &#x2013; of course, when you look to the CMT figures, I think if we would have done equipment development, specifically on mining, it would have a bigger figure, an increase. And I don't know maybe my peers can later on giving that answer, maybe tomorrow what it is, and that is continuous. We still believe that it goes on development and demand on the mining side.</p>
          <p>When it comes to lead times, yes, I think they are &#x2013; they're more stressed. They are longer for sure, and that can go from, say, from three months to almost 10 months that one depending on if you add a service drill rig or an underground drill rig more specific. But that is more or less what you have. We come up to a book-to-bill if I talk now, I think in total for the company, what is it, 109 or something like that. So that is where we are. It is low more of course, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally just &#x2013; are you able to safeguard that customers don't place multiple orders and sort of...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that is, of course, we are &#x2013; we have learnt our lessons from pre-crisis and we are really scanning that constantly, and we have a much more routine that we don't get this orders which, yes, just to provoke or bypass the lead times that is, I think, well under control on that. I think we have a much better understanding from both sides that you need to work together in that area. And I think believe that we have it pretty well under control, I think is on the core components capacity is there. We can cope, so also when you look beyond this quarter, we believe we can manage the output.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have another question here in Stockholm, before we turn to the telephone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peder Fr&#xF6;l&#xE9;n, Handelsbanken. You referred to the strong sales mix when it comes to the strong profitability not only in CT, but also in other areas. Except for the new equipment aftermarket mix, could you please explain a bit when you said it to begin with, because it seems like one of the most profitable segments are not really kicking in yet. And then you see the growth in the portable on the smaller side. So please explain the sales mix in equipment for these divisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if I first go on the aftermarket mix. I think it's not drastically changed. So that one we still have a very good aftermarket part on that one. As we are growing also very strong in the aftermarket and that if you see, I have said it several times on that one. To give you when it comes to &#x2013; if we take CT and you take the equipment divisions, if you take that one, I would not support your statement when you mentioned the portal business that is not a good profitable business. I think you cannot make 26, if you don't work in all areas with a good profitability. So that is, I think, moving in the right direction. I think, again, and I'm repeating myself and that we have done an enormous work on the design and development not only for creating more value for our customers, but also when it comes to the product cost design, which then yield it also in a good improvement on the margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My second question relates to the mining side. To turn the backlog here and you did get a very big order in a product sense in the quarter. I know that. But on the sort of large activities for projects, are they building up or you expecting more to come soon or is it still moving around?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I listen to the people in the mining divisions and also talk to several of our customers, I think, there is still more to come. No one &#x2013; I didn't see any or didn't hear any clouds in the blue sky on that one. So everybody is very positive on that and we see it also in the order income that there is good &#x2013; you saw Australia; if you take Chile, if you take Brazil, it is all going extremely well. Take Kazakhstan and you have me here talking about Russia, so you see these things are coming in, in place. So there is still a good underlying development on that one. But again and that was one of the reasons before I start to talk about the outlook. We are back pre-crisis where we all talked it is the super cycle, whatever we talked about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And especially if we look at the mining as you asked on that segment, I mean, if not at or above, that part of the CMT business is at extremely high levels as we speak in terms of orders, and even referring to what we believed to be a super year of 2008. So one has to carry that in the back of one's head as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Anders Roslund, &#xC5;landsbanken. I have a question regarding CapEx in fixed assets, it has been below last year's levels, and now suddenly in the third quarter is like half the amount for the full year. What should we expect in CapEx for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have any immediate figure in my head and -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One can make the note, the observation as you do, I mean, in the numbers. And have we sort of turned the corner from the bottom and that's probably exactly the right observation. In a yearly run rate as it looks in the third quarter, and this is, of course, not very stable over every quarter, but it's probably indicating some tangible CapEx of about 1.5 billion per year, and which would represent roughly some 2% or close to 2% of sales. Even if it goes up from there, we will definitely see numbers that will be between 2 and 3%. It's nothing more dramatic than that even if we would come into a need to do more CapEx later on, so to speak. But, any gradual increase from this level is probably exactly what you should expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You can imagine we didn't do much in 2009 on that part, where we had 2007, 2008. And if I see what projects are now with me on my table to do investments, definitely we have to invest in China, we have to invest in India and we have to invest in certain machining tools for core components and that is going on that one. But it will not be, like Hans Ola said, the type of enormous now.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Three questions, please. First of all, Ronnie, you alluded to the fact that you want to get CT, Compressor Technique, up in absolute terms in terms of the profits. I'm more interested in the margins itself, sort of &#x2013; and whether do you think that is sustainable from here or whether there is something unsustainable in these margins currently?</p>
          <p>The second question is really around the interest rates, very interesting comment there. Just sort of wondering why you are switching towards that fixed interest rate, it seems to me that you're looking for quite a good pipeline here in terms of orders, otherwise sort of &#x2013; I wouldn't be expecting just to be fixed here going forward. Is it correct sort of to assume about 150 million a quarter is the sub question here. Third, on the construction, what is the key issue here for the sequential slowdown? I'm wondering whether there is anything behind the slowdown here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think the interest rate I think Hans Ola will take that part. He can <mark type="inaudible" /> when I answer first the last question. Like I said also in the presentation and when we compare, it is a bit of &#x2013; in the business we are, it's a bit seasonal where you have more in the first half of the year than in the second half year. And then also we compare quarter two with quarter three where we had in quarter two a couple of larger orders, which we had not from the same magnitude in quarter three. But when you really look on the underlying development or demand, there is nothing really to say that it was a weak or a real weaker construction output.</p>
          <p>When it comes to CT, yes, I will repeat what I said on that one. I think I want to make it absolute bigger. And like I said, I'm not going to pin myself on 26% that that is sustainable. I think we will definitely have a good margin development and a good margin in CT for the quarters to come. Why do I say that? I think we have a very solid, resilient aftermarket business, which is growing, which is efficient, which is creating good profitability and equipment divisions are &#x2013; with their new products are really also, beside their good factory load, but also have a good margin on that one. So really we believe that we are on the right record with that business area. And if you look back to pre-crisis where you see that that business area was running 21, 22, if you then look a bit to mix, you can come, yeah, to a solid margin. But don't ask me to say a specific percent, because then we will stand here well, until 7 o'clock in evening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But as it was a question before on this equipment mix in Compressor Technique, perhaps to add to what Ronnie has already said that there is, of course, in the previous peak margins before the crisis, we had a very strong contribution from the really big gas and process compressors, which have a little bit of a different profile than the standard industrial and portable compressors. And that mix is in the numbers, as we speak, because they don't have the same type of relative weight of invoicing this period compared to in 2008. So that has affected a little.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, another one on the margin, and I think that counts also, I think for all business area. If you see the shift, what is going on, to the different regions and remember, many times people were asking how is the profitability in China, how is the profitability in India and all that. You see here that we are significant selling more in that region. We keep a good margin, just to highlight. Maybe you can highlight on the interest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if I &#x2013; Nico, if I understood you right, you're wondering about the interest rate comment and I didn't pick up really the connection you made in your question. But what I said was that in our debt management, if I call it like that, we have gradually moved from a very extreme only variable rate structure to a more fixed, let's say. And, of course, it doesn't reflect anything more or less than that we are at very, very low, historically low, long-term interest rates. And that it's perhaps time to adjust a little bit the rather extreme variable rate profile that we had before. And that would probably lead to something. You mentioned 150 million, if I heard you right, per quarter and I would say well, somewhere in the region of 125 and something perhaps is the best guess today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. It's James at Redburn. Three questions from me, if I could. One, I wondered if you could just rank, from highest to lowest, what the margins are between the different regions at the group level and whether that's driven the mix? It sounds like it has to a degree. Secondly, your balance sheet looks very strong. Could you just prioritize for us what's more important in the near-term, acquisitions or shareholder return? And thirdly, just looking at your head count and looking at your revenue, I think the head count was up 8% and the revenue 18. So there's a big 10% productivity. And, Hans Ola, you alluded to the fact that cost has got to come back at some stage. Would you be able to put a timeframe as to how much &#x2013; as to when that's going to have to happen? And whether you've got the capacity to handle two, four, six more quarters at these high growth rates before that does happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These are a lot of questions, James. Yeah, I think I have to come to London, James, to explain it all. The margins, like we said and I think I have mentioned that in several occasions that I don't mind where we grow. That was my statement. If it is in Brazil or it is in Australia or it is in Russia, if you see overall, if you take the big figures it doesn't matter. Of course, you can &#x2013; if you go really detail-by-detail by division and you see there are products where the competition is harder in certain countries but then it's less for an other type of product. If you take it by country, more or less I think we don't mind where we grow. And that is a good thing to do that.</p>
          <p>When &#x2013; the balance sheet, what is the priority? Growth, growth, growth, then, of course, organic, because we all know that that is giving the best return. Of course, acquisitions. We are exploring the market. We are looking around. You have seen also if you take this quarter, we have done I think four or five, not the big ones, but okay. One day, maybe one is coming and then, of course, we had the shareholders' return, which is coming at that. So that is our priority, James, in that sequence.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the head count, yeah, I think we succeed to create more output with less people and that is also what you see in the bottom line, I'd say. There is no secret on that. And we are hiring more people when it comes to service people that we have always done. I think we are hiring more salespeople and, of course, we hire more people for, yeah, the factory, still out of factories. That is going on. And fortunately, we succeed to grow more than the headcounts growth.</p>
          <p>On capacity, and I think I also mentioned that when Anders asked here the question about the CapEx. Yeah, I think when it comes to core components, that is what we have really to watch and we're also investing in more machining tools. We're also extending some of our factories but this will primarily be in the Asian area where we do that to, yeah, to be able to cope with the future growth.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we turn back to Stockholm for two questions here, if we have any? It doesn't seem like that, so we continue with the telephone conference for the time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Cunliffe from RBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there, Daniel Cunliffe, RBS. Two questions, thanks, first one on the aftermarket. If you could just comment what proportion of OE do you currently have in your revenues for CT and CMT versus the peak of OE in 2008? And also, whether there is an incremental margin differential between the two? I'm assuming there is roughly around 10%, but if you could just kind of comment on that? And then the second question, you're talking about supply chain, bottlenecks, longer lead-times. We saw earlier this week Caterpillar raised pricing by a full point from 2.5 to 3.5. You currently still have 1% price increase for the quarter year-on-year. You're seeing this not just full historically when you saw this degree of volume. Where do you see kind of pricing developing given obviously what's going on in supply chain and lead-times? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I suggest that Hans Ola, you take the aftermarket, and I will take first, maybe, the supply chain. Of course, there is stress in the supply chain. And that I have already explained. And when you refer to prices from Caterpillar, in Atlas Copco, we apply continuous good price management. And this is driven by our innovation and this is also making sure that we generate customer value and that is the way pricing is managed in Atlas Copco. It's not because suddenly the demand is going up crazy that we go out with an enormous price increase to our customers. I think that is not creating a lasting relation with your customers on that front.</p>
          <p>But when you look to &#x2013; of course, if Caterpillar increases prices, we're also buying engines from them, so you also get cost into the system and that is also what Hans Ola also mentioned when he was explaining the margin. Of course, you get pressure on &#x2013; from our suppliers, which, of course, see that copper price increasing, so that means electrical motors increasing. You see iron ore is increasing. That means that the steel in the canopy is going up and also that engine is going up. So this is what we feel coming in into the system. But, of course, as that &#x2013; the market is demanding for product that makes it a bit easier also to increase prices. And that is what we continue to do and we will do that for the next quarter and more quarters to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the aftermarket, the split between OE, as you say, the equipment sales and the aftermarket, I don't have all the exact percentages in my head. But if we take in Compressor Technique, which is representing quite a big portion of the group, we are still enjoying, of course, a bigger portion of sales, that is revenue now, of aftermarket compared to the total, perhaps somewhere in the region of 30 plus, 33%, in that region. Whether it's 32 or 34, it depends on exactly where you look. And you'll remember that in the peak, we talked about an aftermarket proportion of perhaps 27% or something compared to the total sales. And then it's important to remember what I said before that we had a very strong period of invoicing of gas and process compressors, for example, during that period, which also affected the total.</p>
          <p>So it's not an enormous difference and when we look at the orders received, we can see that it's gradually coming down towards 30% as the order book is increasing, of course. But we have to remember that we have seen good growth in aftermarket. So where the real future percentage will land, we don't really know. I think you also asked about the margin difference, and of course, there is no secret that there is a rather substantial margin difference between the aftermarket revenues and the OE equipment.</p>
          <p>We, however, I also want to point that what Ronnie alluded to that we have seen a tremendous margin improvement when it comes to equipment sales compared to the &#x2013; a few years &#x2013; two years ago. And that is because of the efficiency gains and the &#x2013; all the measures that were taken in the &#x2013; during 2009, when the market was really down. So, yes, there is a margin difference of course as before and, yes, we are still at a situation now that we have more aftermarket revenue share than we had in 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to come back, it was the incremental margin. I mean the difference between EBIT margin for service and for OE. Is it the same difference at the incremental level as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when it comes to incremental margin or incremental profit on aftermarket, which is selling service hours and spare parts primarily. Then of course there is not the same type of leverage effect that you would have when you load the factory with more volume. But to get into what difference and so on is extremely difficult and I don't dare to do that.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Ben Maslen from ML. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. It's Ben Maslen from Merrill Lynch. Three quick questions, please. Firstly on currency, the effect you had in Q3, did that include any one-off revaluation effects at all and then what do you expect for Q4 and next year, if we stay at current spot rates. That's the first one.</p>
          <p>Secondly, Dynapac still seems to be struggling a little bit given the charge you've taken. Is that the function of very weak markets in Europe and the U.S. or is there something more structural going on there. May be a bit more color on that? And then finally mining. If I remember rightly at the peak of the last cycle I think you used third parties or contract assemblers to kind of put together some of the drill rigs and so forth. Are you doing that now and just where is the kind of capacity utilization you have on the mining side? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I suggest Hans Ola you take the currency, with that I will first start with the answer to the last part of the question, that's the third parties. Yes, we do the same, let's call trick, the same application as last time when we also worked together with parties or partners around the factories, which do some assembly work for us. So that is outsourced to them and that is going on. And we are talking like I also mentioned of course we talk with them to do more because there is more demand coming.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand also when you compare with two years ago, we are also stronger with some facilities in China and in India. So we will do also more in these areas than we will do in our factories in U.S. as also in Sweden. Then on Dynapac, what we did with Lingen is of course a structural change where we felt that we did not need that type of factories, these two factories close by.</p>
          <p>So we could do it with a leaner structure which we have done, but I would really invite you to look to the website of Dynapac and see the amount of new products. What we're coming out because we are not standing still in Dynapac, we &#x2013; although the demand was not very strong last year, but we have kept investing in new products, which again giving more features to our customers, but also have a better cost structure and this will go on. Next week we have a big launch in Germany for an example, where we're inviting a lot of dealers and showing our new products. And, yeah, I see really a good development in Dynapac. Unfortunately the demand what we have all experienced in 2007, 2008 is not yet back, but let's hope that the construction business in U.S. and Europe is also taking off, and then I think we're at a good track.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You asked about the currency impact in the third quarter, and if we refer to the bridge that we looked at before, as I said, there is not a very big difference compared to third quarter last year. If you take out, let's say, the impact that the corporate hedges last year had. But yes, we had a negative impact of revaluation of receivables as you refer to I think, in the third quarter this year. But we also had the similar type of affect last year. The &#x2013; going forward for Q4, judging from the rates today we would estimate that we will have about the same type of negative impact compared to the same period last year as we had in this report, i.e. 100, 150 minus or something like that.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. I would like to come back to the mining demand. You mentioned that you believed the mining demand was at a peak level here or a very high level. Could you just elaborate whether that is in relative terms or in absolute terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when we talked about that, let's say, we said that this compared to the high level in 2008 that we're reaching that level and that is also what Hans Ola mentioned, when you strengthen statement I made on that one. So that is where we made the comparison. Is it already the peak? If I believe what I see today, no. So I'm still very positive on the outlook when it comes to mining on that one. So it's everywhere where you meet. And I mentioned couple of countries, it is still strong sunshine. And that we also see in the demand of our equipment and also in our aftermarket.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Ola Kinnander with Bloomberg News. Hi. Just a quick question on the currency again. We're wondering how Atlas is affected right now by the rising krona and if there is any way of pinpointing how your earnings are related to the rising krona? For example, if the krona rises by 10% then earnings are affected by so many krona. Is there a way to do it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's of course a more complicated process since the Swedish krona is important, yes, but it's not the only currency that we have. So we don't really use the rule of thumb against the Swedish krona very often. We &#x2013; you can of course do that, but the risk is that when you do it you make so many assumptions that everything is all equal and there are no dynamic effects that it becomes a non-interesting answer. Let me say that, of course, we are affected negatively everything else equal. But to quantify it too much is a difficult task. When we look at the whole currency exposure that the group has and put that in relation to an amount in Swedish krona, you can say that we have about 9 billion in exposed currency flows, but that is between very many different currencies of course. And that we measure very carefully every month. How is that basket of currencies developing, let's say.</p>
          <p>And the 10% deterioration of that basket, which means that there is a strengthening of the Krona, there is a strengthening of the euro, for example. And a corresponding weakening of the rest, let's say. If that happens with 10%, then it affects us about 900 million on a 12 months basis, since the exposed value is about 9 billion in total. So that's the simple math you can do on that, but to quantify it would be a little bit difficult to do specifically for the krona strength.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions, please. The first is, the North America revenue increase and order increase that you've seen. There was a lot of commentary around the most recent ISM number, a lot of pundits arguing that it's proved that we had &#x2013; order growth this year have been down to restocking and that restocking was now over. So the obvious question is how much of your demand growth in North America this year, do you think is restocking and where do you see that going from here?</p>
          <p>Second question is, there's not much in this quarterly report so just you're feeling the heat from competition at the moment, but where are you seeing the most aggressive competition at the moment and is that aggressive competition on price or on technology or can you just give us a bit of color on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Colin. When it comes to North America, if I look to that and I &#x2013; of course in the way we are in capital goods, so when it comes to the restocking and all that, I think we are not &#x2013; I think not much affected, of course indirectly, most probably, yes but directly not. And also we see our channel to the market is primarily direct, so we don't have that distributors or a party in the middle. So on that part, I don't see much on the restocking. What I see if I dig in the figures of North America, I see that the industrial to the manufacturing part. So the small to medium-size companies are really investing. That's what I see, I see also that the aftermarket is doing good development. So is it of course that they have not done their investment in 2008, yes then you can say it is maybe a restocking, but then it is catching up with the investment.</p>
          <p>But that is what I see, and the same is a bit also when it comes to the rental companies which are coming back in the picture, which we had not seen in 2009, and which were back in 2010. So that is what my analysis if I look to the figures from Atlas Copco.</p>
          <p>When it comes to competition, it's not so much on the technology where we really feel that we're lagging behind. Of course we can never be happy on that one, and we have a saying in Atlas Copco, there is always a better way even if we have just launched a new machine, we want to do it better because we see opportunities. So on that part on the technology part, I don't see today an obvious threat. Is the other competition, who also have good machines, who have good equipment, yes of course, locally it is. So it is definitely a real competition and it would look a bit special if I make the statement about competition that I don't have. But where we have the toughest &#x2013; say discussions also internally when it comes to competition is primarily in Asia.</p>
          <p>It's also that we are very ambitious there. We are pushing a lot of our attention to that area because we still don't have the same market share as we would have in &#x2013; what we have in Europe. So we can take more and that is also the reason why a lot of our effort is going there and that also some of our management is there now in China and in India. Actually, we ourself traveled to China and India as executive committee to really see are we really up to the standard, but the competition, if I have to say one region, I would say Asia.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. It's Frederic Stahl from UBS. On the subject of aftermarket, can you tell us whether the penetration differs significantly in the emerging market block again compared to the developed world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It definitely does and I think it is one of our Investors Relation presentations where we have done also that comparison. It would be a real surprise, if we would say that we have the same penetration of one-to-one ratio in Switzerland as in China that's not &#x2013; there is still a lot more to take in Asia, if I take it &#x2013; even also in U.S. where we still don't have the same penetration level as we have in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I am to assume that the strong growth you have there now is part of a catch-up rather than a temporary boost after weak 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is both. I think it's also the strong aftermarket. This is also I think our good work, out of the people who are really doing a good work. That is one thing and of course we have not reached 100% one-to-one ratio, so there is still more to take in the aftermarket. And that is the way it works. And also if we look to our strategy, we are close to climbing the service ladder. So we're up expanding our offer, before we were only maybe selling the filters now we are selling a complete, yeah, it's a real service business. And that is the concept what we really work further and further with our customers to create really customer value. And yeah that yield &#x2013; it seems to be that it yield results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally, can I just follow-up on an earlier question? Did you say that a big explanation for your margin expansion year-to-date has been that equipment margins have gone up significantly from where you were the previous peak?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think first you have a better load of the factories, so you have less under absorption that's for sure. And as I mentioned also in a couple of occasions I think we have definitely redesigned a lot of our equipment not only for creating more customer value, but also for cost and of course it generates, yeah it generate a better contribution.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>So, mindful of the time, can we have the last question from the telephone conference and before we let that go anyone that still have questions from the telephone conference. We welcome you to call anyone of us of course after the conference as well, since you didn't have the opportunity to call &#x2013; to ask your questions. But we take one final question then from the telephone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Our final question comes from the line of Arnaud Brossard from Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. I'm lucky, in recent quarters, demand has increased faster than expected, I think, which means your cost base was probably abnormally low. If this is the case, can you please quantify the effect of a likely increase in variable costs in the coming months? That's my first question. And the second one is about your outlook statement. Does it imply that you expect the Q3 sequential trend in demand to continue in the coming months? I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what your outlook statement really means?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think maybe I can give on the outlook and you take the margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's the most difficult, the margins. We give it always to Hans Ola, the most questions, the most difficult one. Now on the outlook, what we want to say is that we see a positive outlook, we see a positive continuation. If you also compare Q2 with Q3 where we see that we have more/less in volume terms between 4% or 5% gone up, if you would take it away from currencies and that is what we more/less see to continue. We should also be, maybe, calibrate a bit as we're comparing with very weak 2009, you cannot expect that it goes on with 30%-40%. I would love to do it and then to stay here next year and to say it goes 30%-40%. We should recalibrate each other a bit on that one, but that is what we see. It is meant as a positive trend, this outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so just to be very clear, it's always &#x2013; the outlook is always trying to give the sequential outlook. But not necessarily exactly trying to pinpoint our orders are in that respect, but looking at the customer activity from where we stand now looking three months ahead, that's how we try to do it, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you asked -we come from a very perhaps, as you said, unnaturally low cost base coming out of the crisis and the restructuring and so on. And whatever words we use for how low it was, it's true of course that we took out a lot of cost and we acknowledge that the company of Atlas Copco, the group has a lot of outsourcing when it comes to the manufacturing of products. So of course there will be variable cost that comes back when the volume comes back from customers. That's for sure.</p>
          <p>What we have tried to say in a couple of questions is that we expect that the very strong flow through of profit from revenue growth that we see in this quarter and the last couple of quarters to be honest, cannot continue forever and that is what we mean. That doesn't mean that costs will start to increase more than revenue or anything like that, but of course there will be an adjustment along those lines.</p>
          <p>So does that mean that margin improvement is never going to happen anymore? Well, that's for the future to tell, and there are other impacts of that. But from this we are confident that the rise of the cost is not uncontrolled. But of course the relative impact on profit cannot stay as high as we have seen the last couple of quarters. I don't know if you want to add anything more to that Ronnie, but.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say, I cannot say better than that &#x2013; than you say it on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>And then may be to strengthen that essay, of course we are not after hunting the top margins and that we are hunting after real value. And that is maybe the statement to close this day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent closing remarks, so we're hunting for value creation. With that remark, from Ronnie Leten, we close the conference. And thank you very much for participating.</p>
