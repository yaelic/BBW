          <p>Welcome to the CN Second Quarter 2010 Financial Results Conference Call.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Robert Noorigian, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Noorigian.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dave , and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2010 financial results. I'd like to remind you again about the comments that have already been made regarding our forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>With us today is Mr. Claude Mongeau, President and Chief Executive Officer; Luc Jobin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Keith Creel, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and J.J. Ruest, Executive Vice-President and Chief Marketing Officer. After the presentation, we'd like to take questions from those of you who are listening on the call. Could you please identify yourself when asking the questions and we'd really like to be fair to everybody, so could you limit yourself one question with one follow-up. Thank you.</p>
          <p>With that, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Claude Mongeau, CN's President and Chief Executive Officer. Claude?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bob, and thank you to all for joining us this afternoon. We're very, very pleased to announce our second quarter results. They are good results. The economic recovery is taking hold and we were able to turn in both solid earnings growth and a strong free cash flow generation on a year-to-date basis. Our EPS for the quarter specifically is $1.13, which is up 38% from last year on a reported basis.</p>
          <p>But if you look at it on an adjusted basis, it's up actually close to 50% on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by the top line, the economy obviously helping, but also our service and our ability with careful planning to handle the business was key. Clearly some sectors, and I just mentioned a few here, J.J will give you more detail, but automotive at 52%, coal at 49% and metals and minerals at 46%, it takes a lot of solid work and careful planning to be able to help your customer handle that kind of growth in a short period, especially coming back from the deep recession that we all faced last year, particularly in the second quarter, actually of 2009.</p>
          <p>So our revenues overall are up 18%, the volumes are up 27% on a car load basis and 15% on an RTM basis. The main difference between the two is mostly around short haul iron ore movements. But both indicators show the strength of the recovery up to now in 2010.</p>
          <p>We are trying to do our best to help our customers with strong supply chain focus and service improvement to accommodate that business growth. And we are doing so at low incremental cost. Our operating ratio is improving quite significantly on a year-over-year basis, little bit more than six points. Keith will give you some of the key details why we were able to do so. Clearly our precision railroading model, our focus on operational excellence and our goal to accommodate business at low incremental cost is clearly coming through, and that reflects itself in the earnings momentum and the improvement at the level of the operating ratio.</p>
          <p>I said earlier our free cash flow was very strong. Indeed, Luc will give you more details, but for the first six months, we are at around $958 million of free cash flow generation, clearly a strong performance, some of it driven by the sale that we were able to do earlier this year. But nevertheless strong, strong free cash flow generation that bodes well on a go-forward basis to our ability to create shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Just turning briefly to the next page in your presentation, I just want to say a few words about how our game plan is unfolding. This is the second quarter that we report as the new executive team here at CN and we are basically firing on all cylinders. Our strategy is working, everything is with precision railroading at the core. But clearly, our focus on accommodating the business at low incremental cost is coming through.</p>
          <p>People were concerned that with added volume, you would see some of the fluidity and velocity metric suffering and that's clearly not what we're seeing. We've been able to continue to improve in this regard and that comes true in terms of our results.</p>
          <p>The more important point is we are improving in terms of velocity and fluidity and key productivity metrics at the same time as we're improving service metrics for our customers. Our focus on first mile, last mile, our focus on supply chain initiatives and our focus on engaging to understand our customers' business is paying dividends and we are continuing to focus in this regard. We call it deeper customer engagement or supply chain innovation. At the end of the day it's about finding ways to work hand-in-hand with your customers so that we can help them grow and as they grow, help us bring the volume, the top line to our bottom line so that we can continue to create shareholder value for many years to come. And at the moment can do so as we accommodate the economic recovery, which we hope will continue despite the uncertainty that it will continue into the balance of the year for 2010. And Luc will give you later a little bit more about how we see the world unfolding for the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>So with this, I will turn it over to the team starting with Keith,</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Claude. As you captured in your comments, solid team execution continues to be a key ingredient in our success story. As the operating guy I'm honored to lead the team that executes this operating model day-to-day. And we do it by ensuring we operate in environment that above all else we protect the safety of our franchise, our employees and the communities we operate in and through. And in turn this environment gives us the sustainable platform that allows us to deliver the superior service our customers deserve and expect. And do it at the same time with tremendous operating leverage that's allowed us to absorb the volume growth we've experienced at a very low incremental cost.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the quarter's financial results they indicate we've had some success in this area. But at CN we realize one thing: financial success is only the output of our effort. So let me take a moment to walk you through some of our key operating metrics in our initiatives.</p>
          <p>So the operational highlight slide you're looking at some of these metrics we share with you each quarter with a small addition I'll mention in a moment about our terminal dwell and training velocity measures that we've added to this portfolio.</p>
          <p>Starting with the upper right side, you can see that we've continued our improvements in train load measured in GTMs per train mile. This is railroad raw productivity at its best. Our highly safe and efficient eco-friendly trains which I've heard some refer to as long trains drive the best use of our crews, our locomotors' fuel and our network capacity resources and investments.</p>
          <p>The 7% year-over-year improvement you see was driven by careful management of our train starts as our traffic started to ramp up, continued to ramp up through the year. Our distributive power initiative continues to pay benefits as more and more of our traffic is moved in our safe high-efficient DP trains. Approximately 35% of our road fleet is now DP equipped and that number will move to about 50% by the time we finish our 2010 and 2011 locomotive plans.</p>
          <p>This goes hand-in-hand with our rifle shot capacity investments, speed enhancements in our network, which I'll discuss in a moment as well. The net result is more traffic on the same number of trains, which obviously provides the tremendous operating leverage that we benefit from.</p>
          <p>Below that you can see that our locomotive productivity, measured as GTMs per available horsepower, continued its record improvement as well. This is a reflection of the increase in train loads that I just mentioned and our culture of continuously matching our locomotive fleet inventory to the workload at hand.</p>
          <p>And like any railroad, a lot of our expense is generated in our yards. This represents a significant opportunity for delays, misconnections and service issues. So this is an area that we have always focused on and we will always focus on. We measure the results here in a measure we call cars handled per yard switching hour. The key levers include: minimizing your car inventories, you continuously adapt your service plan with a view to minimize your car handling; you match your yard resources to the demand and your overall network strategy that we've deployed, which maximizes the workload at our low cost operating or processing centers, Winnipeg, Toronto, Chicago Kirk Yard and of course Memphis.</p>
          <p>Next is car velocity, which we measure in car miles per car day. As you can see this metric is basically flat year-over-year. There's a couple of things here that are happening with respect to mix. Some of the growth we've had with some of our slower moving fleets, which impacts that number and also the fact that we spent all the second quarter of 2009 literally stuffing over 25,000 cars into storage with the economy. And since then of course the ways that we've added service back in 2010 we've been very judicious with it. So you've not seen the stepped improvements, so that's driving the flat year-over-year comparison.</p>
          <p>Having said that, the main reason we look at car velocity day-to-day is a barometer of our proper inventory as far our fleet management. And here I can tell you that the team did a respectable job. J.J.'s going to tell you in a minute, we moved about 15% more RTMs in the quarter versus last year, with active online inventory that was only 5% higher than 2009. And at the same time, our car order fulfillment rate was up two points year-over-year as well as we focused on selling our short lead time orders.</p>
          <p>All right, in the note on the right-hand side of the page you'll see that commencing this quarter we've adopted the industry standard AER measurements for terminal dwell and for train velocity. In line with our change, our measures are available directly on the AER web site along with those of our peers.</p>
          <p>You can see from the time series that our efforts to drive out all types of failures, eliminate network bottlenecks and increase track speeds to key locations are all having the desired effect. So this year for example we're going to continue spending two signings at our Edmonton and Prince Rupert corridor, two others on the Winnipeg to Chicago corridor, one in Northern Ontario and at the same time build a much needed bypass track around our yard in Saskatoon. And we've also phased investment program to increase our track speeds in the Superior area, which will allow our trains to tackle some of our most challenging grades on our system with our initial train velocity.</p>
          <p>Operational overview. I hope you would agree that this team of railroaders has continued to deliver on the operating side. These productivity metrics we produced allow us to tell J.J. and his team to keep selling and we'll move the business at a very low incremental cost, and we'll harvest it to the bottom line as we recover through this economy.</p>
          <p>In line with Claude's leadership and our collaborative operations marketing approach, this operating team is not satisfied with just helping J.J. and his team grow in step with the recovery. We want more business than that. We want more customers, we want more from each customer and we're prepared to earn at one carload at a time. So both myself and my operating team have cleared time in our schedules to work directly with the marketing team and engage with our key customer accounts.</p>
          <p>You probably read about some of the supply chain collaboration agreements that CN has pioneered under Claude's leadership as well. Making these collaboration agreements are more &#x2013; these more than just words on paper require a significant matter of working commitment. Rest assured myself and my team are directly engaged with our supply chain partners while at the same time standing side by side with our marketing peers and the key individual accounts.</p>
          <p>As far as our pipeline of productivity initiatives, those continue. We add to them. These include car shop consolidation. This quarter we closed the car shop at Centralia. We'll close Fond Du Lac in August. Our locomotive fleet plan that we've talked about previously has come together with 62-8s now online, giving us about a 15% fuel efficiency gain over the locomotives that they've replaced. DP of course continues to be a key piece of that strategy.</p>
          <p>So with that said, I'll turn it over to J.J. for the marketing review.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. Thank you, Keith. If you could join me on Page 10, the graph of the carload graph. The second quarter really began where we left it off in the first quarter and we continue sequential improvement growth in our volume. We've had 27% sequential carload growth from the first quarter of this year. We've had 27% carload growth from the second quarter of last year and this really reflect the stronger than expected recovery in the North American GDP and industrial production.</p>
          <p>It is also reflecting of the impact in the marketplace of our improved services, some of them Keith mentioned, like for example First Mile, <mark type="inaudible" /> sector, the scheduled service that we offer to our bulk customers as well as our very strong focus on continued velocity across the supply chain, and that's modeled just when it's on the railroad.</p>
          <p>And not to say the least, we are all engaging with customers. You've heard Claude, Keith, Luc and myself, and all the senior leaders in operation and marketing spending increasing amount of time with customers and understanding their needs and what creates value for them.</p>
          <p>If we go to Page 11, Slide 11, you'll see the number for the second quarter. During the second quarter, with the support of our customers, our revenue were up 26% on an exchange adjusted basis. If we break this down again on an FX adjusted basis for the quarter, it is explained as follows: 15% of the increase in revenue was related to volume, rail volume, more reflected by the RTM workload which was up 15%. RTM is a much better measure of our volume due to the significant increase in our iron ore business, which is relatively short haul. This is our other carload business.</p>
          <p>We have also increased our revenue from price. Same-store price remain about 3%. However when one adjusts for the Canadian regulated grain and our legacy contract, which have some RCF-type price initiative, our core pricing would add in up about 4%. We have also obtained 4% increase on our fuel surcharge revenue because of the significant higher WTI and highway diesel pricing compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Also because of our industry leading 90% universal application of our fuel surcharge program, which really is up to 98% when you include regulated grain as well as the RCF legacy contract that we have. Other revenue were also contributing to the total, contributing 4%. And these other revenue were driven by our vessel and dock, mostly iron ore as well as significant turnaround in our automotive business, auto port as well as transport activities as it relates to carload.</p>
          <p>Now going to the major segments, starting with manufacturing. The manufacturing sector contributed $260 million of growth on an exchange adjusted basis for the quarter. Petroleum chemical was up 15% mostly because of improvement in industrial production and refined product.</p>
          <p>Metals and mineral was up a whopping 46%, but that's because typically of the major impact of iron ore, but also because of the continued recovery of the steel segment, which is now running up and around at 70%, it kind of went up to close to 74, went down back a bit, but fluctuating at a good pace.</p>
          <p>All of this has translated in very high increase in carload, not only for iron ore but also flatroad product and long product. Also, our success in metals and minerals are related to Keith's team's effort and focus on the First Mile, which has also produced some extra point of market share against our trucking competitor in the steel market.</p>
          <p> Price  product as up 16%, in part because of the restocking activities in North America as well as exports to China. Automotive was up 52% because of the stronger production level from the CN assembly plant that we have in Ontario and Michigan as well as our entry in the Chicago dealer market by the opening of an auto port back in <mark type="inaudible" /> Chicago at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Our bulk segment was up $73 million on an exchange adjusted basis, of which coal contributed 29%. We have very strong offshore demand from China, Korea and Japan for Canadian met coal as well as Canadian oil sand pet coke product. Our U.S. thermal coal carload have also increased 19% in the quarter, which was a nice thing to see.</p>
          <p>Grain and fertilizer was up 6% on the back of increased demand for fertilizer, mostly potash but also corn. However, this was offset during the quarter by volume of export feed grain, mainly oat and wheat.</p>
          <p>Finally, but not least our intermodal business was up $91 million on an exchange adjusted basis in the quarter of for 25%. We had very strong import and export on the West Coast in June. The Port of Vancouver volume reached a level similar to 2008, which was nice to see. Our activities at Rupert have also seen some new all-time high with its bigger three vessel per week services.</p>
          <p>Repair volume on the domestic side have continued to improved, reflecting the improvement of the Canadian economy, but also as well as the traction of our very strong customers' engagement in the marketplace. All in all we had a great quarter, which we're pleased with it and pleased with support from our customers.</p>
          <p>If we move to Slide 12 just for a short outlook, on a manufacturing sector we expect carload to remain on the same page or the same range. The North American industrial production anticipated to remain in the same range. We see some mill in the case of forest products to come back, whether it's for lumber or wood pulp, which would increase carload available to us coming from our preferred customers. We also see some ramping up of construction aggregate, especially in Northern Alberta where the oil sands and activities in oil and gas is coming back definitely this year versus last year as well as the result of our customer's engagement as we further roll out First Mile, Last Mile initiative in the carload market.</p>
          <p>On the bulk side, the price and demand for offshore met coal is very strong as well as pet coke. A long summer has helped thermal coal in the U.S., which is expected to continue for the balance of the year. The Canadian grain seedings were very low this year as related to this past, but we expect the crop therefore to be lower. We've had a good carryover from the last year and when you combine that with our new scheduled grain service which will be this time ready for the beginning of the crop, we expect the impact of the smaller seedings to be mostly in our case of CN, affecting us in 2011.</p>
          <p>The U.S. crop is promising, <mark type="inaudible" /> late this fall. We're on standby to be able to handle one of our customers will be receiving us orders from their own customers.</p>
          <p>Finally in intermodal, the Asian container import in July continued to be very strong as well as the export of goods and empty containers in July also very strong. And the Canadian retail volume continue to improve steadily as our customers' business expands and we continue to focus on service in an environment where we're competing with truck and truck supply is getting tighter.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we are positive about the business prospect for the second half of the year. We are definitely gaining momentum with our strong customers' engagement as well as supply chain approach initiative with key stakeholders like port and terminal. For the total year we're looking for volume growth in mid-teen area. Luc?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, J.J. Well, it's a pleasure to be reporting great results for the second quarter and certainly as well for the first half of 2010. I think we set out, we're achieving what we set out to do, which was to leverage the economic recovery and our results are showing that in spades. As Claude pointed out we're -- we have been making progress on all key performance metrics whether they're operating productivity, service-related in terms of providing the great service to our customers and our financial results for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>We're delivering adjusted EPS of $1.13 for the second quarter and that's a 49% improvement over last year. Indeed when you adjust for foreign currency you actually get 59% improvement over last year. As J.J. pointed out we actually made some strong progress in all parts of our business and this was obviously comparing to last year, which was the trough of the recession.</p>
          <p>Our revenues came in at $2.1 billion, which is up about 18% versus last year and that's 20% on an FX adjusted basis. We also saw growth in all of our commodity groups and our RTM as was previously mentioned increased 25%, our carloads 27%.</p>
          <p>Our operating ratio was a low 61.2% in the quarter, which was a full six-point improvement. And for the first half of 2010 our operating ratio stands at 65.1%, which is a full four-point improvement over last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to expenses for the second quarter. Our total expenses came in just under 1.3 billion, which was up 7% versus 2009 and on an FX adjusted basis that translates to about 15% increase. The major area, category of increase was in the fuel, fuel line which was mostly due to higher prices as the WTI went from $60 last year to $78 this year. As well the volume obviously was a big contributor and that was partly offset by continued improvements in terms of our fuel productivity where we had about a 3% improvement in second quarter.</p>
          <p>Our labor cost went up about 6% on an FX adjusted basis versus 2009. The principal reason for the change was wages which have increased and a little bit more overtime. On the other hand, our manpower was up as well a little bit 1%. So a very small increase in terms of overall manpower. 1% overall, however we probably had about 3% in the running trades.</p>
          <p>In terms of other changes, casualty and others was up a little bit from last year, an increase of about $30 million in the second quarter, mostly due to some higher legal and environmental costs across several small items. However, I should point out that on the first half of the year, we're tracking with last year and we're about only $4 million above last year on an FX adjusted basis.</p>
          <p>It's important to go back and just keep in mind that these financial results are stellar, these expense levels in terms of the business that we've been able to accommodate are exceptional. The train load actually went up 7% to about 8,000 gross tons. For train, our cars handled per yard hour has gone up 9% and our labor productivity in terms of million GTMs was up a solid 13%, just exceptional productivity results from Keith and his team.</p>
          <p>Turning over to free cash flow. As Claude pointed out, $958 million of free cash generated in the first half of 2010. And that's almost $500 million more than last year. Obviously, this is attributable to better operating results as well as lower cash taxes in Canada and the sale of our Oakville subdivision to GO Transit in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>We continue to accomplish our objective in terms of repurchasing our stock. Our share buyback program, we've now completed slightly over half. So we have about 7.7 million shares which have been bought back in the first half of the year. We have a net debt position of about $5.6 billion and that is net of about $900 million of cash, which we had on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to our updated financial outlook for 2010. As you can see, we have very, very strong first half results. And we expect the economy to continue on its gradual course of recovery. We are mindful of some of the concerns in terms of some parts of the economy and we do expect the pace of growth to be lower in the second half, simply because we also were seeing some of the start of the recovery back in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>We don't, however, at this point, and J.J. I think covered that in quite some detail, we were not seeing any slowdown in terms of our traffic and we do not expect a double-dip economic scenario at this point. On that basis, our revised guidance is for adjusted diluted EPS, we believe we have the scope to achieve an increase of approximately 25% in 2010 over 2009, which was at the $3.24. As well, we see our 2010 free cash flow to stand in the range of about 1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Now that's as well reflecting the very strong cash that we generated in the first half of the year, our increased earning forecast, the proceeds that we realized on the sale of our Oakville subdivision as I mentioned in the first quarter and lower cash taxes in Canada. We're using this opportunity as we expect to make an additional voluntary contribution to our pension plan in the order of $250 million.</p>
          <p>This will come &#x2013; and to improve the funded position of our plan as we feel that it is prudent given certainly the less than stellar equity returns that we have seen and the prospects for a continued low interest rate environment, at least for the short term. All of that will translate into solid shareholder value creation.</p>
          <p>On that note, I'll turn it back over to you, Claude.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Keith, J.J. and Luc. As you can see or hear, clearly this leadership team is clicking. We are delivering on our game plan. We are trying our best to help our customers accommodate the recovery and from our side, we are leveraging it by accommodating at low cost. Very strong team execution, we're focused on our mid-to-long term game plan with a range of initiatives, many of which are focused on engaging with our customers and finding ways to continuously improve our business from the platform of operational excellence that has made CN what it is.</p>
          <p>So our focus is on keeping the momentum, I think the guidance that Luc is giving you for the balance of the year if the economy holds on its path of recovery is something we can deliver. And if we succeed at that, we should have a strong finish to what is the first year for the transition of this new leadership team.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. If I can, just on the guidance on the cash flow side, it seems a little bit low considering what you guys generated in the first half of the year. I mean you've almost done 1 billion already and I get that you're going to be paying out another $250 million. Do you have more capital spending planned for the back half of the year than you did in the front half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean we have about $1 billion or so of capital spending, which will be taking place in the second half. I mean this is consistent with the 1.6 billion capital program that we've laid out. And if you look in the results we've got about 0.5 billion or so done in the first part of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that makes sense. So it's the extra CapEx plus the additional 250 payout and that'll make up the difference, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. Thank you. I appreciate that. My next question, you guys obviously have had a little bit of a slowdown or at least a work stoppage in the Port of Montr&#xE9;al. Wonder if you can you give us an update on where we stand right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the parties at the Port of Montr&#xE9;al are in discussions as we speak and we are hopeful that they will find a resolution to the conflict and the labor dispute in short order. My comments would be the following: I think it just goes to show how important railroads and port infrastructure are to the economic backbone of both countries in North America. And it just puts a lot of emphasis on making sure the parties find ways come to agreements without such labor disputes. I'm hopeful that they will do so in short order. In the meantime, for us the impact is not really material. We are trying to help our customers and all the business. Some of them are moving to other ports including Halifax and we are working in partnership with terminal operators and other stakeholders to try to minimize the impact to cargo owners of this labor dispute.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Claude, what I thought interesting was that when you go in your customer site today, this took sort of second place to a little blurb that you guys had put up there about hey, CN is ready for peak season and listing through sort of all the steps that you've taken to prepare for the additional freight coming on. Could you talk about that? Do you have a lot of shippers calling up asking if you guys are prepared for this peak season? And just talk about the expectations and the mood this year versus maybe the prior three?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think our customers are able to see what this team is able to deliver as we speak. I mean, I just go back to what J.J. was explaining to you. Our overseas business for instance, that's international containers, has been a &#x2013; it's been a very, very strong surge for the last two months or two months and a half on both coasts, both on the West Coast in the Vancouver and Prince Rupert, but also here in Montr&#xE9;al and Halifax across the board. So we are showing our ability to accommodate that business. It's not without challenges, we've had some hiccups inside our terminals for instance, in terms of our ability to serve the trucking community in short timeframes with the so-called car time and other small issues to that effect. But what our customers are seeing is that we are able to accommodate very strong growth while improving service levels and that bodes well for the balance of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, guys. Thank you for the time as always. I'll let somebody else have at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hey, good afternoon. I wanted to ask about the OR. So if we think about the Investor Day and kind of some of your longer-term targets there, you're already better than that here in the second quarter. And I realize that this can bounce around a bit. But how should we think about the fact that you're better than sort of the longer-term guidance? Does this mean that you're going to try to just grow the earnings faster here, even if it means higher OR or how do we reconcile those two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Bill, let me put it to you this way. Our CFO has given you guidance from kind of sustainable mid-60 operating ratio. If you look at the first half of the year, it's exactly where we are at around 65%. I stand by his guidance for the long term, but we'll certainly do everything we can as a team to beat it if we can. And for sure, the second quarter results and our ability to accommodate the initial rebound of growth at very low incremental cost bodes well. At some point though, you do get step functions and that initial capacity available has to be lapped out and you have to add resources more in sync with volume growth. So we'll do our best to meet or beat the guidance that we've given and over the long term, we'll see whether we're able to do so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So along those lines, how should we be thinking about the head count as your volumes grow from here? Could it stay flat on a full-year basis in 2010? Or is it sort of no, we've already hit that inflection point, we've got to start adding back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our headcounts are up 1% in the second quarter with about 3% increase in our running trade. And we are doing everything to stay ahead of the curve and we have opportunities for productivity gain in certain areas and we will make sure we have running trades and locomotive engineers ready to accommodate the business going forward. So I think the model we've discussed is something that would have us grow our workforce in line with the business volume over time, keeping in mind that we're trying to accommodate the business with productivity gains and the growth will not be proportional.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you for the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I actually had a follow-up on the labor question. Is there a contractual increase in wages that kicks in in the second half? Or what do we expect for the balance of this year and next year on the wage rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean we have the collective agreements which have been adopted, and so we're looking at roughly, I mean ballpark about 3% growth in terms of wages. But there's no significant change in the second half versus the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only change we may have would be if we were to settle the TTRC. That's it, and that's going to be second half on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you had a 3% increase in the first half versus a year ago, yet you managed to keep wage and benefit costs flat year-over-year despite that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually our &#x2013; if you look at it on an exchange adjusted basis, our labor expense is up about 6%, Chris. And 3% or so is wage, a little bit more from adding overtime and the rest is the slight increase in workforce and noise around other aspects of labor expense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that makes sense. And actually a similar question with regard to the effective FX; how much of the difference between RTMs and carloads was FX versus mix or other factors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there shouldn't be any impact there Chris because our carload is car load, this is physical count. And we have more carload growth because we had a lot of short haul movements, particularly the iron ore. Our RTMs again are physical counts of the movement of goods over a distance for the tonnage, and that's up 15%. So both measures are not really impacted by the FX conversion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, wouldn't that have depressed the revenue ton miles relative to the amount of freight that you moved though?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the revenue &#x2013; per revenue ton mile, it would, but not the RTM versus carload.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Jacob Bout with CIBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I had a question on pricing renewals. You talk a little bit about pricing going into the second half of the year, how much has been &#x2013; of your book has been repriced and just how the customers are responding. Are you seeing a little less pushback with the rebounding economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A high percent of it is already put to bed, I won't provide specific numbers. And the &#x2013; obviously the customers are still coming through the recession, the early days of the recovery. They too are putting price increase to their own markets, some of them are very significant like you've seen in the coal market. Some other markets in the early days of changing their price. So really gets down to the value we create and who we compete with, and right now we're guiding to be able to get price increase on a steady basis in the range of the 3.5% guidance from the end of the year as Luc has provided in talking to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe my next question then would be on the flooding that we've seen in Western Canada. Can you talk a little bit about how that impacted the second quarter? And then how does that change your outlook as far as grain volumes going into 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the grain, the flooding in Western Canada, obviously the seeding was less this year, number one. Number two, the carryover from last year's crop to the next year's crop is higher because the wheat board has not been able to sell as much of its product as its first thought in the last winter and last spring. And then when you add to that our desire with our new scheduled grain service to already start early this year with our program, we think that for the next six months, we should be all in, we should be able to be close to what we did last year on the volume. But when you get to the second half of next year, which is the second half of the crop, then it was &#x2013; well, we'll see the impact of the fact there is going to be less growth coming in this fall. So short-term impact this year limited, but we'll see the impact next year. I don't know how we'd see that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just add to that though, Jacob, obviously with wheat prices going up, it's not just Canada having less production, but also droughts in Russia. So with wheat prices being up, the fact that the wheat board have available carry to sell into the fall should help cushion the impact of the lower production for 2010. But as J.J. said, the early part of 2011 is when we should see lower grain volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as the second quarter was concerned, was there any impact with your competitors' main line flooding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, from an operation standpoint, maybe Keith, you want to explain what we did to help CP, but for us it was not nearly an impact like it was for CP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, not a material impact to us at all. In fact, we work closely with CP to allow them to continue service taking detour trains probably upwards of close to 10 days over our main line out in Alberta going through Edmonton to Winnipeg and a couple of other routes that they run. But certainly we work close with them and allowed them. And I think at the end of the day, they would say this and they told us this, hopefully, helps them recover their network, which at the end of the day is good for the industry and good for our relationship and good for all the freight that we interchange together and as we work together on a go-forward basis. Someday that shoe may be on the other foot. So we've always tried to approach it from that respect. We're not going to kick somebody when they're down. They're our partners and we're going to help them as much as we can.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Ed Wolfe with Wolfe Trahan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you break out the reported yields, the revenue per car loads in terms of the impact from price, fuel, mix and FX?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the price, we got 3% price increase. So when you take into account that we still have some RCF, some grain legacy. On the fuel we've got 4%, our revenue came in from the fuel surcharge, the change in the BTI and highway diesel. And on the volume we got 15% as we mentioned earlier all related to RTM. And then there's the last 4% which comes from other revenue, the revenue which is not rail therefore does not contribute to the RTM, but nevertheless significant revenue for us. So that's all operation, dock, auto port and the trans load. And that generated an increase of 4% of the total of 26 on an adjusted basis that we talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if I want to look at the total carloads yields down 9.5% year-over-year and price is up 3 and fuel is up 4, what's the impact of FX in mix to get me to negative 9.5? What am I missing here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you should better look at it from an RTM standpoint, Ed, because from a carload standpoint you have a huge mix impact from the short haul moves of iron ore that are up on a significant basis on a year-over-year basis. So I think if you take the 26% revenue growth and you break it down on a per RTM basis, that's the best place to look to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so I guess the answer is there's a big impact from mix and we've got to think about it the other direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. The difference between carload and RTM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'd be happy to help you further on an offline basis, but I think that RTM is the better gauge of volume and how to break down the key pieces of revenue growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Claude, when you think about the operating ratio, seasonally there's not a reason why third quarter should be worse than second quarter, is there? Or anything that you can think of other than a sudden change in demand or something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, take the good and the bad that comes to you in the quarter. It's tough to predict what the third quarter will be until it's done, but there are no major differences between Q2 and Q3. The more important drivers that would have a seasonal impact are winter, our capital program and those aspects are not very different from Q3 to Q2. But in the second quarter we had a tremendous amount of growth and we are accommodating that early phase of growth at very low incremental cost because we have the available capacity now. Our ability to continue to sustain this level of low incremental cost diminishes over time and that should start in Q3 and Q4 of this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And are you hearing from customers anything about inventory one way or another, whether it's above normal levels, whether there's restocking going on, any concern about that from anybody that they don't have enough inventory or that they're going to need less inventory going forward either way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've seen a lot of inventory replenishment in the first six months of the year and we believe that unless there is a contraction in the economy that the continued demand should be helping our customers to continue to drive the volume going forward. There is obviously a lot of chatter, Ed, and it's tough to call whether demand will falter or whether other issues will creep up and if people will have to trim production and start to be more cautious about inventory. At this point in time, we don't see that and we are hopeful that the balance of the year will continue on that pace.</p>

Can you talk a little bit about the sustainability of that kind of increase? I know that in the past you've been running, back in 2000, through the years, you've been much lower than the 250 run rate you're getting now. Is 250 the right rate to run that forward on a quarterly basis now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Other revenues.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Other revenues? Other revenues for us are really in large part related to the carload revenue. When carload goes up, these other revenues tend to follow it because they are linked to it like iron ore, automotives, transport activities, some freight forwarding. So right now maybe because of the &#x2013; how low they were last year and how related &#x2013; how are they related to iron ore they were significantly higher. Iron ore right now effective is running very, very strong. And I can't see &#x2013; maybe there's another 10% in iron ore that we could see, that is if the mine can actually run at those rates. So...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On a more normalized basis, is that closer to &#x2013; that's lower than the 250, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think on a normalized basis going forward, we should see other revenues subject to iron ore continue at this pace or in that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But on a year-over-year increase we're not going to see a 40% increase going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay, that's great. Second question here also for J.J., I know there was a question on pricing and how &#x2013; did you reference how much you've booked for 2011, given your current contracts that you've already negotiated so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I did not. And we're not providing that specific information to our &#x2013; publicly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, how about in terms of your average length of contract still around two years, two to three years, is that a fair statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have the whole range, just tariff, one-year contract, two-year contract, long-term contract when it's valuable. The length of the contract is maybe at this point slightly drifting up and that's because there would be reasons to do that if a customer is making major capital investment or the likes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Tom Wadewitz with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Wanted to ask another question on the other revenue, which I guess you indicated that's going to keep going at a pretty strong pace. Does that tend to be similar to the overall margin? Or is that a lot lower margin? Or how would you think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually when we look at these other revenue we also track same-store pricing for that, we track volume, how much is volume related, the same way as we manage our other business we also look at operating ratio. The operating ratio for these other revenue in total is not at the same level of the railroad, but at the same time the capital investment in these other activities is quite different. So they're different business, they're as profitable, but they're not the same type of a capital investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You also have to recognize, Tom, in this are passenger revenues for instance, the VIA revenues, the other revenues, it's all other revenues. And some are asset intensive, some are not asset intensive. I think they are on a different basis than the normal rail revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, so it's different type of revenue obviously, but it's not going to be accretive to OR, if anything that would be a slight drag on your OR in the quarter having the big move up in other revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it would be actually, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's see. In terms of the per worker costs, I know it gets tricky to model because you've got quite a &#x2013; you've got currency and you've got stock-based comp and other things. But how would you look at that going forward in terms of the year-over-year change in per worker comp and  benefits for like the third quarter, fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you said it yourself, Tom. It depends a lot on stock-based compensation and a lot of other moving parts. I think the important point for you to remember is other than those volatile items, which are very difficult to predict, but for which you have good guidance, $1 up on the stock price tends to add 4 million or 5 million of stock-based compensation. And the other sensitivity that we've disclosed and informed you about, the other pieces is wage increases in the range of 3% and whatever our workforce addition will be going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good afternoon. I wondered if you could tell us how many train starts you added in the quarter and just how that compared to the 15% increase in RTM that you accommodated in the quarter? And give us some sense of your ability to add volume to your existing intermodal and merchandised trains, recognizing that I'm asking you to make a generalization there because it is going to vary by corridor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Train starts up about 7% with the volume that we saw quarter-to-quarter. So quite solid job of absorbing a lot of that volume, just as train linked up, train flowed up significantly. And the second part of the question was how much more, is that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, how much capacity do you have to continue adding cars to your existing intermodal and merchandised train starts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just looking at the averages, this is not a perfect science. But effectively, you've got a 10,000-foot railroad and if your average train length is 7,200 feet, I mean that tells you that in some corridors, it'll be more, quite a bit more in some corridors that &#x2013; probably the most restrictive or the most constrained corridors, and constrained's probably not the appropriate word, I'd say at least 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then for J.J, I think you made some reference to this in your prepared comments. But you referred to sort of a trial at your Analyst Day in the steel industry to see if you could increase your market share by being a bit more flexible in terms of your car order lead times. Can you just kind of speak to the early results there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the early results are positive. I mean like maybe other &#x2013; unlike other railroad, our market share of some of the inbound, outbound, West Coast and steel mill is quite limited. On your look of the outside of a steel mill, it's mostly truck as opposed to rail. So it's not so much of a question whether the steel mill are running at 65 or 75% operating rates, but more of a question, can we respond in time with our product. So we've actually reduced the lead time for a steel mill to order a car, we'll call those shorter lead times, the guarantee car holder process. We're also &#x2013; we mentioned a lot of us focus on our First Mile, Last Mile, that came the First Mile. And yes, we have gained points of share out of steel mills when it comes to CN versus the trucking competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Still early days, but I can tell you one thing, customers are trying out and it's a positive sign. So if we can respond with flexibility, hopefully over time they will trust us with more of their business.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Good afternoon. Just coming back to the yields, revenue per carload if I can for a second, intermodal and coal were so robust including the currency relative to kind of some of the others that you noted had mix. Is that because coal is more in the U.S. and therefore you're just looking straight up? Or were there some contracts that got renewed? Just wondering why the large differentiation's there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's all mix related. Distance of haul, more business for one account versus the other account. So it's all about mix, mix of customers, mix of length of haul. All contracts are renewed with some increase and it's about the mix of business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've been at &#x2013; on an effort to price to the value of our services for many years now. And so by now we tend to have our pricing guidance and there's much less variance around that 3 to 4% price. And so sometimes if we have a little bit more opportunity because we create value, it might be on the upper end or slightly higher than that. Other times when customers have difficulty or the competition with the alternative is a little tougher, we might be a little bit at the lower end or slightly below, but our pricing is in that span of 2 to 5% with very few instances above that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wonderful. And then if I look at the coal though, is that something like that maybe more met coal that you've gained? Can you talk a little bit about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually this quarter, the second quarter we've actually seen an increase in both met coal in Canada as well as terminal coal in U.S. Both market have generated for us increase in volume. And in our Canadian coal market you also see into that varying into those results 10 petroleum coke, which when we published coal there's also some pet coke into that. And pet coke from Canada comes from basically Fort McMurray and goes to the coast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; J.J., when you were going over your review, I thought you said something about 3% on same-store sales and then you threw out 4%. Was that a currency adjusted for that 3%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The difference between the 3% price increase on same store and the 4% is if we were to normalize, if you wish, for the Canadian regular grain, which right now in second quarter, we have a 7% decrease versus last year as well as the fact that we do have some legacy contract that goes back to acquisition of railroad that we did over the years which are related to RCF, which obviously now are negative and eventually these index will turn vastly positive. It's really 4% when you take out RCF and grain, but it's really because they are in the portfolio, that's what it is, it is right now 3%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wonderful. And then in the casualty line, it was obviously an improvement from last quarter. Is there anything in there other than Keith's improved operations, any actuarial gains or anything in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last question. Volumes, it sounded, J.J., when you were going through the numbers that you were feeling pretty good about where things are going. I just want to understand if that was just kind of as you looked toward peak season? Or is this kind of even the economic environment beyond that and around that that you're still feeling the strength continuing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we look at our weekly carload, we can't quite necessarily relate to all of what we read in newspaper because we're still moving very strongly the overseas business, the domestic business is holding up, the manufacturing sector all-in seems to be holding up. Our customers on the overseas side, I met a couple of those recently, are feeling very good for the third quarter because already we're in late July so we already have a month. And what's coming at us in August is obviously already on the dock somewhere in China waiting to be coming in. So I mean they have visibility to that. So the question is really toward the fourth quarter, and then we'll see in the fourth quarter, I mean the fourth quarter is a little off in terms of some of these things we'll see if the proof will be in the pudding as to what happens there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I wanted to ask a little question about intermodal, you talked about the surge. I know Prince Rupert has its own dynamic. But really just trying to figure out what's driving the kind of intermodal growth we're seeing, kind of across the industry. Can you help us think through the factors here? How long does the inventory restocking provide a tailwind? Are there shifts from trucks accelerating for any reason? Are there certain categories of goods within intermodal that you think are really driving some of the outside growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The import is mostly related to the economy in North America and Canada and the U.S. Vancouver has seen a record in June all in, we've seen a record. Rupert is combination, mostly U.S. market and therefore potentially share related as opposed to economy related. On the East Coast of CN, Montr&#xE9;al and Halifax, it's not really shared but it's kind of steady eddy in terms of what activities our customers are seeing. The export business is actually up on the West Coast because there's more container available. We could have seen an export business in Canada in the in the first quarter but there were not enough container coming in to create a capacity for containers going out. So now that we have this tsunamis of cost containers that came in May and June, all the shipping line on those containers back to China, either they're paying to move them empty or ideally they want to get some freight into it, which the Canadian and manufacturers and all that keep talking pulp, lumber, grain products and the like. So all happy to try to get a deal the shipping line to put some goods into it and to going back.</p>
          <p>Domestic freight, a different story. We compete with truck. Truck market has capacity issues, cost issues. And this is a place where our product may be as much of a difference on how we fare as opposed to the overall market strength itself. We've put a lot of focus on improving both our domestic and overseas product and our customers are reacting positively to that better product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, that's helpful, thanks. And just as another one, just maybe we have an asked in awhile about the export potash opportunity, I know it's not for awhile in terms of when things come up. But what do you have the capacity for, what do you need to do to increase capacity and maybe just touch on the overall opportunity of export potash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not specifically talking potash. We have export capacity for a lot of product, whether it's manufacturing, anything that wants to go west, west like Killam, Rupert, our rail line in our view have had &#x2013; they under-utilize, and I think Keith can probably comment better than me on that. But we do have a lot of network capacity to move a lot of stuff going west. After that it's a question of locomotive, which you buy as you need them and people which you hire as you need them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And last mile activity in this instance. People ask, often it's the waterfront capacity that's the bottleneck, whether it's the terminal in Vancouver or the new terminal in Rupert. And so we will be there to accommodate growth as it comes in all those bulk commodities. We feel privileged to have access to both Vancouver and the Port of Prince Rupert in terms of long-term growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And these...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there's nothing specific you need to do to do export potash specifically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, because typically export potash moves in customer cars and we have the rail line capacity. The issue is terminal capacity and where will the customer send the business.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Sal Vitale on for Jeff Kauffman. I have a question, just looking at the incremental margins, I calculate an incremental margin for the second quarter of about 74%. Just looking at expense line items, you talked a little bit about labor earlier. What about like purchase services and for example equipment rents? I see purchased services down 1%, so FX adjusts probably something like up 5, 6, 7%. Is that something that's a level that's sustainable given the carload growth of what, 27% and RPMs up 15%? How should we look at that for the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, specifically on purchased services, you're right. I mean, actually when we do an FX adjusted for the second quarter, that's actually up 5%. And as far as the balance of the year is concerned, we feel pretty good. I mean again, some of these things move in step functions, but we feel that we've got the capacity and we can absorb some additional volume without necessarily seeing a proportional increase in our costs. So we'll have to see how the business gets layered on, but we feel that that's actually not a bad run rate for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Does that also apply to, for example equipment rents?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Equipment rents actually was quite favorable. I mean we were looking at an improvement of 6%. Now I think that one may be more difficult to keep at that level.</p>

          <p>We'll have to see, but I think that may be a little tougher there.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then just following up on labor, as you spoke about earlier, what &#x2013; did you mention what head count levels we should expect for the second half of the year?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we said we will continue &#x2013; subject to growth going forward, we will continue to hire running trades in line with business volume. And in the other categories, replace our attrition, but try to continue to gain productivity. So I think the second quarter performance which add a 3% increase in running trades and a 1% increase in the workforce overall is not a bad model on a go-forward basis.</p>
