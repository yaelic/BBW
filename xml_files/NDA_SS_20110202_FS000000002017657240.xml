I just would like to remind you to state your name and who you represent when you ask questions later on, since this is also webcasted. So Christian Clausen, CEO and Group President of Nordea, will start by giving you a presentation on the results. And after that we will have a Q&amp;A session, a shorter Q&amp;A session, where also Fredrik Rystedt, CFO; and Ari Kaperi, CRO, will be present. After that, we will have an analysts' questions session down in Nordea Salon and we will have journalists' questions as always. So you are most welcome.</p>
          <p>And please, Christian Clausen, CEO and Group President of Nordea.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jan, and welcome to this Q4 press meeting. I am proud to present our Q4 result and the full-year result of course. And the key message is that 2010 has been a very important year for Nordea; we call it a milestone. We came strong out of the crisis, and one year ago we launched our customer, our growth and efficient initiatives, as I've been talking about throughout the year, and they are clearly delivering. We have strengthened our market position, more customers, more business activity and stronger position. And we have increased our income and operating results. And we have also prepared well to the new regulation. We've strengthened our capital, but most importantly our liquidity and funding positions. So, in lot of areas we have actually improved our position. So, we like to call 2010 actually a milestone on our journey towards a great Nordea.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the numbers; first the trends. All the areas are green, reflecting increase in income &#x2013; net interest income. Loan loss is clearly down; operating profit up to record levels; risk-adjusted profit up; and the number of customers clearly up. If you just take a few numbers from the release you've seen, I'd like to highlight that actually our full-year operating profit is &#x20AC;3.6 billion. It's up 18% based on a very strong income number, a new record level &#x20AC;9.3 billion. If we focus then on the quarter, we have delivered now &#x20AC;1 billion in Q4 of operating profit, and most incomes lines are actually record levels. I'd like to highlight the commission income because the commission income is very significantly up, as you can see. It reflects the very high business activity, which is characterizing what has gone on in Q4.</p>
          <p>And let me dive a bit into the numbers. As I said, income is record level, up 3%, but if you look at this slide you can see that the underlying customer income is actually up 10%. The other areas which are down are reflecting this very high income level we had last year in the markets area, mainly, as you probably remember, coming down to a more normalized level. But still it's clearly offset by the very strong development in our customer income.</p>
          <p>Net interest income up 4%, with a solid trend in all customer areas. Deposit volumes are up very significantly, actually 15% on the year. Margins continued to increase here. On the other side of the coin, we have somewhat higher funding cost. Net fee and commission is up 18%, as I said, in the quarter. It comes from most lines, very much from the savings area, but also from lending and brokerage fees and other areas. It's helped by the fact that the Danish Guarantee Scheme has expired and there are also seasonal effects, but still a very strong increase in our commission income, reflecting the high activity level.</p>
          <p>As I said, very much from savings and asset management we see increased commissions and we can see that the assets under management has actually increased 21% in the year, a high inflow and high appreciation. We have a very strong performance in our asset management area. 78% of our funds have actually beat their benchmarks and actually we have a close to 15% average absolute return to all our customers in 2010, not only reflecting good performance, actually also reflecting a good asset allocation, as some of you will recognize. Fair value result is up 13%, driven by the strong increase in customer areas, as you can see. The other parts are bit more volatile, but this result is one that we are very happy about.</p>
          <p>Expenses are exactly in line with outlook. Excluding the FX effects, it's up 3.1%; including the growth initiatives is what we planned for. In euros, it's up 7%. There are some negative seasonal effects in Q4, which recently comes up &#x2013; out higher than the other quarters. Net loan losses down, there are no provisions this quarter through the Danish Schemes. 23 basis points is actually in line or slightly below the average of our business cycle, we expected 25. So you can say, norm &#x2013; loan losses have been normalized and that goes even for the Baltic area where we are down to 26 basis points. This is reflected in our credit quality, and there has been quite an interesting rating migration during the year. This is our rating scale with low ratings and high ratings. We have 18 rating scales, and you can see that in the high rating scales &#x2013; and around 4 minus here is what you would normally call investment grade. So in all our exposures, which are above the &#x2013; investment grade, you actually see an increase, and the exposures below investment grade you actually see a decrease. So, we had during the year increased our quality of credit portfolio, which of course points into the future in a nice way, not only by rating migration but also by the lending growth we have had, has been in the higher rating categories. And this is very good for us. It takes less capital of course, and the new environment to have customers with higher ratings.</p>
          <p>The regulatory framework is going to be a reality now. The industry challenges will be the capital requirements, the short-term liquidity and the longer-term funding part. It puts clear pressure on the return on equity and it needs &#x2013; makes every bank revise its business model. But we are very well positioned. We have a very strong starting point. Our core Tier 1 is 10.3%. That's unchanged, and that is actually quite interesting because it then captures the 11% lending growth and a payout ratio of dividends which is 16% higher than last year, and still we have 10.3%. And that is by any standard very high compared to the risk we have on the balance sheet. And therefore, we normally look into this Standard &amp; Poor's Risk Adjusted Capital ratio framework where we're actually one of the strongest banks still in the newest version that came out. So by any standard, a very strong starting point on cap compliant to Basel III here, so that's fine.</p>
          <p>Also on liquidity, we have a very strong position. We have now built a liquidity buffer of 70 &#x2013; &#x20AC;61 billion, which is in line with the requirements under Basel III. It's invested in similar assets of very high quality like is required in Basel III. As you can see, it's a significant growth. Short-term lending has also grown in the recent years, but now short-term lending &#x2013; sorry, short-term funding &#x2013; now short-term funding is lower than our liquidity rather, reflecting a very strong funding position that we are actually not short funding the rest of the balance sheet, if you want to look at it this way. Also on the long funding, we are doing well. We have increased the maturities of our funding and our long-term funding especially significantly. And now, we have the situation where the behavior maturity of our assets and liabilities are pretty close, which I think is very prudent. It's a very small mismatch. So, the maturity transformation actually happening on behavior maturities in Nordea is not very large. And this is the same liquidity risk that the Basel regulation, NSFR, Net Stable Funding Ratio, is going to handle. As you know, NSFR, the net stable funding ratio, is one that's decided but is not implemented. It's going to be observed over several years. We find a lot of these parameters are strange. We think it has to be reviewed during the observation period, but we have taken the stance that this is the prudent way to run the balance sheet. And I think if we get to there and the whole banking sector, I think we have come to a very prudent level.</p>
          <p>So all in all, we are very strong coming into the regulation. We are overlooking our business model. I think everyone will have to do that. Of course, we can mitigate some of these effects from capital for new risk-weighted assets, from funding and from liquidity in various ways in the way we construct our products, our behavior and the way the customers behave and the way we advice, and we are going to do that. So we are working on our new normal plan, and we've continued to do that during the year. And the objective is of course to increase the return on capital in this new environment, which is a very significant change. However, we have the strong standing point. I think the 12.8% ROE will compare extremely well throughout Europe when we see the results coming in.</p>
          <p>The long-term target is still our main focus. We launched it in December 2006. The most important part is the doubling of risk adjusted profit in seven years. And as you can see, we have been ahead of the line. We're slightly below the line right now, mainly because of the low &#x2013; very low interest rate levels, which harms our deposit income, and the extra funding cost we have experienced. But we still believe that that target is within reach under the assumption we also put out in 2006, that the seven year's doubling will be a full business cycle. So under the assumption, we now will see the economic growth and somewhat higher interest rates levels. We think this is within reach. The second long-term target was to be top quartile on CSR, and as you can see we're number two in the European landscape with 10% return over these three years, not impressive but compared to most other banks it's okay, I would say, which have lost between &#x2013; yeah, you see the numbers up to 100%, average around 40%, 50%.</p>
          <p>And then the ROE target, which of course going forward is going to be important with the new capital requirements, but here we're number one after Q3. We haven't seen all the results yet of 14.1%. So the long-term target is still what we're focused on, our growth strategy, the longer-term delivery on our underlying business growth. We're not this time giving out an outlook &#x2013; short-term outlook. We have left that. We have in recent years widened the outlook, as you have noticed, and we're now in line with industry practice left &#x2013; the notion of giving a short-term outlook, which we think adds little &#x2013; very little value.</p>
          <p>A few comments on the history; the Nordea name was launched in November 2000, 10 years ago. And the history of Nordea is an interesting history; only 100 years ago &#x2013; or 100 years ago it was 300 banks that merged and merged and merged. You cannot see all the names of the banks, but they're actually here into Nordea, 80 banks, 30 banks, 4 banks and then in 2000 Nordea. And it integrated during the year and we got the name in November. And it has been a very interesting journey. The very complex part of departure &#x2013; point of departure, hard work in integrating, creating the common culture, the common values, the business processes, the focus on risk handling and capital. The organic growth strategy we launched in 2007. The prudent growth we launched a year ago. And that journey has rewarded shareholders by 183% TSR. It's meant that we have grown profit before loan losses very significantly 127%. Cost to income ratio has come down, more efficiency, and assets are up significantly. Maybe most importantly, we have delivered on one of the key fundamentals in running a bank, that's our credit management. You can clearly see here that the risk appetite we actually decided many years ago of 25 basis points over a full business cycle is kept. And in this period, we even had two cycles, the IT bubble cycle and now the financial crisis cycle, and as you can see, we are clearly below that line on average. And already now, you can see that at the end of the year we are growing below the line at 23 basis points in Q4, as I mentioned, indicating that this is kept and I think it's a very strong point of Nordea.</p>
          <p>So we have this solid position. We have built our home &#x2013; nine home markets, 11 million wonderful customers, 1,400 branches. We kept our AA rating through the crisis as one of very few banks. And we are now top 10 European retail banks, and we are one of two Nordic companies on the Forbes 100 list of the world's most successful companies, which we find is an impressive delivery over these 10 years.</p>
          <p>That's enough with the history. I will go on with business momentum. The business momentum is strong. The economies &#x2013; the Nordic economies show strength, like all of Northern Europe, Germany and all of Europe are showing strengthened growth; solid growth rates, fairly robust growth rates, well-paced, modest inflation and strong public finances. Especially Sweden, of course, is leading with very strong growth and very strong position in public finances. Finland and Norway is also in there. Denmark lagging a bit on the public finances, but the debt level is low. And we also believe we see some recovery now in Denmark and we see some improvements in labor markets. So, we would call this growth we are looking into for the year robust. This gives us a good background for our strategy. We have indeed strengthened our market position. The number of gold customers are up 200,000, 7% in the year, and average over the last three years is 6%. That's a very significant growth and of course is the underlying base for our income growth, because getting 6% more customers, they do more business and so on. We are more than halfway there.</p>
          <p>Worth noting is also that we're growing very strongly in our asset management business, savings business, which is key going forward with 21% growth in the recent year with peers much lower and the average much lower. We're actually gaining a lot of market share here. So all-in-all, our value propositions work. We attract customers. We do more business, and this is also connected to the fact that we increased the customer satisfaction, which is up despite the recession, despite the fact that we have customers suffering from the economic recessions still and being unemployed and of course, maybe not 100% happy with the answers in the bank but hopefully happy with the help we still can give them by helping them through their problems. This is a very strong base also.</p>
          <p>And then this slide suggests something about the business momentum. If we look at the three months rolling for &#x2013; rolling average on monthly &#x2013; three-months average on income growth, we can see that it's picking up significantly during the year. Also, the 12-months rolling, the yellow one is up, and the 24-months rolling is showing our solid growth in income during a long time horizon, all the way back, actually for as long back as the last four years. So &#x2013; but most recently, the income momentum has picked up based on very high business activity, as I mentioned already. The reason is of course that we came out strong on the financial crisis very early. Already late last year, we said, the financial crisis is over and we're looking into economic growth, fragile economic growth but economic growth. We launched a prudent growth strategy and the nine initiatives. And I will not go through the nine initiatives again. I have done that on previous meetings, but let me give a few highlights as to how they have delivered, because they are actually key for this delivery we see today.</p>
          <p>First of all, the future distribution initiative is key. We are changing the whole branch network in these years. We updated creative branches to advice branches and transaction branches &#x2013; service branches, and this is very well received. We are now running 82 branches like this and we will keep developing the number. And the customers are receiving it very well, either you go to advice branch for advice or you go to a service branch for service, very simple. The customers like it. They are handled better in both situations. Either they want to sit down and get the 360-degree meeting and difficult advice on how to handle their finances or they just come to get fixed, something about their card or their payments or whatever they need, and that is also well done. This is a winning concept, and I will show later the efficiency is going up dramatically. So it's not only the customers liking it, we like it as well. And one clear indicator is that we have significantly increased the number of proactive customer meetings. The number of meetings where we take the initiative to advise the customers is up significantly during the year. We also improved our private netbank a lot during the year. So a lot of transactions of course moved over there, and we have gone mobile in all countries now, on the netbank which is of course also an important thing going forward.</p>
          <p>The new customer acquisition initiative and the growth in Finland are also delivering. We have record number of gold customers. We have developed in Finland according to plan, and we see the Finnish growth picking up. And I think the best demonstration is the number of customers but also that lending is up 14%, deposits up 7% and savings in France are up 19% during the year. Activity level is just high, showing that this new concept is working. On corporate merchant banking, the big corporate customers we're also developing well, very high activity level. Income is up more than 40% over the year, 19% in the quarter alone. We improve our customer relations. We get new core relationships. We do more business.</p>
          <p>Lending is not growing very fast in the corporate sector right now. And the reason is of course that the corporates make a lot of money and they are very rich in cash, so they can finance themselves mainly. But also they take up some long-term funding on the capital markets, which we actually help them with, I'll come back to that, but the activity level is fairly high. So, we see activity picking up in the corporate sector. And we see in the longer-term horizon also income growth is very strong in the corporate side. So, that initiative is working and on the markets initiative &#x2013; the capital market initiatives, it's worth noting that we are very highly ranked on the Eurobond market. We are number three here, showing that we are the leading Nordic bank in helping our customers and fund themselves in the international markets for the longer term. And as we go into the future of course, the new regulation, a lot of the long funding for corporates are going to be done on the capital market. We also have very strong position on the equity market. So, that initiative is also delivering. We have more to do, but we have come a good way.</p>
          <p>In new European markets, following the plan we opened the 45 branches we expected during the year, as you can see, and we delivered the income growth. And I think this is still an important growth initiative going forward. We'll continue on that, the new regulation. We mean that we will focus a lot of filling up the branches now with customers, but also advising them on more and more types of products and so on, but still we see the profitability level here very healthy going forward and the growth will be delivered. Also these initiatives are creating efficiency. That is not still easy to gather in one number, but I have a number of indications that really we internally also follow-up. And on the customer side, we have a number of indications that income per employee has gone up 13%; number of customers is up 2% per employee; number &#x2013; new customer acquisition from outside Nordea is up significantly 14%, as I said; business volumes per FTE is up 4%; the number of 360 degree meetings, the advice meetings, is up 27%; and the number of gold customers in new European markets is up 7%.</p>
          <p>The number of &#x2013; measures of efficiency, and we also have a number of the more back end of the business, the more administrative things. And here the scale is over two years and we see the number of manual transaction and branch network is actually down 23%, which is a huge driver for efficiency. The cost in asset management portfolio is down 13%. The IT production cost per production volume is down 19% over two years, very strong efficiency driver, showing that our initiative on IT efficiency is also delivering. The number of contracts on loans, cards and invoices is up 25% per FTE. The corporate payment transaction is up 28% per FTE. And the number of square meters per workplace is down 5% over two years, and that's a very good number because it shows our people are out there meeting the customers, not so much sitting in offices. So, we need less office space to service them. So, these efficiency numbers show that these growth initiatives are delivering the efficiency, which just was also part of the purpose. So on income and efficiency, we are delivering.</p>
          <p>So, the key message is that 2010 is an important milestone for Nordea. We came out stronger of the crisis. We delivered very early on our prudent growth strategy, the initiative for customers' growth and efficiency. We strengthened our market position and we have strengthened our regulatory position, as I said, strengthened our balance sheet, our capital funding and liquidity position. So, we are looking into 2011 from a strong starting point.</p>
          <p>That concludes my presentation, and we will now take questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Rickard Henze from ABG. <mark type="audio gap" /> during 2011 &#x2013; sorry, this year, and your intentions regarding covered bonds and senior unsecured, kind of the proportions between those? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I begin on the long-term target, when we launched it in 2006, I still remember that some people among the analysts thought it was more or less impossible to reach. I think we've proven that the underlying business development is actually in line. What has happened is of course that interest rate level has gone down and we had a financial crisis. So, under the assumption we said &#x2013; because we said seven years represents a full business cycle. So under that assumption, i.e., that we now see economic growth continuing and we see interest rate levels normalize, which I think we expect, then it's within reach. But it is not an easy target, it require a significant underlying growth. We have proven we can deliver on that, and we think we can continue on that. But of course if that assumption does not hold, if we see a doubled dip or surprising developments in the economy, then we have to look at that. But it &#x2013; when we use the word, within reach, it means that we are putting our plans to reach it. And Fredrik, on the redemptions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we had &#x2013; in 2010, we had roughly about &#x20AC;18 billion of redemptions totally including Nordea Kredit. We have a slightly smaller number for 2011, it's a couple of billion less than that. First of all, just a comment on 2010; we've actually issued 30 &#x2013; or just over 33 billion of long-term funding. So as Christian alluded to, we have strengthened the funding situation quite rapidly leading to this close to maturity matching that you have now seen. So of course, we generally think we are in a really good liquidity spot. And of course, as you also know, we have launched both the Norwegian and the Finnish cover bond programs. So just to answer that question, of course the proportion of cover bonds for 2011, we will expect that to be higher as we now sort of embark and of course also grow the Finnish and the Norwegian program. So it's difficult of course to talk about the issuance volumes generally, but our liquidity position and funding position is much stronger now than it was in 2010 and we also have the covered bond program. So, it's a good situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello. <mark type="inaudible" />. Just if you can comment a little bit what you see for trends here in 2011, especially related to corporates if you see? We have seen activity levels coming up, but if you also see lending volumes coming up in the corporate segment? And then I saw on screen something about NII sensitivity. That you have increased that. In which areas you believe that the NII sensitivity will be highest going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the corporate lending is a complex story. We have over the year increased our corporate lending by 8%, I think it is. So we see lending growth, but as I said, the interesting thing is that among the big corporates where we see the big numbers we also see very strong results and strong cash flow. So, the number of customers are very rich on cash and therefore do not need to draw on lines even though their activity is clearly picking up. And also as I said, we also see the use of capital markets more. So I think that the activity level is high, as I said. What actually comes on the bank balance sheet is another number and that is not easy to forecast. And the reason is of course also that the cost of those loans in terms of capital costs for the banks are going up because of the new regulation. We see activity level will pick up, and as we also say in the report, we see that the investment level start to go up also, not to the high levels we saw but it's picking up. So all-in-all, I would expect improvement during the year on that &#x2013; on those levels as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Net interest rate sensitivity, we are of course very sensitive generally, as Christian alluded to, and of course these low levels of interest rates is of course not good for the results. We have increased by 50 million roughly in the quarter and it will vary. We've got two major sources of interest rate sensitivity. First one is the transaction account household typically. The higher the interest rates more we earn. And that sensitivity is largely the same. So a lot of our interest rate sensitivity comes from those transaction accounts or general saving accounts. It hasn't really changed. What has changed this quarter is our structural interest exposure, and that has to do largely with the length and the size of the liquidity buffer. And you have seen in this quarter that we have expanded the liquidity buffer by 6 billion, and it's slightly longer. So, that's the main explanation. And it will vary over quarter. So, it's a largely in that order of magnitude.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi; Magnus Andersson at ABG. Just to follow-up on the long-term growth target, you would have to increase profit to hold loan losses by almost &#x20AC;2 billion until then. How much of that do you think you can impact with your own initiatives? And what are the most important drivers there? And how much is market driven, i.e., interest rates, some kind of general market growth? That's number one. Number two, just on your problem loans again. For the second quarter in a row gross problem loans are up quarter-on-quarter by 4% now and 14% year-on-year. If you just could give us an indication what is driving that regions? Is there any FX in there we should be aware of? And it also looks like you have an inflow of gross problem loans that is up quarter-on-quarter. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Yeah, on the long-term target I can only repeat what I said. Our plans are designed to deliver this underlying business growth and the number of customers, the business activity and volumes. And then margins will fluctuate as they're done. You saw deposit margins being depressed until more or less zero because of low interest rates. They are bound to increase now when interest rates go up. We also see it clearly demonstrated in this quarter. The reaction is quick. And we have seen other types of margins go up and down. Let's just say, capital market margins were very high last year. So what we are in fully control over is the business volume, the customers and the activity levels and all the things we are working for. But if we take the assumption as we made it to the full business cycle, then what we look into now is some economic growth, is some normalization of interest rates and then we think we will &#x2013; it will be within reach. So, I cannot get any closer than that but the plans are designed to deliver that.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll not quantify it here, but of course improving margins on deposits is an important part of it, and economic growth and activities of course are also important. We do not expect crisis to continue for years and years, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And when it comes to loan loss fees, as you so long heard to the overall quality of the lending book is improving and now we have come down in the level of loan losses to those levels we even expect throughout the cycle. The only portfolio we are still above these 25 basis points level is actually Denmark. In all other countries' portfolios, we are now below. But then you ask about this development of problem loans that is going up, that is in a way also very typical and natural for this type of the &#x2013; this part of the cycle because what happens now when we are in the, let's say, upturn is that after the crisis there is a tail of customers which are still in the problems, and now we can more easily identify those problem customers where we see that they won't make it. When we see that customer, we make a loan loss provision and that impairs the whole portfolio. But that doesn't change the underlying risk because we have covered that risk already early in the cycle by these collective provisions, so that we've been prepared to take these type of customers and then risks in. And then what makes these impaired loans increasing is that when we have done these collective provisions, there is no impaired loan attached. But now when we changed that in a way that the specific was loan loss provisioned, then that impairs that specific loan portfolio and that explains this increase in the problem loans. But I said, the underlying risk is not changed, there are no surprises.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Please also note that the impaired loans increases and performing loans, so this technical explanation Ari is giving, that if you have general provisions where you don't have any impairments because there are no loan structure impair, when you then impair a performing loan, it's often a very little provision you do, maybe 10% of the loan, but you impair the full loan so that blows up the figure in the technical way, which is not reflecting the underlying risk where the table I showed the rating migration is one that is reflecting the underlying risk in the portfolio.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, hi. Hampus Brod&#xE9;n, Enskilda. I was just wondering if you could give us some additional favor on this phenomenal trading revenue in the quarter, what's driving it, et cetera. That's the first question. The second question is regards to your corporate margins. You say that they've actually increased during the quarter; just wondering if you expect that to continue. And also if you could elaborate a bit on the difference in margin development on front book versus back book. Is it so that the front book margins are still higher than the back book, and therefore the back book margins are increasing, but are the front book margins in fact going down during the same time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two comments on fair value, Fredrik will take over, but as I showed in my slide, it's mainly the customer areas that keep going up. It's a very steady growth line as you can see, so we do more business. And margins were, I would say, favorable this quarter. We also have a number of fair value adjustments, which we have every quarter. But these were slightly higher this quarter than the last year. But the underlying explanation is higher customer activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can just emphasize that point, because if you look at our unallocated markets' profit throughout this year, it has actually reduced very significantly, both there in treasury as we have &#x2013; as we also had estimated for the year. So, the initiatives that you have seen here with our markets product to our corporate customers, has paid off. So, we've had really good customer activity. And then of course we've had, as we have also talked about before, some impact from revaluations in the quarter. But it's been a good quarter in general for fair value, so just to your point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. <mark type="inaudible" />, I will continue. The margins, yes, they are slightly up in the corporate lending book, not much but slightly up, and of course, there is this kind of pressure coming from this upcoming regulation that all the banks, they have to focus on getting the good profitability of &#x2013; when they &#x2013; when we used our balance sheets. But then again, of course there is another force that's driving for, let's say, increased competition because as you saw also that the rating grades, they are improving, the quality of our customers are getting better. And of course that means that there is a lot more accommodation on these good credits and that is holding back this, let's say, increasing trend. But I would foresee that this trend will &#x2013; it has to continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we see clearly increased competition on the corporate side. It's mainly coming from weak banks coming back, wanting to have some income growth. Many of them are government owned or government supported heavily internationally. So, it's a bit strange to see that competition picking up like that when we know that the capital effect, the capital need in those banks are very, very significant and then to see the pressure on margins. It's a bit strange, as we can obviously easily calculate that the margins need to go up because of the new regulation. But that's the effect right now. So, competition is fierce.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe to your comment before on the 2 basis points that we have increased the margin in the quarter, as that has been the case for quite a few quarters now, it is relating to the black book or basically repricing. So, the new lending is relatively stable in there.</p>

          <p>Magnus. Just a follow-up on Pandora, can you say something, do you intend to keep that holding and what kind of valuation method do you use? I understand that you do not mark-to-market it to the full extent. How much have you taken of their real market value so far? Secondly, just on short-term interest rate sensitivity, how much was the impact quarter-on-quarter by high short-term interest rates? And of the 500 sensitivity, how much is deposit margins, i.e., transaction accounts sensitivity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For technical reasons &#x2013; now I can actually hear my voice now. For technical reasons, I actually missed your first question because I was working with the microphone. What was your question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it was a follow-up on the Pandora holding, if that is first of all something you intend to keep on your books? What &#x2013; if that is kind of strategic holding or not? And secondly, how do you value it? I understand that you do not use your full mark-to-market valuation, how much have you valued it to &#x2013; relative to the actual market value, as an example, for instance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Now, let me just start with that question. Generally &#x2013; actually, we don't own Pandora. We don't have any Pandora shares. So, it's important to note that we have a holding in Axcel III of course. So, it consists of many other holdings within that fund. And we have some of those funds for commercial reasons, and we will always have it. So, this is a natural part of our business. So, the valuation is actually on Axcel III and not on Pandora, but generally we have conservative valuations on equity or private equity holdings just like Pandora. Exactly the discount is not something that we disclose for obvious reasons because it's our internal fair market value assessments of these holdings. But it's a fairly significant discount we have for all of those conservatively valued. Your second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question was just on the short-term interest rate sensitivity, how much impact you had quarter-on-quarter sequentially by the high short-term interest rates? And of the 500 sensitivity, how much is due to transaction accounts, i.e., deposit margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If I start with the last question, the interest rate sensitivity, as I mentioned, out there it is actually not any different than in our assumptions. The way we calculate it, as I mentioned, is of course the SIIR and then the assumptions we make on the margins as the interest rates go up. So typically, on the transaction accounts where interest rates are either zero or very low, when the interest rates go up, of course we get to retain a lot of that. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how much of the 500 is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a very significant amount. It's roughly about 350 or in that order, actually a little bit more, close to &#x20AC;400 million. So, that's a large part. And the increase this quarter is actually coming from the structured interest rate and liquidity buffer mainly. Then you're talking about the deposit margin. It's roughly about &#x20AC;30 million total for the quarter, and the absolute majority of that is actually coming from the household side, about &#x20AC;20 million of that is actually household. And margin is of course up 13 basis points in the household and 6 basis points on the corporate side. So, that's roughly the numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. There has been some, not rumors, but negative news out in the shipping area in the past month, I would say. And there were also some &#x2013; you had some larger exposures or loan losses in Norway. Could you just comment on how you see the development in the shipping area? Should we be more concerned going forward considering that Baltic Dry Index is relatively low, et cetera? That's the first question. And then also if you can comment on taxes, which were slightly higher this quarter, if that is something we should expect going forward as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start from shipping business. So you're right, so that the bulk and tanker market is now once again little bit down with the containers and also we are quite active in oil and offshore business. They are actually doing quite well. But the shipping business is cyclical as we know one and there has been &#x2013; this has been a continuous concern about, let's say, from market to our shipping group. But as you have seen actually, the loan losses &#x2013; actual loan losses from our shipping portfolio, they have been very low and so there were also in the Q4. Actually this increase you see in our Norwegian figures, that is not from shipping, that is in the Nordic Bank Norway. If you take a look at our shipping figures, the loan losses are down, meaning that we don't foresee any kind of change in our credit quality and in the shipping book so that this is more or less typical. This is the nature of shipping business. Rates are up and down, and we have to choose the right customers, strong customers, who can survive these cyclicalities. And so far, we have been successful and we don't have any reason to believe that that situation would change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Tax &#x2013; the tax rate was a little higher in the Q4. And it had to do with, I should say, one-off impacts, a lot of &#x2013; or smaller litigations and other things that we provided for. So, the tax rate for the year ended up at slightly higher levels than we would have wanted, put it that way. Those one-off impacts, actually coming from those litigations and its relatively high tax impact in the life business, those amounts to roughly about 0.7%, 0.6%. So, we were pretty close underlying at 26% as our statutory rate was. So this should be also a normalized level, so to speak. So, it was more temporary in Q4.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rickard, ABG. I want to touch upon two issues, firstly on the &#x2013; coming back to the impaired loans. You said that it's usual for this part of the cycle, but what is not usual is that the impaired loans that is still performing increases quarter-over-quarter than it did in the fourth quarter. So, I am wondering if you could give some more insight in why does the performing loans within impaired loans increase, and if there is any segments or countries that is driving that increase, <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, it is exactly natural that the increase comes to these performing impaired loans, because as I said, that the way this cycle works is that when we are getting to the downturn then we see that there is a deterioration of the quality of our certain lending books. We make collective provisions because we don't see that what are the customers, but we see that this portfolio maybe &#x2013; that we will have losses from this portfolio over the time, but then when we make these collective provisions there is no <mark type="inaudible" /> impaired loan volume attached to that loans provision. Now when we are at this part of the cycle, we can now more clearly see that there are this tail of customers who will not make &#x2013; they are still paying interest, they are still paying principle even, but we see that actually this customer according to our own analysis will be &#x2013; it's very high likelihood that that will be in default. Then we take a look what type of collaterals we have and then the difference compared to our exposures we may get loan loss provision. And thereby, the whole &#x2013; when we make this loan loss provision it may be 10% of the total exposure for that customer, but the impaired loan is 100% for that customer and that is still performing. And of course, this only shows that we are still very conservative and that it's kind of proactive in our loan loss provisioning policy, so that we are identifying these customers because now we can more clearly see those.</p>
          <p>Then your question was that that, is it &#x2013; is this increase coming from specific parts of the portfolio? Yes, that is coming and that is also what we have expected. It's mainly coming from Denmark so that there we can see these problem customers who have not been able to restructure their business models and that we believe that they will not make it. But that is exactly to the part of the portfolio, we had very high collective provisions. Now, the collective provisions are down and these specified provisions are up. So, that was &#x2013; that is more or less the story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And secondly, on funding, firstly, what's the average behavior maturity on mortgages you are using when you say it's 2.7 on the total asset side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it will vary by market. So in some markets, it's longer, others it's shorter. In average, the total behavior maturity for all mortgage portfolios is roughly about eight years. This is slightly shorter than that, but roughly about eight years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And secondly, if we look at the funding spreads both in the CDS markets and primary and secondary markets, you're now slightly above Handelsbanken and do you think that's a problem for you? And when will we see any relative disadvantages in terms of competition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to comment to competitors in terms of funding. I would tend to maybe separate for &#x2013; on the CDS and the primary. There are various reasons &#x2013; market-driven reasons on the CDS side. So more relevant for us is of course primary issuance. And if you actually compare exactly time-by-time, I would tend to actually disagree with you in terms of that disadvantage. So we &#x2013; I don't think we are at a disadvantage in terms of primary. We have even seen occasions where we are &#x2013; actually many occasions where we are at an advantage in the primary side. CDS is a different story.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Johann?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question about cost; you didn't give a firm guidance on anything this year but I think you say that the investments 2011 on the cost side will be higher than in 2010. So, isn't it reasonable to assume that cost growth this year will be higher than the 3% FX adjustment that you had in 2010? That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you want &#x2013; okay. Yeah, first of all, I mean the reason why we &#x2013; as Christian elaborated on before is that we're not giving an outlook because we're into more of a normalized situation, so to speak, and we're pursuing our prudent growth strategy. And yes, the investments for the specific initiatives will be larger in 2011, however so will also the efficiency gain. So from a net perspective, we're still producing very good results and of course income is also very positive. But generally speaking, we are pursuing a growth strategy, so we expect our costs of course to continue to grow. Otherwise, it's going to be extremely difficult. But it's worth mentioning and I think that's the point &#x2013; the whole point of showing these figures that you saw in the productivity side is that there is a lot of productivity work ongoing in all of these different areas. Those are efficiency gains, so we're becoming gradually more and more efficient in pretty much everything we do including front and back office work, administration, head office cost, all sorts of things. So we're doing that, so the cost growth that you're actually seeing is very largely targeted towards generating higher income, more customers, et cetera, all those kind of things that we are discussing. So although I cannot comment on cost targets or cost growth for 2011, and we will not do that, we expect of course, if things go as we think they will in terms of income growth and more business, then of course yes, cost will continue to grow of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And the second question, I think over the &#x2013; in Q4 you were not that active in the debt capital market because of the volatility we saw there. So I think you printed less debt than earlier in the year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Would &#x2013; spreads now on the &#x2013; in the primary market are up a bit compared to the second half of 2010. Would you say that there could be a negative effect when you go out and print cover bonds for senior debt or whatever in this year in the first half or second half? So, you have yet to re-price on the liability side that matures compared to what you are out there for &#x2013; to raise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but that's not &#x2013; I think you need to look at the year as a &#x2013; on a more holistic level 2010. We issued, as I said, more than &#x20AC;33 billion on a redemption of &#x20AC;18 billion. So we picked up a lot of new long-term fund and it was actually a deliberate decision to do that. And if you look at actually 2009, that was also much higher than 2008. So, we have deliberately strengthened our funding position. Of course there is a limit to it, so if you look at the maturity matching as you alluded to before of course as well, we're pretty close to match funding, right. So, there is a limit to how much you can do. So the reason why we were a little lower in Q4 was not that the spreads were higher or adverse or any such thing, it was just that we have done a lot of long-term funding during the year. So of course depending on how the regulatory environment will play out and what we will see now as we go forward, we will adjust our funding strategy accordingly. That we see is no problem. We see &#x2013; I think we all see that we've got a good funding situation with attractive terms. But realistically, if you look at the situation we're in with so close to maturity matching, to me it seems really strange to go sort of lot further. Regulation would indicate that, as Christian said, that one would need to go to even more long-term funding. To me, economically for any region, Sweden or the Nordics or anywhere, it wouldn't make sense to have banks actually coming close to match funding or even negative match funding. So, I think we've done a lot. But the funding strategy for 2011 of course will depend a lot on coming regulations that we are still not aware of.</p>

          <p>Hi. Masih Yazdi from Erik Penser. A question there on the risk-weighted assets; you're saying in your report that you've initiated an increase of recognition of collateral that's decreased your risk-weight assets. Do you expect that to continue in 2011? And how much would that be, everything else being equal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can comment on this. We have &#x2013; we're working &#x2013; as we do with cost efficiency, we are also working risk-weighted assets efficiency and trying to sort of minimize risk-weighted assets in the three different ways, first of all making sure that we target as far as possible products and customers that are capital efficient. I think the second part is of course, we're working with approvals, internal rating based models, and of course we still have some work to do in the corporate model to get advanced approval, for instance. And the third part is what you are elaborating on, trying to become more efficient on collateral which reduces risk-weighted assets, and we've been successfully doing that in the fourth quarter. We've also actually done it several other quarters and that work will continue. So, we've been constantly engaged in our entire business organization to actually do that. So, we specifically &#x2013; we've stated the impact in Q4, we expect that work to continue. How much we can do will depend on, of course, business conditions and our own ability, but of course that efficiency will continue.</p>

          <p>So Mats, the first decent banking analyst Cheuvreux had for many years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I couldn't agree more. Thank you. Mats Anderson with Cheuvreux. Just two questions; one is a little bit of book keeping, average behavior maturity, exactly what do you mean by that? That was the first. And the second was, why do you, Fredrik, think that it doesn't make sense to match the funding exactly, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, behavior maturity is &#x2013; it's &#x2013; is &#x2013; really is very simple. If you do for instance a 40-year mortgage loan, people will actually amortize that. So, it's not going to be bullish in 40 years. A lot of things could happen; they can repay, they can change banks; they can amortize and do a lot of things. So, what we actually do is we go through every item, not what we do, what we've done. We've gone through every item, every portfolio, all the customers looking at what is the historical behavior maturity of all these funds and then we actually also put a stress to that behavior maturity. So this is the average duration &#x2013; or not duration, maturity of all those items we have, both on the liability and the asset side. So we do exactly the same thing for deposits, for instance; what is the typical length of any assets so to speak and &#x2013; that we have. That's the way we deal with behavior maturity. And your second question...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, why it doesn't make sense in your opinion to match...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the traditional &#x2013; if I may put it this way, the traditional role of banking has been to sort of collect the deposits and funds. The business side of any economy has been that way for several hundred years. So that maturity transformation is truly a key issue, redistributing between short-term or transactional deposits into long-term funding which is necessary. If you fund a power plant or if you fund a plant or any other sort of long-term investment, you need that funding. So, that has been a role of the banking sector forever. And of course the interesting thing is that, what you can see for model bank, just take any bank, savings banks for instance, what NSFR would actually do is force a negative maturity transformation. So you would actually have to fund &#x2013; let's say, you would &#x2013; were to do a three-year corporate loan or five year cooperate loan, in average for your book you would actually have to have funding which is longer than what you lend. So, you can of course calculate or try and estimate what is the impact of the overall economy, but to me that does not make sense. It just is not a very important &#x2013; is not a functioning way. If you look at the Swedish side, it's very clear that there is a fairly significant funding gap on the Swedish side. So, lending by far exceeds deposits. And that funding gap, if you actually fund that from the banking side more than the maturity of your lending, then the cost will be prohibitive for basically investments in the industry or other things. So, that's the underlying logic.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> share buyback mandate. Under what kind of circumstance we actually execute on that during 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Tomas, we are doing this as we did in 2010 of course, on the AGM ends well. So, we are not planning to do anything. And as you know, we are also sticking to the capital policy we have, which is you can say with a Tier 1 target of nine and we are way beyond that and of course much higher also in terms of core Tier 1, we are &#x2013; as Christian also alluded to, we feel really strong in terms of equity. But we simply just don't know what the requirements will go &#x2013; as we go forward. What we do know from the Basel Committee is that over time the core Tier 1 ratio will gradually increase to 7%, but there is still a lot of unknowns and of course one of them relates to the counter-cyclical buffers and where they will be, are they going to be in core or not core or contingent, wherever it may be. Another one is the discussion on the systemic risk here, more systemic banks but is still out there on the discussion. Is that going to be a solution with resolution or bail-in or is it going to capital surcharges. We also have outstanding issues relating to IFRS and loan loss impairments and all sorts of different things. So at this point of time, I don't think any bank is actually able to calculate or to estimate what a capital policy should be in the new normal. So we feel we've got really sound and good balance sheet, but we cannot judge where we are in terms of the regulatory requirements, as we go forward. I would really hope during this year that this will be clarified. So hopefully, within the next nine months or so we'll probably know more. Then maybe we can construct a capital policy, but whether we have excess capital or adequate capital is just not possible. So this is &#x2013; repurchase mandate is just a preparation to have some flexibility, should opportunities arise. That's the only purpose for it.</p>

          <p>Very short question regarding the core Tier 1 ratio; if you could give your best indication now where you would be under the Basel III regulation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We have not &#x2013; actually not given any clear indication of where we will be. We have given indications on what the impact is. And as I can only repeat, that is roughly about &#x20AC;20 billion or so, so approximately 1 percentage point impact. But there are also &#x2013; and of course, the explanation, there is the market risk and a counter &#x2013; CVA is the main portion. So, that's still the communication we have on that issue. Of course, there are also mitigating impacts and we generate capital also. So, where we actually will be in the Basel III is different. But more mechanically, mathematically, we can see that it takes out roughly about a percentage point from the core.</p>
