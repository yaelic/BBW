          <p>Ram, Chandra and Maha will give a brief overview of the Company's performance, followed by a Q&amp;A session. As you are aware, we do not provide specific revenue and earnings guidance.</p>
          <p>Let me also remind you that anything said on this call which reflects our outlook for the future or which can be construed as a forward-looking statement must be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that the Company faces. We have outlined these risks in the second slide of our results presentation available on our website.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ramadorai to begin the proceedings.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kedar. As you all know, we are operating in an unpredictable operating environment. In this context, TCS delivered a very healthy topline growth of 23% in rupee terms for FY09 driven by primarily volume growth of 18%. Overall, it was an all round satisfactory annual performance given the turmoil in the global economy.</p>
          <p>FY09 was capped by TCS crossing the $6 billion mark in terms of revenue, which is a milestone. I am also pleased to share that the Board of Directors has recommended an issue of bonus shares in the ratio of one-to-one subject to shareholder approval and this is our second bonus share issue since our IPO in 2004.</p>
          <p>We focused on our operational efficiencies collecting cash more efficiently and driving an enterprise-wide cost management program and we have improved our profit margins annually by 109 basis points and posted operating profits of 6,602 crores rupees, up 28.9% over the last year. Net profits this year were 5,172 crores impacted by non-operational factors like rupee and cross currency volatility.</p>
          <p>The Company continues to generate significant cash flows. Even after the recent cash acquisition, we have cash of nearly 4,300 crores at the year-end and have rewarded investors with a dividend payout of 27% and a total dividend of 14 rupees per share, including rupees five as the final dividend subject, of course, to shareholder approval.</p>
          <p>Our ongoing drive to increase operational efficiency is yielding results. Making improvements in efficiency will continue to be a company focus going forward.</p>
          <p>We achieved our overall target of 45% off-shore leverage, which is an improvement of 310 basis points on an annual basis from quarter four of '08 to quarter four of '09. We continue to drive our cost management program and have held down cost significantly. The same rigor was applied to our collections, which has reduced our overall debtor days outstanding by 12 days in the last six months.</p>
          <p>In today's operating environment, we continue to provide our clients with an experience of certainty. This value proposition is even more appreciated by clients in this current environment. We have succeeded in increasing the number of clients across all revenue bands. We have grown in all major markets as well as verticals including BFSI; and Chandra will talk about these operational aspects.</p>
          <p>Rigor and discipline on the sales process have helped us add 163 clients during the financial year 2009 and we signed 28 large deals. As you know, we acquired the Citigroup's captive BPO, and this has started yielding revenues. The addition of 12,500 talented professionals came as part of this acquisition. And I'm confident you'll see the strategic benefits of the deal in the quarters to come.</p>
          <p>If you look at our gross addition in terms of people, we added 48,595 people during the year, resulting in a net addition of 32,354. Next fiscal we have made offers for 24,885 on campus. The joining of these trainees will be aligned to the recovery in demand for our services.</p>
          <p>While the world economy will take a while to recover, the more astute organizations are already looking at ways and means to reinvent themselves to clearly participate in the recovery ahead. With a broad set of transformational capabilities, we believe TCS is well placed to partner these organizations in coming out of the slowdown with speed and effectiveness.</p>
          <p>With the macro environment remaining uncertain, the company remains focused on improving efficiencies in addition to focusing on the customers. Because of streamlining our own operations, we have not compromised on our sales and marketing efforts or our ability to scale up to meet the new demand. I am confident about robustness of our business model, which is built on significant recurring revenues, a broad set of clients across industries and various markets.</p>
          <p>We have made significant investments in new growth markets of Asia, including India and Latin America, and these are expected to begin yielding results. We are continuing to invest in the future by building people competencies as we look and explore new opportunities. These would be in form of solutions for emerging areas like utilities and sustainable energy, healthcare and customer analytics.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and I will hand over to Chandra.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ram. Hello, everyone. I just want to highlight some of the operational aspects to say &#x2013; to establish that in the current environment they are quite sound. We have had a volume growth of about 19.3% on annual basis.</p>
          <p>From our offshore point of view, from a Q4 last year to Q4 this year, we have made an improvement of 310 basis points, which is actually what we wanted to do. And from a client perspective, all the client metrics show excellent growth across the revenue bands.</p>
          <p>In terms of the $1 million plus clients, we have added 45 more to the list this year. And in terms of the $50 million clients, we have moved from 19 last year to 24 this year. The same is story if you look at to the 10 million, 20 million and all the other bands.</p>
          <p>From a deal perspective, I think it's healthy, 28 large deals we closed. Especially this current quarter, we closed about seven deals, of which six came from the U.S. and one in the UK. We added a good number of clients, again, this quarter, 36 of them, and taking the tally to 163. So client addition has been healthy.</p>
          <p>From a industry point of view, you all know that we have had a problem across the industry segments. But net-net financial services registered a double-digit growth for the year, and manufacturing, retail, and utility sectors showed much higher growth rate. Having said that the impact on the manufacturing and high-tech sectors have been more pronounced from Q3 onwards, we did very well in Q1 and Q2, but Q3 onwards the impact has been negative. We think that will continue.</p>
          <p>The telecom sector is definitely weakening for us with the specific exposure on the top client, and that has been weakening and that is not only affecting the telco sector growth, also affecting our UK to some extent.</p>
          <p>Then from a geography perspective, all the major markets in this year posted a double-digit growth, Europe, I would like to single out, with the 38% growth on annual basis, 38.8% growth, has done extremely well. And that has come about because of the deal wins that we announced in the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>From a margin perspective overall, in the year we improved the operating margin by about 109 basis points from FY08 to FY09 perspective, which I think is pretty healthy considering the price pressure that we have been experiencing. Overall, on a year basis, we have had a pricing impact on the margin to the extent of 4.8% negative. So, that has to be taken into account when we view this margin improvement.</p>
          <p>Then from outlook perspective, I think the environment is still uncertain, and the sectors, I would single out, having more uncertainty on manufacturing, high-tech, and telecom to some extent. And with regard to other sectors, I can't specifically comment whether it has been bottomed out or it has not been bottomed out, but there are some places where the recovery is happening. And the deal pipeline is quite healthy with above 20 deals that we are currently pursuing.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to hand over to Maha.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chandra. At TCS, we did not slacken our efforts to reach out to customers and prospects, and help them address their business problems. Our core value proposition, which is delivery excellence, certainty in outcomes, and hire off-shore is more relevant than ever in the current economic environment, and we continue to win assignments. At the same time, we renegotiated some agreements, and overall, we remain customer focused.</p>
          <p>The global economic situation meant volatility in currency movements. While substantially getting the benefit of declining value of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar, we ensure that we protected ourselves from the effects of cross-currency fluctuations. Even after making a large strategic acquisition this year, we continue to hold significant cash reserves.</p>
          <p>We ended FY 2009 growing 22.97% in rupee terms to 27,813 crores of rupees. In U.S. dollar terms, this works out to 6.016 billion.</p>
          <p>The breakup of revenue growth is as follows: volume growth is 17.74%; exchange is positive 10.8%: billing rate, negative 4.89%; effort mix that is &#x2013; by moving &#x2013; by the result of moving people from onsite to off-shore, negative 2.27%; TCS e-Serve, 1.59%, and therefore, the total is 22.97%.</p>
          <p>We had talked about the weakening external situation when we announced the results last quarter.  Revenue quarter &#x2013; revenue growth for the fourth quarter declined 1.45% quarter-on-quarter in rupee terms to 7.1, 7.2 crores of rupees, and 3.36% quarter-on-quarter in dollar terms to US$1.433 billion.</p>
          <p>While we gained 4.94% this quarter by consolidating TCS e-Serve revenues and 62 basis points from currency movements, quarter four revenues were impacted by 2.65% from volumes and by 1.97% negative from pricing. Although revenue also declined by 2.39% from off-shore shift, this is a welcome move in view of profitability.</p>
          <p>We continued our focus on improving operational efficiencies that Ram had described in our last call, scaling down our expenses in line with the deceleration in the revenue growth. Let me now give you a bit of details on some of the steps we took.</p>
          <p>A significant margin lever in our business model is the off-shore mix. At the end of FY 2008, when 41.9% of our revenues were generated from off-shore locations, we had spoken about targeting 45%. We made a steady progress in that area throughout this year. Off-shore leverage in the fourth quarter went up another 160 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 45.2%, achieving the intermediate and of course the immediate target we had set for ourselves.</p>
          <p>While we shifted some employees from various locations and so on, and we also followed a compensation policy in terms of variable compensation, there were certain improvements in margin as a result of it.</p>
          <p>We also continued the scrutiny on head count additions. By limiting gross additions to 3,522 this quarter and maintaining attrition at 11.4%, we had only 521 net additions during Q4 on an organic basis. We were able to bring down employee costs in absolute terms by 121 crores in this quarter over the previous quarter, that is 84 basis points as a percentage of revenue.</p>
          <p>Likewise, we controlled other expenses as well. For example, we've been able to bring down travel expenses by 17.1% quarter-on-quarter which translates into a 32 basis point deduction as a percentage of revenues. For the full year, our cost discipline resulted in a 26 basis point reduction in our cost of revenues, and 81 basis point deduction in SG&amp;A expenses.</p>
          <p>Operating margin for Q4 was 23.71%, down 105 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Margin impact for the different factors are as follows; currency, 31 basis points; off-shore shift, 67 basis points; rate productivity change, negative 44 basis points; SG&amp;A component, negative 159 basis points; total decrease, 105 basis points.</p>
          <p>On an annual basis, our FY09 operating margin was 23.74%, up 109 basis points over last year. The break up of margin improvement was as follows. Currency, 4.25%; off-shore shift, 51 basis points; rate productivity change, minus 4.54%; SG&amp;A component, 87 basis points: total increase, 1.09 percentage.</p>
          <p>Finally, net income margin for the fourth quarter was 18.41%, down 21 basis points quarter-on-quarter. For the whole year, our net income margin declined 3.59% over last year. A significant part of this decline was on account of foreign exchange losses on our revenue hedges.</p>
          <p>On hedging, we witnessed tremendous currency volatility in FY 2009 with all the major currencies depreciating sharply against the U.S. dollar and against each other. The Indian rupee moved in a wideband between 40 rupees and 52.50 against U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>GBP depreciated 38% against the U.S. dollar, but only 8% against Indian rupee. While euro depreciated 19% against the U.S. dollar, while depreciating 7% against Indian rupee.</p>
          <p>In such a volatile scenario our hedging strategy continues to protect budget <mark type="inaudible" /> realization and deliver predictability. Our cross currency hedges helped us avoid translation losses of four billion rupees this year.</p>
          <p>However, revenue hedges we took at the start of FY 2009 with limited outside participation contributed to a ForEx loss of 7.8 billion rupees this year. That said, I would like to point out that our average post hedge rate for FY09 was 44.50 against the average realization of 46.30.</p>
          <p>Moving on to cash flows, we continued our sustained drive to improve collections. During the fourth quarter we brought down our DSOs by another three days on top of the nine days improvement achieved in Q3.</p>
          <p>After paying out 24.38 billion rupees for the acquisition of CGSL, we ended FY 2009 with cash and liquid investments of 42.87 billion rupees.</p>
          <p>To sum up, at a time of unprecedented global uncertainty and turbulence, we coped well in 2009. In response to the environment, we focused on what is within our control, that's improving internal efficiencies and delivering good results.</p>
          <p>By resisting pricing pressure, we are aggressively shifting works off-shore, managing our costs better and hedging prudently, we protected our operating margins, and did so without diluting our capability to lead in the recovery ahead.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from the line of Mr. Ed Caso from Wachovia. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Good evening, I guess. Thank you for taking my question. I'm curious if you can give us an update on the pricing environment and how that has worked into fine discussions as they come to the end of projects and start new projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the pricing environment continues to be challenging. Definitely there is pressure, not necessarily when the contracts come up for renewal, also at different points in time. If you really look at our customer base, they are large companies. And if you look at the top 100 companies, more than 40% of them have declared decline in their revenues in their last business announcement. More than 55% of them have declared decline in profits. And a good number of them have also declared losses.</p>
          <p>So this is the environment in which they are living in. So that definitely translates in terms of cost management initiatives for them which also results in pricing pressure. So, all I will tell you is that you please look at our annual numbers. We've had a 17.7% volume growth organically. And we've had a pricing impact of about 4.8%.</p>
          <p>Going forward our take is that for FY10, we would say that it is in the lower single-digits, is the likely impact we are factoring in at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Mr. Caso. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi gentlemen. My question here is on, first one is on visibility. I was wondering is there any change in the amount of visibility that you have going into this year? I'm wondering if you could give us any commentary on decision-making, is it starting to pick up, are people actively making decisions, has there been any change in the demand environment from that perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is the most difficult question, and this is the question, definitely, you want the best possible answer; but we'll try and tell you. From our point of view, I think still there is no very clear clarity, but if you look at certain sectors like retail, like utilities, like pharma, we have clarity. But sectors like manufacturing and high-tech, definitely there is a lot of cloud around visibility.</p>
          <p>And all companies are not closing budgets; some companies are taking tactical steps and quarter at a time. So that is the behavior. So the discretionary spend which actually was in a very tough situation in the beginning of the calendar year is probably better in some sectors, but definitely in overall, still there is delays and lack of approval for discretionary budgets. That's the best possible I could give you in terms of a qualitative color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just secondly, I was wondering if you had any commentary or any changes you're seeing in the political environment given what's happened here in the U.S., any adjustments that you may be making with moving more work off-shore or in regards to H-1B, any commentary on the political environment will be great?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think from the U.S. point of view, I think there is no direct impact so far. And in this environment, actually we have accelerated our optimizing of the resource base, and definitely we are driving more work off-shore. And you have seen that resulting in a significant shift off-shore this quarter and also resulting in margin improvement; almost 68 basis points on a sequential quarter basis.</p>
          <p>So we will definitely continue to drive the off-shore movement program and optimize the employee costs as tightly as possible, definitely. And in terms of visa situation, I think there is &#x2013; we have enough visas for the need that we have going forward for the fiscal year FY10, so that's not an issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one last one, if I could sneak it in. Your decision to hire next year; obviously it doesn't look like you're ready to hiring people on a quarterly basis, but you are taking people on to the bench. I was wondering if you could just explain that. It would seem intuitively that you would probably stop the hiring process and focus on pushing utilization higher. I wonder if you could just comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll answer this question; probably Ajoy may like to add. See the principle of recruitment what we have taken is that not only going forward, actually in the Q1 or the Q4, we have tightened the recruitment. So we are really not adding any laterals, it's very, very, very tightly controlled. Only where it is absolutely needed, the niche skills, is where we are looking at.</p>
          <p>And the fresh trainees, 24,000 plus trainees, where we have given offers, they will have a certain joining rate. And those trainees will come all through the year. And the first batch doesn't start until the second quarter; later part of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And obviously, we will synchronize the time at which they join, as we know more at the end of Q1.</p>
          <p>So this is the principle. And also there will be &#x2013; our attrition is running around 11% at this point &#x2013; 11 to 12% at this point in time. So we have factored some attrition as well for this fiscal year.</p>
          <p>And you need to see this also, in the context of what we are experienced in the last five quarters. To recall, in the December 2007 quarter, we first announced that we are seeing the impact in the financial services market. Specifically if I recall, we said that there are two clients that we are seeing severe cutting budgets. And then that translated into impact from the Financial Services and later on into Manufacturing, Hi-tech, another sectors.</p>
          <p>And we've had a tough year. At the same time we've had a volume growth of about 17.7%. So now, we've taken all this into account. So we've controlled any lateral additions, very, very tightly, and the pressures, the approach I've already told you. So, I don't think that we are looking at dropping utilization. We are definitely going to make our efforts to improve the utilization, that's the goal.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Foresi. Our next question is from line of Mitali Ghosh of DSP Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mitali?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good evening. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about how you expect the volume flow in the next few quarters? How should we expect the next quarter to trend? And also while on volumes, what you're seeing in the Banking sector? You discussed the trends in a couple of other sectors with what you're seeing happening at the Banking sector now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mitali, I think it's very difficult to say at this point, because the uncertainty is there still, still there are surprises. And there is no clear visibility in terms of the discretionary budgets. So one can't say that what may expects to ramp up will definitely get ramped up. That is the uncertainty under which we are operating. So it's very difficult to give you a range &#x2013; even a range in terms of what can happen in the volume growth or if there will be volume growth.</p>
          <p>Then in terms of the Banking and Financial Services sector, I think the point I was making is that we are seeing more impact and more cloudiness around Manufacturing, Hi-tech and Telecom sectors than the Banking sector. In the Banking sector, we can see some spots of recovery. But whether it is systemic, whether it's bottomed out, or whether it's going to turnaround, I think is too early to say. We just need to wait for some more quarter, and we will be more smarter down to the question three months from now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if you could provide some color on the operating margin outlook for next year and how you expect the different factors to impact it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we can't say anything about what's going to happen to the exchange. So leave the exchange out of the equation. And many talk about the offshore moment, yes, the drive will continue. We will continue to move more work offshore, still there is some headroom. And for all the work we have initiated, there is some more distance to go. So we will definitely improve the offshore margin. And then, you should also factor in that there is going to be a pricing decline. So you have the &#x2013; these are trend for the offshore on the pricing. Currency I think you are as good as we can guess, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mitali, Mahalingam here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pricing, the effort in terms of improving the efficiency will continue. I mean, that's &#x2013; and in fact it is not a finished job as far as we are concerned. We did talk about 45% but that &#x2013; as I said was only an intermediate and immediate goal. There are possibilities. And the second one is that all other expenses &#x2013; all the expenses are under scrutiny, so that program is going on. And you have seen the impact in the last three quarters on a consistent basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just going to follow-up to that, what are you targeting in terms of utilization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The utilization, as I said, the number of people that we are recruiting is primarily at the trainee level. So we are definitely trying to improve the utilization without trainees, distinctly. The utilization of trainees into projects, and that utilization going up will very much depend upon the volume that we receive. So it's very difficult to say. But utilization excluding trainees we think it will go up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just finally two things, one is in terms of the tax rate, what do you expect in fiscal '10 and fiscal '11 and just some color on the ForEx hedge loss that maybe we can expect over the next couple of quarters, is there any change for that or does that remain similar as last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see, as far as the tax rate is concerned, there is no change as far as next year is concerned. As far as the hedging loss as for next year, you know that we have got close to about 700 crores of rupees or 7 billion rupees in OCI. But as far as the next quarter is concerned, we have got $120 million coming in at maximum participation of 41.</p>
          <p>Now one will have to work out what exactly is the &#x2013; going to be the currency factor because as you can see the rupee has been started appreciating against the dollar to a limited extent. So we cannot trade it. So that's going to be one that is moving up. As far as the year as a whole is concerned, $349 million is the one, that's limited participation at 41.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ms. Ghosh. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Moshe Katri of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, it's <mark type="inaudible" /> on behalf of Moshe. I got few quick question. First thing, with regard to existing customers asking to renegotiate existing contracts, is there &#x2013; how widespread is that and is there anyway to quantify the average requested pricing concession?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it's pretty hard to give a precise number on this, but as I said, the pricing negotiations range anywhere from 4% to 15%. That's the demand. And that doesn't mean that we negotiate at the price, but there is a demand. But it not in a very systematic way, I think it varies from sector to sector and customer situation to customer situation, and also it differs from type of engagement. But it's fair to say that generally there has been an attempt to renegotiate the price.</p>
          <p>So the only thing that we can say is that, we have looked at our portfolio, we have looked at what has happened this year, we have looked at the other clients in that situation, and we have at this point in time factored in an impact of lower single-digits for us for the next fiscal. That's the only comment I can make.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And with regard to budget, I mean, what sense do you get as far as, have budgets been largely finalized? And if so, what are the trends in terms of expected offshore spending within those budgets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the budgets where it is finalized, I think it's predominately focused on a lot of ADM work, lot of maintenance and analytical work. Discretionary budgets in general are very hard to come by across industries. Okay. There is a cut in discretionary spend across the industry segments, but definitely there is an attempt from the customers to increase offshore volumes. Absolutely. That's again across sectors. Also in certain companies, they are not really freezing the budgets, they are taking a very tactical view of case by case approach. So, it's a mixed bag out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And my last question, if you can just please comment on sales cycles &#x2013; if you can just comment on sales cycles?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, I wouldn't say that there is any unusual change in the sales cycle. Wherever there is an RFP or wherever there is a opportunity that's being pursued, we don't see any significant change in the sales cycle. But if you are trying to create an opportunity proactively and if it requires discretionary funding, it can be really long.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, before we take the next question, we'd like to request that you limit your question to one per participant so that the management is able to address all your questions. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Can you just decompose the fourth quarter revenue a little bit better, trying to understand the dollar contribution of the Citi acquisition, sort of first of all? And then, if you could decompose the pieces of volume growth, pricing impact et cetera, just to get a better sense on what the fourth quarter sequential underlying volume growth look like for the core business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Julio that's &#x2013; the fourth quarter decomposition goes this way, volume is negative 2.65%, pricing is negative 1.97%, exchange impact is positive 62 basis points, change in off-shore leverage is negative 2.39% and e-Serve added 4.94% positive and therefore overall 1.45%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, that 4.9% was what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>e-Serve that is CGSL, Citigroup's BPO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was plus 4.9%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it looks like just from the numbers that we had, the dollar contribution from Citi would have been roughly like 60 &#x2013; $66 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>$71 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>71, yeah. So then the underlying core business itself looks like it declined about 8% quarter-to-quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Less than that Julio. It's closer to about 7%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay, got it. Great. And then just &#x2013; I think the trajectory that you're expecting for when you're expected to bring head count back on board that should match your demand improvement that you say, when exactly that was supposed to match up again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's &#x2013; as I said, the major head count that we are talking about is the fresh trainees for whom we have made the offers. They will start in the second quarter &#x2013; middle of second quarter. So the actual sequencing will carefully plan it at the end of first quarter, and try and match it to the volume uptick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And &#x2013; but with that also when you expect revenue to come back again or is that just a head count addition situation? If &#x2013; I guess, I'm trying to understand specifically as when you're expect to start growing again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it's a difficult question to answer. I think, we don't give consensus as you know. All I will tell you is that Q4 has been a volume decline and a pricing decline, but if you look at the year-on-year, I think it has been a 17.7% volume increase which is pretty decent in the current environment, in spite of the impact of Q4.</p>
          <p>So we will need to carefully wait for another a month or two. Because what is bothering us is not the new deal pipeline. The new deal pipeline, the closure is not the issue we are having. The issue we are having is the sudden hold that comes in your existing client base.</p>
          <p>If you look at last fiscal year, our top clients have all had holds in terms of the revenues dropping on a year-on-year basis, in spite of that the  17.7% has come in spite of the fact that several of the top clients have de-grown. So there are tons of holds that's coming, and there is no predictability in that holds. We'd like to see a few months at a time where we're experiencing a hold. So we are watching the auto sector, we are watching the other &#x2013; the auto supply of player sector, watching the other manufacturing sector, the hi-tech sector.</p>
          <p>So we want to make sure that we are not getting those holds in the months to come. Till then, it's very difficult to predict whether we'll have volume growth or not; that's exactly the problem. The problem is not in the deals we have closed, because there we normally get 2, 3% and there we have visibility, and especially the deals that we closed this quarter or last quarter, all have happened after the turmoil has happened. So these clients exactly know what they are committing to, that's not an issue. Problem in the existing accounts when there is surprises come. So, I can't be more accurate.</p>

          <p>Okay. And for the full year, you said that the pricing has impacted the margins by 4.5% and off-shore has improved the margins by 51 basis point, so the offshore improvement has been significant in FY09, so why the improvement is just to be an extent of 51 basis point?</p>

So, if you put it altogether, I think that's where you see the pricing impact from &#x2013; off-shore improvement perspective it's a 160 basis point building in 51.</p>

          <p>Yeah. In any case, we have been saying that the impact of offshore movement is between 20 to 25 basis point per percentage movement.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just on last thing, sir, there is some high number of common clients biggy share with the Satyam too, is there any client churning where we are getting a higher benefit versus UBS, can you throw some color in terms of how the churning from Satyam clients to TCS and its impact?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is &#x2013; in general, we don't talk about specific competition. So, I wouldn't see that as a significant opportunity or anything. I think overall, there are opportunities in some clients which we pursue, but I wouldn't like to put a number to it, Sandeep.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to check with Maha, in terms of have there been any changes in terms of the underlying hours per day that we bill, since 1st of April?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I just want to clarify one thing that the number of hours that we bill corresponds to the number of hours that we work for the customer. It is &#x2013; there is no discount that is passed on because we have got a slightly longer working day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And another thing is, in terms of write-back on taxes, have there been any write-backs in this particular quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There have been some write-back, and that's the reason why in this quarter, you would find that the tax amount has come down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one last thing, in terms of our rent having gone up by almost 80 bps in this particular quarter, what could have contributed to such a significant jump?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are essentially three things. One, there have been certain additional premises in which we had moved. The second one is, as the result of some in-sourcing that had taken place in an overseas location, there was an increase. And the third one was there was a dispute, and we have been taking some steps in terms of, well, settling that dispute.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So a lot of it could be one-off or do we expect this elevated level to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is some part, which is really one-off and not the full extent of increase. But I would say &#x2013; let me say, substantial part of the increase is one-off.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Mehta. Our next question is from the line of Anthony Miller of TechMarketView. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, gentlemen. I wonder if you could add a little bit of color and movement to the UK and European scene. Firstly, if you look at UK and Continental Europe and you look at it in local currency terms, which country markets have you seen the best growth in, in the last quarter and which have been the least satisfactory for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Continental Europe, overall, has done very well, not only in Q4, but also over the entire fiscal year, even excluding the exchange. And, also, Europe, UK has done well. If you really remove the exchange impact, obviously, you've had an exchange impact in UK because of the sterling weakening. So I would say that first Continental Europe followed by UK.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Has there been any &#x2013; is there any material difference in the shape of the demand in UK and Europe versus the U.S. either because, say, the vertical sectors are behaving differently or even demand for a particular service line is different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in these markets, we are seeing growth in retail, financial services, and utilities. These are the three sectors, I would say, that we are growing in these markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just finally, what exchange rate should we be using for &#x2013; sorry, I missed the dollar one, but can you give me again the dollar, for euro and for sterling, so that we can apply it to the numbers to get the local currency effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I said as far as the dollar was concerned was that &#x2013; I presume you're asking about the overall movement that -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually, what is actual exchange, yes, yes, the exchange rates, so that I can just apply them on my model to get the local currency numbers, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As far as this quarter is concerned, it was &#x2013; okay, the average currency as far as the U.S. dollar is concerned was 50.04 for this quarter. For pound, it was 71.91, and for euro, it was 65.62.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Just wanted to get some understanding on the pricing. If assuming Q4 pricing levels had to stay right through for next year, what would be the exact impact on pricing would be for an '08 business, that is FY '10 vis-&#xE0;-vis FY '09 would be?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's something, which you don't have it handy. But what will be the drop you've seen from Q1 to Q4 and a pricing drop for this financial year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I was just observing that among your service metrics, except for maybe BPO on an organic basis, all our service lines have declined during the quarter including some of the so called non-discretionary spend area such as infrastructure and testing. What has caused this phenomenon? Have you seen some ramp up in some specific large clients, which has led to this or is this a phenomenon that we've seen across industries, across clients?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we &#x2013; on our services &#x2013; no, you're talking about the quarter or the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm talking on a quarter-on-quarter basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Quarter-on-quarter basis, I think you should have seen growth both in BPO and Infrastructure. And it's just that we've had a huge decline this quarter, revenue decline, so that's what you're seeing throughout the board. It's more because of the holds we have faced with specific clients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right. And if I &#x2013; pardon me, if I've got this wrong, we're expecting almost no volume growth next year. Is that what you're saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We have not said any guidance on the volume growth. All we have said is that, at this point in time &#x2013; there are two points I make. One is on the new clients that we won on the ramp ups. We have some clarity and visibility. The problem we have is in predicting any unexpected holds that occur in the existing accounts. That has been happening all through the last three quarters. And we are not able to predict that. So unless we get clarity on that for the next month or two, it is very difficult to clearly say how much will be the volume growth or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's all we have said. We have not said one way or the other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. In your earlier conversations where you'd kind of just indicated that fourth quarter might be the worst in terms of volume decline, and after that we'll probably see things improving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We hope so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are we still saying that because &#x2013; if you looked at the numbers this quarter, they seem to have deteriorated much greater than expected. Do you expect that to carryover into -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in the fourth quarter, our numbers were, I think, pretty much on the expected lines because if you see the volume perspective, de-growth was about 2.6%. And I think we are expected that there will be a volume decline and a pricing decline in the fourth quarter. And also, you have to factor in that we had a 2.4% of decline in fourth quarter in the revenue due to the offshore movement, so pretty significant, something that you've got to factor in. I think a lot of other people also reported &#x2013; who ask some questions about the fourth quarter numbers probably didn't that into account where a 2.4% shift in revenue drop due to the shift offshore. And whether this is the worst ever, I mean, as I said, it's about the uncertainty that can come in any of the large accounts that we have. So we are not able to clearly give an answer on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thanks and all the best for a tough year.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Ms. Nagarajan. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints that will be the last question. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Kedar Shirali and the management for their closing comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rochelle . I'll now invite Mr. Ramadorai to deliver the closing remarks for today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, everyone. All I wanted to summarize was to say that it has been a challenging environment and we expect the uncertainty to continue for some time. In spite of that, our revenues crossed the 6 billion mark, which was up 23% year-on-year; strong volume growth in terms of about 17% for the year; operating profits $1.42 billion, up about 29%. The operating margin improvement was to the extent of 102 basis points. We have generated cash and declared dividend of 14 rupees per share in the 19th consecutive quarter of dividend paid out since we went public. We did declare a 1:1 bonus subject to the Board approval and the shareholder approval. Board has taken that decision, but it has to be with the shareholders during the AGM.</p>
          <p>We did achieve the offshore mix of 45% and which was an improvement like I said, 310 basis points. More importantly, the DSO was reduced by 12 days in the last two quarters. We did add new clients and large deals were closed. And then the benefits of the acquisition of the Citigroup BPO will be seen. And we did add gross of 48,595 people including the offers, which we said we have made for the year 2010 from the campuses at about 24,885. In a tough challenging environment, it has been a good performance. And we will look at the customer experiences, customer focus, and operational efficiencies as the theme and across the world, including the emerging markets, would be the key focus. Thank you.</p>
