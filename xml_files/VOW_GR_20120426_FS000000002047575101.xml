          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Volkswagen's conference call on the results for the period January to March 2012 based on the Ad Hoc and the Interim Report we published this morning. Joining me today on this call are Hans Dieter P&#xF6;tsch, Member of the Board of Management, Volkswagen AG, responsible for Finance and Controlling and the Member of the Board of Management, Volkswagen AG, responsible for Group Sales and Marketing, Christian Klingler.</p>
          <p>You can follow the webcast and download the chart from our website at www.volkswagenag.com/ir. Questions can be sent by email or called in. After the presentation, we will take questions first from analysts and then from the journalists. Let me now pass you over to Mr. P&#xF6;tsch.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and allow me to add my warm welcome to those of you joining this call today. It is my pleasure to be able to report a good start to the year 2012, despite the difficult economic environment here in Europe.</p>
          <p>In the first three months, the Volkswagen Group delivered more than 2 million vehicles for the first time, an increase of 11.1%. The volume increase, which of course includes MAN, drove sales revenue up to &#x20AC;47.3 billion and operating profit to &#x20AC;3.2 billion, thanks to qualitative growth.</p>
          <p>Profit before tax increased to &#x20AC;4.3 billion, benefiting from an improved financial result, in particular, through strong earnings from our equity accounted companies. Automotive net liquidity ended the quarter at close to &#x20AC;16 billion, down just over &#x20AC;1 billion on the year-end, as we invested in our future growth in our car division, in new products and plants, including, of course, MQB and also in trucks with a further increase in our position at MAN.</p>
          <p>Last week, we announced the takeover of Ducati via Audi AG, subject to the usual approvals of the cartel authorities. Ducati is a perfect fit to Audi with its renowned expertise in low weight and high power outputs, together with impressive margins and significant sales and profit potential.</p>
          <p>Allow me now to hand you over to Mr. Klingler, who will take you through the sales landscape and our good performance. Mr. Klingler, over to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome to the conference call from me also. This chart shows development of the growth of car market by quarter in comparison to the same quarter of the previous year. In the wake of the Eurozone debt crisis, the economic environment darkened significantly, mainly in Western Europe, but also in markets which depend on exports to the regions. This explains the comparably weak market growth in the last quarter of 2011. With an ongoing strong development in major growth markets such as China, Russia on the one hand, and the North American market picking up on the other, the first quarter of 2012, again, recorded positive growth. The recovery of demand, following last year's earthquake in Japan also contributed to this global growth of 6.8%.</p>
          <p>However, in order to evaluate the relative development of the global market, a comparison to the last normal year of 2007 is still appropriate, which is shown at the next chart. On a global basis, the car market is now comfortably above the pre-crisis level of 2007.</p>
          <p>However, that is mainly the result of the strong performance of the Chinese market since then. Excluding China, the car market is still below the pre-crisis level as shown on the next chart by the orange line. First the phase-out of government support measures in many markets, then supply disruptions from natural disasters and, finally, an increasing difficult economic background in Western Europe, kept the car market outside of China muted.</p>
          <p>While the North American car market is growing again, the recovery is still somewhat fragile as the overall economy operates below its potential. With the Eurozone debt crisis still lingering, Western Europe is now in a mild recession, putting the car markets under pressure. While some markets, including Germany, still show positive economic growth and a stable car market, Southern European countries, from Greece to Portugal, report significant declines.</p>
          <p>A recovery in the developed markets will be protracted. A possible further contingent from the current debt crisis and the rising oil price constitute significantly to the market development. We continue to closely monitor this elevated level of market risks.</p>
          <p>Total market growth, albeit on the somewhat slower pace, is continuing in the emerging BRIC markets, especially in Asia. We expect this favorable development to continue. In spite of the difficult market conditions in Western Europe, we are confident that in the year 2012, the global car market will have a small growth compared to 2011.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our performance. The Volkswagen Group continued to outperform the overall car market. We again gained global market share in the first quarter of 2012, supported mainly by the Group performances in China, the US, Russia as well as in Germany.</p>
          <p>Here you can see the car market performance of the regions around the world in direct comparison to the performance of the Volkswagen Group in the first quarter of 2012. The Volkswagen Group has outperformed market in every region worldwide. As the Western European market declined by over 8%, the Volkswagen Group recorded a decline of just 1.2%.</p>
          <p>As already mentioned, major market in the region suffered reductions, amid a weak economic background. In particular, the Portuguese and Greek markets contracted heavily by 48% and 32% respectively, against the first quarter of 2011. And France and Italy are both down by over 20%.</p>
          <p>Now we'll take a look at the performance of the individual brands of the Group. In the first quarter of 2012, nearly all of our brands achieved an increase in terms of sales for the Group. Total deliveries to customers exceeded last year's level by 11.1%. Volkswagen passenger car deliveries were up by an impressive 10.5% to more than 1.3 million cars, driven by a robust sales record and strong demand in China, the US, Russia and India.</p>
          <p>Audi deliveries rose by 10.8% compared to last year to 346,000 cars, being very successful in China, the US, Russia and Japan. &#x160;KODA expanded deliveries up to 243,000 cars, mainly due to the strong demand in Russia, China and India. SEAT suffered from the weak Western European markets, whereas Bentley has managed to expand the deliveries significantly.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles increased deliveries by 7.9% with strong demand in Germany and in Russia. As expected, markets for heavy commercial vehicles and buses are losing growth momentums in 2012. For the full year, the global market is expected to reach roughly the same level as 2011. MAN and Scania faced headwinds during the first quarter of 2012. Worsening economic conditions in some of the major markets, particularly in Western Europe, had a negative impact on truck demand and led to an intensification of the competitive environment. During the first quarter of 2012, total Scania deliveries decreased by 14.82% to 16,000 vehicles, compared to the same period of 2011. The Volkswagen Group has consolidated MAN since November 9, 2011.</p>
          <p>To give an overview of the sales performances, we have included the comparison to the period of January 2011 to March 2011 for information only in this chart. As you can see, MAN recorded total vehicle deliveries of 35,000 units, which rounded was at the same level as the quarter one in the previous year. Sales revenue in the Power Engineering business area at MAN climbed about 5% compared to the first three months of 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, let us now take a look at a few highlights on some of our new models, which will provide a good base for our sales performances in the coming months. The Volkswagen Passat Alltrack pleasure before business, the off-road oriented lifestyle version of the Passat Variant, as a crossover between an Estate and SUV, offers the best updated advantage of both worlds. Shown at the Tokyo Motor Show in November last year, the Volkswagen Passat Alltrack was introduced in the market this March.</p>
          <p>The Volkswagen new Sagitar characterizes itself by its modern dynamic and representative design, as well as its un-compromised driving experience, which are based on Volkswagen's quality standards and German engineering. The Volkswagen new Sagitar hit the road in China last month.</p>
          <p>The successful Audi A1 has captured a new segment for Audi. The new Audi A1 Sportback expands the range offering two additional doors, more functionality, more practicability, more comfort and roominess. The A1 Sportback had its world premiere at the Tokyo Motor Show and was introduced in the markets in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>The &#x160;KODA Citigo 4 Doors offers best-in-class roominess and spaciousness that provides flexibility and comfort every day, creating more space for life, shown at the Geneva Motor Show in March this year the &#x160;KODA Citigo 4 Doors was introduced in the markets this month.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Klingler. Now let's return to Mr. P&#xF6;tsch for some more details on the key elements of our financial performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>In the first three months of 2012, sales revenue increased by 26.3% to &#x20AC;47.3 billion. Excluding the first-time consolidation of MAN at &#x20AC;3.9 billion, the increase was still an impressive 15.9% to &#x20AC;43.4 billion. Higher volume contributed &#x20AC;3.7 billion through the improvement. The pricing was flat, while mix, including both products and country mix, contributed &#x20AC;1.1 billion to our performance, reflecting our strong portfolio of products.</p>
          <p>Currency, mainly the US dollar added to the further &#x20AC;0.3 billion. And finally, our Financial Services division was up &#x20AC;0.8 billion, bringing the total sales revenue to &#x20AC;47.3 billion for the quarter.</p>
          <p>The increase in sales revenue was an important factor behind the improvement in the operating profit, which increased from &#x20AC;2.9 billion to &#x20AC;3.2 billion in the first quarter. The lower percentage growth in operating profit versus the increase in sales revenue is due to a significant purchase price accounting charge, together with ongoing cost relating to the introduction of new products, including preparatory works relating to vehicles on the MQB architecture. Excluding these effects, the operating profit margin was at a level close to that achieved in the first quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>Delving into the details shows that volume, together with price and mix effects, came to a total positive &#x20AC;0.7 billion. Currency after hedging was a plus of &#x20AC;0.1 billion. In the first quarter, we were able to continue to reduce our product cost by &#x20AC;0.3 billion. Fixed cost and depreciation increased by &#x20AC;0.6 billion, which reflects the growth in our production base, as well as the significant efforts to prepare the company for the introduction of cars built on the MQB tool kit later in the year.</p>
          <p>The contribution from our truck and power engineering activities was negatively influenced by the significant charge for PPA resulting in a net negative swing of &#x20AC;0.2 billion for the quarter. Finally, earnings from financial services were maintained at the same high earnings level of the first quarter 2011. In total, the operating result was &#x20AC;3.2 billion for the first three months.</p>
          <p>Turning now to cash flow in the Automotive Division, operating cash flow reduced from &#x20AC;5.1 billion to &#x20AC;2.9 billion with the key driver being the movement in working capital, which moved from a positive effect of &#x20AC;1.5 billion in the first quarter 2011 to a negative &#x20AC;1.9 billion. This movement reflects an increase in stock levels, which moved towards a more normalized level ahead of significant model changeovers.</p>
          <p>In addition, the first part of the dividend we receive annually from China was, this year, agreed in the first quarter, but the cash is expected to follow in the second quarter, thereby driving up receivables at March 31 by around &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>And finally, MAN completed a transaction related to Ferrostaal with MPC Industries, resulting in a cash outflow of &#x20AC;350 million. Cash flow from investing activities fell from &#x20AC;4.5 billion to &#x20AC;2.5 billion, excluding equity investments, which in particular included the purchase of Porsche Holding Salzburg in the first quarter of 2011, cash flow in investing activities increased from &#x20AC;1.3 billion to &#x20AC;2.1 billion. Within this, CapEx almost doubled in the first quarter to &#x20AC;1.7 billion, reflecting, in particular, the upfront investments for MQB derived cost.</p>
          <p>The CapEx ratio was 4%. For the full year, we cannot route that it will be over 6% with the usual seasonality pattern weighed towards the second half. Net cash flow over the first three months for the Automotive Division came in at a positive &#x20AC;400 million.</p>
          <p>Staying with the Automotive Division, net liquidity at the end of first quarter was &#x20AC;15.8 billion, down just over &#x20AC;1 billion over the year-end 2011, reflecting the significant investments in our future I just outlined on the previous slide, plus the investment of &#x20AC;1.4 billion in increasing our stake in MAN to just over 70% of the voting rights.</p>
          <p>As we announced last week at our AGM, we have increased our stake to 73.76% of the voting rights as at April the 18, 2012 and 71.89% of the total capital. Our actions in 2012 built on the increase in our holding in 2011 bring us closer to the realization of an integrated commercial vehicles group of Volkswagen, MAN and Scania. Our liquidity level of &#x20AC;15.8 billion allows sufficient flexibility to execute our strategic plans, irrespective of fluctuations in the capital markets.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to the financial performance of our 10 brands. For the first time, the first three months, the Volkswagen passenger car brand posted earnings of &#x20AC;1.1 billion, up slightly on the prior-period despite the impact of the preparations for MQB. Audi increased its earnings to &#x20AC;1.4 billion for an 11.4% margin, maintaining a double-digit level for the seventh quarter in a row. &#x160;KODA recorded a result of &#x20AC;209 million on the back of continued international success.</p>
          <p>SEAT suffered an increased loss, flowing, in particular, from the dramatic decline in Southern European automotive markets, as mentioned already by Mr. Klingler. Bentley continued its recovery, turning around a loss from the prior-year first quarter to report a small profit. Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles increased its operating results by 35% to &#x20AC;124 million.</p>
          <p>Scania booked an operating result of &#x20AC;262 million, posting an impressive 11% margin, despite tough market conditions. MAN was included for the first time in the first quarter with a result of &#x20AC;223 million before purchase price allocation. The other line in the chart includes the elimination of inter-company sales, the earnings from Porsche Holding Salzburg, as well as PPA charges.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen financial services earnings was slightly up at &#x20AC;311 million. Combining the automotive and financial services divisions gives total operating profit of &#x20AC;3.2 billion for the first three months.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the financial results which, for the first three months, came to a positive &#x20AC;1.1 billion, which stands in stark contrast to a negative &#x20AC;0.7 billion in the first quarter 2011. Here we include the results from our equity-accounted investments, changes in the valuations of derivatives, as well as interest related costs.</p>
          <p>Our Chinese joint ventures recorded a pro rata strongly positive operating result of &#x20AC;848 million in the quarter. Our indirect interest in Porsche AG also booked an excellent result. In addition, the net value of our put and call rights relating to our indirect investment in Porsche AG grew due to lower interest rates, driving the booking of a further positive &#x20AC;600 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In total, profit before tax came in at &#x20AC;4.3 billion close to double the level of the first quarter 2011. So to bring this part of the call today to a close, just a few words on our outlook statement, which you can read in the interim report in full. While we expect continued growth in the global car market in the remainder of the year, the pace of growth is expected to slow. For the full year, we are anticipating a decline in the Western European market, although the German market is expected to come in flat for the full year.</p>
          <p>Our key group strength is our unique brand portfolio and its accompanying management model, which underpins it. As we move further into 2012, in the midst of a global economy facing uncertainty with a strong balance sheet and improved cost structure, together with higher flexibility and production and the strong product portfolio with a leading edge in technology, we consider ourselves well prepared for the challenges ahead.</p>
          <p>While the inclusion of MAN will lead to higher revenues in 2012, the purchase price accounting required will minimize the impact of MAN's inclusion within the operating result.</p>
          <p>To sum up, while Q1 has in no doubt provided a solid platform for reaching our 2012 goals, many challenges remain. We aim to match the level of operating results achieved in 2011, which we regard as no mean achievement, given this stiffening competition in Europe and slowing growth of the global market. In the long run, we aim to be the leading automotive group in the world qualitatively, quantitatively and, of course, financially.</p>
          <p>We're making good progress, the evidence is there. We are on the right path and as more of the steps in our strategy fall into place, the sustainability of our earnings becomes more and more assured.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch. We will now begin with the question and answer part of today's conference call, starting first with the questions of analysts. Let's take the first question please.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our first question from Horst Schneider of HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Horst Schneider from HSBC. Three questions, if I may. The first one relates to your order intake, maybe you can comment a bit on that. We heard yesterday from Renault that they record some better order intake also in Europe towards the end of the quarter. So can you confirm that? And in that context, also, I want to know if the second quarter, in particular, also for Volkswagen will be again the peak quarter in terms of earnings.</p>
          <p>I think the pattern that we have seen over the last few years is that Q2 is always the strongest quarter. I think, this year the situation is somewhat exceptional because you have got the changeover of the goals in H2. But is it right to assume that Q2 earnings will increase further and this will be the top quarter in terms of earnings?</p>
          <p>Then the second question is, I want to know if the result that we have seen now in others is somewhat sustainable. And I want to know in particular what is the PPAs that is included here in this others result?</p>
          <p>Then the last question is related to the MQB platform launch. We have seen, in the fourth quarter, high burden for that. And I want to know how many burdens &#x2013; how much is MQB ramp-up burdens result in Q1 and how many burdens we can expect for the next two quarters from that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Horst. So you have three questions for us. The first question refers actually to our order intake, if you can give here some details, where do we stand there and you would like to know if the second quarter with regard to earnings, if that would be the strongest quarter this year.</p>
          <p>The second question refers to the line others and you would like to know how big or huge is the impact coming from PPAs. And the last question refers to MQB, if we can give some more details on the burden in Q1 coming from MQB, and what is our estimate or outlook with regard to the MQB impact for the rest of the year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if you'll allow, I will start first with the order intake. It is probably mostly concentrated on Western Europe, your question. Undoubtedly, in some of the countries, the crisis is very existing. This is, for example, true in Italy. This is true in Spain. This is true, if you want so, for the total Southern Rim in Europe.</p>
          <p>We still have a reasonably good order intake. But I need to be, as well, clear that in these countries, but the total markets will go down and have come down to a certain extent, even heavily, the situation for the customers is not so positive. So, just for a reminder, the market in France and the market in Italy fell down by just about 20% and others like Portugal and Greece more than doubled.</p>
          <p>So, we don't know what Renault is comparing to what; the only thing what we know in general is that our order intake over the last quarter was reasonable, that our order stock is reasonably high, that we have achieved to reduce a part of our delivery times and that we know that we look with a very detailed analysis in everything what is happening in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>So, if you go then outside from Western Europe, you have a different view. North America, you have seen that we have increased heavily our orders and, therefore as well, our sales. This is as well true for Russia. We see reasonable positive development in India concerning the total market, as well our performance. We know that in South America, there are some good lights and sometimes, as well, questions about the good lights. And in China, well you have seen as well in our performance we have, in general, increased. So, coming back to that, it's probably more concentrated to Western Europe. We are not over what we have expected and we are not under what we have expected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What is now the size of your order book in Europe, could you quantify that two months, three months of sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Reasonable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'm going to continue with the question on the second quarter, whether it's the normal seasonality pattern we can expect a peak there. Clearly, the second quarter should not be a bad quarter as always. Possibly and for the reason already mentioned ramping up production for big volume models, the development might not be as pronounced as in, let's call it, a normal year.</p>
          <p>To the question on the PPA charge in the others line, now there, first of all, if I can recall my statement from earlier times, on the basis of the current situation with regards to acquired companies, we're looking at, first of all, a full year 2012, which will represent the peak in terms of PPA charges with an over-proportional effect in the first quarter summing up everything, both in the operating result, where the majority sits, and the financial result with the total amount of close to &#x20AC;0.5 billion.</p>
          <p>We will clearly see a development where, over a period of time, we'll see the PPA charges coming slightly down. Again, we have to expect a full year charge of around &#x20AC;1.5 billion in terms of PPA charges.</p>
          <p>Third question on the MQB impact, first of all, let me make sure that there is proper understanding on what that means in terms of which content do the various cost related have. We are talking development costs, of course, investments and consequently, the cost related to investments and significant ramp-up cost for the respective model, of course, also a significant cost for the re-shuffling of production schemes and an under-optimal situation in the plants where the restructuring process has to be initiated.</p>
          <p>So, this clearly triggered a substantial amount of costs also in the first quarter and as we've said manifold times, we have to look at a situation where each quarter in 2012 will be affected. We are talking over an above three digit amounts, and the whole situation is going to drag on into 2013.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just three quick ones. Mr. Klingler, on the presentation chart number seven. The market development without China, and I know it's a relative chart and it's against the performance year 2007. But it indicates that on an absolute basis, in the coming quarters, you expect the markets outside China to be on lower levels than what we saw in the first quarter. Where is this regionally? Do you think run rates in Europe will further decline from where we stood in the first quarter, or is this incorporating some other regions? Could you just shed some light on it?</p>
          <p>Secondly, with regards to the cash flow development, we saw a very steep rise in receivables in the quarter. Could you just tell us what is behind that? I understand the Chinese dividend might have played a role in that as well, could you quantify it?</p>
          <p>And then, lastly, to your decision to step up the MAN in the quarter to now almost 74% ownership, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, I don't expect you to share your thoughts really on timing on any further action. But, just conceptionally, could you share with us your thought process with regards to a potential domination agreement, would it allow Volkswagen to do anything different than what is the position today?</p>
          <p>And finally, on that subject, also with regards to your net liquidity and all the further projects that you have still outstanding with Porsche and so on, do you feel that &#x20AC;15.8 billion in light of the current still very high uncertain economic environment is sufficient to pursue all these steps basically within the next one and a half to two years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jochen. You have three questions for us. The first question is for Mr. Klingler. With regard to the market development, also without China, if he can give you some more information, where do we see here the development. Then the second question refers to the cash flow development and the receivables, if we can quantify here more the Chinese dividend and if we can give you more details.</p>
          <p>And the last question refers to our strategy with regard to MAN, if we can give you some more details or some more information with regard to a possible domination agreement. And the last question was with regard to the net liquidity. You are asking us if around &#x20AC;16 billion net liquidity will be sufficient actually for all our strategic plans and projects we are heading for, if that would be enough even in this tough environment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe I'll start with your first question concerning this chart on page seven. I think, first for explanation reason, this is a chart we chose on percentage the comparison to 2007. And therefore, we need to understand what has happened in 2007.</p>
          <p>In 2007, the year started slower than it ended. So, you have a very strong market in the second half of the year 2007. Therefore, a big part of the relative difference is coming from the base year 2007. So in general, we do not see major changes during the year, but the comparison to 2007 and the base of 2007 is different, as the second half of the year in 2007 was stronger than the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>So, I think that gives you, from that perspective of page number seven, the feeling. But that's concerning the paper. In general, we see on the markets, as we said, compared to last year, a small growth worldwide. But these growths are happening in different regions on a different level.</p>
          <p>So, we see a positive momentum in China concerning the passenger cars. I'm not talking about light commercials. We see a positive trend in the United States in general. So the market is coming back, still on a lower level, but it's coming back. We see, as well, in South America, pretty stable and positive development, as it is in India and still a positive momentum in Russia.</p>
          <p>We've mentioned before that the market in Western Europe are not in the same shape. There's a big difference, if you want so, from the Southern Rim to the Northern Rim, knowing that the Southern Rim will have, for this year, in our feeling, a negative development and the Northern Rim will probably be more or less stable, having smaller decreases.</p>
          <p>We should not forget that some of the countries are in a recession. So Spain is in recession. UK has announced if you remember well yesterday that there is a recession time. We shall see what's happening with Italy. So the European and Western European markets, as I mentioned before, are reasons for us to believe that we need to be extremely close and that we serve with all efforts necessary to react as fast as possible if further changes are coming.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, there was the next question then on cash flow, working capital side, when I mentioned that there is a specific effect with regards to the receivables. And in the receivables position, there is an amount booked roughly of &#x20AC;1 billion, which represents a short-term timing difference referring to a dividend decision, which was taken in the first quarter at one of our Chinese joint ventures, which we then expect to reverse in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Comparing this position with the first quarter 2011, of course, creates a bit of an issue because the situation was different in 2011. Second question with regard to our shareholding in MAN and which kind of, further action could be expected, what can we already do. Now very clearly, we always said and gave a number of indications that we think there are significant synergies, which can be created in as we put this integrated truck group. And our opinion there has to know extent changed in the meantime. Of course, as always in human life, it's necessary to turn up with quite some effort. Now if you turn up with the effort, of course, you always want to participate in advantages coming out of this.</p>
          <p>So that's mainly the reason why we stepped up the shareholding in MAN. What can we do already? That's quite a lot because, as you are well aware, we received approval by the cartel authorities already. Of course, in order to treat all the shareholders on a fair basis, we need to assure the arm's lengths principle or, in other words, we have to make sure that whatever is done in terms of a corporation between the related companies is advantages for all the shareholders and all the companies.</p>
          <p>We are a quite used to work on that basis as we have demonstrated at Porsche. So that's a reasonable basis to work. And if there is any reason to think further on, we clearly declared that we want to keep all our options in that regard open, and that could also include the possibility of a domination agreement for MAN SE.</p>
          <p>The final question then on the net liquidity side, now clearly it's an appropriate question of whether this liquidity position looking to potential future projects, whether this is sufficient, it's a reasonable question, I would say. Nevertheless, even if we keep in mind that the number we addressed in terms of net liquidity to serve the needs of the group on a secure basis, which was roughly &#x20AC;5 billion in the past, which needs to be revised upwards on the basis of the Group, which has become much larger in the mean time.</p>
          <p>But I would assume, it should not be more than &#x20AC;7 billion to serve these needs. So, on that basis, I think it's obvious that we have quite some playing ground available. From today's point of view, we would judge the situation as such that we don't see limitations to our strategic intentions on the one side and we think the position is absolutely robust and solid to support our A rating in the future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Let's have the next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Michael Tyndall of Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, it's Mike Tyndall from Barclays. Thanks for taking my question. Just one or two, I guess, the first one is relation to MAN. Given that you've got antitrust approval, can you just confirm whether or not any inter-company supply agreements need to be on an arm's length basis or can you actually supply engines to MAN without the need for that approval?</p>
          <p>The second question just related <mark type="audio gap" /> (45:20) wrong, it's on a percentage of completion with your suppliers. I'm just wondering whether or not we're still thinking of a smooth cost versus Q4, Q1 and Q2 and whether or not perhaps there is a possibility that Q1 costs have rolled into Q2?</p>
          <p>And then, I guess, the final question is, I mean, the Q1 results were startling in terms of how good they were. I'm just wondering if that was a surprise to you, as well, given your full year planning and perhaps if you could tell us where the surprise is coming from, is it market share, is it pricing? I'm just curious to know whether or not you're looking at these results in the same sort of view as we are. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Michael, thank you. So then, we have three questions. The first one relates to MAN. How we can actually, after having the antitrust approval, how we can work together with MAN, if we have to do everything at arm's length principle? So the second question refers to MQB, the sequencing of costs, if we can give you some more details. And the last question refers to our results in Q1. And you would like to know if we were surprised by the good performance of the Volkswagen Group or were actually &#x2013; what are the reasons for that good performance if we can give you some more explanations, is that coming from pricing, market share gains, or whatever?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, first of all, again on the truck company side, what can we do and on which basis, as I explained, we have received full antitrust approval, so all the cartel issues are gone there. Nevertheless, it's very clear, we need to deal &#x2013; to do whatever we do on a clear &#x2013; on things basis which essentially means we need to prove that if there is any common dealing, it is advantageous for all companies involved and it's contagious for all shareholders.</p>
          <p>Second question, is there any push-forward of costs MQB related into future quarters? No, not really. I mean, I think may be another point here. We started installing MQB equipment already some mid last year, so we're quite advanced in this process and the effect is well limited on whether by accounting somewhat would be taken as CapEx or its being kept as down payment until we receive final &#x2013; the supply receives final approval from our side, that's really not substantial.</p>
          <p>So again to say what I already said, we need to take into consideration that there will be quite significant burden to the P&amp;L also in upcoming quarters. Not necessary, in a substantial way, bigger as we seen in the fourth quarter 2011 and the first quarter 2012. And this is, of course, just to create the basis for a decent number of future models which clearly will assure that we receive a very decent payback on our investments.</p>
          <p>The other question, then, were we surprised? No, not really. I think &#x2013; actually to put it that way, we don't like surprises. I think, to look a little bit at the motivation behind your question, I think, if the P&amp;L is being dealt with in a more surgical way and effort is taken to distract a number of specific issues like the PPA charges, one would find out that we are close to the relative performance in operating profit, compared to the first quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, before one takes this as a positive, we should not forget that volume is up, sales revenue is up. So one would expect a better performance compared with the first quarter 2011, which of course had clear limitations by the whole process of reorganization and restructuring we are currently going through. So that's why, to cut a long story short, we would pretty much say it is what it is and it's been expected.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As there is a huge interest, I would really like to ask you to raise two questions only. If not, we need to reduce to one question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Stuart Pearson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, so two questions. I mean, firstly on China, clearly huge profits there in the quarter. I want you to just update us, given what was said about inventory at the Beijing Auto Show on Monday, how that market is looking into the second quarter, both on the mass and premium side, particularly on pricing?</p>
          <p>As a follow on to that just the dividends, you mentioned of &#x20AC;1 billion issue in Q1. I wonder if you just &#x2013; I think you said that was just from one of your JVs. I wonder if you could just remind us the total dividend out of the China JVs payable for fiscal 2011 and how we should think about that dividend policy going forward.</p>
          <p>And then just my second question, just looking at your geographic sales performance, it seems the biggest increase is in Russia this year. And actually, Russia, by the end of this year, looks like it could be bigger than the French market, which we spend a lot of time worrying about. But how profitable is the Russian market for Volkswagen Group? How does that compare to perhaps the Group margin average and what is the average for that market, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Stuart. There is more or less five question or so. So, I have to shorten it a bit. I'm really sorry. So, the first question refers to &#x2013; no, the first two question refers to China actually, so the first question is with regard to inventory if we can give an outlook how the second quarter would look like. Then the second part of the question is dividends. So we mentioned the receivables in the first quarter and what is the expectation for the dividends from the joint ventures in total. What is our expectation, what we received this year from them? And then, we come to the next question. It's in regard to the increase in Russia. We have seen a very good sales performance there. And if we can describe a little bit the development and the margin expectation and give our outlook. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think, if I understand right, your question basically is what is the development in China total market. So we believe that in the passenger car market, there is a growth potential. So the first three months, that was about a 5% growth on the passenger cars party, not on the commercial vehicles. And we believe that over the next months to come, there will be a good potential of further growth and we also have said since the beginning, if we have somebody that asks us on the vision for the Chinese markets, we believe that is a one-digit growth potential existing.</p>
          <p>On the inventory side, there are inventories, which are in the market, in general. So we have different competitors who have, at least what we have understood, some discussions on their inventory levels. We can tell you that we have no issues on our inventory and we don't have here any feeling to have any reason to believe that we are overstocked. So, in general, Chinese business for us is running well.</p>
          <p>Now, if you come to the second part of the question, which was Russia, as you know, we are not giving information about our margin and margin structure and what margin we do. Please understand it. It seems to be for us a question concerning our competitiveness. We are running effectively very well in Russia. The market is driven by a positive economical situation, as well it was a little bit driven in the first months by the preparation of the new election, which has happened then February, March.</p>
          <p>But let's be honest, that is a good feeling, a good performance, but the performance in United States seems to me to be, at least on the same level, if not even on a higher level, to be evaluated because we are back. We are back in the US and we have done a very, very good performance in coming to a different status.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the dividend from China, as I explained this specific incident, which you can find in receivables and working capital, is just part of the whole situation. And we do expect as a dividend payment for 2011 to be paid then in several tranches in 2012, at least &#x20AC;1.5 billion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, everyone. It's Arndt Ellinghorst, Credit Suisse. I have two questions, the first one is concerning your at-equity result. You reported, obviously, a very strong number with &#x20AC;952 million in the first quarter. Firstly, can you share your view whether this is a sustainable level of the at-equity line for the rest of the year for the other quarters? And also whether a one-third, two-third split between Porsche AG and your China contributions, whether this is a sort of reasonable assumption for us?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I have to say I was a bit surprised when I saw that VW or VW Bank took &#x20AC;2 billion from the EU's LTRO funds. May I ask whether you can share your rationale and why you believe it to be appropriate for company with about &#x20AC;16 billion of net cash to tap these crisis funds and also what you're intending to use these funds for? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Arndt for your two questions. The first question relates to our at-equity result and if we can give you some more details, first of all, how is the split coming from the Chinese joint ventures and the earnings from Porsche AG, and if the current at-equity result is more or less a sustainable level for the remaining quarters of the year and then you would like to know why Volkswagen did decide to take part in the ECB funding with &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, with all the difficulty in place to get single numbers for the future, but we expect, with all the respect for an excellent Porsche performance, but we think possibly there is a bit more potential with regard to the Chinese joint ventures. So that ratio might change a little bit to the favor of China over the period of time. Anyway, we do expect a positive financial result for the full year. And then on financial services, it's very clear. We look at the situation on who is allowed to participate in any program and if that is favorable, we would not see any reason not to participate. And that's perfectly the reason why we took the amount of &#x20AC;2 billion. It's just complimenting our funding base for financial services.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. First question again on MAN. Maybe you could give indication for the reason for buying preference shares in MAN? And can you confirm that you would not need that for domination agreement? And the second question would be on Porsche. On pending decision here, have you made any progress on that regard in the first quarter? And have you received any indication with regard to the timing of the legal issues, any new indication in that regard? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Daniel. Thank you very much. You have two questions for us. The first again to MAN and you would like to know the reason for buying preference shares, and if we can give more details about a possible domination agreement or to a possible intention. Then the second question refers to Porsche and actually the strategy to achieve an Integrated Automotive Group with Porsche, if there is any progress so far with regard to the timing, and also if we can give an update of the legal issues at Porsche SE?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, on the MAN, why did we buy pref shares? As I already mentioned, if you tune up with efforts, you want to participate in the advantages also. The price of the prefs is stable, so we didn't find any reason not to buy pref shares of MAN. Then, again, as I already elaborated on, on the basis of the position reached, we still keep all our options open, and that could also include the possibility of a domination agreement.</p>
          <p>In terms of Porsche, obviously, I talked could potentially long on that issue, but to cut a long story short here, not so much news. We still try to identify an alternative route; that's a lot of work to be done with a number of authorities. And from today's point of view, it's simply speaking not judgeable, whether we will be able to identify an alternative route at all. Of course, if there is any progress we will inform the market.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the legal issues, I also have to say, nothing to be reported what was not already in the newspapers, which &#x2013; in an attempt to put everything in one bag, which means essentially more unlikely that we would hear anything new both from the US situation and in Germany before the second half of 2012.</p>

So I was wondering whether that performance will have an impact on your objective, i.e., could you reach the target of reaching breakeven ahead of 2013, could it be as soon as 2012?

          <p>So, your question refers to the US, if we can give you an update, if you stick to our target with regard to break-even at latest in 2013 or if we can achieve that even earlier, if we could give there an update?</p>

          <p>I think the &#x2013; first understand, we've opened our Chattanooga plant in the mid of last year and we started production of the new Passat. We've introduced the new Passat there in end of the last year and we have an overwhelming success with our new product, which gives us a very positive feeling and which gives us, I would say so, the feeling that what we have planned seems to work because, of course, planning is one and realization is another. At the end of the day we see that the realization of our plans are there.</p>
          <p>We've launched as well about two years ago <mark type="indiscernible" /> and half year the Jetta there, as well very successful and we've launched the Beetle. So these three main products make a big difference now in terms of a contribution as well as in terms of capacity to come to a different level of volumes. Audi as well shows interesting and positive development on a nice level.</p>
          <p>So we have broken &#x2013; or we have achieved last year the breakeven in the sales company. I think that's first achievement for the brand Volkswagen, and we still believe that in 2013, we have good reasons to say that we can have the breakeven on a total level of the company. So we're in a good track. We're confident, but it's still some work to do.</p>

          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon, Bernard Donges from JPMorgan. So, my question is on the components of you EBIT mix. So, on the volume mix prices impact of &#x20AC;0.7 billion that you show, could you likely give us like the breakdown of like the three components? And in particular, I'm interested to know if the price impact on operating profit is a 100% pass-through from the price impact that you report on revenues on the other bridge. And basically, you say it's also like some incentive in the form of re-option when you buy like cars that are not reflected there? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon everyone. The one question is on Brazil &#x2013; pretty big, I think, it's nearly 20% of your revenues for VW Brand. Obviously, we've had the situation where imports have sharply fallen back after the extra import tax. I don't know whether you can particularly comment on the pricing situation for your sales in Q1 compared to say Q4 and compared to year-on-year just to give us a feel. But overall I think your price was flat year-on-year. Is Brazil positive year-on-year and positive Q-on-Q? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Adam. You are interested in Brazil and our pricing situation there, if the pricing was similar to Q4 or how was the development there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure that there has been a change in the laws concerning the import essentially between Mexico and Brazil. That is one thing. I don't think that in first quarter there has been any impact on pricing. But I believe, if I understand right, the question is in general, how is the situation? In general, the Brazilian market, as we have said, as well, the last time is under heavy pressure of competitors.</p>
          <p>We see new competitors going into the market, obviously, as well that there are more and more, let's say, brands establishing their foothold there. We have achieved in this first quarter, a reasonable good result concerning sales and we had on pricing, a reasonably good result as well. But let's be honest, there is a lot of pressure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just &#x2013; are you still seeing the impact from the Chinese brands particularly coming in, is that still there? I thought they had pulled back a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Chinese brands have fallen down, essentially due to the change of the import law last year, which has been announced, I think, in December. But they are localizing and they are making new plans and they are coming. So, it's not an effect of the Chinese brands. By the way, I'm not sure that Volkswagen is competing with Chinese brands at all. It's an effect of the investments of our direct competitors who'd be there in the market like Ford or like for example General Motors.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi good afternoon. I just want to go back to the comparison of the revenue and profit bridges and then just look at the, what I call the drop-through rates, in other words, the proportion of profit to revenue growth, the &#x20AC;0.7 million of drop through on the revenue growth, and this quarter is about 14.6%. If we go back and look at the full year 2011, it's 21.9%. And indeed in the first quarter 2011 that same ratio was 31.4%. So we're a seeing a fairly sharp deterioration in the apparent drop-through of revenue growth to profit growth. And I was just wondering if we could explore that, what do you think &#x2013; quite sharp deteriorations there, is there something behind that in the accounts or is there something behind that in terms of underlying trading? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Charles. So you have a question, and you want to compare the development of the revenue and the profit line, and if we can give you some more information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On drop-through from volume price mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me give it a try. Maybe I could help you. So if you look at the P&amp;L structure, as I already elaborated on, if you take the <mark type="indiscernible" /> and you would add back the PPA chart with regards to MAN, then you end up with an operating result which is roughly &#x20AC;350 million, &#x20AC;360 million higher than the operating results stated or, in other words, in relative terms, it means 7.5% operating result relative to sales revenue.</p>
          <p>If you compare this with first quarter 2011, it's been 7.8%. So you see, it's pretty close. Now, then of course, as I stated, and I can repeat this, of course, we should have expected an even stronger performance if we did not, at the same point in time, revamp, restructure some major plants in Germany by the introduction of the new modular toolkit. That's been, of course, also another very major effect. So, over and above, it means, once we return to more normal circumstances, we have to keep product on track 2013, 2014 we expectedly will look at another level of performance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know, I should just shut up, but just very quickly just to confirm that therefore there are cost items that would effectively be buried in the volume price and mix element in the profit bridge, that's my understanding of what you've just said?</p>

          <p>We will take a question from Christian Breitsprecher of Macquarie. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. It's Christian Breitsprecher from Macquarie. Just one question again on the timing of the MQB headwinds. So basically, as I understand you, the MQB headwinds are not going to increase in the following quarters. It's pretty much on even level of Q4, Q1 and what we see in the coming quarters. So, the only thing that can really kind of spoil the party is really the run-out and ramp-up of Audi A3 and Volkswagen Golf, is that the correct picture?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can answer directly, you have to &#x2013; of course, towards the end of the year, you have to add on the new &#x160;KODA Octavia and also the SEAT Leon. It's both volume cars and, of course, once we rebuilt the factories to a large extent, we will take precaution for the next models also to come. So, again, as I've said, the whole year will remain burdened by this, but don't worry, we'll get the return next year and the year after.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. So I do not see any request coming from journalists. So if there is still an interest, then you should let yourself, because if not we close the call.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay that does not seems okay. I am happy to close the call for today. Thank you very much for taking part in our conference call. Good bye from Volkswagen.</p>
