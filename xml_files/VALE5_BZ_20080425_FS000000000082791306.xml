        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning to those who are in this side of the Atlantic; good afternoon to those at the other side of the Atlantic. First of all, I'd like to tell that unfortunately our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Fabio Barbosa will not attend the conference as he's in China attending an investor conference.</p>
          <p>The title of our 1Q08 earnings release, Staying Strong in a World of Changes, reflects I think pretty clearly what happened in this quarter. We had a very strong performance in face of a tough environment of currency, price volatilities, and no cash charge that distorted a little bit our real performance.</p>
          <p>In terms of production, we did very well. Iron ore production in the first quarter '08 despite this is a seasonally weak quarter, I'd like to emphasize this,  but it reached 74.5 million tonnes of iron ore helped by the good performance of Caraj&#xE1;s, Rukutu and the new mine of Fazend&#xE3;o.</p>
          <p>And in this quarter we achieved historical mark because our production in middle base accumulated over the last 12 months in the first quarter of 2008 exceeded the 300 million tonnes mark. The last time we had a historical mark was in the third quarter of 2004 when we reached for the first time 200 million tonnes of iron ore.</p>
          <p>So we continue to increase our exposure to the cycle, and in doing this we delivered in this quarter three new projects, three new platforms of cash flow and value creation for shareholders. The Fazend&#xE3;o mine in the Southeastern System with a capacity to produce 15.8 million tonnes of iron ore on a run-of-the-mine basis; the third Para plant of our affiliated joint venture, Samarco, with a capacity to produce 7.6 million tonnes of pellets that started operations in April; and finally a small but very important project in terms of our matching strategy for nickel, Dalian in the north of China, which has a capacity to produce 300,000 tonnes per year of finished nickel.</p>
          <p>Dalian is important because it's a project which is associated to the Goro nickel project in New Caledonia. Goro is going to produce 60,000 tonnes of nickel in matte with 78% of nickel content. And so it's going to ship its product to Dalian where we are going to produce a product with 97% of nickel purity. And to have the flexibility to play in the Chinese domestic market for stainless steel.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of that, we are going to change the profile of sales for the Chinese market that's too concentrated on plating on the plating market, represents more than 80% of our sales. And we are choosing more towards stainless steel because this product produced by Dalian will be focused on the stainless steel industry. Although China is a very large player in the plating market globally,  China represents 50% of the plating markets wherein we are very large player in this market; we have 40% of the sales of market share in the plating market. In the domestic Chinese market, plating represents only 20% of the consumption of nickel. So with Goro plus Dalian, we'll be exploiting a larger share of the large Chinese market.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, we spend this quarter only $1.7 billion. This is going to accelerate throughout the year. But 77% of our CapEx was focused on growth, project execution, plus research and development. We have been investing heavily in mineral exploration around the world focused in products like copper and coal in South America, Africa and Asia. And we are starting to have initial very favorable results.</p>
          <p>In terms of projects, we announced the cost revision of the On&#xE7;a Puma project, $2.3 billion from the $1.4 billion initial budget. This was due to the too much volatility to the appreciation of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar and also to the rising costs. As is well known, the mining industry faced a very tough environment in terms of cost because almost everything has price increasing, raw materials, equipment, spare parts, contractor service as well. In Salobo I, it's a project that is being developed that has very good expectations. So for revision of its CapEx budget upwards by $200 million to $1.1 billion against $900 million. And we are very optimistic about Salobo, about developing after Salobo I, Salobo II. And even there is a chance for Salobo III, having a very large copper operation at Salobo with more than 200,000 tonnes.</p>
          <p>Well, in terms of cost of goods sold, comparing the first quarter 2008 with the first quarter of 2007, there was an increase of about US$800 million. That's as is shown in this slide. Most of this was due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the main currencies that composed of our costs, talk about the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar.</p>
          <p>But it's important to highlight that even amid this environment of rising price for inputs, we managed to get $224 million in cost reduction.</p>
          <p>And talk about our effort paying off, in a quarter-over-quarter basis our cost for unit of output of course discounting the effect of depreciation and the of course the volatility, we managed to obtain cost reductions quarter after quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>And I would like to emphasize upon that in a tight market environment, one should not concentrate its attritions only in cost or cash cost per tonne. But there are several situations where we have to accept our cost increase, but conditions if marginal revenues are higher than marginal cost, this is the relevant economic decision. If there is an opportunity to increase production, increasing cost, but the additional revenues generated by that decision is going to be much higher than the additional cost, to be not rational, to not make that decision, do you need to give up cash flow and profit? It should not be on the very best interest of shareholders. Of course we are making a lot of efforts to fight costs, but our main driver is the comparison between marginal revenues with marginal costs.</p>
          <p>Our operation margins improved, attributed to the fourth quarter of 2007. For the company as a whole, it went back to 37.2%, up 430 basis points, and across our three main divisions, only the ferrous minerals division registered a decrease in margins. I want to call your attention that only $17 million of additional revenues rose from the iron ore price increase. The bulk of the iron ore price increase is going to be accrued from the second quarter onwards. A major part of our clients moved to the Japanese fiscal year, which starts on April the 1st, for the period relevant for price change. So only a small part of the price increase is retroactive, and a major part will be accrued from the second quarter onwards.</p>
          <p>Comparing the first quarter 2008 with the fourth quarter 2007, our EBITDA registered an increase of approximately $200 million, and it was helped by a reduction of SG&amp;A. SG&amp;A in the fourth quarter 2007 was very high. These are due to one off-events, like the expense with branding with installations of office outside Brazil with several provisions, and to a seasonal increase of profit-sharing provisions. So it decreased by US$232 million. There was the contribution of reduction in cost of goods sold, the contribution of an increase in sales price, and that more than offset the seasonal decrease in sales volumes.</p>
          <p>Comparing EBIT to the EBITDA reached in the first quarter 2008 with the one that we obtained in the first quarter 2007, it's important to see that if you normalize by the nickel price, the average realized nickel price, we should see an increase, not a decrease because in the first quarter 2007, nickel price was very high. The nickel average realized price reached $40.4 thousand per tonne. It increased by 29% compared to the first quarter 2008. And as I said that one should not expect this very high price to continue over time because it should be very good in a short-term view. But for the medium and long term it was not as positive that looks in the short term because of course this invites substitution.</p>
          <p>Our metal earnings decreased by 8.8% compared to the first quarter 2007, and in the last 12 months perspective, we have an interruption in our upward trend. It was $12.5 billion in 2007; it decreased to 11.7 billion. And this was the effect of the distortions caused by noncash charge. There was an increase; compared to the first quarter 2007, we have an increase of US$737 million in terms of noncash charge. Due to the so-called monetary variation on the position of our net liabilities in U.S. dollars, we have the effect of derivatives and market-to-market of some instruments.</p>
          <p>In terms of derivatives, we have positions in aluminum and copper. We are going to expire by the end of the year, December 2008. We still have a hedge about 55% of our aluminum production; in terms of copper, only 25% of our production. These hedge were made as way to protect our cash flow for the acquisition of Inco in 2006.</p>
          <p>In terms of nickel, we have a very small part of our productions, only 5%. In nickel the rationale for hedging is due to two factors. First, we have some space that are made at fixed price, and we use derivatives to keep our exposure to the price volatility of nickel. Secondly, we used to buy nickel feed from third parties at fixed price, and so in order to match our positions, we used to hedge against price volatility. So these are transitory, noncash events that of course contribute to distort our financial performance in the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>In terms of debt, it's important to highlight that our cost, our average cost of debt is in a downward trend. We managed to reduce the average cost of debt by 270 basis points in a period of three years. And most recently this was due to the action of LIBOR interest rates. Through swaps, we transformed an additional part of our debt into floating interest-based debt, but now we have 64% of our total debt indexed to the LIBOR. Taking advantage of the decrease in Libor to reduce the average cost of debt is part of our constant of reducing costs and achieving the lowest cost of capital possible in the environment.</p>
          <p>Well, looking to the future we believe that the cycle, the long cycle of minerals and metals are gaining momentum. We have seen widespread price rise for several products in different segments for base metals, for steel-making raw materials, precious metals, and minor metals such as cobalt. But the longer-term fundamentals remain strong. Demand for minerals and metals continues to increase supply growth is facing much of headwinds, more power shortage, in additional to the usual problems where the shortage of skilled labor, equipment, contractual service, environmental permits is the problem across the world.</p>
          <p>And we believe that the future, this key factor driving the demand for minerals and metals will be investment in infrastructure by emerging market economies - not only China, but India and several other even smaller countries like Vietnam. And I have to say that even in mature economies like U.S. and Australia, the lack of investment in infrastructure is increasingly recognized as a barrier to economic growth. There are discussions nowadays about the status of the transportation infrastructure in the U.S. that's contributing to a decreasing productivity in an economy that traditionally has moved by high productivity gains. So it's very good for the future of the demand for minerals and metals.</p>
          <p>Steel price are rising across the world for every type of product in every region of the world, reaching all-time highs; we present a slide of the crude steel price index that's reached an all-time high. And the excess demand for steel is generating very strong pressure on the demand for the steel-making raw materials.</p>
          <p>I don't know, all price were settled recently as you know. Metallurgical contracts for 2008, 2009 year were settled at price that runs from 205 to 210%. Manganese ferroalloys price reached an all-time high. To give you an example, our average realized price for the first quarter 2008 reached $2,100 per ton against $1,000 the first quarter last year. We settled the price for pellets for both for blast furnace pellets with a 86.67% increase over 2007, and also for direct reduction pellets maintaining the 10% premium over blast furnace pellets. And we saw a recovery of the premium of blast furnace pellets over fines that is an additional indication of the market tightness for these products.</p>
          <p>In terms of pellets, we see a rising trend of consumption around the world. In these four months of the year we have two new operations, two new from joint ventures. Zuhai in China that started operations in January, initially it's a very small operation with only 1.2 million tonnes per year. We have stake of 25%. Samarco, as we have mentioned. We have one new pellet planned to be delivered this year, Itabiritos in Brazil in the Southeastern System, with a capacity to produce 7 million tonnes. In the future we have Tubar&#xE3;o VIII at the port of Tubar&#xE3;o.</p>
          <p>Pending Board approval, we have our investment in Oman in the Middle East to take and finish off the growing - of the growth of Gulf countries that are investing dozens of billions, of $100 billion. And we are analyzing further investments in the Chinese market to exploit the mass Chinese market for pellets, and also in Malaysia to establish a distribution center for Southeast Asia.</p>
          <p>We foresee goods to production increasing by 4.7% over the next five years. That should be a slower pace than the first seven years of this decade, but still above trend and much above global <mark type="inaudible" /> growth. We see the demand for iron ore is still growing fast over the next five years by almost 11%. Percentage-wise it reflects a slower pace of growth but volume-wise we have a very significant amount of iron ore being required from the iron ore industry.</p>
          <p>In terms of nickel, despite the existence currently of very high inventories, we believe that the prospects are improving. We have seen what we believe the end of the stainless steel de-stocking cycle, the demand for other applications coming from the aerospace, the energy, and the chemical industry running steady. And the production of austenitic stainless steel view is recovering from the low in the third quarter when the austenitic ratio plunged to 70% from 77% as an average in 2006. Now it's approaching 75%; that's good for the demand for nickel. It means that the substitution pressures have eased.</p>
          <p>In terms of aluminum, aluminum's a typical case where power shortage are very important with energy price are boosting aluminum price. And for the future we believe there is a very good upside because on the one hand we are seeing projects for new smelters with a very high CapEx, with 7,000 to US$9,000 range against 2,000 to US$4,000 in the past, and on the other hand very high operating costs due to the rising costs of energy. So this conflict has to be solved by a decrease in energy price that we think that's unlikely, and/or an increase in aluminum price to make feasible the development of these projects.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, tougher market presents also very good prospects. Copper price reach an all-time high. This is due to the combination of production disruptions, low inventories, and well known supply constraints that come from lower grades from the lack of a large pipeline of projects. And the potential source of supply growth is basis - is still very significant political risk.</p>
          <p>So we do believe that Vale is well positioned with its large world-class worldwide pipeline, is very well positioned to take and finish off the long cycle that we still believe that will last for several years in the future.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. I will be happy to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction]. Our first question comes from Mr. Roger Downey with Credit Suisse.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Roger Downey&gt;: Good morning, everyone, good morning, Roberto. Another good set of results from an operational standpoint. But I think cost has still been a bit of an area of concern for a lot of people. I think it would be interesting to hear from you some guidance on what we can expect going forward. So what initiatives are in place to further increase, or further reduce cost rather, despite the fact that surely enough we're going to have another slight increase next year, which would offset costs, but just to get some idea on the initiatives there. And the second thing is on Caraj&#xE1;s, with the delays in the licensing there, what can we expect in terms of 2009, or is it more realistic just about thinking about 2010?</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: Good morning, Roger. Thank you for your questions. In terms of costs we launched an initiative to identify inefficiencies to correct them of course and do more with less. This is the general guideline. It is not something that is usual. Let's reduce cost by X million of billion of dollars because there are no such in efficiency in an environment of rising price or everything; it's just not feasible. The idea is to become leaner, more efficient, and this is a daily activity in our company. So there is nothing that I can tell you, that, well, we are going to reach $200 million of cost reduction or $2 billion of cost reduction. There are surprise coming from every side in terms of cost increase. What I can guarantee you is that we are doing our best in terms of reducing inefficiencies.</p>
          <p>Again, I would like emphasize this. In a tight environment where there are several difficulties in several segments of the market where demand is pressuring supply, the best guideline for decision is to figure out if the marginal revenue is higher than the marginal cost. One should not refrain from increasing production just because your cash cost will increase, but just if you have to verify if the marginal cost is lower or not than the marginal revenues. Of course this does not make us relax about cost. We have a constant concern about cost. We are investing to reduce them. We are doing our best to reduce them.</p>
          <p>In terms of Caraj&#xE1;s, we wrote in our press release that we are concerned about the obtention of the environmental license for the Caraj&#xE1;s expansion to 130 million tonnes per year. We are not sure that the project will have a delay, but there is a chance for delay. We are not sure that we'll able to deliver this project the second half of  2009. So there is a risk, but nothing that we can make sure that our production will suffer in the next year or not. For the time being, we keep our expectations that Caraj&#xE1;s' 130 million tonnes per year will come onstream the second half of 2009, and we'll keep you informed about this.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Roger Downey&gt;: Thank you, Roberto. Just a follow up on the cost side of things. Of course, the first quarter is traditionally seasonally low in terms of shipments. So in other words, your denominator in terms of tonnes is lower. Going forwards with some more capacity being added as you streamline your processes and start operating at full capacity in some of your expansions, should we see downward pressure on costs just from the economies of scale?</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: We'll see this in the more longer period of time. For instance, in iron ore, the expansion of our capacity in Caraj&#xE1;s over the next five years for sure will contribute to reduce operational cost, first because these are new mines with much lower stripping ratios, and secondly because Caraj&#xE1;s, given the very high iron content, has much lower cost than the Southern and Southeastern System. So we have an impact on the average operational cost for iron ore.</p>
          <p>The case of nickel, the same. We'll have new projects come onstream that will contribute to decreased cost. But you should not expect that next quarter we'll have lower costs due to an increase in sales or so. We'll have to see in the more longer term perspective.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Roger Downey&gt;: Okay,  Roberto. The second question on the nonferrous derivatives, I think it caught a lot of people by surprise. I don't think your explanations were very clear. Just going forward though, is this something we should expect will continue? Despite the fact that you said that some of these contracts will expire at the end of the year, will they be renewed and is this --?</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: Oh, it's --</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Roger Downey&gt;: Yes?</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: -- done. I'm sorry. Roger, we have a policy of no hedging.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Roger Downey&gt;: Exactly.</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: We hedge against metal's price volatility only in special situations like that. When we are financing the acquisition of Inco, we decided to hedge part of our positions, our production of aluminum copper to protect our cash flow to be sure that we have part of the cash flow will be delivered to pay for the service of the debt.</p>
          <p>In the case of nickel, the situation's in a very small scale. So we do not foresee a renewal of the position in aluminum-copper. In nickel, it's a policy to be exposed to the currency volatility and to hedge the positions. But in nickel feed, this is a continuous process. We do not foresee putting an end in this use of derivatives for nickel. But again, these are very small positions compared to our total productions, about 5% of the production.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, please restrict your questions to one at a time.</p>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Felipe Hirai with Merrill Lynch.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Felipe Hirai&gt;: Hi. Good morning, everyone, and good morning, Roberto. My question is regarding your nickel project. We saw a major increase in CapEx in On&#xE7;a Puma. So, Roberto, could you walk us through the main reasons for such increase in the On&#xE7;a Puma project and how this would impact the development of Vermelho?</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: Well, thank you for your questions, Felipe. First, we have approximate $900 million increase in the CapEx cost for On&#xE7;a Puma. One-third of it was due to the effect of the Brazilian real appreciation against the U.S. dollar. And $600, two-thirds of the cost increase, was due to the usual impact of rising costs for equipment for our contractor service, particularly the assembly of the electromechanical assembly. So it's something that is in line with environment that the mining industry face - quality, volatility, and input price increase.</p>
          <p>And it doesn't impact Vermelho. Vermelho is still being studied. The project is being built in order to be approved by the board of directors and constructed. I would like to highlight that our experience with Goro will facilitate a lot the development Vermelho in a much easier way, not only also Vermelho, but our projects for the next decade in Indonesia, Pomala, Sorowako II. We have a family of new nickel laterite limonite projects to be developed in the future, including a second phase of Goro that will be developed at a much lower cost than this initial phase, given the infrastructure is already in place and given the experience that we are gaining with the developing of the project.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Felipe Hirai&gt;: Okay, thank you. And, Roberto, and just a follow-up question on the increase in CapEx. Could we assume that your $60 billion CapEx program for the next five years that it could actually be higher than that? Or do you think that it's still too early to assume that it would be instead of 60, it could be 70 or even $80 billion?</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: At this point of time, we are not foreseeing making any change in our CapEx program for the next five years.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Felipe Hirai&gt;: Okay. Thank you, Roberto.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Jorge Beristain&gt;: Good morning, Roberto. Two questions. One is more of a strategic question. What can we interpret out of the collapse of the aluminum division now held with inside nonferrous and the increasing emphasis on your coal business as a standalone operation? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: Good morning, Jorge. It's a very interesting question. The aluminum business before the acquisition of the nickel operations were, in terms of the company context at that time, it was relatively large. With the nickel operations, it became relatively small. It represents only 15% of the revenues of the nonferrous minerals business. And as aluminum is part of the nonferrous metals of the base metal business, we decided to include the aluminum operations into the nonferrous metal division. So just for the sake of facilitating of not for any strategical reason, that it doesn't mean that we are downgrading the aluminum business in our general strategy.</p>
          <p>Secondly, why coal is separate. Our coal operation is still very small. We are just beginning. We are ramping up our Australian project. You see typically the case of Carborough Downs. Carborough Downs is an underground mine in central Queensland. It's still very small. As an underground mine, it produces only 800,000 tonnes of coal, mostly coking coal and PCI coal. Only with the project that we are starting to implement of long wall system, Carborough Downs will be a bigger mine and with much lower cost because small underground mines are not economically feasible due to the very high fixed cost to ventilation and safety investment. So to ramp up to 4.4 million met tons per year. So let's keep coal aside, it's different from ferrous min; it's not ferrous minerals and not a base metal. And so it will be a division on its own. I would say that it's still in its infancy. It's again nothing  in terms of a strategy.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Jorge Beristain&gt;: Okay. My second question is just related to some of the recent management departures that you've had, particularly Lancaster. I think he was one of the key architects behind the big push you've done in the last several years to spend hundreds of millions of dollars almost per quarter on R&amp;D and exploration. And I was wondering, is there anything concrete that we can point to in that plan that's been found in the past few years in terms of a new generation of projects? And what were the reasons behind the recent departures of both Stoliar and Lancaster?</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: Well, yes, well, we regret the departures of both. All good things come to an end and they decided to retire. They have their right to do that. It was Jose Lancaster  built a very good business, a global mineral exploration and multi-commodity mineral exploration program. He did a very good job. He's a very knowledgeable, very competent professional. We all of us at Vale admire him. He is a professional capacity. But one of the good things he has done was to build a very good team of very competent professionals that will have the challenge. But we think that they have their competences and the motivation to continue the work that Jose Lancaster  started. So things are going on, and we have great expectations about the results that we'll start to collect in the future.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Carlos de Alba&gt;: Good morning, everybody. Good morning, Roberto. Two questions. First one is related to the, following on Jorge's question on what was the spike in aluminum production cost only related to the higher spot prices for energy that we saw earlier in the year because of the low water levels in the reservoir? That is question number one. And question number two, Roberto, if I may, as far as the explanation of the higher SG&amp;A cost, it was quoted that out of 43 million increase in selling expenses, 30 million came from the coal division. However, when I looked at the revenues that we're reporting for that segment, there were only 72 million. So it seems to be quite a significant level of selling expenses for the revenues that are being generated right now. Thank you.</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: Well, good morning, Carlos. Regarding the first question regarding the cost of aluminum -</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Carlos de Alba&gt;: Yes.</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: I'm sorry. Regarding the first question with the cost of aluminum, in Brazil, we had a very serious threat of a power shortage. So energy price in the spot market had a very significant spike. The energy price in the spot market, which was very low - in December 2007, they were around US$10 per megawatt hour - they skyrocketed to more than US$200 per megawatt hour. And now when these spread disappeared with the stop of the rainy season, now one should see energy price in Brazil in the spot market at a price of again less of 10 to US$15 per megawatt hour. But if you enter into a contract for one year, you are going to pay a price that's at least as high as $100. And if you enter into a contract for 20 years, you are going to pay at least $70 per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>So at Valesul that buys part of its energy needs in the spot market, we decided to reduce production instead of keeping it. It was the case for marginal revenues against marginal costs. In this case marginal costs were higher than marginal revenues. So we decided to reduce production at Valesul.</p>
          <p>At Albras there are not problems because Albras has 100% of its energy needs under our 20-year contract at lower price than the current market price. So we continued to produce. Of course we have regular maintenance activities repairing some cells. That's part of the normal activity. We had no problems with that.</p>
          <p>And we are still having some increase in aluminum refining because the production of Paragominas is not sufficient yet to beat all the demand for the Space 4 and 5 of Alunorte. So we have to buy bauxite from third parties. It doesn't have the same quality of the Paragominas and Trombetas bauxite. So it tends to generate higher cost of refining bauxite in our aluminum refinery. So these are problem that will be corrected over the next quarters when Paragominas will be sufficient to meet the demand for Alunorte.  Your second question is --?</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Carlos de Alba&gt;: Is on the --</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: SG&amp;A, SG&amp;A. As I was mentioning, we cannot say that our co-operation, given its more site is profitable operation that is a star performer. One should see our co-operation, as I said, in its infancy. So it's an investment. In the short term we are having costs in exchange for having very good returns over the medium and long term. It's a small operation; it's growing, and gradually it will become a profitable operation.</p>
          <p>We have plans to become a very large player in the full market. We have projects to be developed, Mozambique and Australia. We look to develop Belvedere. We have prospects at Allen Steel, then Peak Downs in Central Queensland near Carborough Downs. We mineral exploration around the world in Magnolia, in Angola, in Kazakhstan, and other places in the world, in Colombia as well. And we look forward to become a very large player in the coal market over the long term.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Carlos de Alba&gt;: Thank you.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Oscar Cabrera with Goldman Sachs.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Oscar Cabrera&gt;: Hi, good morning, Roberto. Congratulations on achieving the 300 million tonne mark. Looking forward for the next one, which is 450. So the first question - I was very interested in your comment about the austenitic stainless steel production and the ratio. The question there, Roberto, is do you surmise that the increase is because we're starting to restock on stainless steel? Or is it because the high coal prices globally are forcing some of the production on nickel pig iron production out of the market because it becomes uneconomic?</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: Good morning, Oscar. We are trying hard to accelerate the achievement of this new model in iron ore production. It's a great challenge. But we promise that we'll do it.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Oscar Cabrera&gt;: I know you will, Roberto.</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: Thank you for your confidence. And about austenitic ratio, it's much more linked to the volatility and flexibility of the stainless steel industry. In our short-term prospect it's relatively easy for the stainless steel industry to move to non-nickel stainless steel, the series 400 or so-called ferritic steel, or to the series 200 that's low nickel content is stainless steel, then reducing the austenite ratio.</p>
          <p>But this is not a permanent situation because the end user of the stainless steel products will suffer. So the stainless steel industry is able to do this in a short-term perspective, trying to reduce its cost as a reaction to what we have seen - the very high nickel price that prevailed in the first and the second quarter 2007 reaching an all-time high level in May 16th of 2007 when it reached $54,000 per tonne. But it's natural that now, given the lower nickel price and given the fact that it's not technically feasible to promote permanent substitution, austenitic ratio is gradually moving to its normal level of 75, 77, 78%. I think at least to me it's clear that we should see this movement.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Oscar Cabrera&gt;: And a very bullish sign for the nickel market. Then the second question, Roberto, it's got to do more with your strategic positioning right now. It seems that you're very interested in the coal and in the copper market. And the question is, do you (a) plan to develop organically, or will you (b) go and try and acquire something to take advantage of the extremely tight markets in both commodities?</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: Well, we have a project pipeline in both products. In copper we are developing Salobo the First. Next we have Salobo II, and I raised the possibility of having even the next station on Salobo III to end up with an operation at Salobo with more than 200,000 tonnes per year of copper. We have Papomono in Chile. We have both in Canada to increase our copper production a little bit. We have other products in Brazil, Cristalino, and we are investing mineral exploration in countries like Peru, Chile, Kazakhstan, Mongolia to identify our new copper deposit and to develop them.</p>
          <p>In coal, as I mentioned, we have Mozambique, Australia. We have prospects in Columbia, Mongolia, and Angola. So our priority is our Obendros, but simultaneously to our effort in organic growth, keeping an eye to opportunities for acquisitions, for acquisitions that will contribute to create value for our shareholders.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Sanil Daptardar with Sentinel Asset Management.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q - Sanil Daptardar&gt;: Thank you. Roberto, you talked about some 4.7% increase over the next five years. I did not catch what it was you were talking about. Is it the global GDP growth you are talking about that would be trending above trend line levels or...?</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: Well, we are talking about crude steel production. We expect it to grow to 4.7% in a global basis. It'll be a little higher than the global GDP growth. Despite the current environment, despite the recession in U.S. and growth deceleration in the major developed economies, we believe that for this five-year period, it will continue to grow above trend, something a little bit below 4% against long-term trend of 3.5%, being driven by emerging market economies, which is very important for the demand for minerals and metals because these are the countries that are in the forefront of the structural change. These are the countries that will have to invest heavily in infrastructure, in housing. These are the countries that are having some change like financial deepening, and increasing credit to companies and to individuals, especially consumer finance and housing finance.</p>
          <p>In our country in Brazil, we have seen over the last couple of years the very important impact of financial deepening. Price in Brazil was very low relative to GDP. There was an increase more recently due to the extension of consumer credit and housing credit. So it had a very important impact on the demand for consumer durables, mainly cars, and a positive impact on residential construction. And the net result of this is a growing demand for metals, especially steel and aluminum, copper and nickel.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I was just wondering if you could give me a better color on the derivative losses. The forwards, are they open forwards or is there any capital collar? When do they roll-off? I.e., when are you actually going to take the cash impact of the derivatives? Thank you very much.</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: Well, thank you, Dan, for your question, very interesting one. We have some open and we have some collars in the derivatives. They will be expiring over the time. For instance, in this quarter, we mentioned in the press release, we had a loss of $75 million that had a cash impact because it was due to the liquidation of contracts, contracts that were expired and were liquidated at a loss. So we have not only an accounting loss, but we have also a negative cash impact, and they will expire over the year. So by December of 2008 they will be <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Roberto; good morning, everybody. My question's related to the negotiation your competitors are still having with the Chinese customers. I know you can't give any color what Vale's opinion and what the possible ramifications might be for 2009's calendar year negotiations. I know it's still early, but given the fact that the situation is pretty difficult right now I would like to know what Vale thinks. Thank you.</p>
          <p>&lt;A - Roberto Castello Branco&gt;: Our job is done. We negotiated the iron ore fine price. That's the step one. We highlighted the price differential for the best iron ore in the world. That's Caraj&#xE1;s with the premium. We became exclusive the premium. The pellet price negotiation was also very successful, as I mentioned, 86.7%. And I believe that's too premature to think about the next negotiation. So the name of the game now is to maximize production and to try to keep cost under control, to make our production cost of iron ore and pellets more efficient, and to develop our products. And these negotiations of our competitors, well, let's see the results. They remain to be seen.</p>
