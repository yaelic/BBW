        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and welcome to our Q1 Conference Call. First, I'd like to focus on the market environment and the highlights of the first quarter of 2011 and then Lothar Steinebach, our CFO, will provide you with the Q1 financials in greater detail. After that, I'll comment on the outlook for 2011 and finally we'll take your questions.</p>
          <p>I'll like to begin by reminding everyone that the presentation, which contains the usual formal disclaimer to forward-looking statements within the meaning of relevant U.S. legislation, can be accessed via our website at henkel.com\ir (sic) [henkel.com/ir] (1:28). The presentation and discussions are conducted subject to the disclaimer. We will not read the disclaimer, but propose we take it as read into the records for the purpose of this conference call.</p>
          <p>Now, let me get on starting with the market environment and highlights of the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>We see an overall global economy further growing by 3% plus. We see in Europe with a mix growth, Germany being very strong and Southern Europe continuing to show weak signs. We see a U.S. economy with slightly accelerated growth that continued issues in the overall housing market. And we see the emerging market with strong growth rates; however, we did see because of the political unrest in the first two months in MENA -- instable MENA region, however, stabilizing in third quarter of -- the third month of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We've seen considerable expansion of the industrial sector and we continue to see private consumption on a moderate level. We are seeing raw material price increases further accelerate and further accelerated and &#x2013; than originally to anticipate it by closure of last year.</p>
          <p>When we look upon Henkel overall in our first quarter the highlights are as following. Continued strong organic sales growth, continued double-digit growth in our emerging markets, taking it two points up from 38 point of total business in the first quarter of 2010, to 40 plus percent of total business in 2011. We have seen market share gains in all relevant markets for Henkel and we continue to adapt our structures to the markets and by thus I mean that we've now opened our third Shared Services Center globally, this time in Mexico serving our colleagues in the Southern part of America.</p>
          <p>And we are confident that the task we set ourselves to have more than 1,000 people deployed in Shared Services by the end of 2011 will be reached and we continue to have eye on cost reductions for the first quarter and will continue throughout during 2011, you can see that in the SG&amp;A line.</p>
          <p>On the challenges for us, we did see a decline in our gross margin due to a higher input cost, which we'll speak more about in detail today. We did see a weaker Middle East and Africa business particularly in the two first months that has recovered in month three and we anticipate normalization throughout the Europe and did have a negative impact in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We continue to see an ongoing strong competition in the HPC side and supply shortages in raw materials, particularly impacting our Adhesives business. On the challenges in our North American business, I've spoken of on that on previous calls since summer of 2010, and I'll going to greater details to where we are in our transition of our North American business.</p>
          <p>We have changed, as I alluded to or spoke to you about in the second part of 2010, our management team in North America and conducted an in-depth review and analysis with an external set of consultants and we agreed upon a number of actions upon, you know, that we are taking into implementation of this stage. First big block is improving our operational excellence, particularly focusing on our marketing and sales activities, getting a better alignment of our sales into our key customer groups and spending our marketing money more structured along our key product lines.</p>
          <p>We are strengthening our innovation program which will have a positive impact in the second part of the year, but a great focus on innovation is put into our North American business from the middle of last year. And we continue to optimize our structures and processes and also to continue to upgrade our organization in North America.</p>
          <p>That means that we are seeing the first signs of stabilization in North America. However, I expect that the turnaround will be more in the latter part of 2012, no '11 than in the beginning of 2011. So, as I said on previous calls, the problem didn't arise overnight. The solution has not risen overnight, also. However, we are seeing the first signs of stabilization in our North American business.</p>
          <p>Which brings me to our business groups. Our Laundry and Homecare business saw a slight positive organic sales growth in declining markets, only driven by strong volume. So, we're seeing strong volume growth and negative pricing. We see a strong Western Europe and we see a negative North America in the first quarter. We see healthy organic sales growth returning back to Eastern Europe following a very challenging market environment in Eastern Europe in 2010 and solid growth in Latin America.</p>
          <p>We have seen market share growth, however, due to input cost we have seen adjusted margin impacted -- negatively impacted by the raw material pricing. We continue to try to drive pricing into the markets through innovation, so I would characterize the first quarter for our Laundry and Home Care business as a robust performance in a highly competitive market environment, however, this is clearly one of the areas where we need improvement throughout the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>Our Cosmetics and Toiletries business again delivered a very strong quarter, accelerated our strong organic sales growth to 5% plus, and this is compared to strong comparables from last year. All regions contributed and the emerging markets continued double-digit organic sales growth from our Cosmetics and Toiletries business.</p>
          <p>We saw a strong business in Western Europe and we did see North America stabilizing with market share gains, so here in contrast to our Detergents business, we are seeing a stabilization in our North American business as it relates to Cosmetics and Toiletries. We are seeing European market shares at record high levels and we are seeing adjusted EBIT margin on regular levels for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We're seeing successful innovations again driven into the market place. Two products I want to mention is Perfect Mousse and got2b Powder'ful. Perfect Mousse is new product line in our hair coloration, which will help us further expand our market share position in coloration. So, again, a strong quarter in a very a very challenging environment for our Cosmetics and Toiletries business.</p>
          <p>Coming to Adhesives Technologies, very strong organic sales growth, all regions growing, the emerging markets was the primary growth driver, but also Eastern Europe, MENA and Asia-Pacific contributed -- of course, they contributed to the growth. We are seeing further market share gains and further increase and adjusted EBIT margin and we are also seeing an improvement in the quality and also the volume of our innovations. So, we see strong profitable growth that continued for our Adhesives Technologies business, delivering a very strong quarter in the area.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the numbers. Overall growth rate 0.9%; organic up 7.2; bringing the top line to 3.823, so a strong top-line growth. Adjusted EBIT margin declined on 48.4 to 46.6, minus 180 basis points. Lothar will go more into detail but this is clearly where you see the impact of the raw material price increases.</p>
          <p>We did see an adjusted EBIT growing 12.1% from 4.21 to 4.73, and adjusted EBIT margin up 40 basis points from 12.0 to 12.4. Adjusted EPS from &#x20AC;0.60 to &#x20AC;0.73, a growth of 21.7 and a continued strong focus on net working capital despite the high growth on the top-line from 8.7 to 7.9, so a deduction of -- or reduction of 60 basis points. So, a solid first quarter in challenging environment. Top-line growth, clearly you see the challenges in our adjusted gross margin and good progress in our adjusted EBIT margin and net working capital continues to make progress.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to hand over for Lothar, who will take you through the details and I'll then come back and close the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>With that, I will walk through the financials as usual with sales growth by business sector. Our three business sectors have been delivering 1.6%, 5.7%, 11.5% organic sales growth, respectively. There is only a little difference between the foreign exchange adjusted numbers and the organic sales growth so there is almost no impact from acquisitions and divestments.</p>
          <p>We'll start first with our Laundry and Home Care division. We have experienced strong volume growth, with 4.8%, over compensating negative pricing effects of 3.2, resulting in an organic sales growth of 1.6. That was heavily driven by our Laundry division, which is the major part of our business, and it was almost positive in all regions, with the exception of North America, where we are still not satisfied with our performance and Kasper has alluded to that already.</p>
          <p>Next is our Cosmetics and Toiletries division. We continue with a spectacular organic sales growth rate of 5.7, which is composed of even stronger volume growth of 8% and the negative pricing of 2.3 resulting in 5.7. All strategic business units of our Cosmetics and Toiletries division have been positive, with particular emphasis on our strongest part of the business, the Hair Care.</p>
          <p>Both retail and professional have experienced higher than average growth in the Cosmetics and Toiletries divisions. We've seen growth in all regions so we've continued with our strong growth path driven by innovations and North America also being back to positive organic sales growth.</p>
          <p>Next, sales growth in our Adhesive Technologies division, again, another spectacular number 11.5%, composed of 8.9 strong volume growth plus an additional 2.6 from pricing. We have started to implement price increases and we've been successful in driving price increases through and that will continue for most of the part of this year.</p>
          <p>We've seen mature markets and emerging markets growing strongly, with particular success in a number of mature countries among others, Germany, with strong market share gains and therefore, strong organic sales growth. We've driven further pricing in all our segments, in all the strategic business units, and we've seen the strongest performance in what we call general industry and transportation and metal industry. But, we've seen double-digit growth in most of our strategic business units.</p>
          <p>Next, a look at the regions. We've seen all regions with positive organic sales growth, with particular strong performance in Eastern Europe, double-digit, back to double-digit organic sales growth in Eastern Europe. We've been affected by the events around political unrest in the MENA region, obviously also to some extent by what has happened in Japan, in particular Middle East, North Africa, where we've seen sales growth of around 5%, accounting or adjusting for the sales shortfall as a result of the political turmoil, which we estimate at around &#x20AC;20 million in Q1. Without this shortfall, our organic sales growth rate in MENA would again have been double digit.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at our performance in the emerging markets. In Q1, where we have increased our sales share in the total volume of sales from 38% in the respective Q1 of 2010, to 40% in Q1 of 2011 this was driven in major part by Adhesive technologies and the Cosmetics/Toiletries division, which obviously has experienced much stronger growth than our Household Care division.</p>
          <p>We're back to double-digit growth rates in Eastern Europe, which is primarily driven by Adhesive Technologies and the Cosmetics business, both in Russia and Turkey. Adjusted EBIT by business sector looking at our three divisions, Laundry and Home Care with minus 60 basis points, Cosmetic/Toiletries with plus 90 and Adhesive Technologies was again plus 90 basis points.</p>
          <p>Starting with minus 60 in our Laundry and Home Care division, we've seen an EBIT decrease on an absolute level, impacted in major part by restructuring expenses which we have taken in Q1, which I will show in a moment. The adjusted EBIT margin is down due to the ongoing competitive pressure in North America in particular but also in Western Europe and the strong impact from rising input costs. We've basically maintained our absolute level of media spend in order to drive sales and as you have seen, our sales growth in terms of volume growth has been quite satisfactory.</p>
          <p>Cosmetics and Toiletries, we've continued on a strong growth path in terms of sales growth, which is reflected in the adjusted EBIT growth, EBIT margin growth, 90 basis points. We've continued with our margin-accretive innovations. We've been communicating for quite a period of time that margin-accretive innovations, selective innovations have been the name of the game in that business which has driven growth and profitability improvements.</p>
          <p>And it's noteworthy to point out that in our sales growth calculations we only differentiate between price and volume and all the innovations that we bring to the market which are margin-accretive, are counted on the volume. So therefore, there is kind of an overstatement of the pricing impact and an understatement of the volume.</p>
          <p>Strong EBIT increase despite negative pricing in the overall sector and rising input costs as well here. Now, rising input costs are not as strong as they are in Laundry and Home Care and the Adhesives division, but it's still much higher that we have experienced in the past. We've continued with a very tight cost management and with our very flexible production utilization. We continued to experience aggressive pricing activities in the markets and we've continued with a higher level of media investment in order to support our growth momentum.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBIT by Adhesive Technologies, we've experienced rising input costs, which we had offset by further efficiency gains and we're also seeing the benefit of our improved manufacturing footprint, where we have invested over the past years quite a bit. We've also been able to increase our own sales prices on a broad base and I'm sure you've seen that this has been happening in the market in general. We've continued to invest in R&amp;D at the level that we had before in order to maintain our level of innovations, which is very important in this market as well.</p>
          <p>Capacity utilization has picked up, as usual, beginning of the year with the stronger above 50% capacity utilization and we've always communicated that Q4, in terms of capacity utilization, is the lowest quarter in our business. Look at income statement, adjusted sales to a gross profit with gross margin adjusted down by 180 basis points and yet we've seen an improvement over the period of Q4 of 2010, 90 basis points. Again, that had capacity utilization despite the continuation of the negative impact from raw material price increases.</p>
          <p>Net accounts in major part for the negative 180 basis points versus the same period of last year, we continued to maintain our strong and aggressive price increases, which will continue to help recover some of the margin, the negative margin impact that we've seen in Q1. Our most impacted by the negative pricing is Cosmetics/Toiletries and Laundry and Homecare, and despite the higher volumes that we've been able to generate, we've seen the negative impact on the gross margin level.</p>
          <p>Income statement, most important negative or positive deviation is the marketing, selling and distribution expenses with minus 100 basis points and positive impact on our profits. Administrative expense is down by 40 basis points compared to the level of sales. We start with marketing and selling. We've continued with our stable investment in marketing. As percentage of sales, it's down, and that is the result of two factors, one of which is that we've had a better efficiency in our investment, that is to say, with the same amount of money better expenses, better media coverage.</p>
          <p>Plus, even more importantly, the shift in mix in our business with a strong growth in our Adhesives division, where the percentage of media investment is very low, and therefore, with a higher growth rate and a higher volume of sales that we have generated there, we have a mathematical decrease of our ratio of marketing, selling and distribution in our numbers. So, from that perspective, we've continued with very good investment in marketing where it makes sense and that is where our branded products businesses are investing, and the shift in mix results in an overall decrease in the percentage of marketing, selling and distribution expenses in our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Administrative expenses, 40 basis points down as a percentage of sales. We've continued to use shared services, which permit us to generate higher sales volume with the same or lower amount of expenses. That will be continued throughout this year and the next years. We'll continue to improve our structures, we'll continue to adapt our structures to the markets thereby generating savings in our structures and permitting us to generate higher sales volume with lower expenses.</p>
          <p>Reported to adjusted EBIT, major difference to last year is we did not have one-time gains. The level of restructuring charges has been slightly higher in Q1 compared to the same period of last year, 43 versus 31. And that is in major part driven by our Laundry and Home Care division. We continue to do investment in improving our structures, in particular in Laundry and Home and Care, where we need to respond to the difficult market conditions by improving our structures aggressively. And therefore, we've been investing in Q1 in major parts of the Laundry and Home Care in terms of improving our structures and responding to the pressure on pricing and the market situation, in general. Restructuring expenses in the other divisions and corporate have been on a fairly low level.</p>
          <p>Looking at the cash flow statement, in particular, change in net working capital, higher cash out for net working capital because of the strong growth that we have experienced, even though we've decreased our ratio of net working capital to sales which has helped us to mitigate the impact from the stronger growth that we have experienced. Very strong growth for the total company obviously results in higher absolute amount of net working capital although we've decreased the relative ratio of net working capital to sales.</p>
          <p>Cash flow, free cash flow down compared to the same period of last year in major part as a result of the strong growth and the utilization of additional net working capital in order to generate the sales volume that we have generated. Strong performance continues in our net working capital to sales ratio. Strong further improvement by division, all divisions have either maintained their strong level or improved. Overall company down by 60 basis points compared to the same period last year. And I believe it is correct to say that we're best in class in all our divisions compared to our peers, and the overall result for the company is, obviously, particularly good in terms of saving cash on generating the sale -- sales volume.</p>
          <p>That's reflected in the evolution of our net debt. We've reduced our net debt by almost &#x20AC;2 billion in two years, between Q1 2009 over Q1 2010. Now to Q1 2011, it's slightly above &#x20AC;2.1 billion. We're on a very good path to further reduce our sales -- our net debt during the rest of the year, thereby generating the requirements that are needed in order to get the upgrade that we're looking at.</p>
          <p>Before turning over to outlook for fiscal year 2011 and Kasper, let me just update you on some items in the guidance that we've given earlier. In terms of guidance on the restructuring charges, we now expect 100 -- around &#x20AC;160 million for the year, which is up from &#x20AC;120 as we had guided earlier. And direct materials -- raw materials packaging, contract manufacturing, traded goods, we had guided impact to be in the low teens as -- and in the high single-digit, sorry, and we're now guiding to the low teens so an increase over the same guidance that we had earlier in the year of 2 to 3 percentage points.</p>
          <p>With that, I hand over to Kasper and the outlook for fiscal 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lothar. Let me just, before I go through the outlook, just give you an update on how we look upon the market. We still see a solid GDP growth for 2011, around the 3.2%. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:14) at 6.6 and industrial at 6.8 and private consumption at 2.9. So, overall, we do see a solid GDP growth for 2011.</p>
          <p>What has changed is the increase in the raw materials and that's why we now see for Henkel low double-digit, for the Henkel basket of raw materials. So, what we are seeing is -- we're seeing a further increase in raw material costs, also compared to the guidance that we did give at our annual earnings call in February. But, overall, the global economy is still with positive growth prospects.</p>
          <p>Before I come to the guidance, let me just spend a couple of minutes on our situation in Japan. We have sales in 2010 of approximately &#x20AC;380 million in Japan. We have four production sites and more than 800 employees. In the first quarter, we've only seen minor impact on the numbers. I also want to re-emphasize that our predominant focus as soon as the catastrophe happened in Japan was on our employees, and the safety of employees. And secondarily, we looked upon the business. We believe that long-term that has been and will continue to be the best strategy for us.</p>
          <p>So, while the first quarter has not been significantly impacted, we do expect an impact in the following quarters to come, not only on our Japanese business, but also in businesses that the Japanese industry supply either fully or on the component basis, i.e., in the electronics space or in the automotive space.</p>
          <p>Lothar and I have spoken about the MENA region. We conduct business in the MENA region and have revenues in 2010 to the tune of 900 million. We have 21 production sites and 5,000 employees. We did see sales losses of approximately &#x20AC;20 million in the first quarter. Again, as Lothar alluded to that if we were to back the &#x20AC;20 million back into the numbers, we would have seen a double-digit growth rate.</p>
          <p>We had seen stabilization and normalization of the situation in the month of March, but there is no doubt that the situation in the Middle East is significantly more volatile now, even after stabilization, than in the course of 2010. However, the situation has stabilized and so far, we expect a normal second quarter.</p>
          <p>That brings me to the outlook for 2011, we have guided in February that we expect an organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. We are changing that now and saying that why we still expect 3% to 5%, we are guiding at the upper end, so closer to 5% then the 3%, following the very strong organic sales growth in the first quarter of 7.2. So, we're taking and moving the guidance on our growth to the upper end.</p>
          <p>We still guide on the EBIT margin of 13% and adjusted EBIT growth of plus 10. So, we are seeing another year of profitable growth ahead of us. The journey we are seeing for 2010 is focusing on profitable growth and increased market share to get the right balance, but at the same time ensuring that we don't want to forego market share but not at any price; we do want to maintain a profitable growth rate.</p>
          <p>We plan and expect to extend our position in the emerging markets. You saw that in the first quarter extending the position with two points compared to the first quarter of 2010. Our policy is to stabilize our position in North America. We saw the first signs of improvement in the first quarter but as I said, I think you will see improvements more in the second half than in the first half. We are very committed to offsetting raw material price increases by putting sales price increases through and a continuation on our cost focus. Separate to raw material, we are continuing the structural changes of our organization.</p>
          <p>Originally, we guided with restructuring volumes 100 to 120. We're taking that up to 160, as you saw that we have restructuring charges of 100, no, of 42 in the first quarter. So, what you are also are seeing in this number is our capability to change <mark type="ph" /> faster now (3:36) as an organization compared to a couple of years ago.</p>
          <p>So, we are continuing to drive change in as quickly as we can into the organization and this year will be, we have a big focus on our shared services, as we also said, but as you can see we're capable of driving changes fast into the organization than previous and that is what you are seeing in our restructuring measures. So, 2011 will be important step to achieving our targets. For 2012, we are completely committed to hitting our targets of 13% in '11 and 14% for 2012.</p>
          <p>In summary, a solid first quarter in a challenging market environment, strong top-line growth growing at more than two times GDP. We continue to see margin improvement, with more than 40 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2010. Strong performance in Cosmetics and Toiletries and Adhesives, mixed performance in Laundry and Home Care. We are seeing headwinds in MENA and Japan, continue to see intense competition in Home and Personal Care and further increases in raw material prices and supply shortages. As I said before, we'll continue our focus on cost and profitable growth and restating our commitment to the 2011 outlook and our commitment to hitting our targets in 2012.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to thank you for listening to our overview and we'll be happy, Lothar and I, to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Celine Pannuti from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. My first question is on input costs, could you elaborate on what is the impact throughout the next quarters, i.e., was Q1 the peak, or given that you have increased your guidance, should we expect Q2, Q3 impact from input costs to be higher? And as well relating to that, am I right so in understanding that this is about another &#x20AC;200 million of euro of extra cost on your input cost bill? And if you could, detail how you are going to offset that. So, how much is extra savings and how much will be pricing?</p>
          <p>My second question relates to, in fact, your P&amp;L. In your P&amp;L, you have the other line as added benefit on your margin; I think it was about 80 basis points. I think you said it was a provision release and also the disposal of non-current asset. Could you please elaborate on what was behind that please? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the impact of input cost, was Q1 peak was one of your questions. No, we don't expect Q1 to be the peak, we expect Q2 to be with the stronger impact. We don't obviously have a specific guidance for Q2, but we've not seen the peak yet. The number that we provide in terms of comparison first needs to be understood that it's gross number, so that's before negotiating and saving. And therefore, that's kind of the pricing in the market as we experience it. And therefore, the counteractions that we are taking is obviously all the counteractions that are available to us, and that's among others, shifting suppliers, changing materials and also negotiating different conditions.</p>
          <p>So, from that perspective, that's not the impact that we expect on our P&amp;L. Obviously, it is the gross impact as we see pricing in the market evolve. Second question, or part of the question, was relating to the extra impact on our P&amp;L. Again, you need to understand, this is the gross impact. And therefore, the number that you've provided again is to be understood prior, before our countermeasures.</p>
          <p>Now, the total volume that we look at is about &#x20AC;6.8 billion. So you know, you can make the calculation. The extra savings and pricing composition, I think it would be too simplistic to say half of it is extra saving, half of it is pricing. It is a large number of actions that we're undertaking in order to mitigate the impact of the gross impact of raw material price increases.</p>
          <p>We'll continue with our pricing in both Laundry and Homecare and in Adhesives. So, therefore, pricing, additional pricing will kick in Q2 as well in Laundry and Homecare, and you've seen that in Q1 it did not get a very positive impact. With terms &#x2013; in terms of extra savings, again, it not just saving, it's a lot of different actions that we're undertaking in order to improve our situation in respect of the impact of raw material pricing.</p>
          <p>P&amp;L other operating income, in operating charges we have seen in Q1 income from release of provisions, in particular, in Latin America of around &#x20AC;9 million. The other are just small items which add up to the numbers that you have seen.</p>

          <p>It is a provision that we had taken to provide for foreign exchange fluctuations. Venezuela has been a very difficult country for the period of time as a result of the split in the rates between the official rates and the unofficial rates and the difficulty of getting foreign exchange in -- permitted in the country in order to make the imports. Now, that eventually has resolved because the problems have been resolved and addressed. Therefore, this could be released. But for a period of time it's been a very difficult situation in that country.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Susanne Seibel from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I was hoping you would talk us a little bit through the planned evolution of pricing for 2011. As you have just mentioned, we have seen very little in terms of positive pricing in the consumer side and also surprisingly negative pricing on the Cosmetics side. Could you give us a little bit your idea about how you think this is going to develop over the next couple of quarters and whether you feel confident that for the full year, pricing in Laundry and in Cosmetics is going to be positive although we see still a negative number for the full year from that side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before we go into detail, let me just allude to what Lothar said and explain it again. When we introduce new products, the new products are calculated only on the volume side, not on the pricing side. And that means that the more new products we introduce in the market even with higher pricing, it is not accounted for in pricing, it's accounted for in volume.</p>
          <p>And as you know, that we do approximately 40% of the business with products that have been introduced in the last three years. So, if you do the mathematics, we then introduce approximately 15% revenue of new products every year. That means that all is accounted for on the volume side and not on the pricing side. That means that in that context the pricing is understated and the volume is overstated.</p>
          <p>So, what we are seeing is that we are predominantly driving our pricing strategy by introducing new products on the fast-moving consumer goods side. That's why you continue to see a strong push on the volume because it is easier to push pricing through a new product introduction than through price increase just on existing products. So, that's where -- was the model that we have and that's the only model we have. You will continue to see an overstatement quote unquote on the volume and an understatement on the pricing.</p>
          <p>We are and have already taking pricing initiatives, as said in the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter this year. Whether you'll continue -- whether you will see a positive line item on pricing this year, I think it's too early to say, but as you can see, we are guiding towards going to the 13%. That entails a contribution &#x2013; an increased contribution from our Laundry and Home Care and our Cosmetics and Toiletries business, i.e. an increase in EBIT margin that can only come through also increased pricing power.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you had adjusted your pricing for the new products, how negative would it be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're in the process of establishing a methodology in order to be able to estimate the impact of it. We don't have that information available yet, but during the quarter we'll provide some more perspective on kind of the imputed pricing impact of new product introductions, which is significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall, our current belief is that we still &#x2013; we'll be going back in Laundry and Home Care to pretty much picking up pricing to an extent that we end up at least zero, but that's again something that is at this point in time difficult to predict because, obviously, there will be reactions to pricing by customers but also by our peers and that therefore is something that we need to watch out during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall, I believe it'll be helpful to see the perspective on new product introductions as to how the pricing impact from that is because it's significant as a result of the strong flow of new product introduction that we have in both divisions. And we've communicated on many occasions that one requirement of a new product introduction is margin accretion.</p>
          <p>So, therefore, that's really the way to increase prices, in particular in Cosmetics, but also to some extent in Laundry and Homecare. So we'll give some more perspective as we go, and in terms of pricing. Otherwise our expectation is still that at least in Laundry and Homecare we'll end up, even with the methodology that we currently utilize, at zero or slightly positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you say at least in Laundry and Homecare, is the situation in Cosmetics more difficult?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not more difficult. It is very similar by the way. The difference is that we have this high rate of innovations in Cosmetics. And therefore, there is no point in --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's where you see it because you have very strong new product introductions which are all counted in volume and <mark type="inaudible" /> (43:10) they are margin accretive and that goes all the way down, because it was also that we did not cut on the advertising spend.

But, obviously, there's a strong very competitive activity in the mature countries.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Matthias Eifert from MainFirst. I have two questions on Adhesives. First of all, could you give us the percentage of sales coming from emerging markets there? And secondly, can you give us a bit of insight, what is driving the market share gains? Is it still sort of a late benefit from the National Starch integration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First part, emerging markets share in adhesives is 44%, among the strongest that we have in our portfolio. Second, market share gains in the mature countries, it is both. It's also a benefit indeed of the National Starch acquisition. We're now really getting the benefit of the size that we have acquired and the efficiency that we have been driving through the organization as a result of the integration of the both businesses.</p>
          <p>So, therefore, organic sales growth in particular in what we call packaging adhesives, that's the major part related to National Starch has been very significant. And at the same time, we've been driving through price increases in that sector. So, that's a testament to a strong success and contribution of the acquisition or acquired business into our market share gains, but it's also true with respect to transportation and metal, where National Starch does not play a role. We've been quite successful.</p>
          <p>We've also benefited from the pickup in that market. I'm sure you have seen a pretty strong recovery in the automotive industry and other industries that are related to it. And we've benefited from the market share gains and I should say our strong market position that we have and I refer to the brand that we have acquired 15 years ago, Loctite, which continues to be a very strong brand driving our business, in particular, in general industry and transportation.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. I just had a couple of follow-ups really, one was firstly on savings. I know you don't really provide explicit guidance going forward from here, but I was under the impression that you're targeting still about &#x20AC;100 million per annum in terms of supply chain and I think around &#x20AC;50 on SG&amp;A, if that's still the case or if that rate may have picked up at all for this year.</p>
          <p>And then just another follow-up on some of the one-off items going through the P&amp;L, I had a question on your provisions for incented awards. Was there a charge in Q1 this year and was there a charge in Q1 last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the first question, Alex, and Lothar will then speak about the provisions that we are taking. On the savings, we are not changing our guidance and that's what you are asking is you are seeing an increase in our restructuring costs. And, of course, that will lead to additional savings when it hits. I think that the most important part on that, and that was the point I was trying to make, is that with the change we made in the organization over the last three years, we've become a much more agile organization and are capable of responding quicker and quicker to market changes and that's what you're seeing on the restructuring lines.</p>
          <p>So, over time that will &#x2013; you'll get an increased saving as that <mark type="ph" /> forces delay factor (47:53) because what we are doing on the restructuring side is driving sustainable changes into our organization, predominate in building and expanding our shared services. And our shared services will drive increased savings over time in our SG&amp;A line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect of the charges for our special incentive, we did not have any charge in Q1 of 2010. We have the commensurate charge in Q1 of '11 which is around eight and that will be building up then for the rest of the year to a bit more than 30.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess my question is -- there seem to be quite a few one-off items coming through the P&amp;L. I mean, would I be right in thinking that there is small number of positives, the small number negatives do they roughly net each other off? I guess the question is your margin uplift this quarter of 40 basis points, should we kind of think of that as the genuine underlying rate with those one-offs netting each other off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is yes. We always have some what you call one-offs which are technically not one-offs, but they release of provisions which occur every quarter to some extent and also some charges which occur every quarter as part of normal operating procedure. And therefore, Q1 was nothing special in that respect and it kind of netted out and therefore 40 basis points improvement in our evaluation of underlying business improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That's helpful. Thank you. If I can just ask one more question on cosmetics, I mean, the innovation clearly going very strongly here, I just wondering it &#x2013; it still sounds like Syoss is a key driver of that. And then, I was wondering what you might be seeing in terms of the competitive landscape concerning Syoss. I get the impression that there's been a competitive launch in some markets. I just wonder if you could update us on that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's correct what you are saying. You've seen a competitive response from our biggest competitor out of Cincinnati. Right now we have seen zero slowdown in our growth of the Syoss product line in the first quarter. So, we continue to see very strong expansion of Syoss. It's now present in 35 countries, including Japan and China, and is today our third largest brand in our Cosmetics business.</p>
          <p>But, I do want to caution, because I think it, and forgive my English now, it would be too simplistic to say that the growth and the margin improvement in Cosmetics are only coming from Syoss. We have record high market shares in our Coloration and part of that is driven by what I said in my presentation, the mousse business. And mousse is to simplify it, is frankly a coloration that in content is similar to shaving cream or shaving foam. So, you apply very easy to the hair, which has been picked up extremely positive by the marketplace, that's one.</p>
          <p>The other one is a gel in the hair in the shape of a powder, which has been introduced two to three years ago in our professional line, is now in our retail line. So, it's not only Syoss, we actually have an extremely strong and healthy innovation pipeline in our Cosmetics business. And that's why you continue to see a roughly a 5% organic growth rate quarter-in, quarter-out, plus minus one point over the last many quarters in Cosmetics. And we are confident we'll continue to drive very strong growth in our Cosmetics, not only due to Syoss, but due to overall a very strong innovation pipeline.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, all. I've got two follow-up questions. The first is on Adhesives, could you perhaps discuss the end markets and any changes you are seeing in the sub-divisions in Adhesives? And the second part is related to the input cost side. How far are you now hedged in the year, i.e. how much uncertainty is there still left from the crude oil movements let's say for the remainder of the year? And maybe one final follow-up, again on the one-offs. Is it true that there was a &#x20AC;14 million disposal benefit in non-current assets? And maybe you can highlight what that &#x20AC;14 million was? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the first question and Lothar will take the second question. Overall, we had a very strong development in our Adhesives business. And it was pretty much across the board. So, it's hard to pull something out and say that was much better than the other. But probably, the only slower development that we saw in our Adhesives markets was in electronics, where we're seeing the overall electronics market being slightly down in the first quarter compared to previous development. I would did see however strong numbers, as you also saw, from <mark type="ph" /> Intel (52:44). But, overall, we did see a slowing down in the electronic system.</p>
          <p>Automotive continues to be good. Constructions continues to be strong and our constructions market, as you know, is predominantly Eastern Europe and partially Middle East; it's less in North America. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:00) industry continues to be strong. Packaging has been less volatile through the recession and also the following the recession.</p>
          <p>So, overall, we continue across the board to see very strong growth, as I said, the only one where we have seen a slowdown in growth has been the electronic sector, which is a more volatile sector and it could also continue to have essentially a slow growth rate with the impact of the Japanese scenario, but it's not -- but besides that we are seeing double-digit growth rates across the board in all our industrial end-user markets.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the input cost and security, we obviously have an outlook for the rest of the year which basically suggests that we're going to see the peak in 2 and 3 and then the situation relaxing to some extent in Q4. That is pretty much clear. We don't expect that to change dramatically. There is, obviously, an outside chance that it may, but life is risky in itself. From that perspective, I think our expectation for the evolution of input cost and the oil price is pretty solid.</p>
          <p>In terms of a particular gain that you referred to, we don't have a &#x20AC;40 million gain from any disposal. What we have was the release of the provision that I mentioned earlier. And we have gained from disposal of fixed assets in the &#x20AC;206 million, that's small stuff that we continue to dispose of. That's basically what we have in many situations. That's -- those are the big items. All the other items add up to the numbers that we've provided but none of them is of any significance --</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, couple of questions if I may. In terms of the A&amp;P environment, we are hearing from P&amp;G that they are looking to take price increases in North America as well as Western Europe. I wanted to see first and foremost if you were seeing that yet in your particular markets and also in terms of your thinking about spend for AMP on the full year, you mentioned that was broadly stable for Laundry and Cosmetics in the quarter?</p>
          <p>And then also, in terms of Japan, if you think the impact will be greatest in Q2 and maybe reverse in Q3? And what the impacts of input shortages in your end markets might be, if that could be part of the reason why electronics is potentially softer? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. On the pricing side, we're seeing the first signs &#x2013; the very early signs on pricing in Western Europe and North America and we intend to do the same which we also based on the market place but it's still very early days on pricing.</p>
          <p>On the marketing side, our intention is to keep the current or high level while AMP spend continues to be high. We do expect a flattening out of AMP spend in the overall market in 2011, but we don't anticipate to take it particulary down, we see it as a growth driver for us. So, I think the biggest change you're going to see in the marketplace this year on investment in consumer goods is particularly in the Laundry and Home Care side, an increase in list pricing. That will happen, that is our anticipation that that will happen.</p>
          <p>As relates to Japan, I think it's too early to say that. But, what we are seeing is that we are seeing particularly some of the Japanese sub-suppliers have been very severely hit by the crisis. And I think it's too early to say how that will impact global supply chains. So, I think that the bigger impact in the medium to long-term will be outside Japan because you will see constraints in the global supply chains in our -- from our side and within our Japanese business.</p>
          <p>You have to take into consideration we do &#x20AC;380 million business in Japan. Two thirds is in Adhesives and one third is Cosmetics. So, over time we expect of course, the Consumer business to return to normal. The International business will be impacted, but how much and to which extent I think is too early. But, I do think that the Japanese situation will have a great impact outside Japan and within the Japanese market.</p>

          <p>You referred to the shortages of raw materials; we continue to experience that in particular relating to our packaging adhesives business. So far, you know, we've seen some impact on our business, but we don't think that's to an extent that would suggest that we need to kind of adjust our sales figures. They continue to be very strong. Could have been even stronger without the shortages, but we believe that for the time being it's not something that will prevent us from delivering on the strong performance that we've seen in Q1.</p>

          <p>Can I just ask one follow-up on Japan? You mentioned sales outside of Japan might be more impacted than that within, and I think that's in line with our thinking. How much of your sales would be affected by this, what kind of percentage are you thinking about?</p>

          <p>We can't really quantify that, I mean that's too early because what you have to see is that the sales impacted outside Japan is sales to customers that are getting sub-supplies from Japan are simply in other places. So, for me that's too early days. We are not &#x2013; we are maintaining, as you can see, our guidance. And on the top line we have increased our guidance. So, at this stage we don't think it will have a material impact for us. But, you know, the actual extent that will come, I think, is far too early to say. At this stage, we don't think it will impact our overall numbers for 2011.</p>

          <p>I would like to add that our guidance or the, I guess, higher end of guidance is obviously taking in to account some impact from or negative impact that we might experience in the rest of this year. Currently, our run rate is higher as you might have been, I mean, that's obvious, there's nothing to hide. But, we're taking into account that it's difficult to predict at this point in time and therefore, our guidance takes into account potential impact from that. Now, if that does not come out then obviously, we'll room for improvement or further adaptation of our guidance. For the time being that's just our way of dealing with insecurity in the market as a result of this.</p>

          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for participating in our first quarter conference call. Despite the challenging environment, I believe, we made solid start to the financial year. At the same time, we will continue to maintain our rigorous approach to cost management and continue to adapt our structures to the changing market conditions. I am therefore very optimistic that we will achieve our financial targets for 2012.</p>
