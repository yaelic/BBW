          <p>Good afternoon. This is the Chorus Call Conference Operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the UniCredit Second Quarter 2012 Results Presentation. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Federico Ghizzoni, UniCredit's Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us in spite of being Friday, 3:30 and August and welcome, everyone. We are here to present the second half &#x2013; the first half, sorry, and second quarter results of UniCredit. But before going to the presentation allow me to say just a few words. Despite a particularly challenging economic scenario, UniCredit 2012 second quarter operating profit shows, as you will see, a good resilience, supported by the active implementation of the strategic plan, cost reduction program.</p>
          <p>The group level, net interest income held up and the loan to deposit ratio is further improving, as we continue to work closely with our customer and we reap the benefits of our diversified business model. The negative evolution of our net income is mostly due to an increase in our loan loss provision primarily in Italy. In any case, in Italy, we have an improvement of the coverage ratio, confirming that we have a quite conservative approach in the calculation of our loan loss provision.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to the presentations, starting with few initial considerations like for executive summary. Some key messages, first of all, gross operating profit. And that's quite well, thanks to strict control of the cost and the resilient revenues.</p>
          <p>If we exclude the buyback carried out in the first quarter of 2012, revenues, as well, held up well, with cost dropping 2.4% in the quarter and 4.6% less for the same period in 2011, showing here the first signs of impact of the strategic plan. The very difficult environment in Italy lead that on increase of our loan loss provision in the quarter, but resulting, as well, in an increase of the overall coverage. In addition, we continue with the strengthening and the repositioning of our balance sheet and our capital base. In particular, in the quarter, we see a further improving of the funding gap with deposits that are up 2.8% quarterly, especially in Italy.</p>
          <p>Our geographical spread and conservative risk policy has brought us to diversify pretty well our exposure to sovereign debt and to maintain stable, about &#x20AC;40 billion, the level of Italian bonds. We have already fulfilled 68% of our group funding plan, 78% of the Italian one. And, finally, we look to the capital, the Basel 2.5 Core Tier 1 ratio improved to 10.4%, 8 bps. If we look at to Basel III fully-loaded, common equity Tier 1 is already above our 2012 target.</p>
          <p>Let's move to slide number five, net profit and net operating profit. As I said, whilst the gross operating profit held up well, the net profit and net operating profit were impacted by the deterioration of the economic environment, especially in Western Europe, and in particularly again in Italy, where we have to do significant loan loss provisions.</p>
          <p>The pressure here is, on some way, offset by very good and efficient cost management. All-in-all, the net profit in the second quarter stood at &#x20AC;169 million, down considerably from the first quarter, also excluding &#x20AC;477 million of the buyback that was booked in the first quarter. The net operating profit add to &#x20AC;592 million. And if we look the first half profit, which stay at &#x20AC;606 million, excluding buyback &#x2013; including buyback it's almost &#x20AC;1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide six, some more information about the net operating profit. Again, revenues held up well, only down 2.5% quarter-on-quarter, excluding once again the buyback. Cost, down quarter-on-quarter, 2.4%, with an even higher drop year-on-year of 4.6%, including here both decreasing on staff cost and administrative cost. Net operating profit heavily impacted by a 36.6% jump in loan loss provision to &#x20AC;1.9 billion, reflecting the deteriorating credit environment that unfortunately we see in Italy. But I'm repeating myself, the overall coverage in Italy is improving.</p>
          <p>In term of the first half, our net operating profit excluding the buyback decreased by 5.4%. Loan loss provisions were up 23.6% vis-&#xE0;-vis the last &#x2013; the same period of last year. Important to note that the net operating profit by region, if we look at the net operating profit by region, CEE improved from a seasonally weak first quarter, mainly thanks to stronger revenues in Turkey and Russia in particular. So we have Central-Eastern Europe moving in a positive trend.</p>
          <p>Slide seven, total revenues. Mostly in this case, we see a very clear, marked difference between Western Europe and CEE region. In CEE the revenues are up 6% in the second quarter, rebounding from a pretty weak first quarter, it was impacted, maybe you remember, by the change of accounting rule in Turkey.</p>
          <p>Across the group, net interest income was down only 2.6% quarter-on-quarter, impacted mostly by declining Euribor, balance sheet repositioning, lower commercial lending and higher funding cost, partially offset by big effort in terms of re-pricing, but mostly concentrated for, obvious reason, on short-term loans.</p>
          <p>We have maintained our overall conservative risk policy. This is affecting negative the revenue side because we have decided once again to limit our exposure to Italian bonds, bonds with very high yield, to &#x20AC;40 billion, &#x20AC;41 billion, in some way, impacting or giving up some potential additional revenues. The decline in net interest income in the first half shows a similar trend, down 3.9% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Finally, due to the adverse market conditions also fees are down, precisely 5.2% in the first half compared to the same period of 2011. We'll see a breakdown later on. Same story on trading results, it's down, in the first half it's down quarter-on-quarter, but remain at a level comparable to the second Q of 2011.</p>
          <p>Slide eight, net interest, not too much to say. As it is for revenues also net interest income showed a similar trend with CEE and Poland up 2.4% in the three months that ended in June, thanks to double-digit growth in Turkey again, and Russia, two important countries for us where we have a significant presence, so this is very positive. It was down 4.6% in Western Europe due to the pressure, especially in Italy and Germany, while Austria registered a good progress. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:18) first half shows a 0.3% progression in Central-Eastern Europe and Poland, a decrease of 5.5% in Western Europe region.</p>
          <p>We can move now to &#x2013; have a look to volumes trend, slide nine. The volumes trend is positive in some way, in the sense that it is moving in a way that the funding gap keeps reducing significantly. This is a trend, if you've seen, if you remember since Q3 last year, since the time the fund &#x2013; the commercial funding gap has been reduced by almost &#x20AC;42 billion and this is one of the key objective of our strategic plan.</p>
          <p>Customer deposits increasing, this is visible in this quarter. We are up &#x20AC;10 billion quarter-on-quarter, of which at least &#x20AC;5 billion comes from commercial deposits. And again, this is a good trend, especially in Italy. Well, as you know, the issue of liquidity is the most critical one. It's a different case in Germany, where opposite, we have a problem of too much liquidity.</p>
          <p>Although commercial loans demand was weak in Western Europe, there is positive effect that we have a sustained increasing activity in Central-Eastern Europe, in particular Turkey is picking up. And once again, this is important for us, it's an important market. It was giving some signal of decline in the first quarter, it's now picking up again.</p>
          <p>Fees and commission, page 10. So also here a double trend, CEE and Poland turned in an excellent performance in the quarter, 7% &#x2013; 7.9% up, down 6.5% in the first six months, mostly due to a very weak quarter in the beginning of the year. But the rebound is very significant, 7.9% increase. Western Europe was down 4.9% both in the quarter and in the first half.</p>
          <p>And if we look at the split of fees, we see a completely different trend. Financing services are down in the quarter due to lower demand for credit, especially in Germany, but they are up strongly and precisely 11.4% in the first half period.</p>
          <p>Transactional and banking services is substantially stable. This is a point, I think, of strength. And finally, the criticality is more on the investment service that are down year-on-year, quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the adverse, let's say, the risk aversion of customers, pretty logical, in a period like this one and this is a trend, it is there at least, since three quarters.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to the operating cost, page 11, here we have good news. They are down, in line again with the target of the strategic plan. They are down, overall, 4.6% in Q2 versus Q2 2011, 2.4% quarter-on-quarter, in the first six months, down 2.6%. Staff cost down 1.7%, with a drop of number of people of 1,642, year-on-year 3,000 people less. Even better operating cost, down 4.2% quarter-on-quarter and 2.5% first half 2011 versus first half 2012. So a very promising trend, with the commitment of continuing our spending review and initiatives to simplify the structure of the growth and to reduce our cost base.</p>
          <p>The cost income ratio for both quarter and the first half stands at 59.9%, excluding, obviously, the buyback of the first quarter. Particular good is the trend in Western Europe, we are down 4.1% in the quarter, 5.8% year-on-year. In Central-Europe, the trend is opposite, it's up 4% quarter-on-quarter. This is due to the fact that considering that still we see very good performance in the region, we keep investing in accordance with our plan. But again, if we look year-on-year, the growth is zero and in despite of, remember, of inflation rate that average in Central-Eastern Europe is around 5%, 6%, so also zero, I think, is an excellent achievement.</p>
          <p>Let's go to the number of people, FTEs, page 12. I don't want to comment too much, as I said already, the progression and the declining is there, 1,600 people quarter-on-quarter, almost 3,000 year-on-year. This is a reduction that comes from all divisions and it's mostly concentrated in Italy.</p>
          <p>Cost management versus strategic plan, slide 13. This is a slide that we put because we want to give you a clear sensation of what we are doing currently. Following what is the strategies of the strategic plan. As you can see, if we look the situation in term of cost management in the group, in the last three years, we have been substantially able to maintain flat development, slightly up.</p>
          <p>But if you look on the right side of the slide, that since we have &#x2013; we came out with a strategic plan, we have seen a significant drop in term of cost, especially in Western Europe, it's minus 3.2% first half of 2011, first half of 2012. Same trend is in Central-Eastern Europe. The costs are growing average 6.4% from the first half 2009 to the first half 2011, and they became flat from 2011 to 30th of June 2012. So substantially having targets, having a clear strategy, it helps a lot in terms of reducing the cost.</p>
          <p>Also another example, what we are doing following our strategic plan, page 14 is an example of what we mean for simplification. Substantially here, we want to leave you three messages.</p>
          <p>One is that, it is about the redesigning of our Italian network. We are investing significantly in alternative delivery channels. As you can see, the number of transactions done on direct &#x2013; on branches, it was 59% in 2008, it's now down to 27%. So this is are about the transaction done by customer inside the branch, a significant drop in few years, down to 27%.</p>
          <p>This allow us to redesign the business model in the branches. As you can see from January 2011, when we had 92% of our branches fully-fledged, so branches providing cash and non-cash services, fully equipped with people, this number of branches are progressively going down. We are now at 73%, 0.6% of the total, and will go down to 26% 2015, which means a lot. For example, if I remember correctly the number, this means 2,500 cashiers less needed in 2015 versus the beginning of this plan of redesigning our network.</p>
          <p>In line with this, so we continue to rationalize the network. We have closed 142 branches since January 2011, reaching now 3,648 branches in Italy and this is a problem that will continue.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to the cost of risk. As I said already, the cost of risk is up. It's not a surprise unfortunately in the current climate. We are continuing to take a very prudent approach to risk. And this leads to an increase in the first half, year-on-year, of 23 bps in term of cost of risk and 37 bps quarter-on-quarter. I would not mention or will not do any comparison with 2011, because we are unfortunately in a completely different, let's say, economic environment.</p>
          <p>Cost of risk is up in all divisions, is up in all regions and country, except Austria, but obviously with different trend. Central-Eastern Europe, up from the first quarter, but stable year on year. Germany up, but mostly is due to one substantially big ticket and partially is also an accounting adjustment from risk and charges to provisions. Austria down, Italy significantly up from 146 bps to 209.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look now more in detail to the asset quality on slide 16. As you can see, the growth in term of impaired loans is equivalent to 3.2%, so impaired loans are still growing. What is positive at the group level is that the coverage ratio is stable. And if we decompose NPLs versus other impaired loans, we see NPLs growing at 3.8%. Other impaired loans growing 2.8%.</p>
          <p>Different trend in Italy. In Italy, the reality, the trend is better in the second quarter versus the first quarter. If we look the total impaired loans, meaning they're still growing but with the speed that is slightly less. And they're positive also versus the previous two quarter, the coverage ratio that starts to increase again. And as you can see, the NPLs are growing 4.9%, but here we have also a significant reclassification inside the impaired loans. So due to the deterioration of the economic environment, we have classified some doubtful loans, for example, to NPLs. Other impaired loans, in reality, this is quite encouraging they are decreasing minus 0.6% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>I would not comment too much, page 18 is just review of what we have already commented by region, versus the growth of the trend of impaired loans.</p>
          <p>So let's move to page 19 and we start to look after, to discuss the balance sheet structure of the bank. As you can see, the balance sheet has increased 2.3% since March 2012. This comes mostly from mark-to-market of derivatives, still positive, even though slightly increasing, the leverage ratio is below 20, one of the most conservative, I would say, among the large European banks.</p>
          <p>To continue with the balance sheet structure, this quarter the net interbank position is again improving significantly and decreasing by more &#x20AC;10 billion to &#x20AC;34.1 billion including the overnight deposit with Central Banks, so it's down from &#x20AC;44.5 billion to &#x20AC;34.1 billion, again including overnight deposit with Central Banks, down from &#x20AC;70 billion December 2011.</p>
          <p>Securities in issue remain quite stable, down &#x20AC;1.5 billion quarter-on-quarter, here I would simply say that thanks to our strong retail base 45% of total securities issued by the group are placed with our customers.</p>
          <p>Finally, the ECB gross fundings remain stable, we are at about &#x20AC;30 billion, &#x20AC;31 billion, of which &#x20AC;26 billion comes from three years LTRO. But it's important to keep in mind that, at the same time, we have loans to ECB and various Central Banks amounting to about &#x20AC;38 billion, so &#x20AC;31 billion taken, &#x20AC;38 billion deposited.</p>
          <p>Page 21, we have snapshot of our bond portfolio composition. Out of these &#x2013; out of &#x20AC;90 billion that is the total amount of bonds that we have, as you seen can see in the diagram, 46% were Italian, sovereign bonds, total about &#x20AC;41 billion. As I said already a couple of times, we have not increased our exposure to the Italian sovereign, that remains stable at &#x20AC;40 billion since, if I remember correctly, December 2010.</p>
          <p>In comparison with other &#x2013; with our national peers, our stock of Italian bonds is well below the tangible equity and precisely at 0.84, is the lowest I think &#x2013; what I think is the lowest among all Italian banks. And this gives you, I think, even more clear sensation of our conservative approach in this respect.</p>
          <p>Page 22, let's have a look to the funding plan. In term of funding program, we are well ahead of schedule. We have done already 68% of the overall target, it was &#x20AC;31 billion. Out of the &#x20AC;21.2 billion done, &#x20AC;9.6 billion are retail bonds. And in spite of this, it's important to remember that the network bonds are still represents only 7.1% of our customer total financial assets, providing ample room for further placement. So in spite of the growth, still we are one of the lowest bank &#x2013; we are one of the banks with a lowest percentage of retail bond versus total financial assets.</p>
          <p>We have currently no need to tap the secure wholesale market, in line with a strategic plan. But we will take, obviously, opportunistic approach if the market will be favorable, as we have done already during the current year. For Italy, the funding plan has been already done for 78%, so better than the average of the group.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look now to the balance sheet structure and liquidity, on slide 23, sorry. As you can see from this slide, we have a very well-matched balance sheet in term of maturities, giving us a strong, let me say, liquidity position.</p>
          <p>In addition, it is also well-matched, when it comes to asset and liabilities, and particularly, 60% of our asset and 50% of our liabilities are the result of close one-term client relationship.</p>
          <p>And when we look more deeply to the liquidity side, it comes up clear from slide 24 that how our unencumbered, immediately available liquid assets amounts to over &#x20AC;116 billion, well above the 100% of wholesale funding maturity &#x2013; maturing in the next 12 months. So, &#x20AC;116 billion of immediately available asset, including cash and deposits with Central Banks, above as I said, the 100% of the wholesale funding need. In addition, we will have also another &#x20AC;48 billion in eligible assets available within 12 months, bringing the total to &#x20AC;164 billion, definitely offering a solid buffer whatever the environment going forward.</p>
          <p>And the funding gap, page 25, as well positive trend is down by &#x20AC;42 billion from the peak of September 2011, so from &#x20AC;108 billion to &#x20AC;66 billion. Italy is one of the major contribution, I think Italy is around &#x20AC;26 billion, &#x20AC;27 billion down.</p>
          <p>Opposite trend in Central-Europe, we are slightly up, but once again, this is justified by the positive trend in term of loan development in the region, because this is, I think, a very important message, here we are performing definitely well, and this trend hopefully will continue.</p>
          <p>Let's move to capital, page 26, first of all, a look on risk-weighted asset, they are down 1.7%. Mostly, it's market that is down 12.7%, dropping &#x20AC;7.8 billion, which is mostly &#x2013; by far, the largest contributor is CIB. And we are down also 1.3% on credit risk-weighted asset.</p>
          <p>Important also the geographical diversification, 35% of risk-weighted assets are based in Italy; 25% in Germany, 7% Austria, or 25% Central-Europe and Poland, so very well-diversified position.</p>
          <p>And in terms of capital ratios, page 27, as I said in the beginning of my presentation, the Core Tier 1 Basel 2.5, improved by a further 8 bps and now stands at 10.39%, 10.4%. And in term of, if we consider Core Tier 1 calculated and of the EBA stress test, we are well above. And finally, looking to the numbers under fully-loaded Basel III, the Common Equity Tier 1 is once again above our 2012 target, and above 9%.</p>
          <p>Maybe you are used to see this slide, we present this slide every six month, you see the trend of our performance versus the strategic plan. I don't think we need to go too much into details. I will just underline the funding gap. We are seeing an improving trend, primarily thanks to increased customer deposit across the group and notably in Italy. Italian business, the organization is progressing well. Same, the risk-weighted asset optimization, here we are down $17 billion year-to-date in CIB, which $7 billion comes from run-off.</p>
          <p>So overall, the only point of attention is about FTE, following the Italian new pension law, but we have taken measures to compensate in term of cost the negative effect of the pension reform.</p>
          <p>I take one minute on page 29 to recap some of the principle of the reorganization that we announced the 10th of July this year, it's a project of the organization. It will be formally approved hopefully at the end of this year in December. It's not a revolution, it's the continuation of our strategic plan and the key points, in short, would be that we would move from a divisional breakdown to a regional approach in Italy, Germany, Austria and Poland. CIB would remain a global division, focusing on large multinational and large corporate customer.</p>
          <p>We have &#x2013; in the meantime, we have, we will cancel, let's say, the retail and the private banking division in the holding, so CIB will remain the only global division. CEE and GBS plus asset management will not be impacted substantially by the proposed changes. So this is done, again, in the logic of simplification, in the logic of containing costs, but also in the logic to have a much more lean and effective and quick bank, improving at the end the relationship with customer and also the revenues side.</p>
          <p>Last slide of the presentation is about turnaround Italy. Here the numbers are quite encouraging. As you can see, total revenues year-on-year up 5.3%. Operating cost down 5.7%. The gross operating profit, up 22.1%. So the turnaround, when we look to the commercial performance, it is there, the numbers are quite encouraging. If you look in term of numbers, second half 2011, there was a gross operating profit of &#x20AC;2 billion, we have reached &#x20AC;2.4 billion in the first half of 2012.</p>
          <p>This is helping in absorbing the increase of loan loss provision which unfortunately, as we have already discussed, is affecting now the Italian operation. But in term of commercial results, I would say we're in the right direction. Cost income is down, revenues minus loan loss provision, or risk-weighted asset improving. So, the trend definitely is the right one.</p>
          <p>I would close here my presentation with just a few last points. Let me say that, considering the exceptionally difficult environment, I am pretty satisfied or very satisfied with this result.</p>
          <p>We have seen a GOP resilient. We have seen a very conservative policy applied in term of loan loss provisions, as well as very conservative and also balanced risk and investment policy. But most important to me is the fact that we have solid, increasing capital ratios. We are ahead of target for 2012.</p>
          <p>We have a solid liquidity position, as well improving with the funding gap that keep shrinking. And we have also a very solid access to diversified funding sources. So we can say that we are solidly positioned to face any potential future challenge arising from this very difficult, unprecedented global economic turmoil.</p>
          <p>So, thank you for listening me. Now, we can move to the Q&amp;A session. I would just remind everybody that maximum, you shall keep term of number &#x2013; in term of question, maximum two questions at a time, in order to give space to everybody to put question and Marina Natale, our CFO, and myself will reply to them.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you and good afternoon. Thank you for the presentation. So, two questions from my side. One is &#x2013; and I just asked your peers as well, if the ECB were to contemplate negative rates on the excess reserves or deposits there, will there be any impact on your position, although, given that it's probably net negative, if probably the answer is no. And how would you look at it? Would you change anything in your ALM, how would you look at it? <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:52) was indicating, for example, he would hope to be able to issue more of CP paper and if you could make a comment.</p>
          <p>And also again, as we are going through, potentially, another rate cut, we expect about 50 basis points by the end of the year, could you just now refresh us on where you would be standing in terms of, all else being equal, your impact on net interest income? And how, again, you can see that being passed across to clients in terms of pricing?</p>
          <p>And the second question is very specific on Italy, you said you're satisfied with the progress. Indeed, in the quarter, you've been able to keep revenues stable, costs, even marginally down. But if I'm looking at your numbers, PBT for the half year is &#x20AC;80 million. It was &#x20AC;280 million in Q1, that means a &#x20AC;200 million loss in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And if I'm looking at the breakdown, provisions seems to have gone up from about &#x20AC;900 million in Q1 to &#x20AC;1.4 billion in Q2. So, that is a significant increase. I know you talked about some deterioration in the NPLs, but the increase seems to be material. If you could add whether that is going to be the Q2 level, a continuing level? Or if it was anything that is one-off in Italy as well, beside what you've flagged in Germany? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you put three questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One was on liquidity.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, let's say, if regarding the first questions about ECB, it's obvious that we will have probably to change as well part of our strategy because it will change the reasons and the economics, let's say, in operating with ECB. And I don't know if this will come, but we will have in some way to see as well as <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:12) said, if we have to go to the CP market or what to do in case they ask to change some of the strategy that we have currently in place, we'll see.</p>
          <p>And the 50 basis point drops, that means another 25 basis points down. Let me say that the impact is there, but should not be significant in the sense that this is impacting mostly &#x2013; in our portfolio, it's impacting mostly Germany and Austria. It's not impacting too much Italy, considering that Italy, now the price is based on spreads rather than Euribor. So the impact would be quite limited and still Western Europe is going again its own way. So the impact in our group diversified is actually quite manageable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I understand you correctly, your pricing on the lending side is based more on spreads, which are apparently still going up, rather than on the underlying rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, yes. Clearly, this is for Italy, in this point, it's impossible to consider Euribor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, sorry, one other follow-up on your change in strategy with regard to potential negative rate at the ECB, would that mean a change in strategy on the balances that you keep there or what would be the direction of change, just to understand where the strategy, what the impact would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Already now we have a reality since that they have decreased to zero the remuneration of the deposits with them, we have changed our strategy, meaning we place now the money not with them but we place the money with, as reserves, let's say, with the Central Banks, where at least you'll get something in terms of remuneration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Bank of Italy or Bundesbank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly, yes. So when we say in the presentation, deposit to Central Banks, actually 30 of June, no, but today there is &#x2013; I'm looking at Marina, but I think there is nothing with the ECB. So if they will go further down, obviously, we have to look for alternatives, further alternatives. But Marina wants to add something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we &#x2013; our understanding is that it's not on the agenda the option to go negative. Anyway, it's clear as already stated by Federico that the liquidity center which is going to be more exposed and more sensitive to this in the event a drop, a further drop in the rates, will be Germany rather than Italy. And we are &#x2013; you mentioned about, let's say, which are an implication, it will be more difficult for sure to do on pricing which is something that we are constantly doing since last year mid-year, also in the first quarter and also in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We managed to offset the significant drop in Euribor, namely 35 basis points, by a very active action on the reprice side. At the same time, fair to say that we are suffering also on the liability side, where we are not able to fully incorporate the reduction in the market rates and where we see a certain resilience of our rates on the liability side due to also the remix towards longer maturities on the liability side.</p>
          <p>So, at the end of the day, your point about which have implication for sure a shrinking &#x2013; a further impact on the NII, also the action we are activating on the asset side are very intensive. I guess, that this was the question about NII, while there was another question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Provisions and the cost of risk, obviously, in a market like this one, it's not easy to make serious forecast. We have activated a number of actions, we have deployed a lot of people on ground in order to be effective, one, on limiting the transfer of credit from in bonus to impaired. As you saw, there is some results in this quarter, we'll see if it sustainable, but people are there and they are working very hard and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you say action to limit the transfer, is it trying to capture early and renegotiate with the company, help out, restructure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. We have substantially cut into &#x2013; if I can summarize in few words, cut into the entire network based on rating of the customers, the highest ratings <mark type="ph" /> 6, 7, 9, (46:31) they are following a dedicated way with co-responsibility from business and risk for each of the customer, each of the customer in this category. There is a plan to reduce the risk and/or improve the level of collaterals and guarantees. So this is a big effort ongoing in order to limit the migration again from <mark type="ph" /> in bonus to impaired (47:12). And, clearly, the term of provisions depends a lot also the policy you want to apply for this quarter, as you've seen, is changed versus the previous one in Italy, we have decided to start to increase actually the coverage. This is a signal. In the previous two quarter, the coverage overall was going down, so we have decided to be more conservative. Again, we are vigilant, we are very conscious that this is the main problem. The bank is focused on it.</p>
          <p>On the rest of the group, I am more confident. I don't see problem, honestly speaking, in Austria and Germany. I think that also in Germany, the peak of this quarter is quite exceptional and from what we see in Central-Europe same, the situation seems under control.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Alberto Cordara of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir. Mr. Cordara, your line is open, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, sorry. Good afternoon. A couple of questions, the first one is relating on the P&amp;L that you presented this quarter. The provisions are quite high, but then I can see that you've increased your coverage in Italy from 40.6% in Q1 to 41.2%. The delta should be something over &#x20AC;300 million. So in my view, I mean, basically you've done a clean-up which is good. And probably, this clean up has been, let's say, funded from a P&amp;L point of view by the trading line, which was quite strong. So I would see this increase in provision interest, let's call it, one-off, but to me, the trading line seems quite strong, and I'm not sure why. So I just wanted to ask you why in this quarter trading was so positive.</p>
          <p>The second is the deposit <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:33) from this quarter, apart from capital is on the cost line. I can see the cost giving you a very good performance. And then you have been talking quite extensively about this new plan for UniCredit. I remember from the business plan you have the idea to keep the cost line flat. So I just wanted to get back on this issue and asking you whether you think you can do better than the business plan, which I assume it's a bit of a must given the current environment.</p>
          <p>And if you can give us an idea this year where the cost line would end up being. Typically you have a strong seasonal adjustment in Q4 downward when you recover the variable compensation allocated throughout the years. Should we see that this year as well or not? So these are my questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In term of provisions, I will say that what is &#x2013; I mean, the increase comes because we have mostly &#x2013; because we have also some new entry which is clearly in the impaired loans. Even though, for example, on the past due in reality we decrease versus the previous quarter by &#x20AC;500 million more or less. It's a reclassification of provisions of our loans within the impaired loans. So if you move from doubtful to LLP to &#x2013; sorry, NPL, there is clearly also the need to adjust the provisions. We have also provisions more than before, some single names. So there is &#x20AC;200 million I think related to single names.</p>
          <p>So again, I will define this not a clean-up, but a more conservative approach versus previous one. But not because we changed policy, but because we recognized there is an increasing deterioration in the economic trend in Italy.</p>
          <p>Trading, now trading I think is pretty stable. As I said, it's down quarter-on-quarter. Also excluding buyback in the first quarter, it's stable versus one year ago. So there is nothing special or exceptional in the results of trading. Keep in mind that we don't do prop trading, for example, so investment banking of the group is entirely focused on servicing substantially the corporate base of the group. So one of the ambition, even though it's impossible, the ambition is to have some stability also on the trading line. Cost, yeah, we are performing in the first half of this year quite well, probably better than expectation. I don't want to give numbers for the near future. We have done &#x2013; we think that we can do better than what was envisaged in the plan, but this has to be proved day-by-day with continuous attention and new action on the cost side.</p>
          <p>We have also &#x2013; what we do is two kind of things. One is a pure cost-cutting exercise. One is to try to find action of discontinuity versus the past. One is the one I showed you during the presentation about branches. Today, we came out with a press release for a large project called the Newton. Here again is a quite innovative approach. We are just at the beginning of this journey. But the plan is to create a discontinuity in the management of our IT infrastructure in order to get the benefit in term of cost.</p>
          <p>In this press release it's mentioned a number &#x20AC;1.2 billion in 10 years of accumulated savings. Again, in this moment, it is a project in the sense that we have just started the implementation phase, but I'm mentioning this just to give you the idea that we keep really working on two dimensions, cost cutting on one side, the discontinuity on the other side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I pick up on this because I think this is very interesting. I mean, obviously there is problem in terms of negotiation with the trade unions and whatnot. But increased efficiency of the network for you and for other Italian banks, to me, is a bit of a low-hanging fruit, is something that is relatively plain that should be easy to be achieved, again, apart from obviously the negotiations that you need to have with the trade unions.</p>
          <p>But a question to you is efficiency in Italy, yes, but what about other markets? I mean, we saw the German retail business that has a very high cost income ratio and this has been historically always very high. Is there any way you can also improve the efficiency of your other, at least, Western European operations and are you working on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the example we have seen for Italy with a bigger shift from, let's say, physical branches to alternative delivery channels is &#x2013; will be done also in Germany and Austria. We want to see how it's working in Italy, but the plan is to go in the same way on the German and Austrian side, because, as you said correctly, there is an issue of cost income at the end of the day on the retail business in mature markets. So it's inevitable to work on the fixed cost, again, mostly the cost of a physical network. So, the plan is to do &#x2013; to have a similar approach also in these countries. This is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:08) and I think with this, I have replied to the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that if you look, you're going to see the data set with all the detail and if you look at the change quarter-on-quarter also Germany and Austria are showing a decline. Overall, the total direct cost of the Western Europe region is down. So in a consistent way, also our centers to show different dynamics &#x2013; it's slightly different dynamics for Central-Eastern Europe as already pointed out, with a different strategy in terms of ways to fuel the growth of revenues.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, thanks for taking the time. And my first question is on SME debt under moratoria, under the Italy moratoria, could you update us as to how much loans are involved? That's the first one. And the second question I had was out of your total gross loans for how much of this loans have you had to stop accruing interest because the client is in so much trouble? I just want to get a feeling as to the size of the potential issue. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the first question, I think we will send to you the information after the call because I am not able to reply. I don't recall the numbers honestly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Or maybe it's not even yet available because I doubt that the law is fully implemented. Anyway, we will check and we will contact you with the highest details possible.</p>
          <p>On the total loans stopping accruing interest, et cetera, obviously, if they are NPLs we stop, by definition, to accrue interest. And on top of this, we have decided to keep the level of interest for doubtful loan the lowest possible to avoid that if they become NPLs then we have to do in provision what you have accrued in terms of interest. So we try to &#x2013; so NPLs, no accrual, the other impaired loans, we try to apply &#x2013; it's counterintuitive but we try to apply lower interest, if we feel that there is risk to become NPLs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So ,basically, if you numbers behind this, you have &#x20AC;44.8 billion of NPLs for which you don't accrue any interest in the gross?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And for &#x20AC;32.9 billion, you only accrue a lower rate. So, say this loans would...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. So for the &#x20AC;32 billion, it's a one-to-one decision. So the fact that the network is allowed to apply lower interest rate when &#x2013; the more the situation becomes difficult, but it's a one-to-one decision, so it's not for &#x20AC;32 billion total.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. I have two questions. One is about, let's say, asset quality. I was wondering, I missed the previous part on the first part of the call, but I was wondering if there is a new guidance in terms of loan loss provision for the full year, because loan loss provision was a little bit volatile in the first two quarters. I'm asking this because if I look at the bottom line and I consider that the large part of this year, the capital gain on the London Stock Exchange, there is not a lot of, let's say, capital generation through the profit and loss. And, in fact, if I look at your capital ratios, the improvement is mainly related to, let's say, decreasing RWA.</p>
          <p>Second question is about always asset quality, I was wondering if you are provisioning anything about Imco, Synergia, Premafin and, I don't know, maybe FonSAI? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guidance about asset quality, as I said, we are monitoring the situation day after day. And we are doing a lot of things to keep the situation under control. We don't give guidance because, I think, in a market like this one, it's really, it's too much volatile. So it's impossible to give to an analyst a direction.</p>
          <p>Capital gain, true, it's &#x20AC;120 million from London Stock Exchange. But at the same time, it's fair to say that we have also, more or less an equivalent, of one-off negative that are compensating this in Germany, that are compensating the one-off we had from the London Stock Exchange.</p>
          <p>Imco, Synergia, FonSAI, blah, blah, blah, policy is to not disclose, do not disclose what we do for single names. Clearly, these are names that, by definition, are under a clear view &#x2013; review, meaning, a clear spotlight ,and they will be for supervision for what is needed.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just to go back to the previous question, just to make sure I understood. You said that you're unable to make a forecast for provision, because I think you said asset quality. I think we're more interested in provisions because I think that's the surprising number today. I think the highest analyst had &#x20AC;1.7 billion and you booked &#x20AC;1.9 billion. So unless you tell me that there is any one-off <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:08) which I think you said there isn't, then obviously the inclination is to take that as a type of a run rate.</p>
          <p>Number two, could you remind us why you decided to sell your stake in LSE because I thought it was strategic. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Unable is not the proper wording. We don't give guidance, but not that we are not able to give guidance. The provision of the quarter, there is for sure one one-off, this &#x20AC;100 million, precisely &#x20AC;104 million in Germany. It is &#x2013; was a name that was already booked and the risking charges has been moved to LLP, so it's one-off.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon to everybody, I have a single question, which regarding RWA optimization in second quarter. I wonder if you can update us on the program, if any, to migrate some of your portfolio to IRBs. I wonder if in Italy, do you have room for doing so. We've seen some competitors in Q2, obtaining a significant benefit to this. I wonder if you're having the same situation. And if so, if you do project to ask for the validation of internal models by year-end. And if you can give also a guidance about a potential benefit, also. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting from the validation of models, let's remember that we are the only bank with the advanced approach in Italy. We are now working on the extension of the advanced approach to the part of the portfolio that is not yet covered, that is not in the bank, that is mostly outside the bank. I'm referring to leasing, for example. But again, we have already moved to the advanced approach sometime ago. So, it doesn't apply to us what others have done.</p>
          <p>We keep going with rationalization of our risk-weighted assets. As you remember maybe, we have almost &#x20AC;50 billion of portfolio on offer, of which, of this &#x20AC;50 billion, &#x20AC;35 billion more or less will be done by 2015. We are taking substantially any possibility or opportunity to improve in term of optimization, in term of reduction of risk-weighted assets. It's not an easy market to go in this direction, especially in Italy, where prices for selling portfolio, for example, are definitely not in this moment interesting unless &#x2013; and it's also difficult to find a buyer.</p>
          <p>So, from one side, we keep working especially on the CIB side, in terms of optimization. The program of run-off is ongoing. As you say maybe in the presentation, &#x20AC;7 billion done up to now, up to 30th of June, last approach is already applied. Then to Marina with some additional numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>&#x20AC;2.5 billion is the contribution of what we call during the industrial plan presentation, ring-fenced portfolio, is a contribution for the quarter. So in a very consistent way, we continue to go down as we projected at the time of the industrial plan. For this quarter, we are not accounting any specific improvement due to regulation, while its business evolution or let's say dynamics of operational risk which are contributing to the development of the risk-weighted assets.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Carlo Digrandi of HSBC. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I have two questions. The one on slide 26, where you showed the risk-weighted assets, the weight on risk-weighted assets over total assets went down, 100 bps or so, over the quarter. So I was wondering if there is still more room to improve the ratio given the fact that in this difficult moment, it did help to create some capital generation, albeit small. And in this case, if you think that this will be an issue going forward, in the sense that it will help you to create additional capital generation.</p>
          <p>At the same time, I was wondering if you can give us the Basel III impact fully-phased in, given the fact that probably towards the end of the year, you will be presented the accounts anyway in this respect.</p>
          <p>The second question is on liquidity. You did show the plan of liquidity of the &#x20AC;31 billion, as expected, at the beginning of the year, and this has not changed. So can I assume, with a little bit of say luck, if the markets will continue to remain relatively okay for you, that you will achieve the &#x20AC;31 billion and at that point, you may eventually be long of liquidity given the fact that you've been taking the LTRO? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for liquidity, yes, the funding plan was &#x20AC;31 billion. And the intention is to fulfill the funding plan. Intention is to keep improving our liquidity position and to get any opportunity coming from the market. You are right in saying that we may be long in term of liquidity, but I'm want to state very clear that, also in this moment, we don't have an optimal liquidity position, in the sense that we have to match liquidity in certain area of the group. But I prefer to be in this situation right now rather than the opposite. So the plan will be completed and we'll see what to do then, the following years. But the liquidity is for us primary importance.</p>
          <p>Risk-weighted asset and the Basel III, Marina can give you numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Risk-weighted assets, since there are no other specific change in regulation before year-end, we will update in the next few calls. And so we will discuss for 2013 the potential impact, next time we're going to meet.</p>
          <p>And on Basel III, the impact is approximately 110 basis point, as a result of the &#x2013; if you upload all the impact. But as you know, there are still three open big question marks about the full implementation of Basel III, i.e., the filter on available for sale, the balancing factor on SMEs and also some still uncertainty about DTA and DTA minor elements, while the filter is <mark type="ph" /> on effect for sure (1:10:05) is for sure minor in term of impact. And this is going to be a positive impact, in the event it is going to be offset there to maintain such filter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. A question regarding page 34, which indicates that new entries of impaired loans are falling, this should be a leading indicator. Do you think we can extrapolate anything on future quarterly loan loss provisions?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I have questions on tax. On one hand, you are announcing the settlement with the treasury and operation Brontos. Are we right to assume that there would be no impact to future P&amp;L and that you have already expensed for them?</p>
          <p>And secondly, we have seen one of your competitors getting a significant tax refund. Can we assume that UniCredit will have something similar? Or is that something specific to your competitor? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Brontos, you are right. There is no impact on our P&amp;L because that has been already provisioned, let's say, in this first half of this year. The question about the asset quality at page 34, the peak 58 is also positively influenced by the change of regulation on Italian past due. And that has reduced the limit from under 80 days to 90 days, we had a jump of &#x20AC;1 billion more in our numbers. As I said already, the second quarter shows a specific on in past due a drop of &#x20AC;500 million.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, I'm saying once again, the big efforts that we do especially in Italy, in the network in particular is to work on in bonus, customer in bonus, in order to try to limit as much as possible. It's a big effort, but to limit as much possible the migration to impaired. For the tax refund, Marina?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrea, sorry, didn't get exactly your question, but I understand that probably you have seen the press release of Intesa, which is referring to a tax refund, tax benefit. Unfortunately, this quarter we don't have either benefit or bad news since the Brontos case was already paid out from the P&amp;L of last year. So this quarter and also the previous one was not affected by Brontos, fully reflected in previous year. While in terms of benefit, I don't know, to be very honest, the details, so I can't compare with the Intesa detail.</p>
          <p>What I know that this quarter we have a tiny amount in relation to the capital increase, approximately &#x20AC;40 million and we have the benefit of the tax benefit coming from Salva Italia...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Salva Italia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Salva Italia, sorry &#x2013; Salva Italia, you are right. Salva Italia, which amount approximately to &#x20AC;40 million for &#x2013; in relation to the previous year. So it's &#x20AC;40 million one-off, while &#x20AC;21 million is the recurrent element and is impacting the first six months. So if you like to qualify to one-off element the only one we have is &#x20AC;40 million plus the, what we call <mark type="ph" /> ACHE (1:14:19) in relation to the capital increase and we have booked the full amount of &#x20AC;40 million in the second quarter, rather than to have it spread during the first two quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>But this is the only two elements we can mention as extraordinary which, unfortunately I cannot compare with those of you have seen on the other press release, because I don't have the details.</p>
          <p>Andrea, I guess that you asked or something, the third question unfortunately I missed it...</p>

          <p>The next question is from Ms. Anke Reingen of Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. I just had a very simple follow-up question, I just wondered about your net interest income trend in retail Italy, and I'm just trying to understand, I mean your net interest income is up despite a decline in loan volume and an increase in deposits. I just wondered is it to do with divisional accounting or &#x2013; unfortunately, I can't find the slide of the interest rates you gave us, or the customer rates you have given us in the previous quarters. Is it to do with higher loans rates, or can you maybe just give a bit of an indication of the trend? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in term of net interest income in Italy, there is a very big effort ongoing in the network in term of repricing. And there is a very centralized, let's say, policy in terms of FTP. So we give to the network, challenging rates, I'm putting this way, and on top of this, the network is engaged in continuous repricing. Let me say in general that the current difficulties in the market in some way, they are helping in the repricing side because it's clear that if you have capital and liquidity, nowadays you can catch customers and you can apply your price.</p>
          <p>So, the positive result is due to the commercial effort coming from the network. It's not the first quarter, this one also in the first quarter, if you remember, the net interest income was quite resilient because of the capability in Italy to reprice loans and deposits.</p>
          <p>So, in terms of deposit, another important point to keep in mind is that, most of our deposits in Italy are so-called commercial deposits, so more or less the equivalent of site deposit where we keep paying interest around 0.05%, correct? Yes, 0.05%, so this helps in keeping up in some way the net interest income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So it should continue to go up slightly, hopefully?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the trend should be sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you should come to Italy and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:17:55) this question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The effort is there. The effort &#x2013; I mean, but what I can tell you is that the commercial side, two things have to come first, when <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:18:10) talk to customers, one is deposit, so liquidity and one is pricing. So this is what I can guarantee, then we will see what will be the market.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Andrea Vercellone with Exane. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions on my side. The first one is on capital. I just wanted to know whether you have accrued any dividend in the first half of the year, you don't need to tell me how much it is, just want to know if it's in the ratio.</p>
          <p>The second question is on net interest income in the corporate center. If we look in your divisional database, it looks that all of the divisions are actually doing quite okay. The problem is that the corporate center has actually recorded a swing of more or less &#x20AC;150 million quarter-on-quarter. So I just like to have a little bit of an explanation as to why this is happened. Particularly, I'd like to know, whether there is a delay in transferring this to the divisions or if there's any one-off elements in this corporate center. Or if not, whether we should just assume that it's the new group funding cost, let's say, that has been locked in, so it should remain there, for a little longer. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About dividend, as you know, we are required by Bank of Italy to file the information about the capital. And we have taken the decision to keep the same approval we have already presented last quarter, i.e., the average of the last three years. So it's a &#x2013; we have not taken any decision about the dividend payment. The decision will come in year end, the time of the approval and only for the purpose of this, the filing to Bank of Italy of our Core Tier 1, we are assuming approximately &#x20AC;0.10 payment. But again, it's not a decision and it's not kind of the &#x2013; looked at a commitment to pay out this level of dividend. So we will review the decision year end.</p>
          <p>About NII of the corporate center, there are no specific one-off or big element. It's fair, your assessment that the business is enjoyed &#x2013; is reflecting a performance, while in this corporate center, we see a loss and the loss is the toll we are paying to keep a very conservative liquidity position in order to be ready, let's say, in a market situation which is still very volatile. Therefore, this is the impact of such commitment to the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to elaborate on this point of Marina, the last point about the conservative approach. So as I said, we pay something in term of revenues in order to be on the safe side. One is the liquidity position of the bank. It is not optimal in the sense that we could use the liquidity in a better way, but we prefer to be long in some way. And then, let me remember once again, our approach in term of investments, so in term of bond portfolio, we keep the total of our portfolio. We limit to high yield bonds, to a level that compared to many peers is below. So we have to view net interest income also accordingly to our &#x2013; to the policy that we have chosen, let's say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to follow-up on this, so is it a fair comment, on my part, to say that if nothing changes in the next quarter, then more or less, the quite high negative interest income in the corporate center should remain more or less at the same level or not? If you don't change your liquidity policy, your bond portfolio policies or &#x2013; well, it sounds surprising, but I assume you're not going to change your formula to charge the divisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Things being equal, yes, in the sense that we will see also the volume mix, so it's not only a matter of price, it's also a matter of volume, so which are driving the impact on P&amp;L of business and as a result of the transfer rate of the corporate center.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just a quick question. If you could give me an idea of how is competition in Italy on the liabilities side evolving, and where are you seeing the highest push for funds, in which products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well this moment, it's not easy to read the market, but I will say in this moment, the competition is a bit less intense than was at the beginning of the year. Probably, the effect of one, LTRO; two, the loans demand that is pretty low is helping in some way, banks. We are quite happy, because overall, when we do benchmarking with the system, we see that we are increasing deposits, as is evident from our numbers and for sure, we are not the one paying the highest rate. So the competition is tough, but a bit better than beginning of this year.</p>
          <p>We will see next year when probably banks will have to face another year of wholesale funding, pretty challenging and maybe, hopefully, if the economy will slightly pick up, the demand in term of loan will come back. But up to now, tough but not unmanageable.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
