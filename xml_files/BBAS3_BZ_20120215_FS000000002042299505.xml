          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. We will now begin Banco do Brasil's Fourth Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and a live broadcast with slide presentation on the Bank's website, at Investor Relations site where questions may be sent through.</p>
          <p>Before proceeding, let me mention that this presentation may include references and statements, planned synergies, increasing estimates, projections of results and future strategy for Banco do Brasil, its associated and affiliated companies and subsidiaries. These expectations are highly dependent on market conditions, on Brazil's economic and banking system of performances, as well as an international market one. Banco do Brasil is not responsible for bringing up to date any estimated information in this presentation.</p>
          <p>First, we're going to have some details of the results. At the end of the presentation, the executives will answer the questions from the participants. With us today, Mr. Ivan de Souza Monteiro, CFO; and Mr. Gustavo Sousa, Head of IR.</p>
          <p>Mr. Gustavo, you may begin now.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Gustavo Sousa. It's a pleasure to be here hosting my first earnings conference for Banco do Brasil as Head of IR. As was mentioned, I'm here with Ivan Monteiro, Banco do Brasil's CFO and other executives of the bank.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide three, we have the highlights of Banco do Brasil's performance. As you can see the bank presented an increase on the NII items, the allowance for loan losses was below the guidance, delinquency ratios were lower than the banking industry, the bank showed a control in administrative expenses and diversification in business items. The bank showed an increase in other sources of revenue.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide four, we have the guidance of 2011 and the performance for 2011 as you can see the bank achieved most of the items informed in the guidance with the exception of the expansion of the individuals loan book where the guidance was 17% to 21% expansion and the banks grew by 15.4% and the reason was the implementation of the macroprudential measures by the Central Bank early last year.</p>
          <p>When the bank prepared the budgets for 2011, the bank did not take under consideration those measures. They haven't been announced at that time. And the expansion on the corporate loan book, the guidance was 16% to 19% and the bank achieved an expansion of 14.3% and this is due to the fact that the bank extended its credits to Brazilian companies via the acquisition of corporate bonds from those companies. So it is &#x2013; these are also credit items but they were not included in these items for this purpose. But had they been included the bank would have achieved this guidance and another positive year <mark type="audio gap" /> (03:27) over the average portfolio.</p>
          <p>Moving to page five, we have the net income for Banco do Brasil and we see the information of the net income and of the recurring net income, the bank posted a R$11.8 million recurring net income, the extraordinary items were related to on the positive side, the sale of non-core participations, fiscal efficiency; and on the negative side, economic plans.</p>
          <p>On page six, we have a breakdown of Banco do Brasil's total operating revenues. We highlight the expansion of the NII. This item grew by 11.1% and represents 70.4% of Banco do Brasil's total operating revenues and we also highlight the expansion of the insurance business. The business grew by 20% and with a total share of 3.7% of Banco do Brasil's total operating revenues. One other item of importance is the decrease of participation of the Previ item. As you know, this is due to a fluctuation of the profit, but and also due to the expansion of the bank's business.</p>
          <p>Moving to page seven, we have Banco do Brasil's leadership positions. Banco do Brasil is the number one in assets with 20.9% market share. It's also the number one in credit with a 19.2% market share. The leader in deposits with 26.4% market share, and the leader in asset management. Banco do Brasil's subsidiary BB DTVM holds 21.6% of this market.</p>
          <p>Moving to page eight, we have a table of sources and uses, and I would like to highlight here the expansion of deposits. This item grew by 17.4% and the share of this item in the total funding sources of Banco do Brasil is 74.2% and I would also highlight the expansion of commercial papers here and this is not the ideal translation. This item is composed of what we call Letras Financeiras and this represents a funding instrument in Brazil very similar to a bond issued by a bank and LCA, Letra de Cr&#xE9;dito do Agroneg&#xF3;cio, which is a funding instrument backed by agribusiness loans.</p>
          <p>Moving to page nine, we have a breakdown of the deposits and I would good highlight here that our savings deposits reached R$100 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 10, we have a breakdown of those items that I had mentioned the LCA and Letras Financeiras. These items tend to be very important funding instruments for Banco do Brasil in the near future.</p>
          <p>In terms of foreign borrowings on slide 11, we see that Banco do Brasil reached a record balance in foreign borrowing, reaching $34.6 billion in this item. I would highlight here the item bond issuance at $11 billion. As you know, Banco do Brasil is a frequent issuer in the global capital market using a variety of instruments from single bonds to subordinated securities and also hybrid instruments.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 12, we have a graph on asset management. We have an expansion of 15.4% year-on-year. Again, BB DTVM is the leader in this market with 21.6% market share and if we look at the fee that this business generates, in the year of 2011 this business generated over R$12 billion in fees, an expansion of 19.7% year-on-year; and the expansion quarter-on-quarter, fourth quarter 2011 versus fourth quarter 2010, is up 20%. This is a very consistent business for Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>On page 13, we present a breakdown of the NII. This is a new breakdown that we are presenting this quarter. This is an effort to present a clearer way to look at the Banco do Brasil's NII. And the items, the NII is broken down into loans operations, net revenues from loans operations, the expenses for funding, the recovery of credit that were written-off, treasury and other. And it is important to say that reconciling this table to the financial statement is not an easy task. So, this is a good way to look at these items, because for instance, effect of FX changes is totally compromised on the treasury item.</p>
          <p>By looking at this table, we can see that, what we have been telling to the market, that Banco do Brasil's main focus is on credit, it's very clear here. And also that Banco do Brasil uses its treasury to manage its liquidity positions and its FX exposures. So we can see the stable, the stable growth of these items, of every component of these items.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 14, we have our NIM numbers and I'd highlight here, that Banco do Brasil's funding cost in terms of percentage of the Selic, still very competitive at 68.3%. Then moving to slide 15, we also have the information of the spread by credit operations in the different segments.</p>
          <p>On page 16, we start with information of our loan portfolio and we call here this loan portfolio in a broad concept, in an amplified concept. We add to the loan portfolio that it is considered by the Central Bank under the resolution 2682. We add the private bonds, the corporate bonds issued by Brazilian companies and guarantees. In this concept Banco do Brasil grew by 19.8%. And we can see that the expansion on the individuals book and on the corporates book enable a dilution of the participation of the agribusiness credit from 19%, almost 19.5% on December 2010 to 19.2%.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 17, we have a breakdown of Banco do Brasil's individuals loan portfolio, where we highlight the growth of 15.5% and the concentration of lower risk credit lines, such as mortgage, salary loans, auto finance and payroll loans; these instruments again a very low risk response for nearly 80% of Banco do Brasil's individuals loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 18, we have a slide showing the effect of the macroprudential measures that were implemented early last year by the Brazilian Central Bank. As you can see on this slide, after the announcement of the macroprudential measures the volume of disbursements on a monthly basis decreased and after the announcement of the easing of these measures, the volume of disbursements went back to a normal level.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 19, we have a slide on the mortgage portfolio of Banco do Brasil both to individuals and corporates, where the bank has been showing a significant growth.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 20, we have a view of the mortgage to individuals in terms of new contracts and disbursements. We highlight &#x2013; other than the tax loss, we highlight that the bank has disbursed over R$3.5 billion through individuals in mortgage line in 2011.</p>
          <p>In the slide 21, the same deal, but this time on corporate, the bank has disbursed over R$1.3 billion in mortgage vested to businesses in Brazil.</p>
          <p>On page 22, we show a breakdown of the corporate loan portfolio. This portfolio presented a growth of 19.2% and this time in this growth metric we include the corporate bonds issued by Brazilian companies, here like I had mentioned before when I talked about the guidance. If we were to move this item, we would have achieved the guidance and we see that, the credit related to investment and the credit executed by the acquisition of corporate bonds is gaining participation in Banco do Brasil's overall corporate loan portfolio. This is due to the fact that these instruments are used on infrastructure projects and we think that this is a very positive trend for the country and for Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>On page 23, we present another breakdown of the corporate loan portfolio. This time into loans to SMEs and loans to medium and large sized companies; we can see a balanced growth of around 19% in those items.</p>
          <p>On slide 24, we opened the utilization of FGO, Fundo de Garantidor de Opera&#xE7;&#xF5;es. This is an important risk mitigator for the SME portfolio. This fund represents a complement to the guarantees provided by those companies, and as you can see the usage of this item has grown by nearly 40% over the last year.</p>
          <p>On slide 25, Banco do Brasil presents items that show its leadership in foreign trade with a record monthly flow in October and a record annual flow in 2011.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 26, we see there disbursements in investments which reached R$10.4 billion in the fourth quarter and R$33.8 billion in the year of 2011, a 63.2% increase.</p>
          <p>And moving to slide 27, we have a breakdown of these disbursements in terms of funding sources. We can see the importance of FCO, BNDES, and Finame.</p>
          <p>On page 28, we have an instrument that is very important to SME, it is the BNDES cards and also an increase in disbursements in these lines. As you can see, Banco do Brasil is the absolute leader in this segment with nearly two-thirds of market share in different views of these lines.</p>
          <p>On page 29, we start to show our agribusiness loan portfolio. Banco do Brasil is also a leader in this item with 63.1% market share. The balance of these transactions reached R$89.4 billion and we highlight the increasing participation of credit to businesses in the agribusiness. We see that with this R$32.2 billion balance to company, this represents 36% of the agribusiness portfolio.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 30, we see the usage of risk mitigators on Banco do Brasil's agribusiness portfolio. These risk mitigators are specifically used on the stage of the cost when you're financing the crop, the early stage of financing the crop and you can see that Banco do Brasil is using risk mitigators at this level at 56, in 56.8% of those loans. And if we look at the southern region of Brazil, a region that has been affect by weather events recently, we see that utilization is even broader at that region with 74.2%.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 31, we also highlight in one specific crop, here the crop of corn, which was the one that was most affected by the weather, that the utilization of mitigators is even more enhanced than in the others with 90% mitigated in this crop.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 32 and ending on information on the agribusiness portfolio, we see that the share of renegotiated loans in the agribusiness portfolio is decreasing quarter-over-quarter. In 2008, developed operations represented 11.5% (sic) [22.7%] (16:48) of the portfolio and at the end of 2011 this share dropped to 6.4%.</p>
          <p>Now talking about the quality of our portfolio on slide 33, we see the credit risk. The operations with better risk went from 93.7% in December 2010 to 93.9% in December 2011, a consequence of the growth in lower risk lines.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 34, we see that Banco do Brasil's NPL ratios are substantially better than those presented by the banking industry, even on an opposite trend.</p>
          <p>On page 35, we see that the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses, where we can observe the stability of the cushion, of the additional provisions that Banco do Brasil has created to save credit risk.</p>
          <p>On page 36, we present the coverage ratio. The provisions over NPL past 90 days, we see that the bank also has a metric considerably above of what's presented by the Brazilian banking industry.</p>
          <p>On page 37, we have a view of Banco do Brasil's distribution network. Banco do Brasil is the absolute leader of this item with 25.1% market share of the total branches in the country. And we also highlight the increase of our distribution network with the addition of Banco Postal.</p>
          <p>On page 38, we also talk about Banco Postal and we show some goals of our Banco Postal operation, to anticipate our objective of being in all Brazilian municipalities, to increase the number of products offered in this new distribution network, to enhance the bank realization process in the country and to get closer to the new middle class.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 39, another breakdown of the Banco Postal, this time showing the results of the first month of operation of this channel. And we can see that this channel conducted over 7 million transactions and opened over 140,000 new accounts. We can see that this will be an important channel for Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>On page 40, we see we have a few of the administrative expenses versus our growth in assets. We can see that the growth in Banco do Brasil's business has been faster than the growth in administrative expenses. So the ratio of expenses to assets has decreased.</p>
          <p>If we move to page 41, we have another measure of this trend, the efficiency trend of Banco do Brasil seeing that the bank reached 42.1% at the end of 2011 in the year of 2011. And we can see that the trend that reflects Banco do Brasil's obsessive control of administrative expenses.</p>
          <p>On page 42, we see how the bank is trying to get more profits to make its relationship with its client even more profitable. The bank has invested in alternative channels. As you know Banco do Brasil has a large distribution network. Now, Banco do Brasil has Banco Postal. The Banco do Brasil has increased its staff that deals directly with customers and as a result the promotional revenue by client is increasing.</p>
          <p>On page 43, we have the income related to the insurance activity and what we call the insurance ratio also presenting an increase.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 44, we have some numbers of our card business. We see that this business has shown an increase in turnover of 23.8%. And I will comment that the fees related by this type of transaction, credit and debit card, they increased by 18.7%, totaling in the year of 2011 nearly $R4 billion. This is one very important driver of Banco do Brasil's fee business.</p>
          <p>Another important driver of fee for Banco do Brasil is the capital market activity and we can see that on page 45. Even in non-ideal conditions for this market in 2011, the bank has played an important role being one of the leaders of the local fixed income market, also participating in equity transactions from Brazilian company and been an important part of these companies in their access to the global capital markets.</p>
          <p>On page 46, we have a view of Banco do Brasil's capital adequacy by looking at Banco do Brasil's BIS ratio. Banco do Brasil finished December, 2011, with a BIS ratio of 14%, breaking this 14% down we see a 10.5% Tier I capital and a 3.5% Tier II capital.</p>
          <p>As you know Banco do Brasil issued a perpetual instrument in January. The intention of Banco do Brasil is to classify this instrument as a Tier I &#x2013; as Tier I capital and we are still waiting for the Brazilian Central Bank to approve it. If we were to classify this instrument as Tier I capital, Banco do Brasil's BIS ratio would grow to 14.3%, the Tier I capital would grow to 10.8%, as you can see on the pro forma calculations on this slide.</p>
          <p>In summary on page 47, we present our guidance for 2012. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:38) those items and to the highlights we see that the ROE, our guidance is that it will be between 19% and 22%, the NII will grow between 11% and 15%, total deposits between 14% and 18%, the loan portfolio will grow between 17% and 21%, and the allowances for credit risks will be between 3.1% and 3.5%. We also have other measures here as the fee income that we project &#x2013; where we project a growth from 13% to 18%, and admin expenses from 8% to 12%.</p>
          <p>And now, ending the presentation, we move the session of Q&amp;A. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. Let me ask you a question, let me focus on your capital ratio. I was surprised to see your Tier I ratio remaining stable at 10.5%, because when the Central Bank removed some of the macroprudential measures in November, the bank was estimating that this would have a 70 basis points improvement in the Tier I ratio. So, I wanted to understand why your Tier I ratio did not improve as you have anticipated? Also, I'd like to understand some more, how do you look at your capital ratio today? And with regards to Basel III implementation, when should we expect to hear from the Central Bank in Brazil about the rules on Basel III in Brazil? And how do you look at potential sale of assets in order to boost your capital ratio? And here, specifically, if you could comment on NeoEnergia and Cielo? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hi, everybody. Let me repeat the question, I guess you didn't hear it. I was wondering why your Tier I ratio remained stable at 10.5%, because when the Central Bank removed some of the macroprudential measures in November, you had estimated that this would have a 70 basis points improvements on your Tier I ratio. So, first, I wanted to understand why the Tier I ratio remained stable, even though you had the benefits of the removal of the macroprudential measures, which reduced the risk weighting of some consumer loans?</p>
          <p>And then, related to the capital ratio, I was wondering how do you see our capital ratio in relation to Basel III? When should we expect the Brazilian Central Bank to come out with the rules of Basel III implementation in Brazil? And how do you look at potential sale of assets in order to boost your capital ratio? And here specifically, if you could comment on potential sales of NeoEnergia and Cielo? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking about the Tier I ratio, what happened is November and December was very nice for us in terms of disbursements. I believe that could explain what happened with the Tier I. Talking about the public hearing, we're waiting for the Brazilian Central Bank and we didn't know to specify the marks that is going to happen. Okay. We're in still waiting. Talking specifically about <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:24) and proposal and NeoEnergia, we didn't have anything concrete value right now, because we're always waiting for some, these assets not are core assets for us and we're always hoping to receive proposals on them, <mark type="ph" /> Mike (29:43). But there is nothing that we are studying or we are developing right now. And talking about the Cielo, I'd like to pass through <mark type="ph" /> Isabel <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:52).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Talking about Cielo, we're not driving any study about open needs capital. We have Cielo since its beginning working along with the banks and the merchant in a very complementary way. So, there is no conflict of interest in this business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me follow-up then, Ivan, first, on the Tier I ratio. I didn't understand the answer. Like, in November you said that you expected it to improve 70 basis points, but did I understand that you said like in December you had very strong loan growth and that's why your capital ratio did not improve as you expected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's true. It was very, very good. When you remove, when you'll be start easing the process or the macroprudential measure, it was very good. And it's common that in the first half we have a strong growth in disbursements. That was one of the reason that we forecast, and another was that  it was not exactly what we forecasted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then what do you estimate to be your Tier I ratio under Basel III, given what the Central Bank has already said in Brazil. What I'm trying to get at, this is the main question for the bank right now is how do you see the need of doing on equity increase in the next 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't need to do any capital increase for the next 12 months and maybe in 2013 and 2014. But again, we are waiting for the public hearing from the Central Bank just to be sure that our strategy and our approach for the capital debt is a conservative approach to keep the minimal level of 13% the BIS ratio. But we feel very comfortable now about our strategy to keep the capital, or to keep the BIS ratio at a minimum of 13%, even on environment under the Basel III rules.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Ivan.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel Abut from Citi. Ivan, quick question on Votorantim. Votorantim had already reported losses in the third quarter. And I think in this conference call, you discussed some measures that have been taken to try to stabilize the situation. What we saw in the fourth quarter however was that the situation did not stabilize and so the losses got larger. So could you comment on the fundamentals that are behind those losses? I imagine they have a lot to do with worsening of the portfolio. What measures have been taken to stabilize the loan portfolio of Votorantim? Have Votorantim stop lending in certain products, in certain sub-segments?</p>
          <p>And second, as I imagine that a big part of the losses had also to do with funding, what is the related update that you can give us on the funding pressures at Votorantim and what's been done there to stabilize the situation? Is it possible to foresee that the losses will stop at some point in the near future? What are your expectations for the next few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, talking about what we decided to do, we changed the methodology. Banco Votorantim has one product they have for a customer. And we have here in Banco do Brasil a portfolio of products. That's why we know the behavior of the customers very, very well.</p>
          <p>What we are doing now? We are introducing, we had discussions with the management of Banco Votorantim to improve the methodology, just to be sure that the new loan that we are generating now is a much better risk than it was in the past. We've put a lot of measures again there that is more than 20 measures just to be sure that we can move the trend or a downward trend related to delinquency ratio. And we are really comfortable about that.</p>
          <p>In the funding side, there is no any kind of problem related to the funding side. You know that we provide to Banco Votorantim a funding that they never use because they don't need to use it. Really with those predictions, why that you see since September, that we are not comfortable with the level of the delinquency ratio. We were just dramatically different this time than Banco Votorantim and we are able to be more, how can I say that, we can still growing the portfolio again. But before doing this, we need to be sure that all the measures that we discussed with the management of Banco Votorantim, they are there and they are able to provide a very good delinquency ratio for the new assets that they are generating now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it too early to say or foresee when Votorantim at a minimum may breakeven and then go back to black ink?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's too early. But we'll provide all the information that we need in the next two or three months about the performance of the bank. We can do this. There is no problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to finalize on Votorantim, Ivan. You said that funding is not the issue. What about capital? With the current losses, is there any scenario where Banco do Brasil, being one of the two partners may have to inject more capital there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If they need to do, let's say, the approach there for the BIS ratio is the same that we have here in Banco do Brasil. We'll keep the 13% for the minimum BIS ratio and we know that there is a change on the regulation suggests a change that they cannot recognize in advance when they sell the portfolio. These were very important number for Banco Votorantim, not only for Banco Votorantim, for the system. That's why if they need to increase their capital, we will support not only us and Votorantim should do the same.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my call. I have two follow-ups really. First, on your capital, I just want to make sure I understood the response to Mario's question. Are you saying that even with the implementation of Basel III you don't expect to have to raise capital in 2012 and probably not until 2013 with the caveat that you're not 100% sure that Basel III &#x2013; how Basel III will be implemented? But under your understanding, you don't believe that even with Basel III, you'll have to raise capital this year and even likely next year? Is that a correct interpretation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Secondly, on Votorantim, another follow-up again to Daniel's question. Is there a risk? I mean obviously the fourth quarter was pretty awful and it's too early to perhaps to make a prediction about when it will be breakeven and profitable again. But is there a risk that earnings could even decline off of what was a very, very bad fourth quarter given that the origination is pretty much grinded to a halt and past loans that you've originated continue to see as an NPL that would expect to continue to increase? Would you expect losses to at least improve going forward or do you think that there is a risk that the results may even worsen off of what was a very, very bad fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are pretty confident that all the measures that we put in place there and we have some numbers that shows this that the new assets, the delinquency ratio for the new asset is very, very good. And the first was start levels and very good levels in our opinion. That's why we prefer to wait this new methodology running for the two to three months and to be sure we are pretty confident that we work very well and the new products and the new assets that we are generating, talking about the vehicle finance, we will be in a very good and comfort level talking about the delinquency ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No, I understand, but the new origination is very light compared to what you were originating a year ago and even beyond that. And then so &#x2013; and my guess my concern is that, as those loans continue to season and experience develops and NPLs develop that you could see a meaningful worsening even going forward in your overall delinquency ratios, which could cause losses to even accelerate versus what they were in the fourth quarter. Is that a possibility? I mean could you see more than R$600 million of losses in the coming quarters? Is that &#x2013; is there a risk there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are working &#x2013; there is &#x2013; it's very difficult for me to give you a number &#x2013; exactly a number now. What is the most important thing for us? That we change the methodology, that we change the approach. But again, we are waiting just to be sure that these methodology is working well. And all the measures that we put in place is not to change the methodologies. We put in place a lot of conservative approach, talking about the treasury, talking about the coverage, the provisions and not only a specific point. There is a lot of measures that we put in place that's reflecting these in these results. Again, we prefer to waiting for the next two or three months and we provide to the market all the information about the performance of the bank.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, again. In that new slide that you provided, showing the breakdown of gross financial margin, I understand that equalization revenues are impacting the line of financial revenues from credit operations. I did a very illustrative, straightforward and maybe over simplistic calculation, just excluding in this quarter and the past quarter, the contribution from equalization revenues and divided this in result by the balance of credit operations in both quarters. And I noticed that using this methodology it would deserve compression in credit spreads. So just like to understand aside equalization, what has caused this contraction and what you see in credit spreads going forward and then I need my second question? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jorg, Gustavo here. Yes looking at that I think I understand the calculation that you ran. We haven't done the same calculation so I would love to see yours and then debate based on your calculation. The reason we had an increase in equalization revenues on the fourth quarter is merely due to the fact that we actually had more disbursements that were let's say improvisable, that were entitled to those line. But I really have to look at your calculation to see if I agree with your line of thinking.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect the same trend in spreads. As you know, our peers also see a scenario of possible compression in spreads due to the growth of lines, lower risk and also to a possible decrease on the Selic. But in order to answer specifically about your question, we can do this at some point in this afternoon, but I would have to look at your calculation. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No perfect, Gustavo. Just I know to clarify, I was just trying to understand the evolution of credit spread aside the equalization contribution. But you already mentioned that you expect some credit spread contraction. I'm just a little surprised because I thought that in the case of Banco do Brasil, the improvement for our credit mix favoring retail operations could maybe support in a better way the evolution of net interest margin versus your peers and this is not what I see in the guidance that you provided to the market. So you see maybe further compression in the retail operation that will not be enough to allow you to maintain spreads during 2012 that would be a correct interpretation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, in the retail operation, as you know, 80% of the portfolio is already done in the lower risk segment. And those items already have very low spreads. We expect those items to respond for even more participation in the retail loan book. But we see that as a positive because even though they had lower spreads, they also had lower delinquency. So if we show a slight decrease on the net interest income, related to that we also show above pickup on when we talk about the non-payable loans. So we view that one movement compensates the other. As you know and you have followed Banco do Brasil for quite some time.</p>
          <p>Banco do Brasil, we feel that we led this movement into working with lower risk. When the bank announced it a few years ago, some part of the market did not understand this movement, but now we feel that we have demonstrated how positive this can be to our earnings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, okay fair enough. My second question, just a clarification about what is your expectations for the year in terms of equalization revenues? I have noted that in the past two years you have been able to maintain a very strong level between R$2.4 billion to R$2.5 billion per year. So what could be expect in this line for 2012? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for the opportunity. My question is related to Banco Votorantim and possible capital increase as a formation. In case of this capital increase in Banco Votorantim and my question is how to be designed and how it could affect Banco do Brasil aspiration? I mean Banco do Brasil would use their own capital to increase the capital of Banco Votorantim and...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gustavo, I'm sorry to interrupt and I'm also sorry about the technical difficulty that we're having here. Can you repeat your question a little louder please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure. My question is related to Banco Votorantim and as a formation this possible capital increase. In case of capital increase in Banco Votorantim, how it would impact, how it would be designed and how it would affect your BIS ratio? I mean Banco do Brasil would use your own capital to increase the capital of Banco Votorantim and it could impact your BIS ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes we can. In the shareholder agreement, that is we've talked about this that we provide all the support to the <mark type="audio gap" /> (48:10) capital we will do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But it would impact your BIs ratio because of course of the view will use its own capital. So it will not affect your capital and as a consequence affect your BIS ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, could affect BIS ratio but again all the trends that I mentioned about is due to an environment under the Basel III rules, in the Basel III rules everything is there. The agreement of the bank, the basis of the bank, the possible increase of the capital in Banco Votorantim, everything is there. And I can tell you that we don't need to increase the capital of Banco do Brasil for the next two years, maybe more than this.</p>
