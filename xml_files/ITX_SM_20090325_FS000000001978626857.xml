          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the presentation of Inditex's results for fiscal 2008. The presentation will be chaired by Mr. Pablo Isla, Deputy Chairman and CEO.</p>
          <p>This presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session, comprising two parts. The first part will be dedicated to questions received on the telephone, followed from 9:50 CET onwards by those questions received through the webcast platform. Mr. Isla, you have the floor.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex's results for fiscal 2008. I am Pablo Isla, Deputy Chairman and CEO, and here with me are Antonio Rubio, CFO, and Marcos L&#xF3;pez, Capital Markets Director.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we have achieved satisfactory sales growth. Sales in local currencies and constant perimeter have increased 12%. I would like to highlight that Inditex has achieved sales growth in all geographic areas. We continue gaining significant share in all markets, proving the global reach of our business model. 2008 has been another year of strong expansion for Inditex. We have added 266,000 square meters to our retail base, an increase of 15% over 2007.</p>
          <p>Let me also highlight our strong cash flow generation, &#x20AC;1.9 billion, which we have dedicated mainly to the expansion of our business. Additionally, we have increased shareholder remuneration by 25% over 2007. These results have been achieved in a challenging year for the retail sector, marked by a difficult trading environment and a slowdown in economic growth in the fourth quarter in most markets.</p>
          <p>As you can see in this slide, our results for fiscal 2008 when excluding nonrecurrent items continue to show growth in all the key lines of the profit and loss account. A key feature of our results in 2008 is that sales growth was positive in all geographic areas, Europe ex-Spain, Spain, Asia, and the Americas over the period. The ongoing international expansion of our group has led to a widely diversified sales platform with international store sales reaching 66% of the total.</p>
          <p>The area with the highest proportion of total store sales was Europe ex-Spain with 45% of the total. Asia also increased its proportion of total store sales due to our successful expansion in the area.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over to Antonio, who will provide you with some detail behind the headline numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning. Sales performance over 2008 has been satisfactory with 12% growth in local currencies and constant perimeter. We are pleased with the evolution of the gross margin over the year.</p>
          <p>Inditex's gross profit has increased 11% to &#x20AC;5.9 billion in 2008. The gross margin has reached 56.8% of sales, 14 basis points higher than in the same period of the previous year.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses had grown 15%, in line with the space, and include all the start-up costs for new openings. Operating expenses remain tightly under control as we continue to make progress in implementation of our efficiency plans.</p>
          <p>When analyzing the EBIT number of fiscal 2008 it is important to adjust for the nonrecurring items in both 2008 and 2007. As you will remember, 2007 EBIT included ach costs following a conservative a positive impact due to the franchise of our operations in Venezuela. In 2008, we have decided to expense all Uterq&#xFC;e launch accounting approach.</p>
          <p>Working capital remains under tight control reflecting the flexibility of the business model. The evolution of receivables in the year reflect the normal growth of the business and an increase in the volume of lease incentives.</p>
          <p>Let me highlight our strong cash flow in the year. Funds from operations have increased 5% in 2008 to &#x20AC;1.9 billion. I would also like to underline our strict capital allocation process. Capital expenditure was &#x20AC;937 million, a stable level over last year, while our commercial surface has experienced substantial growth.</p>
          <p>In the last fiscal year, we have also concluded the 2006-2008 logistics plan. Over this period, we have made significant investments to prepare our group for future growth. Our logistics are now scalable until 2012. As you can see in this table, in addition to the &#x20AC;937 million of capital expenditure, we also increased our dividend by 25% in 2008.</p>
          <p>I will now hand you over to Marcos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>As you can see in this chart, Zara continues to represent approximately two-thirds of Inditex's sales and the younger concepts, one-third. Let me add that all the concepts have increased their percentage of international store sales proving their international scalability.</p>
          <p>Zara performance in 2008 has been in line with the average for the group. Sales in 2008 have grown by 11% in local currencies and constant perimeter. Excluding currencies, EBIT was flat. Regarding the younger formats, Stradivarius and Pull and Bear have performed very strongly in 2008. Bershka and Massimo Dutti have performed in line with the average. Zara Home and Oysho have performed below the average. They have been impacted by the strong expansion of recent years and the current retailing environment.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight the strong reception of Uterq&#xFC;e, our new format focused on accessories. Uterq&#xFC;e has opened 31 stores since its launch last July and the performance of these stores is above our initial expectations.</p>
          <p>Uterq&#xFC;e is currently present in a number of European capital cities. In 2009, we will continue the launch in other relevant capitals and we plan to open around 20 additional stores.</p>
          <p>I will now hand you over to Pablo for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcos. Regarding the outlook for our group, let me tell you that Inditex maintains its long-term strategic vision, focused on the strong potential to expand profitably through its international multi-concept approach.</p>
          <p>Fashion retailing remains a highly fragmented industry worldwide. The share of independents and department stores reaches 60% in most markets. We operate a highly flexible business model and our concepts offer a strong fashion proposition with very attractive pricing. We have a global reach and a highly diversified sales platform with operations in 73 countries. Yet, as an example, our market share is below 1% in 70 markets. We have a strong potential to continue expanding profitably and gaining market share.</p>
          <p>Economic forecasts for 2009 point to another challenging year for the sector. We expect to continue outperforming the industry. The profitable expansion of our business remains a key priority. Additionally, we will capitalize on the opportunities arising from the current environment.</p>
          <p>Our key priority for 2009 will be to strengthen our focus on capital efficiency. We expect to open around 230,000 square meters of newer space. The international expansion of the group remains a key strategic objective. 95% of newer space will be opened in international markets. Capital expenditure will be approximately &#x20AC;600 million. Due to greater efficiency in the opening of newer stores, our goal is to obtain 15% lower CapEx per square meter in 2009 versus 2008 while sustaining the quality requirements.</p>
          <p>Another goal for Inditex in the fiscal year will be to obtain further efficiencies in order to achieve &#x20AC;75 million of savings in operating expenses. In 2009, the focus will be on maximizing free cash flow while at the same time maintaining the profitable international expansion and the commitment with shareholder remuneration.</p>
          <p>In this context, the Board of Directors will propose to the General Shareholders' Meeting a dividend of &#x20AC;1.05 per share for fiscal 2008. The proposal includes an interim dividend of &#x20AC;0.55 per share payable on the 4th of May and a final dividend of &#x20AC;0.50 per share payable on the 2nd of November.</p>
          <p>Regarding our expansion plans for 2009, we expect to open 370 to 450 stores. The calendar of openings in fiscal 2009 will be biased to the second half, 25% versus 75% compared with 43% versus 57% in fiscal 2008.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me tell you that February monthly store sales in local currencies excluding calendar effects have increased by 9%. As you all know, the Spring-Summer season is influenced by the performance over the Easter period due to its significant sales volumes. And this is all from us. We will be pleased to answer any questions you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Mr. Richard Chamberlain from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. Can you hear me okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, morning. Just a couple of questions please. First of all, I just wondered if you could try and quantify the calendar effects that you've seen both in February, because of the leap year impact and then March because of the Easter impact. Are these significant effects on current trading and maybe you can quantify those effects please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Richard, on the calendar effect due to the leap year, the last year regarding February, you can assume that one less trading day may represent -- what we have mentioned in our trading statement is from the 1st of February to the 28th, our sales have grown by 9%, okay. So the calendar effect is, as you can consider, is a calculation that you can make. Regarding March, I believe that the periods are not comparable due to the later Easter in the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right, well I'll have a go at the calculation. Just second on the cost savings program, &#x20AC;75 million, is that all linked to the reduced space expansion that you're talking about, or is that &#x2013; or are there any like-for-like cost savings coming in in existing stores? And also just linked to that, how do you see the potential to increase that cost savings program going forward particularly in terms of rentals, because I think rentals were up something like 20% last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry, the final part of your question has been very difficult to hear because there was some noise, but --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, it was on rental expenses, they were up 20% last year, so I wonder if you can give some guidance on the outlook for rental expenses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, regarding the &#x20AC;75 million savings, what we can say is that the &#x20AC;75 million are incremental. What do I mean by incremental? That these are additional savings, additional potential savings that we have found and part of it has to do precisely with rental expenses. We are renegotiating some rents with our landlords. It has to do also with a structure or a staff expenses and it also has to do with procurement. So, this is &#x2013; this &#x20AC;75 million is, represents additional potential savings that we have found.</p>
          <p>Regarding rental expenses in this year, it's a combination of space growth, inflation, and some accounting issues. Perhaps Antonio, you can explain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Additionally to these effects of the CPI and the space growth, we have added this morning to the accounting of this expense and <mark type="inaudible" /> on a streamlined basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding your first question I think it was clear, Marcos's answer, but what we are seeing is that when we say excluding calendar effects, this means that we are comparing February, from the 1st of February to the 28th of February 2008 with 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right I'm with you; yeah. Now, just one more thing was, I was just really asking about whether the 75 million is entirely linked to space, because it doesn't seem like a huge number --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>-- given that you're having your space slide maybe three percentage points a year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no not entirely. No, no, no, no, no it has to do when we talk about rental expenses we are mainly talking about renegotiating current contracts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In some cases, of course not in every case, but in some cases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding March, it is completely impossible to compare because of the Easter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's completely impossible because these three weeks are different so to have a clear view from a comparable basis we need to wait until the end of the Easter until mid-April.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Richard Edwards from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Couple of questions, one just on that cost point. Should we assume that total cost growth should still broadly grow in line with physical space growth by 10, 10.5% or something in the year ahead, or is the &#x2013; and hence the &#x20AC;75 million will offset inflation in that context, or is the &#x20AC;75 million in addition to what was I think previous guidance of costs growing in line with physical space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You could assume a cost growth to be in line or slightly below physical space growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Second one was just on the tax charges, any sense where it's going to end up in the year ahead, obviously it was lower than expected in the year just finished?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Medium and long-term, we could see about 25% tax rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that our best guess for the year ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Anne Critchlow from SG [Societ&#xE9; Generale]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning everyone. I'd like to ask a question about the like-for-like sales performance between different countries. Are you seeing the gap between Spain and the rest of the world narrow or get larger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not big difference with what we said in previous conference call. Spain is performing below the average. In Spain we always say that what is remarkable is that our total sales are growing in the year 2008. This is remarkable because, well, we are talking about a market in which consumption has decreased 6%, no? And so this means that we are gaining market share, but not a big difference in the last few months compared to what was the case. So, Spain performing below the average, Asia performing above the average, and we could consider the rest of the world in line with the average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And I just have a further question on Zara Kids, have you decided not to roll out Zara Kids as a standalone format from now on or is it really just the problem about getting new stores in Spain at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you've seen in the note we have specified Zara Kids stores separated from Zara in the appendix when we show all the stores per country, in order to clarify that there is an amount of Zara Kids stores that are much smaller than the typical Zara store. Now considering about potential standalone openings in the future, it could be the case in a very limited basis. So in a very limited basis it could be the case to open new Zara Kids stores, but not in a significant &#x2013; not being significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay; thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Luca Solca from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. A question on SG&amp;A, and understanding what level of like-for-like growth you would need at this point to keep SG&amp;A flat on sales as a percentage. I remember guidance went down from 4% to two to 3% couple of years ago, 1.5 years ago, and I wonder if this extra saving of &#x20AC;75 million could actually bring that like-for-like level even lower.</p>
          <p>The second question is on the long-term space growth strategy that you see for the group. I understand that in 2009 in a difficult market environment you're reducing space growth to about 10.5 to 11%. What do you see going forward as the normal space growth level for the group?</p>
          <p>And a third question if I may on actions that you're planning to take on what you have identified as formats performing below your expectations, Zara Home and Oysho, are you preparing to rationalize to reduce space growth or what other actions do you have in your agenda?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding your different questions, regarding the first question, yes, you were mentioning that with all our action costs, we moved from 4% to two to 3% and now you could assume one to 2% with these new savings that we have identified.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So yes, we continue acting on costs as has been the case in the last few years. Regarding our space growth, the growth, the first thing I would like to say is that our long-term vision remains exactly the same, and our long-term strategy. As we were saying during the presentation, we are present in more than 70 countries, in 70 of them our market share is below 1%, we are gaining market share in all these markets. We have significant growth opportunities. So, if we think about the future, the medium-term, we continue seeing double digit space growth in the coming years.</p>
          <p>What we are doing this year 2009 is to be extremely demanding from the point of view of quality, from the point of view of payback, from the point of view of return on investment. In any case, we will continue opening stores, having newer space in a significant way. We are talking about 230,000 square meters additional space during this year. But, being more demanding than we ever have been regarding all these issues, I was mentioning.</p>
          <p>And for Zara Home and Oysho, I will make a quick comment and I will then tell Marcos to elaborate a little bit more. What we are doing more than rationalizing, particularly regarding Oysho, up to three years in which growth has been so huge. We are we could say now consolidating what we have achieved in these years and then giving some breadth I would say to the format. I don't know Marcos if you want to add?</p>

          <p>This is very much the case those two companies have experienced very significant growth over the last three years since the launch, and basically the idea is to consolidate this growth at this point in time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. Just again on the cost efficiencies, could you maybe just help us think about the 75 million in a slightly different way and just give an indication of the split between maybe store, head office and logistics?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on the gross margin, I appreciate you don't give it on a quarterly basis some of the movements, but could you just tell us whether over the full financial year markdown was higher or lower year-on-year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the &#x20AC;75 million, we are targeting 50% of that is coming from rental expenses, renegotiating our current contracts, and then the remaining 50% half from procurement, half from structure overheads at every level.</p>
          <p>And regarding the gross margin, as you know now, the gross margin needs to be analyzed on a seasonal basis. So, to think about the gross margin on a quarterly basis does not make a big sense. No, we think it needs to be analyzed on a seasonal basis. About the level of markdowns, you were mentioning, nothing special to &#x2013; from our side, nothing special. Our gross margin during the year is slightly positive is what we consider a stable gross margin as you know, and this is what we are targeting for the year 2009.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi good morning. Two questions if I may. The first one is that in the last conference call you mentioned that you were targeting positive like-for-like for 2009. I was just wondering if you are maintaining that target. And if you could share with us your view on what you expect for the evolution of the Spanish market because we are seeing some bad news here. So, if you could share with us what's your view for the evolution in terms of like-for-like for Spain?</p>
          <p>And also you said that you're looking into shareholder remuneration with a focus on improving your free cash flow. So if you are maintaining that pay-out for next year? And just if you can confirm, I understand from the last question that you are targeting stable gross margin for full year '09, is that true?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, because this always our statement that we work for the stability of the gross margin and at the beginning of the year that is what we can say about 2009. About like-for-like for the year, as we said during the presentation 2009 is going to be a challenging year for the sector. If you ask myself what is our target as management of the company? Our target at this stage of the year is to have positive like-for-like sales growth.</p>
          <p>This is our target as management because we are at the beginning of the year and we have the whole year in front of us. At the same time, we are aware that the environment is challenging, so, but we maintain this as a management target to obtain positive like-for-like sales growth for the year globally. You were also talking about the Spanish market, perhaps Marcos you can elaborate a little bit more about the Spanish market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the Spanish market as you know we have a very strong position. We &#x2013; It's a market that we know very well and it's a market that we have clearly outperform over 2008 in the sense that we have delivered positive growth while the market has decreased by 6%. This is again our expectation in 2009 to outperform the market in a very clear way.</p>
          <p>Regarding the specific numbers, I prefer not to give them to you, again Spain we believe in 2009 will be below the average while other big markets will continue growing above the average, as this is the case in both Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just to follow up, if I may. Can you give us some idea of the market share gains that you might have achieved during full year '08? And also if you could just clarify on the February numbers you gave the 9% growth, the space growth was still pretty closer to what you disclosed in full year '08, right, so still far from the 11%. I was just trying to reach the like-for-like implicit in these numbers, but probably space growth was still around the 14%, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you be more precise in your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just trying to see what kind of like-for-like was implicit in the 9% growth you mentioned for February, but as we have the strong base still and you haven't from what I heard in your website, you don't have any openings in February, but nevertheless, the base is very low from last year's. So in terms of year-on-year space growth is still far from the 11% you target for the year, so we could have been talking about negative like-for-likes in February.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe the question is not very relevant and this is the reason why we do not disclose like-for-likes. February is the less important month of the year, and there are calendar effects as we have mentioned and March is not comparable. So to talk about like-for-like on a short period of time is something that we have never done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So can you just give me an idea of market share gains in Spain? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you think that the market was decreasing 6% and we have positive growth, here you can -- then it's very easy to extrapolate to find the market share gain that we have achieved during the year 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. Just really a question about your expansion going forward, where do you expect to focus in terms of major openings, which countries should we expect most growth this year in?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our expansion will, first of all 95% will be international. If we think about Zara 98% will be international. So we are talking about international expansion at a 95% level. And then which areas; is very well balanced mainly between Europe and Asia, and in the case of Europe also we're well balanced between Western and Eastern Europe. So, if you think about Zara expansion more or less half of it will take place in Europe and half will take place in Asia. China, Korea, and Japan where we are performing very well as you know. And inside Europe it's well balanced between Western Europe and Eastern Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you mentioned a more stringent return target as a business or you seem to imply a more stringent return target. Could you just perhaps clarify what that might be?</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>You said you are more demanding on the return criteria on new store openings, could you clarify what you mean by that? I think historically your return has been around 40%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're clearly sustaining the financial goals. What we are saying is that both in terms of quality and that we make sure that these returns are clearly obtained, is why are going to focus a lot on capital efficiency this year. That's the long-term strategy of the company, there is no change at all Fraser.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In any case, if we think about our expansion, for example in Eastern European countries, the payback we are demanding for the new openings is stricter, so it's below two years in every case.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Right, and one final question if I may. Just in terms of the overall sourcing environment, what are you seeing in the key geographies, the trade-offs between cost increases that suppliers have seen and then the demand weakness they're also experiencing, what kind of environment are you finding overall? I appreciate you're targeting a flat gross margin, but could you just give us a little bit of color on the souring environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, not big differences. We have talked about this topic in previous conference calls, and you know perfectly our sourcing structure more than, around two-thirds is coming from proximity of Europe then we have 35% of our sourcing in dollar related areas. One year and a half ago, there was a lot of talks about and comments about cost inflation, now probably it's the opposite, but globally not a big impact in our case, as to have a real impact from the point of view of the gross margin.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning everyone, Andrew Hughes from UBS. Could I just ask a little bit more detail on the fourth quarter trading performance please, because I think you said at the start of Q4 that like-for-like was running up 1% and it looks it finished at minus 2? Could you say perhaps just which markets saw the deterioration and which formats and perhaps if you could also tell us whether total sales were up in the fourth quarter in Spain as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we can say is that, Andrew, that we're satisfied with the sales performance in the year. We have delivered 12% sales growth in local currencies and constant perimeter. The like-for-like sales have been maintained and we have mentioned that obviously the like-for-like in Spain was below the average while in other areas was above the average. It's true that there's been slightly more promotional activity in the fourth quarter, but I would not say anything that has changed significantly the results for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So -- but you can't confirm that sales were up in Spain in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, is not a question of Spain, is an extension of the trend that we were seeing before. As you could see also our gross margin was sustained for the year very much in line with the target. So, I would say that all-in-all, we haven't seen any structural change that has changed our view for the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. Perhaps I can ask another matter why you've decided to split the dividend payments into two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we believe it's more efficient to split the dividend in two parts, paying $0.55 on the 4th of May and then $0.50 on the 2nd of November, instead of one big payment on the 1st of August. We believe it's more efficient for shareholders to have these two payments and this is the reason why we have done it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Is that going to be the case for every year going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It is, right. And just finally on the tax rate, why that moved down in 2008 and why you think it's going to rise back to the trend level in the current year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well basically as you know, there are a number of countries that have reduced their corporate tax rate over the year and this is the reflection. And this is why our expectation probably in the coming years is for a slight and progressive growth towards 25%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Towards, so it might be some years before it gets back to 25%, is that right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean 25% is what you must expect.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wanted to try and understand if there is any influence on your slower expectations for space growth from the supply side. So are you seeing any weaker supply of potential space or is this slower rate purely a reflection of your view of the market and need to protect cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say is that it's 90% based on our own decision as because of course there could be planned shopping mall developments that could be delayed. But 90% it has to do with our own decision. As you can imagine being present in 70 different countries, there are many, many growth opportunities. So we are being very &#x2013; as I was saying to you before, no more demanding than ever regarding quality of the locations, regarding paybacks. So it's 90% our own decision.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really. It can be -- as always I would say on a tactical way there always openings that have to do with previous openings, but we are not planning a big closure action plan in Spain, not at all.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning guys. Just a few follow up type of questions. On the space that we were talking about, how many years do you think you're going to be running at this sort of level for before you see any pickup or should I imply from your previous answers that double digits, 10%, 11% is a longer term growth rate? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, following up the question on the gross margin by quarters, could you &#x2013; ignoring the quarters, could you tell us what the main components of the gross margin movement were across the year, please? And lastly, I note your inventory is only up 5%, I wondered if you could tell us what your commitment levels are in absolute terms going into the New Year? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding your first question, Tony, what we can say is that our long-term vision remains exactly the same. This year space growth is going to be 11% coming from a year in which average space growth has been 15%. So, even combining the two years, you can assume a 13% space growth on average. And it's impossible for us to precise right now if in the coming years it will be 11, it will be 13, but what you can assume is double digit space growth rate in the coming years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>But, 11 to 13 is a reasonable forecasting assumption, would you say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it would be a reasonable forecast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we move forward. Regarding the gross margin across the year, the gross margin as you perfectly know it's a combination of many different things. It has to do with the markups, it has to do with the markdowns, it has to do with the currency impact. So regarding our own performance, and also we always say, because it is impossible to be so precise about the gross margin, about each basis point. That is why we always say that 50 basis points above or below for us means stability of the gross margin, as you can imagine operating in so many countries and with different formats.</p>
          <p>So, I mean we think about the evolution of the gross margin during the year 2008 on a six-month basis and we see the first half, the second half, you can see perfectly that according to our own stability concept, it has been stable during the year and it has been stable on a seasonal basis, with many differing impacts. We think that to isolate the different impacts is not very helpful, I would say, because there are impacts in one sense, impacts in a different sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be helpful for us. But, I mean, you mentioned markup, markdown and currency, you must have a rough idea of what those were?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, it's slightly positive currency impact during the year and about markdowns very much in line with now our typical markdowns level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, and on the commitment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And about inventory -- yes, our commitment is because, the commitment of course is the relevant figure much more than the inventory for us. And regarding the commitment, we could say that at the end of the year it is at its normal levels. It's very much in line with what are our normal commitment levels. It's slightly above the inventory growth figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Slightly above, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our last conference call question comes from Mr. Paul Smiddy from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, a couple of questions. Firstly, I think you said a few minutes ago that you weren't expecting any changes in the pattern of sourcing in the year ahead. Can you tell me your thoughts about what will happen to garment prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, then Paul as you know our sourcing strategies are slightly different to that of the industry in the sense that we rely significantly on proximity sourcing to our major collections. So all in all, we do not see any significant change in our sourcing platform for the coming years. What we see is we are trying to build relationships with suppliers that can feed our model with not only with quality and with cost, but also and very significantly with short lead times. So all in all, we do not see any significant change in the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and what &#x2013; are there any, is there any upward pressure on prices from your supplier base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And second question, what area was the disappointment in Q4 performance? Where did that come from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously as you have seen we believe that our results for the year show a 12% growth in local currencies. And we believe this is quite a significant number in a challenging retailing environment, but I would not like to qualify any specific area. We have mentioned that Spain was below the average and all the other areas, Europe ex-Spain, Asia and the Americas, were above the average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But there's been a material change in expectations for the full year in the last month or two. So I just wondered where that was driven from, either regionally or by cost line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There has been a material change in expectations for the '08/'09 fiscal year in the last month or so. What has driven that in terms either of region or line on the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, expectations are a question of the market, so I believe that the kind of messages that we have conveyed are consistent and we have no change of view for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have one more last question from the conference call. We now give the floor to Richard Edwards from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just a follow-up question on CapEx. This 600 number you've talked about for the year ahead, should we assume beyond that that it grows more in line with physical space growth, with the number you're endeavoring to hold stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we will always try to continue obtaining efficiencies from the point of view of CapEx, but this &#x20AC;600 million figure includes logistics coming back to its normal levels after three years in which logistic investment was representing 20% of total CapEx, now it is moving to 10% because we have completed our logistic investment plan for during the years 2006 to 2008. So we are not expecting big logistic investments in the next four years.</p>
          <p>So this is one area, and the other area has to do with being more efficient from the point of view of the CapEx. And we will permanently try to obtain more efficiencies, but answering your question it could be a reasonable assumption.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So which would be a reasonable assumption, to hold it steady or to grow it in line with space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, which assumption, to hold it steady or to grow it in line with space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Grow in line with space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Grow in line with space. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but having in mind that this &#x20AC;600 million is the necessary CapEx for 230,000 square meters. So I mean growing in line with space, but having in mind that it should be additional space to these 230,000 square meters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you understand now my answer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think so. It sounds like you're suggesting the 600 shouldn't change very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

          <p>The conference call questions have finished. Now we give the floor to the questions received through the Internet. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning. We are just going to address the questions we have just received through the Internet. There is a question coming from Farhad Seddiki talking about if we can comment the conversion rate of the new space that we have been opening over 2008, if we are detecting any kind of significant change in the sales density that we are seeing in the new markets where we are entering?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Farhad no, we're not seeing any change in the conversion rates in the space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are, well, he is just -- he is really quick, because he was just saying that the question really relates to the conversion of the store growth in Q4, so, it's very difficult to address this question for an isolated quarter. So, no major changes from our side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a question coming from a private investor which is saying if we are considering any kind of share repurchase plan in case the share continues relatively undervalued in his vision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our commitment to shareholder remuneration remains in place mainly through dividends. As you know share buybacks are not a easy option for us due to the 40% free float. So the preferred way to retrieve to -- for shareholder remuneration will remain dividends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There is another question coming from one of the private investors regarding our plans for openings in India in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes we have signed &#x2013; as you know we have signed an agreement with the Tata Group about going to the Indian market and we are planning our first openings for the year 2010, not for the year 2009. It's difficult to precise now how many stores are we going to open in the year 2010, we would like to be present in the most relevant cities during the year 2010, but it's too early now to be precise about how many stores are we going to open in the year 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have more questions, but most of them are questions that have already been answered. Regarding the level of markdown, any kind of question about like-for-likes required for 2009, or whatever. Any other more technical that we can address from the Investor Relations regarding the FX impact for 2009? And there is a question coming from Nick Hawkins from SunTrust, regarding the percentage of maintenance CapEx that we are going to devote over 2009, if it's going to be changed regarding previous years now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No change, Nick it will stay at around 10% of total CapEx for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question regarding our plans for Latin America, is there any kind of change in our vision for Latin America over 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, not a real change in the -- no, we will continue, we could assume a small number of openings in Brazil or in Mexico, but nothing relevant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a question &#x2013; a follow-up question that's coming from Andrew Hughes from UBS, talking about the long-term targets we have for Uterq&#xFC;e. If the -- regarding EBIT margin and return on capital employed should be above the group average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our long-term target is to be in line within the group's average. That is our long-term target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think that this covers most of the questions that we have just received through the Internet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So thank you very much to all of you. And as you know, we continue ready to answer any additional questions you could have through the phone or in meetings in the coming days. Thank you very much for attending this conference call.</p>
