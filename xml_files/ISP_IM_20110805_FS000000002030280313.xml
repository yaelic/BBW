          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Conference Call of Intesa Sanpaolo for the presentation of 2011 Half Yearly Results, hosted today by Mr. Corrado Passera, Chief Executive Officer. For your information, today's conference is being recorded. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Corrado Passera. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you and sorry, I hadn't pushed the button. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us to discuss our results for the first quarter and the first half of 2011. Certainly market condition has not been favorable in the last six months, but we are reporting solid results and results that are in line with the targets of our business plan.</p>
          <p>Over the past few months, as it has been the case in the last few years, we have put a lot of attention on making our bank stronger and more resilient to manage external crisis and the results we report today indicate that we have done it rather successfully. Intesa Sanpaolo is focused on sustainable profitability, but at the same time, we have reinforced liquidity, solidity and capital strength. Our core Tier 1 is now at 10.2%.</p>
          <p>Liquidity, solidity and capital strength remain our long-term values and we continue to pursue them even if it means sometimes making some short-term sacrifices. Some examples, in the last month, in the first semester of the year, we have not conducted any third-party bond placement, so less fees. We have satisfied our funding needs in advance. We are somehow overfunded and that has a cost, but that leaves quite a relaxing position to the bank.</p>
          <p>We have further lowered our trading activities. The VAR of the period has been quite low, even lower than before. We have kept our existing, let's say, conservative and prudent approach to loan growth. Asset liability management is key in a period like this one and low leverage is another asset of ours.</p>
          <p>One word about our country. I'm about to say what I'm about to say because I truly believe in it. We believe that there is no real economic ground for the loss of confidence that the market is presently showing toward Italy. The fundamentals of the Italian economy remain strong. Let's not forget that several regions of ours are among the strongest, the most active and the most competitive in Europe.</p>
          <p>Italy is one of the countries that will benefit the most from &#x2013; more strongly let's say, from the globalization, due to the fact that we are very strong in a number of sectors that will grow rapidly in the next years, machinery, industrial automation, home furnishing, fashion, food, tourism, healthcare. All these industries are industries where our companies and our country is excellent.</p>
          <p>Another point that the market should remember, Italy is one of the few European countries with a primary surplus in its national account. There are only two of them at least amongst the big ones and that is the evidence of the attention and discipline we are keeping in our country.</p>
          <p>Another point that is certainly almost an exception to the rule in Europe, Italy is one of the very few countries that has already reformed its pensions. And we have adopted a system that is fully sustainable and very few other countries can say the same. Obviously and I keep saying it on a number of occasion, we should define measures to stimulate our economic growth even more and we will certainly do it in the next weeks and months, but the Italian economy contains all the elements to deliver satisfactory growth over the medium term.</p>
          <p>A point about our stock. The disappointing performance of our stock is certainly due also to what I just said a few minutes ago -- to the excessively negative view of our country by the market and certainly by the fact that Intesa Sanpaolo is seen as a sort of proxy of our country, of Italy. But we firmly believe in our bank and in the potential of our bank and I have to inform you that I personally and my two Deputy CEOs, Marco Morelli and Gaetano Miccich&#xE8;, have decided to send a clear signal to this effect by having just a few minutes ago given the order for the acquisition by each of us of shares worth &#x20AC;500,000 each.</p>
          <p>Last point because last time we met, we discussed our business plan. The business plan is built on more than 150 projects, all of them are underway. The most challenging one was the project we call 8,000, that is the management of 8,000 redundancies and with the creation at the same time to offset at least 4,000 of them with new jobs that will be created.</p>
          <p>We have concluded recently an important and innovative agreement with the trade unions and I want to publicly thank them for the contribution they made to a very difficult negotiation. But this is going to be one of the pillar of the implementation of the business plan. We will complete it in the next few weeks and on the occasion of the next quarterly results, we will give you all the details.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to the presentation. I will not go through all the pages, but we will have to cover at least some of them. Page number three, the summary of the summary. Profitability in the first semester 2011 has grown from an operating point of view 5.6% versus the first semester last year. Pre-tax income, the increase is more than 30% vis-&#xE0;-vis last year. And if we take the net income and we adjust for the main non-recurring items, still we have an increase in the round of 7%.</p>
          <p>Cost, as you know, it's a priority of ours. We want to keep having a minus sign semester-after-semester. And after the last three years where we have been able to meet this target also the first semester this year is a minus. We do not benefit yet from the cost reduction projects we have in the business plan because a number of them like the trade union agreement needed a number of months to be launched, but even without the effect of the new projects, we are at 0.2%.</p>
          <p>Cost of credit is down 78 basis points versus 83 basis points last year. I will have more comments in the presentation. High liquidity and I will give you all the details. Strong funding capability and also there, we will have a number of details, low leverage, strong capital base are and will remain competitive advantages.</p>
          <p>As far as capital ratios, we are a bit above what we expected. We have already reached a 10% Core Tier 1. And as you certainly know, the Stress Test has been a successful exercise for our bank and we are amongst the strongest in Europe also in stress scenario.</p>
          <p>Last point is a point I made also before that is important to understand some of our results. When you focus on solidity and liquidity and you want to put the company in the position to bear the effect of very difficult external environment and if you have in mind sustainable profitability sometimes you have to accept some short-term sacrifices and you will see they are not that big. But strategically speaking, we believe we have done what was in the interest of the company and in the interest of all the shareholders.</p>
          <p>Page number four, growth in profitability. Net income adjusted for main non-recurring items show the industrial results plus 6.7% year-on-year and plus 15% semester-on-semester. Core operating income and core pre-tax income is -- are the results of the bank taking apart and putting aside trading activities and the impact of deposit hedging. Also in that case, we have all positive figures and especially the pre-tax income is almost 10% above last year.</p>
          <p>Page number five, I don't want to get into the figures again. Costs are down, we keep going down, we are in an industry that will have to improve and increase productivity in a major way in the next years and our plan is designed around this assumption.</p>
          <p>Page number six, Cost of Credit down from 83 bps to 78 bps on an annualized basis. Two good pieces of news are the gross inflow of new substandard loans down in a major way and the same thing can be said for the inflow, the gross inflow of new doubtful loans, both down in a nice way. We will have other details in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Page number seven. Liquidity is probably the most crucial element of bank management in a situation like the present one. We are proud of what we have done. We are above &#x2013; we are at  100% in terms of medium/long-term wholesale maturity funding. That means we do not need the market any more, even for a long period of time, even if we don't expect the market to be closed for such a long time. 83% of total medium/long-term maturities have already been covered in the first seven months.</p>
          <p>If you look at the picture at the top of the page on the left-hand side, you see that after 2011 that was one of the highest years in terms of maturities, we will have a 2012 where the maturities that are due can be covered in case through our retail network, but obviously we do not expect that to have such a difficult market. But in case as you see we can do by ourself.</p>
          <p>Left hand side at the bottom of the page, direct customer deposits are and will remain higher than our loans to customers. The breakdown of direct customer deposits as you see on the right-hand side on the bottom of the page is very solid, very retail, very resilient. We added another page on liquidity because we know how important is liquidity for you to understand the bank.</p>
          <p>Eligible assets, liquid assets, we had &#x20AC;47 billion worth of eligible assets with Central Banks at the end of June. We have used &#x20AC;15 billion of them for a three months repo with the ECB to optimize the cost of funding, this replaced the commercial paper from the U.S. that is a market that is certainly moving downward, and the best way to balance it was this repo. We could have used the interbank market that we do not almost use. As you know we have a very, very small position on the Interbank. So we decided that the most cost effective decision alternative was the ECB three months repo.</p>
          <p>We have at the end of July &#x20AC;80 billion worth of liquid assets, this is very important. And this figure will probably grow because we want to be as safe as possible and probably this figure will go beyond &#x20AC;100 billion in the next weeks and months. So this is the way we managed our liquidity position.</p>
          <p>Page 9, Capital Ratios. 10.2% Core Tier 1, 11.8% Tier 1, 15.1% total capital in line with our targets and the commitment we took with the market. One point that might be of interest of yours is at the bottom of the page, these figures these ratios already embed the amount of dividends for the first six months. That means that we have accrued somehow the unit dividends we paid last year also on the new the new volume and the new number of shares after the capital increase.</p>
          <p>Page ten, stress tests. We are in a good position both on the 2012 stress figures and on the 2012 stress figures after additional measures. We are at the very top of the ranking. Page 11, we confirm what we said on the occasion of the business plan presentation, we want to get to around 10% on a pro forma basis by the end of this year, not only on Basel 2 criteria that is Core Tier 1, but also on Basel 3 common equity measures. And then 10% will remain the level, whatever will be in excess of it as we have already said several times will be used to pay dividends.</p>
          <p>Page 12. The formula of our business plan, very strong attention on the operating income both on revenues and on cost and productivity. But at the same time the same level of attention will be kept on risk profile liquidity and capital base.</p>
          <p>Page 13 transforms the formula into figures. And in the blue cloud we have the situation at the end of the first semester. In terms of income we have to grow at 6% and we are at 5.6%. We obviously we have to always remember that the merchant banking has given &#x2013; our merchant banking department has given quite a contribution to this growth, but we have an interesting pipeline of possible divestments also for the future.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost/income, we are down at 15.8% (sic) [51.8%] in the first half of the year. In terms of provisions and we are down at 78 basis points in the direction that is a direction that is consistent with the business plan target. In terms of balance between customer deposits and customer loans we are perfectly in line 105%. And I have already commented the capital ratios.</p>
          <p>Given the importance of the Italian market for achieving the revenue figures, we have some updates on the situation in our country. If we look at what -- if we look at how our country is performing in terms of manufacturing turnover, we are certainly amongst the best performing countries in Europe.</p>
          <p>In terms of exports, again a lot because we really see a lot of medium, small and medium but especially medium-size companies performing very well on international markets. The two points, the two elements on the right-hand side are the evidence of the commitment of our government to keep the primary balance under control. And as you see only two countries amongst the big ones can show a positive primary balance. And what is even more important given the growth of the economy is good control in terms of a state borrowing requirement that in 2011 is even lower than in the previous years.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the figures -- let's jump directly to page 17. First semester 2011 versus first semester 2010, the revenues up &#x20AC;5.6 million. We will see line-by-line what's the performance of the different components. Operating costs down, operating margin up 12%, provisions and adjustments down and income before tax from continuing operation 33% up.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we cannot compete with last year given that we had an extraordinary capital gain on the last but one line of almost 700 million last year. So in terms of accounting figures we have a decrease, but if we exclude both from 2010 and 2011 all the non-recurring items, we have almost 7% increase.</p>
          <p>Page 18, you have all the details and all the items that we do not consider recurring and so you can check and correct if necessary our estimates. Page 19, the same comparison between the second quarter and the first quarter 2011. Good growth in terms of income, but obviously the effect of the two merchant banking disposals played an important role. 13% operating margin; cost in line with the seasonal target, 6.1 the growth at the level of income before tax and 12% increase at the very bottom line. Same analysis on page 20 to list that -- we have all the non-recurring items in order to make the comparison more meaningful.</p>
          <p>Page 21, the summary of our balance sheet. The rationale of the title of the page is very clear. We were in such a situation that where we are today, we want to manage the increase of our loans very carefully. Deposits and loans have to be managed in an integrated way. Asset quality is even more key than usual. EVA that means spreads become a very important criterion for decision.</p>
          <p>Loans to customers are up on an average basis 2%. Customer financial assets have a number of movement. We had a number of institutional deposits going away but replaced by others. Assets under management actually decreased, did not decrease in terms of inflow, but I will give you the figures because we had a joint venture discontinued a few months ago, but it's mainly institutional kind of things.</p>
          <p>Assets under administration are going up also because of a number of decisions of ours, but I will elaborate on them in the following pages. Risk weighted assets are going down mainly because we are working very much in terms of optimizing all the components that reduces the risk weighting mechanism, but the main thing was the adoption of the IRB approach that was finalized during the period.</p>
          <p>Page 22; interest, income. The real, not the real, but I mean the increase in terms of &#x2013; if we exclude the impact of the reduction in the deposit hedging, the increase is in a round of 1.3%. One thing that might be relevant in the next quarters is the repricing actions we launched. As you know in Italy we have to go through a quite a long mechanism, and I'm not talking here about the automatic repricing taking place on the occasion of market yields movement, I'm talking about decisions taken by the company, especially in the Banca dei Territori division, that has to go through a process that takes at least two months and that will be probably completed by the end of the following &#x2013; of the next &#x2013; of the present quarter.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side, you have the 2% increase in average loans I mentioned before, you see that medium-large corporates have decreased their figures. These trends are more than expected, especially with larger corporate given the crisis and the level of interest rates they can find on the market, while they're increasing &#x2013; in the volumes with SMEs is very much in line with what we wanted to achieve.</p>
          <p>Page 23 gives you all the elements to evaluate the performance in terms of interest margin and interest income. On a quarterly basis on the left-hand side, and on a six month basis on the right-hand side, you see that the main element that has pushed the interest rates up had to do with spreads. And spreads mean markdown, only partially offset by the decrease &#x2013; some decrease in markups.</p>
          <p>The hedging effect, the hedging contribution is obviously negative and partially is due to the reduction in the hedging position we had in the second quarter. The hedging position is obviously managed on a dynamic way and given there is a scenario in the second quarter, we decided on that occasion to reduce at least for that quarter, our position. Same thing on the right-hand side, spread and markdowns have contributed significantly to the increase of the structural net interest income, while the hedging as contributed negatively.</p>
          <p>What can we infer from this page in terms of sensitivity? The sensitivity is still a bit higher than what we have in our business plan, you might remember that we assumed in our business plan, a sensitivity of about 150 million. We are in the round of 160 and we will have to see in the next month, what will happen but we consider these figures very much in line with our business plan targets.</p>
          <p>24, net fee and commission more or less stable; obviously we decided to cancel completely the placement of third party bonds and when liquidity became such an important issue, we decided to reduce this placement and consequently also the fees we could have gotten from this kind of activity. But overall, given the situation we consider these figures acceptable.</p>
          <p>Page 25, net inflows in assets under management. Please look at the note at the two dots we have in the page because actually, the real net inflows coming from our captive market customers is almost &#x20AC;5 billion, while we lost non captive activities and so the comparison with last year has to take that into account.</p>
          <p>If we add that the performance effect that obviously penalized the total amount. The net inflows are in the round of &#x20AC;7 billion; not yet what we had in mind, but you can imagine how concerned are retail customers today, given the incredible volatility of the market. So we are not pushing in this direction, we know that the room for growth in this area is very meaningful because we have almost &#x20AC;200 billion worth of assets under administration that can be turned into assets under management, at least partially.</p>
          <p>But in such erratic markets, customer &#x2013; retail customers cannot be pushed in this direction. The mix of our mutual funds are in the round of 30% of stock related, we have to get at least to 35%.</p>
          <p>Page 26 is the page on trading profits. Strong increase, especially because of the two Prada and Findomestic deals. I certainly consider them non-recurrent, but non-recurring, but we do not have to consider them extraordinary because as I said before the merchant banking department of the company has a portfolio of minority share holdings with a good pipeline of possible divestments for the future.</p>
          <p>The details of the trading profits are on page 27. Customers &#x2013; profits coming from &#x2013; directly from customers is a bit lower than the last three quarters, but more than acceptable. Capital market and financial assets available for sale means the merchant banking divestments are very high. Relatively disappointing the Prop Trading, but as I said before it was the decision of ours to reduce the activity in such a risky and volatile activity, so positive but certainly lower than in many &#x2013; on many other occasions.</p>
          <p>Page 28, Insurance Business, a good quarter; new premiums going up, increasing collaboration between the factories and the retail network. On page 29, we remind the market, the very complex project we are working on to consolidate our four life insurance companies into one that will certainly be one of the protagonists, one of the big &#x2013; the most important players on the market.</p>
          <p>Page 30, Costs &#x2013; Operating Costs. They are down on an annual basis, very much down in terms of administrative expenses, in line personnel expenses. Obviously, depreciation goes up because of the increasing volumes of investment.</p>
          <p>Page 31, cost of credit, net provision for risk and charges, a normal figure in the round of 65. Net adjustments to loans are a bit higher than what we expected. On a seasonal basis, we expected something in the round of 720, 730. It's a bit higher than that but we don't consider that a trend or something that can challenge our target to keep provisions going down year after year in the next three years and certainly also in 2011. And in fact on a six months basis, we are down 6%.</p>
          <p>Let's see the embedded flows in this area, page 32. Net past dues going down in a very clear way. Net substandard loans going down. And then, the net non-performing loans moving a little bit higher upward because of the unavoidable growth of doubtful loans that, as you know in our country, have a longevity of decades because of the legal procedures. So what is important about doubtful loans, so the so-called sofferenze, is not that much, this accumulation process but the way they are reserved, they are covered.</p>
          <p>And on page 33, you have the usual figures on the total coverage of the doubtful loans, well above 120% and that's the reason why we keep being repaid at a &#x2013; higher money than the book value of the positions. Another point that might be of interest of yours is the last but one dot on the bottom of the page. We have increased the coverage of all non-performing loans despite the situation. We keep increasing the coverage also on the total non-performing basis from 44.2 to 44.6. And another point that is a strength of ours, is the very comfortable size of the performing loan reserve at almost &#x20AC;2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Page 34, the trend in new substandard and new doubtful quarter-by-quarter and division-by-division. The second quarter as I told you &#x2013; as I said before, is a bit higher than what seasonality would have expected, but again we believe we &#x2013; it is totally consistent with our 2011 target.</p>
          <p>Page 35, I will not go through all these figures, is the breakdown of our loan portfolio; very balanced and very prudent. Another page that is certainly of interest of yours is the exposure of the Bank to sovereign risk by country. You have all the details in terms of categories. You have all the details in terms of available for sale reserve. These total reserve was &#x20AC;1 billion at the end of June, but as we all know the big mess happened in July. So we are giving you the updated negative available for sale reserve estimated at the end of July, that is &#x20AC;2 billion all included, both sovereign risk and any kind of other risk, so we are at &#x20AC;2 billion at the end of July.</p>
          <p>What else, the Italian position is &#x20AC;64 billion included the insurance, the technical reserves. We &#x2013; disposition is more or less in line with the past, is the amount of bonds we need for our liquidity needs, and it's quite short-term, is almost all of the &#x2013; the Bank part of this money is less than one year maturity and that's more or less what I had to tell you with the exception of Greece, that is well described on page 37.</p>
          <p>We have subdivided the position by maturity before 2020 and after 2020. You have the impairment &#x2013; the 21%, impairment on all the maturities by 2020, while the other position have an AFS reserve of 2030 &#x2013; 2027 million.</p>
          <p>From Page 38, you have all the divisional figures that if you agree as we usually do, I do not go through them now and we can use them for answering your question. We move directly to the last page of the presentation, page 47. Again, we stress the sound performance of the bank, both in terms of profitability, liquidity and reduction of cost of credit.</p>
          <p>We are very happy about the 10.2% Core Tier 1. We are quite comfortable and &#x2013; comfortable about the stress test. And as I said at the beginning of the presentation, we consider the first semester results in line with the business plan target we discussed in the last month.</p>
          <p>So now, let's leave all the possible room to your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We take now our first question from Giovanni Carriere, Autonomous Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon Mr. Passera. Couple of quick questions. On slide 23rd, when you talk about reduction of hedging impact of 56 million, could you explain again exactly what that means? Because my understanding was that when you are going to cut the hedging, you would actually record a gain as opposed to a loss. And is this 56 million a one-off in nature?</p>
          <p>And additionally can you actually increase the hedging again, you said it's dynamic, given that &#x2013; it may look like in a quarter or two if the economy soften and that actually the ECB is not going to move again anytime soon?</p>
          <p>Number two, in terms of the same slide when you show the impact from higher spreads, so I calculate 35 basis points average &#x2013; higher average re Euribor this quarter. And if I look at your deposit base &#x20AC;180 billion, &#x20AC;190 billion, I would have expected a much higher number. I suppose part of it is because of increased funding costs, I mean where do &#x2013; what kind of role do they play?</p>
          <p>And when you say that you are overfunded for this year, does it mean that whatever has happened on the sovereign front and on the CDS side in July will not impact your NII for the second part of the year? Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The first question about the hedging, during the second quarter of the year we reduced the hedging of about &#x20AC;12 billion and, as you know, when you create this kind of capital gains, you have to sub-divide them for the whole duration of what you're selling. So we will have the benefits subdivided into a number of years.</p>
          <p>The last part of the first question has to do with dynamic management of the hedging position. Yes, we could move back to the &#x20AC;50 billion we had at the beginning. Obviously, we have to decide on the basis of what we expect in terms of yield curve forward versus what we believe it will be the case. But the answer to your question can you get back to &#x20AC;50 billion, the answer is yes.</p>
          <p>Funding cost is certainly part of the reason why you do not have the figure you could have expected. But as I said at the beginning, we had included in the business plan a sensitivity of around &#x20AC;150 million and we are quite in line with that.</p>
          <p>The second reason is the delay; we have to wait in terms of both automatic mechanism on Euribor related contracts and especially on the re-pricing &#x2013; the general re-pricing actions we can take as a bank.</p>
          <p>The last part of the second question, if I understood it correctly, yes, we can go for many months, theoretically for the all 2011 and 2012, without tapping the wholesale market. We will raise money, a few more billion. You remember where we have covered 83% and the rest is retail bonds and these bonds will be paid at rates that are connected with government bonds yields. So for a very tiny minority of our total deposits we will have an impact. But as you can imagine, a few billion on the total deposit base of the bank, the total effect will probably will be minor.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the time for the call. Two questions from me. First, could you give us an indication of the current sort of mark-to-market impact on your Italian Treasury book in Q3?</p>
          <p>And secondly, obviously the funding costs have increased in the market, if we were to assume you had to roll the whole funding base of Intesa to do sort of the new terms, what impact would that have on the net interest margin? I assume it may be without asset repricing, which you obviously will do? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Since you started with &#x2013; by thanking me, I thank you for joining the meeting, and it's my duty and I do it very, very, very happily once every three months.</p>
          <p>The Treasury, the updated AFS reserve on our &#x2013; on all our sovereign securities is &#x2013; read the next page &#x2013; 36. Let me get to 36, I probably went too rapidly before. You see, these are old sovereign risk positions country-by-country and we had &#x20AC;1 billion. The last but one column was &#x20AC;1 billion alignment, let's say, to market values at the end of June. And if you go in the little square on the right-hand side, we are now at &#x20AC;2 billion, and that's the reserve on the AFS positions that are the big ones. In terms of trading book, is zero. We &#x2013; there is no &#x2013; no more effect, as of today at least, on the trading book. So banking book, &#x20AC;1 billion and zero on the trading book.</p>
          <p>The last question, if I understood it correctly, is an almost unanswerable question because, as I told you, we do not need to fund any more our activity for at least two years, at least on the market and even if we do it, it will be for a very minor amount. So given that we have already in-house all the funds to finance our activity, at least at the present levels, assuming that we have to change the cost of this deposit base can be done, and you can do it yourself, but it's nothing to do with reality.</p>
          <p>The day we have to replace gradually our funds at such new levels, obviously also the interest rates on the asset side of the balance sheet will have to be very different. But the message I want to convey is that we are at least partially independent and defended from whatever can happen on the market because of the overfunding policy. That means, that we simply anticipated the long-term funding of all our maturities before the big crisis.</p>
          <p>And in saying so, I completed the answer to the &#x2013; to Carriere that asked me the same question before. At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, we took into consideration the possibility that the market could have become much worse during 2011 and we took the risk and the cost of collecting more funds long-term than was strictly necessary. So, to a certain extent, we found ourselves financing short-term activities with long-term funds but the liquidity priority was such that the cost was believed by us acceptable and I think it was a wise decision.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very clear. May I just add a quick follow-on on the funding side? We have covered the long-term side, obviously, and you say that you have basically enough for this year and for next year if needed. How about short-term funding both for the availability and the cost of this, how has this changed in July, versus before?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Two quick questions from me. The first question is on the loan loss charge, the cost of credit. I've seen a positive trend in international retail with a decrease first quarter into second quarter from 244 basis points down to 170 basis points. Just wondering whether is there anything specific? And on the domestic business the cost of hedges actually increased from 95 basis points to 115 basis points, I'm just wondering whether you've done any extra provisions? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is on the net interest income for next year. If I look at the consensus, it is actually looking at a growth over 6%. It seems to be quite high, I'm just wondering how comfortable you feel with that growth and with your business plan volumes growth in loans of 4.6 %, whether you think it's sustainable or there is going to be a slowdown in volumes? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe we are in trouble because the kind of noise we are hearing from you is really astonishing. First question, cost of credit. Industry is going down also because it was at very much higher levels than we used to be also last year; there is nothing specific. We have not actually done any extra provision, is simply that we had &#x20AC;30 million or &#x20AC;40 million more and probably the only reason is that the cost of credit in Hungary is because of also of banking regulations had to be increased. But I'm not even trying to find a rationalization for that increase because it's really &#x2013; I don't have it. I mean &#x2013; and we consider the trend, the downward trend still going on and very compatible with our 2011 target.</p>
          <p>As far as net interest income next year, is really early to say. What we see in terms of volume growth availability says that we can grow if we want to but again, we will have to manage the liquidity part. So deposits and loans at the same time and we will have to decide, that obviously &#x2013; the basic objective is to stick to the business plan target in terms of bottom line. But in terms of volumes today, is really too early to say what 2012 will give.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have two quick questions. The first one is on fees; it seems to me Intesa has been one of the most aggressive on re-pricing the commercial banking fees. I was wondering if there is more room to go, or if you are going to pause just to make sure you keep customers and keep growing?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on deposit pricing, Intesa has been quite strict yesterday, particularly vis-&#xE0;-vis some of the smaller domestic competitors, which have been paying up on deposits. I was wondering, if you now see any ways to even keeping a strict pricing policy on deposits if you're seeing some inflows lately because of a flight to quality? Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>I'm glad you consider us aggressive in terms of fees. I think, we should be more aggressive and we will be more aggressive and you bet, there is room for our growth on that line. In terms of flight to quality, no, I must tell you that we are not experiencing in our country anything like that. And in terms of pricing policy, for sure, we had, and we wanted, to speed up the process to re-price a number of segment of our customer base, because, as I said on the occasion of the business plan, there is still quite a percentage of our customer base on the loan -on the credit business that has a negative EVA that we want to correct in &#x2013; as rapidly as possible.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon, everybody. Couple of more questions on funding on my side as well, sorry that it's getting a bit heavy on that. Can you give us an indication of how your blended average funding cost is actually trending? What has been, in the recent quarter, maybe few months, and what it was last year?</p>
          <p>And also, clearly your ability to now not even need to tap the wholesale market is a point of strength. But how is the pricing of the retail bonds that you're issuing then being impacted by the high yield on the sovereign bonds. Can you give us a little bit of indication of where we have -how did &#x2013; does that compare with what is expiring?</p>
          <p>And on the other side of it, how &#x2013; to what extent &#x2013; if current conditions remain, which we really hope it will not be the case, but unfortunately things seem to be &#x2013; getting worse. To what extent do you think you can actually pass across the funding increase that you may be eventually experiencing on to your corporate clients? What &#x2013; how much can they take?</p>
          <p>And one last question on a different matter; to what extent, in the current environment, which is very difficult, you still may have appetite to expand and take growth outside Italy. I'm referring for example to Poland, there are some banks that are maybe coming up for sale, some interesting ones. Do you think you may have any appetite, now that you have a much better capital position or this is simply not the time? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The first question, the funding one &#x2013; the first sub-question about the blended cost of everything, I don't have it and I really believe it's not meaningful. As far as the second sub-question, if I understood it correctly, we can go along for almost two years &#x2013; at least for two years, without tapping the wholesale market. But I'm sure that the market will be back and will be available much earlier than that.</p>
          <p>In terms of retail bonds, we have only to do less than 1 billion per month, that is close to zero and obviously the cost &#x2013; the rate at which these bonds are issued are very much connected with the similar government bonds. But again, we are talking about such a minor component of the overall deposit base that, we hope it will have very, very little influence. If &#x2013; those were the questions.</p>
          <p>In terms of possibility to pass the increase obviously, the transfer price rules. We have within the &#x2013; in the company take into account the market cost of funds for the &#x2013; for each duration. So no matter what was the actual cost of funds for us, we charge on the basis of the market cost for each duration.</p>
          <p>The consequence of it, was as I said, in commenting the net interest income figures it net the &#x2013; markups have reduced but in a period when the transfer rates &#x2013; the internal transfer rates have increased by almost 200 basis points. So the answer to the question is yes, in general with the exception of very large &#x2013; of large &#x2013; strong large corporate that can fund themselves from the market at better rates as you know.</p>
          <p>In terms of appetite, I would say that until the word is not clear again, it's not time for acquisitions but we keep our eyes open, we will look into any opportunity. Obviously, the prices at which we are available to make acquisitions have gone down and if we were very strict in the past, we have become even stricter now.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very clear, thank you. One more follow up, regarding the pricing of retail bonds as you run -- which are linked to the government bonds. Is there any way that you can actually issue <mark type="indiscernible" /> (66:34), anything that can help you offset some of the translation of yield increase in the government bond or unfortunately you are a taker there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I understood the question correctly, we have as a policy the rule that we have to be above the government bond rate, maybe very little, but there is no way we can go below that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, couple of questions. The first one is on Italian government bonds. And given you're very comfortable, obviously, with how things are developing &#x2013; I share your opinion on that. I was wondering if strategically you wouldn't consider increasing marginally, perhaps your AFS exposures in order to benefit from some yield pick-up given that the current yields are quite high at the moment.</p>
          <p>Then two questions on recent stuff that has been reported in the press. So the first one is on NPL sales, we see &#x2013; what we're seeing for a couple of months that Intesa is allegedly looking into potentially selling some NPLs, if you could make some comments on that and if discussions are at any advanced stage?</p>
          <p>And the second one is on a potential reorganization of your network in Center Italy, if that was to be the case, I just wanted to know if any of the savings that may or may not occur have already been taken &#x2013; are already embedded in your business plan assumptions? And the final question is on tax deductibility of goodwill. I was just wondering whether you have already made all of the goodwill in your intangible tax-deductible between two years ago or the new &#x2013; or if the new budget low has opened up some new possibilities to potentially make some further intangibles tax deductible with obviously some benefits on capital ratios? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of carry trade on government bonds I must tell you that given our priority on liquidity we do not have in mind this kind of deals, even if as you're saying they might be profitable. But today I believe banks like ours have to stay on the very safe side. The discussions we are having on the sale of a portfolio of non-performing loans is underway.</p>
          <p>We are very tough in terms of negotiation because we see that we have in our portfolio a value that is not that easy to sell to external buyers and given the repayments we are getting from our portfolio, we are ready to sell only at certain conditions. But the answer to your question is yes. We &#x2013; discussions are going ahead.</p>
          <p>The possible further savings coming from some simplification of the corporate structure of our local banks in Central Italy have not yet embedded in the business plan target. And last question, no, we have not used yet all the goodwill, all the fiscal advantages are coming from the goodwill utilization.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry just one question, just one follow-up from this final point. Am I correct, do I understand it correctly that the new budget low from this year has opened up the possibilities to do more? Is that a correct statement?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. One question on the business plan dynamic short-term. It looks like to me the &#x2013; your need to manage liquidity, asset quality, aging and volumes might &#x2013; is compromising top line growth mainly on the net interest income. But I was wondering over the next three or four quarters, what is your flexibility on cost because you rightly included in your business plan some buffers on the NII, which was correct because the cost of funding we see where it's going. There is some disappointment &#x2013; right disappointment let me use this word in the top line volumes in Italy, but again I look at the combined net interest adjusted margin so including cost of risk.</p>
          <p>So the question is, could we expect three or four quarters down the line with weak dynamics in NII that Intesa will actually surprise on the cost line, simply because you included some buffers there and if so, why?</p>
          <p>And the second question, I do share your views on Italy. I spend a lot of time on the phone explaining these, however, the market also knows that. There is very little difference; you know that you're cheap and liquid similar to UniCredit, so people short you. But the question really I want to ask you is, taking advantage of your position as the biggest &#x2013; as the CEO of the biggest Italian bank you speak with trade unions, entrepreneurs, politicians, do you think that the sense of urgency that we read on the papers at the political level is fully understood and if pressure continues to remain something will happen?</p>
          <p>Do you think that there is really the willingness to implement some structural reforms long-awaited? So if you could really give us or give me your flavor what you think needs to be done, can be done and also like very much to know your opinion both at the national level and at the European level; what do you think the solution or if not the solution the change of direction this crisis, because that's really key. If we don't know what the cost of equity of Intesa and the 10 years bond deal, I think it's very difficult to forecast earnings going forward. So I would really appreciate your comment. Sorry, if they go a little bit out of the direct earnings, but they're very important on future earnings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question about net interest income possibly at stake if the situation on the market does not improve. Actually what I can tell you as of today is that volumes to grow are available. We want to be very careful because when situations are so uncertain, you have to put the different objectives in ranking and liquidity comes before any other.</p>
          <p>But as far as we see and as far as the meetings we continuously have with entrepreneurs around the country especially in the nine top regions in the center, in the north. I can tell you that as of today, the potential for reaching the business plan target is there. And we will have to see how much and when, and how fast we want to tap that opportunity.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost reserves, I hope we will be able to tell you on the occasion of the next quarterly results presentation that we have already identified that some improvement vis-&#xE0;-vis what we had in mind with the business plan and the agreement we have finalized but that we have to define completely with the trade unions certainly in this direction.</p>
          <p>I agree with what you said in terms of the market not able or not available to appreciate the strengths of our country and the known selectiveness of the market versus the different banks. But since we can wait, at the end, the market will realize those strength. Where I totally share what your implicit answer to your question about the sense of urgency &#x2013; believe me the trade unions, the entrepreneurs, as of today are on the same side of the table and they are both very much aware of the urgency and the emergency of some measures to not only to keep costs and to keep public expenses under control, but to foster growth because today fostering, sustained and sustainable growth is even more urgent than just blocking public accounts.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we have to be very, very, very rigid in that respect because what we have done in the country, in our country is a real advantage and having a positive balance, a primary surplus is certainly a strength, but we cannot wait two months, as it seems they want to do, to launch new projects for growth.</p>
          <p>And our country can grow more not only through structural reforms, but we have to &#x2013; now is probably not the right time for going through all the list but, they're taking for structures, they take technical investment, they take the way also to increase and to make easier the hiring of new people. There are at least 10 &#x2013; 10 things that have to be done and have to be launched and can be launched. And let me tell you I really believe that in a very short period of time they will be launched to increase the speed of our economy.</p>
          <p>As far as Europe is concerned, for sure, we need to complete the European Union design. Today we are almost paralyzed by the VETO power that is &#x2013; that today every member state has. We do not have an effective crisis management process, certainly we cannot manage crisis like the Greek one on the basis of inter-governmental mechanism. We have to have a European mechanism that today we do not have.</p>
          <p>We have to have a Central Bank for the euro with all the functions and the tasks that any Central Bank has, including market stability and having a currency without a Central Bank responsible for market stability &#x2013; for sovereign debt market stability, is really a weakness.</p>
          <p>At the same time we have to speed the creation of the EFSF, today it's more on the paper than in reality; that is a very important tool to intervene in case of insolvency. But more resources have to be put into EFSF; more flexibility has to be given to this tool. And they have to be able and to be ready to react in a much more rapid way than today.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, many growth projects can only be done at the European level and if we want to be productive as a continent, Europe has to play a much more active role in fostering these projects. But I have already gone too far in terms of time on your questions and if we find another way or another place to discuss what Italy and Europe should do, I'm more than available.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you very much for your answer. Very clear, to me at least. Sorry, back to banking, just one question. If we look at Spain, we have the saving banks, which I'm not comparing to the small banks in Italy, Italian banks are in much better shape, have been delevering, losing a lot of market share. In Italy we have the small banks who have been fueling loan growth and the big banks who have been improving liquidity and funding, yourself, UniCredit and other banks, and haven't grown in the worst part of the cycle.</p>
          <p>So my question is, when do you think the true potential of Intesa as the biggest Italian bank, the best capitalized bank in Italy, and one of the best in Europe, which at the moment hasn't paid off at all. When do you think this trend is going to translate into a true competitive advantage? I know that we are in emergency right now, I'm just wondering, is it a question of three or four quarters, one year, two years, half a year, what's your feeling?</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Three quick questions. The first one is on new taxes coming from increased IRAP, &#x20AC; 57 million I guess is for the first half meaning that for the full-year we should assume something in the excess of &#x20AC;100 million, so this is the first question.</p>
          <p>Second one is on deposits, probably you already touched this topic &#x2013; was not 100% clear to me. I see a little decline in the quarter, is that only due to lower bond sold or does it have to do with real deposit base to the customers?</p>
          <p>Third question, I understand is much more philosophical one but everyone is exercising on this so just to understand what's your flavor. What could be, according to your understanding, a level at which, in terms of spread versus the Bund, you are able to keep your marginality, meaning not reducing the overall spread on NII?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, you're right, &#x20AC;57 million is for the first six months and so you have to double it for the whole year. Deposits, the decrease is partially due to a number of institutional repos that we decided not to continue and the rest is because of retail bonds we decided to sell.</p>
          <p>And the third question is an impossible, not question, but certainly is an impossible answer because it depends on many other things. And again, if we had to refinance or to fund our deposit base at the new levels, we would be already in trouble. But since we do not have to tap the market for years if necessary, it's a totally different situation. Then it depends on the strength of the demand for loans so, I don't want to even try to answer the question because it would be misleading.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, hi and just a couple of points. I want a clarification on repricing. I guess your process is going through now with all your clients. Is that first of all with all your clients or only with part of them?</p>
          <p>And then I guess the process is different depending on each case, but can you give a sense of the kind of repricing you're doing with your clients, is it in the range of 100, 200 basis points? Just to have an idea how much eventually you are planning to compensate of the increased cost of funding?</p>
          <p>And then one curiosity, of the roughly &#x20AC;60 billion of Italian government bonds you have, how much is used or funded through repo with customer or with other banks? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Repricing, no repricing is not a one size fits all kind of repricing. It depends on the different ratings, it depends on the level of EVA you have on the different segments, it's not on all the customers. So it's a really very articulated kind of measure. So it's really impossible to go more in-depth. If I understood correctly, your last question about &#x20AC;20 billion out of the &#x20AC;60 billion are collateral for repos.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to everyone. Three very quick ones. So the first is on the fiscal treatment of saving accounts, which has just been varied by the government. Do you consider this to be a tool to put Intesa in the position of gathering better liquidity from clients versus the usual sovereign bonds used to park the funds?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on client specifically, have you seen any trends of clients moving their money away from current accounts in fear of patrimoniali tax?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, a more general question rather asking for your opinion on where do you see the development of the Italian banking market dynamics in light of the growing funding costs, the asymmetry on capital and liquidity among small and large Italian banks, the presence of foreign banks with lower funding costs and the low current profitability of banks, which actually keeps on going for a while now. How do you see &#x2013; in the positioning, where do you want to position the Group going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe that the new rates, in terms of taxes on the different kinds of deposit, is a move in the right direction because the kind of distortions that we use to have are now eliminated. And I think that time deposits and saving deposits will become more and more an instrument for replacing at a certain point, also the retail bonds.</p>
          <p>The fear for patrimoniali might be there, but given the attitude of all the political parties that is certainly not in favor of such a move I believe that people believe that patrimoniali will not be introduced. And if I &#x2013; I'm not I sure I understood the last question, but for sure big strong banks have today quite an advantage vis-&#xE0;-vis &#x2013; a theoretical advantage vis-&#xE0;-vis small and weak ones.</p>
          <p>We certainly took advantage of these advantage in the first six months of the year when we decided to overfund or to anticipate our funding needs while a number of medium sized banks certainly ran out of the possibility to tap the market &#x2013; to tap this kind of market. Today the market in general is less selective than it used to be and we have to wait for it to come back in terms of selectivity to build quite a real advantage versus the other banks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If there are no other questions, I want to thank all of you. Again, as I said we are managing the bank and all of us are managing our own activity in very difficult times. Italy is being impacted more than it deserves and together with Italy our banking system, but we are quite sure the market will realize the strength of &#x2013; at least banks like ourself.</p>
          <p>We take the commitment with you to keep and to work on the sustainable, profitability mode, we have managed the bank in the last two years and profitability will always be balanced with profile liquidity, leverage and solidity. We believe in the business plan we launched a few months ago and we consider those targets achievable. Thank you very much to all of you.</p>
