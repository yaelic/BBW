          <p>Welcome to Cisco Systems Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2010 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco Systems, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to introduce Ms. Laura Graves, Director of Global Investor Relations, Corporate Communications for Cisco Systems. Ma'am, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our 81st quarterly conference call. This is Laura Graves, and I'm joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and CEO; Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, Executive Vice President of Worldwide Operations; Ned Hooper, Chief Strategy Officer and Senior Vice President of our Consumer Business; and Padmasree Warrior, our Chief Technology Officer.</p>
          <p>The Q3 fiscal year 2010 press release is on the U.S. High-Tech Marketwire and on the Cisco website at newsroom.cisco.com. I would like to remind you that we have a corresponding webcast with slides. In those slides you will find the financial information that we cover during this conference call, as well as additional financial metrics and analysis that you may find helpful. Downloadable Q3 financial statements will be available following the call, including revenue by product and geography, income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheet and cash flow statements can be found on our website in the Investor Relations section. Click on the financial reporting section of the website to access the webcast slides and these documents.</p>
          <p>A replay of this call will be available via telephone from May 12 through May 19 at 866-357-4205 or 203-369-0122 for international callers. A replay will also be available from May 12 through July 23 on Cisco's Investor Relations website.</p>
          <p>Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The financial results in this press release are unaudited. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Specifically, the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>And finally, unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John for his commentary on the quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Laura, thank you very much. During the opening comments in the conference call I will focus on what I view to be the key takeaways for Q3, fiscal year 2010. First, a very candid discussion about what we are seeing in the market on a global basis relative to Q3 and its effect on our Q4 fiscal 2010 expectations; second, an update on our rapidly improving financial measurements and some interesting geographic, product, acquisition and customer segment metrics; third, a high-level summary of what you see us in terms of where we're placing our risk investments and the results in some market adjacencies; and then finally, our revenue guidance for Q4 with the appropriate caveats.</p>
          <p>Following my opening comments, Frank will provide additional detail on Q3. In the third section we will focus on business momentum from a strategy, customer segment, geographic and product basis. Frank will then follow with additional financial parameters around our guidance. I will then wrap it up with some comments in terms of Cisco's momentum going into Q4, and finally our Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>From a summary point of view, I think there are a number of key takeaways from the results in Q3 and I will attempt to cover these at this time. First, the financial results were outstanding. And very well balanced across key areas, achieving record levels -- record level results from both total revenue and earnings per share from a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis.</p>
          <p>Revenue of 10.4 billion, an increase of approximately 27% year-over-year, was above our guidance provided last quarter of 23 to 26%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.42, a 40% year-over-year increase. GAAP earnings per share were $0.37, a 61% increase year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Expense management was solid with non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue at 36.3%. Non-GAAP product gross margins were very solid at 65.3. Cash generated from operations in Q3 was approximately $3 billion. And we repurchased 2.2 billion of stock during the quarter under our repurchase program. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was 28.8%. Non-GAAP net income of 2.5 billion was up 41% year-over-year. Product book-to-bill was approximately 1. As a reminder, Q3 had one extra week in the quarter which occurs approximately every 5 to 6 years.</p>
          <p>The market over the last year and a half has evolved pretty much as we expected and indicated in our conference calls. In fiscal year '09, the first 3 quarters had negative sequential growth in both orders and revenues. Q3 of that year was the bottom. And Q4 was clearly the tipping point returning to normal sequential growth. That is Q3 to Q4 fiscal year '09. Especially orders, but also in revenues. In fiscal year '10 each of the quarters to date has shown very solid sequential and year-over-year growth. As we stated in prior conference calls, Q1 FY '10 acceleration was in the first phase of the recovery. And in our opinion, Q2 marked the second phase of capital spending of the recovery with additional across the board acceleration in all our geographies and market segments.</p>
          <p>This quarter, Q3, we saw a return to both balance across geographies and customer segments that we haven't seen since before the global economic challenge began. There are 3 key takeaways in my mind for the quarter.</p>
          <p>First, Q3, in my opinion, is the proof point to having achieved our goals and aspirations in terms of how we handle very challenging economic times. We emerged from this downturn gaining market share, a larger share of the total wallet spend of our customers, dramatically improved customer relations as a trusted technology and business partner, and having next generation products in almost every product category.</p>
          <p>Second, our innovation and operation engine is hitting on all cylinders. This applies to products, organization structure, business models and movements into 30 plus new market adjacencies.</p>
          <p>And third, from almost every measurement perspective, whether revenues, earnings per share, new product introductions, successful acquisitions, leading in economic challenges, internal start-ups and many more, this quarter was probably the strongest quarter we've had in our history.</p>
          <p>In summary, our game plan for handling economic downturns hit on all cylinders. Q3 results are the proof point and was, in my opinion, the strongest across-the-board quarter in our history. At this time I'd like to provide additional detail on the very positive order growth and balance across geographies and market segments.</p>
          <p>The balance was extremely strong across our 4 large geographic theaters. All 4 growing in terms of orders at or above 30% year-over-year. The U.S. continued its strong pace with very solid balance across enterprise, public sector, service provider, commercial and consumer, all growing in excess of 25% year-over-year. Our Emerging Markets theater, which does not include China or India, returned to very solid growth, comfortably above 40% year-over-year for the quarter. And as a reminder, in Q2 our Emerging Markets &#x2013; this group was flat year-over-year, so major improvement.</p>
          <p>Asia Pacific grew over 30%, again with very solid balance across key customer segments. I know there are many questions about our business momentum in Europe. We were very pleased with our European year-over-year growth numbers of approximately 30%. Our smallest theater, Japan, which represents about 3% of our business, grew in low single digits from an order perspective. Although it's hard to know for sure the benefits of the extra week in the quarter in terms of orders and revenues, our best estimates with all the appropriate caveats is that it has probably contributed to additional 4 to 5% in year-over-year growth terms.</p>
          <p>Now on to additional detail from a country perspective, which was equally as encouraging. Two quarters ago, only 2 of our top 15 countries saw year-over-year positive growth. Last quarter, 8 of our top 15 countries saw year-over-year positive growth. In Q3, 12 of our top 15 countries saw orders in excess of 20% and all but one saw positive order growth.</p>
          <p>Our new innovative dynamic network organization structure of councils, boards and working groups, as discussed in the last few calls, is operating very effectively and has been an important part of managing through the recent downturn and then position us for the acceleration of results achieved in Q3. These structures allow speed, scale, flexibility and rapid replication.</p>
          <p>During the last year we have completely enhanced our Routing, Switching, Advanced Technology and Consumer product lines. Growth in terms of orders were all approximately 25% or better year-over-year and the new products such as our Nexus product family, our ASR product family, new fixed switching, the 2K and 3Ks are all producing growth results at the high end of our expectations.</p>
          <p>The details supporting the new product success is really impressive. The following is a quick summary of year-over-year growth rates for these new products. The Nexus 2000 is up 431%. The Nexus 5000 is up 315%. The Nexus 7000 is up 277%. The ASR 9000 is up almost 900%. Our UCS product line had sequential revenue growth of 168% from Q2 to Q3, and order growth of 83%. For other new products that have recently been announced, the sequential order growth, that is from Q2 to Q3, was also very strong. In terms of this quarterly sequential order growth the ASR 5000 grew 243%. ASR 9000 grew 110%. The ISR G2 grew 337%. The ISR 1900 grew 333%. The 2900 ISR grew 335%. And the 3900 ISR grew 342%.</p>
          <p>Ned, that's probably as fast as we've ever done with new products in terms of rapid ramp-up for the next generation. Obviously both our next generation product introduction pace and rapid customer acceptance of these new products across our entire product lines is extremely strong &#x2013; in my opinion in fact, the best we've seen in the history of our company in terms of breadth and depth of its innovation engine with solid operational execution. Again, I would not underestimate the role that the new organization structure and new business models have played in our ability to achieve the above mentioned results.</p>
          <p>We believe that these are sustainable, differentiating advantages for Cisco versus our peers in the market, and are therefore continuing our optimism about gaining a bigger share of our customers' spending even in areas where we already are the clear leader. As we projected in prior conference calls, we had market share gains in both Switching and Routing. As an interesting supporting data point, our CRS-1 had year-over-year order growth of approximately 45% and our IP phones had order growth of approximately 57%.</p>
          <p>While it's still early in the integration stages for our 2 large acquisitions, Starent and TANDBERG, the initial integration, internal integration, customer acceptance and excitement have gone even better than we could have expected. These 2 acquisitions have had the broadest successes with our customers, almost without exception, of any acquisitions we've done at any time in terms of the initial integration.</p>
          <p>Our focus, not on a stand-alone product, but rather on a technology architecture tying together products from different &#x2013; from the data centers to the home, is gaining major traction with many of our customers. We are also seeing the expanding acceptance of our approach to business architecture across our leading customers.</p>
          <p>As an example, at one of our recent global technical advisory sessions with 30 of our largest customers and service providers and enterprise customers I asked a key question, have we improved our position with you first in terms of our technology architecture over the last year? And second, in terms of our business architecture partnership over the last year? Over 80% of the participants said we had improved while the remaining said that we were in the same position as a year ago. This feedback is well ahead of my expectations for this point in time. However, our challenge now is to repeat this in volume across our top 1,000 customers.</p>
          <p>We exit Q3 with a compelling financial position and an innovation engine from both a technology and business model perspective that should position us to expand our leadership in the marketplace, while at the same time moving effectively into 30-plus market adjacencies. Our internal start ups, partnerships and acquisitions continue to fill out our architectural strategies, and we believe innovation in our traditional Routing and Switching product families has had a very high probability of gaining market share.</p>
          <p>For those areas that Cisco can influence and control we feel we are doing very well. The key market transitions relative to collaboration, virtualization and video networking, which will drive productivity and growth as the network loads for the next decade are continuing to evolve even faster than we thought just several quarters ago. Again, as an update, the new organization and business models have contributed in a major way to this quarter's productivity increase as measured by revenue per employee, which was a very strong 28% productivity increase year-over-year, not including the recent acquisition of TANDBERG.</p>
          <p>While we attempt to be very transparent with what we are seeing in the market and have established a good track record in terms of seeing trends early, our views do not tend to change every month or every quarter, and even when they do evolve, to change dramatically is really the exception. It is with this consistency of staying focused on the long term by not getting distracted by the short-term market activity that drives our strategy for future success.</p>
          <p>While we believe the recovery is accelerating, no one knows for sure how long it will be, how long it will last, how strong it will be or the extent of new job creation. But as we said in prior quarter conference calls, we are going to continue to be very aggressive to position ourselves for an optimistic view of global economic growth, while continuing to maintain tight financial measurements in aligning our resources to new opportunities.</p>
          <p>I believe Q3 was a very positive proof point that both our vision and strategy for our industry is evolving as expected, and at the same time our ability to execute on the vision and strategy as demonstrated by the very strong Q3 results. Given the Q3 financial results, productivity increases and successes in the new markets, it is probably not a surprise to anyone that you will see us growing our expenses at a faster pace, as we continue to expand in our traditional business areas and move into the 30-plus market adjacencies. As discussed in last quarter, we expect our head count to grow in support of our additional growth investments by 2 to 3,000 incremental external hires over the next several quarters. Net of acquisitions, we added approximately 1,000 of those employees in Q3.</p>
          <p>We expect to continue to be very aggressive in both our own internal innovation commitments as well as our partnership and acquisition strategies. For those Cisco employees listening, this growth in head count will continue to be very targeted towards strategic opportunities with focus on productivity improvements in many of our traditional functions by adding resources to drive into these new market adjacencies. Also as we've said in conference calls over the years, Cisco will always be affected by major economic changes, capital spending patterns, new and existing competitors, potential issues affecting our suppliers and our ability to execute or not on our strategy and other factors as discussed in our SEC filings.</p>
          <p>For purposes of our long-range goals, as well as our quarterly guidance, we are also assuming that our vision of how the industry and the market will evolve will be accurate and we will be effective in execution on that vision.</p>
          <p>With all this in mind we will continue to provide our guidance with all the appropriate caveats one quarter at a time and encourage each of our shareholders to not get too far ahead of themselves on building on the positives of another very strong quarter. Given all the uncertainties regarding the strength and shape of the recovery, concerns about the recovery possibly slowing and the unknown extent of job creation, we encourage you to wait for additional economic data before becoming too optimistic. This is what you would expect at Cisco, and I would encourage that from our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Before providing guidance for Q4, let me remind you that Q3 had an extra week, which we now estimate to have accounted for 4 to 5% in terms of the year-over-year growth. Also as a reminder when looking at comparisons, last year's Q4 fiscal year '09 to Q4 fiscal year '10, we are starting to see more typical comparisons. Q3 FY'09 was the bottom, as we said earlier, from a Cisco perspective, and Q4 was the tipping point, delivering very solid sequential order and revenue growth compared to Q3. A nice way of saying that the end of Q4 is coming more in line from a comparison and a pattern we're used to seeing. I</p>
          <p>In terms of Q4 revenue guidance, I will provide the full Cisco year-over-year revenue growth including our acquisition of TANDBERG. Frank will provide additional details in his Q4 guidance discussion on sequential Q3 to Q4 comparisons, as well as our year-over-year comparisons. With this discussion in mind, our revenue guidance for Q4 fiscal year '10, including our usual caveats as discussed earlier and in our financial reports, is for revenue growth including TANDBERG to increase 25 to 28% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>As we shared with you in prior conference calls, we will now turn to our primary focus on growth in terms of year-over-year rather than sequential growth. In summary, we believe that we are well positioned in the industry due in part to our new business model in terms of vision, differentiating strategy and execution. We believe we are entering the next phase of the Internet as growth and productivity will spin around collaboration, video and virtualization enabled by Network Web 2.0 technologies. We will do our best to provide the product architectures and the expertise to partner with our customers in the implementation of this collaborative capabilities from a technology and business perspective. We will also share with our customers how we have done this internally. In short we're going to attempt to execute a strategy over the next decade that is very similar to what we did in the early 90s, and as we said before, it powered our growth for the next decade.</p>
          <p>Now, Frank, let me turn it over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. I'm pleased with the outstanding financial results for Q3 FY'10 with the achievement of most metrics at or above the high end of our guidance and which demonstrates our ability to execute within our business model.</p>
          <p>Total revenue for the third quarter was $10.4 billion, an increase of approximately 27% year-over-year, above the high end of our guidance provided last quarter of 23 to 26% year-over-year. We did have an extra week this quarter, which resulted in approximately a 4 to 5% increase in revenue year-over-year or 3 to 4% sequentially Q2 to Q3.</p>
          <p>Total product revenue was $8.4 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Switching revenue was $3.7 billion, an increase of 40% year-over-year. Modular Switching revenue was up approximately 45% year-over-year, while fixed Switching revenue increased 37% year-over-year. Our Switching revenue for the quarter represents a record in dollar terms and the highest year-over-year Switching revenue growth we've experienced in nearly a decade.</p>
          <p>Routing revenue was $1.7 billion, up 23% year-over-year, representing an increase of 37% year-over-year in the high end, an increase of 1% in mid-range and an increase of 7% in low end. Advanced Technologies revenue totaled $2.4 billion, representing an increase of 18% year-over-year. We saw increases in Unified Communications of 26%, Wireless at 27%, Video Systems of 9%, and security was up 15% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Other product revenue totaled $630 million, an increase of approximately 71% year-over-year. The year-over-year growth was led by strong sales of cable and optical products, the inclusion of sales of Flip video products from our Q4 '09 acquisition of Pure Digital, as well as solid growth in our emerging technologies, which includes Unified Computing, TelePresence and Physical Security, among others.</p>
          <p>Total services revenue was a record $1.9 billion, up approximately 11% year-over-year. Services resumed double-digit growth and actually continued to grow at a fairly consistent rate throughout fiscal year 2009 and 2010. We experienced an increase in total revenue across all geographic segments on a year-over-year basis. Year-over-year revenue ranged from an increase of approximately 15% in Europe to approximately 41% in Asia-Pacific theater. Revenues in the U.S. and Canada theater was up approximately 29%, Japan was up approximately 25% and Emerging Markets was up approximately 30%.</p>
          <p>Q3 FY'10 total non-GAAP gross margin was 65.2%, down 0.4 percentage points quarter-over-quarter and up 0.1 of a point year-over-year. For product only, non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was 65.3%, down 0.3 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. The decrease was primarily due to higher discounts, partially offset by higher volume and cost savings. While we were pleased with our overall performance in gross margins this quarter, we do recognize the variability and product mix and other factors that will impact the gross margin. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP product gross margin was up 0.7 percentage points primarily driven by higher volume, mix and cost savings, partially offset by higher discounts.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP service gross margin for the third quarter was 64.8%, down from 65.9% last quarter and 67% in Q3 fiscal year '09. The service gross margin decrease quarter-over-quarter was primarily driven by mix and increased costs from the additional week, which resulted in greater head count expense, partially offset by volume. The year-over-year decrease was driven by some similar factors. Services margin will typically experience some variability over time due to various factors such as the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of contract initiations and renewals.</p>
          <p>Total gross margin by theater ranged from approximately 62.9% for Asia-Pacific and Emerging Markets to approximately 71.1% in Japan. We saw variability in our margins across theaters due to higher discounting, offset by cost savings and volume. Gross margin increases on a year-over-year basis in Emerging Markets, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Europe and decreased quarter-over-quarter. U.S. and Canada declined year-over-year and were flat quarter-over-quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $3.8 billion in Q3, up approximately 9% quarter-over-quarter driven by the extra week, and increased investments in product innovation and strategic growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating expenses were 20% &#x2013; were up 20% year-over-year. The expenses associated with the extra week in the quarter contributed approximately 4 percentage points of the year-over-year increase. Non-GAAP interest and other income was $72 million for Q3. This amount reflects investment gains realized in our portfolio, and a gain from the early termination of a lease agreement with a customer, partially offset by higher interest expense from our recent bond offerings. GAAP interest and other income was $58 million for the third quarter of fiscal year '10. Our Q3 FY'10 non-GAAP tax provision rate was 19.1%. Our non-GAAP tax provision reflects a decrease in our forecasted effective tax rate for the fiscal year from 22% to 21%, due to a relative increase in foreign income taxed at other than U.S. rates.</p>
          <p>During Q3 FY'10 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed a 2005 U.S. Tax Court ruling involving Xilinx. The case impacted the tax treatment of share-based compensation. While Cisco was not a party to the case, the tax accounting change caused by the decision resulted in a tax benefit to Cisco of $158 million, which was excluded from our non-GAAP earnings and our non-GAAP tax rate. This represents a reversal of the charge recorded in Q3 FY'09. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $2.5 billion, representing an increase of 41% year-over-year. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income was 23.9%. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the third quarter was $0.42, versus $0.30 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, a 40% increase year-over-year.</p>
          <p>GAAP net income for the third quarter was $2.2 billion, as compared to $1.3 billion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the third quarter was $0.37 versus $0.23 in the same quarter fiscal year 2009.</p>
          <p>We closed the TANDBERG acquisition at the end of the third quarter and there was negligible impact on our income statement while our balance sheet does fully reflect the impact of the close of the acquisition and related accounting. GAAP results include a $14 million loss for Q3, related to our hedging of foreign currency considerations for our acquisition of TANDBERG. While these hedges have resulted in GAAP losses of $10 million year-to-date, they allowed us to effectively lock in a purchase price at currency levels more favorable than those prevailing when the deal was first announced.</p>
          <p>Now moving onto the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong, providing us with significant financial flexibility. The total of cash, cash equivalents and investments for the quarter was $39.1 billion, down approximately $530 million from last quarter. The TANDBERG acquisition resulted in a net use of approximately $2.6 billion of cash. During the quarter, we generated $3 billion of cash from operations.</p>
          <p>Moving onto accounts receivable. Our receivables balance was $4.1 billion at the end of Q3, down from 4.2 billion at the end of Q2 fiscal year '10. At the end of Q3, days sales outstanding or DSO was 39 days remaining unchanged from the Q2 level that we had last quarter. And that's compared to 27 days in Q3 fiscal year '09. DSO reflects a shipment profile fairly consistent with last quarter, while also including the addition of TANDBERG to our balance sheet late in the quarter.</p>
          <p>As the technology industry moves to a recovering supply demand environment, shifts in lead times and inventory levels will occur. We have improved our lead times throughout the quarter on most products and expect these lead times to continue to improve throughout the next quarter.</p>
          <p>I would like to acknowledge and thank our partners and our customers for their continued support as we have worked through this together. Total inventory at the end of Q3 was $1.3 billion, up approximately 3% quarter-over-quarter. Non-GAAP inventory turns were 11.1 this quarter, down 0.6 of a point from last quarter and up 0.4 over Q3 of last year. As part of the management of our supply chain, we enter into purchase &#x2013; inventory purchase commitments as a normal course of business.</p>
          <p>These agreements allow our contract manufacturers and suppliers to procure inventory on our behalf based on our expectations of customer demand over multiple quarters. Typically these agreements are firm and non-cancelable. Cisco's inventory purchase commitments at the end of Q3 were $4.3 billion, an increase of approximately 30% from the end of Q2. These inventory levels and purchase commitments reflect our increased confidence, allow us supply chain flexibility and support anticipated higher business volume and longer term product demand projections in our business.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we repurchased $2.2 billion of common stock, under the stock repurchase program, or 87 million shares at an average price of $25.76 per share. The remaining authorized repurchase amount under the stock repurchase program was approximately $9.3 billion at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Deferred revenue was $10.3 billion at the end of Q3, up approximately 7% quarter-over-quarter and an increase of approximately 17% compared with Q3 fiscal year '09. Deferred product revenue was $3.5 billion, and deferred service revenue was approximately $6.8 billion, increases of approximately 28% and 13% year-over-year respectively. At the end of Q3, our head count totaled 68,574, an increase of approximately 2,700 from last quarter, or a net increase of 1,000 aside from the acquisition of TANDBERG.</p>
          <p>In closing, from a financial perspective, this was an outstanding quarter for Cisco. Based upon the robustness of our products and services portfolio, we have seen in our business &#x2013; we've seen our business return to a financial position that we believe is in many cases stronger than where we were prior to the economic downturn. This strong financial position provides Cisco a solid foundation for continued innovation and strategic investment which we believe will allow us to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities that are ahead of us.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn it back to you, John.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Well done.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the discussion of strategy, customer segments, geography, product review, etcetera. Q3 continued the trend of balance between innovation and operational effectiveness in almost every aspect of our business. In recent past conference calls we have gone into certain important discussions of our strategy. And we will continue this trend in most of our future calls. However, given the very strong results of this quarter, we think the strategy speaks for itself and will focus this conference call on the normal customer segments, geographies and product results.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to customer segments and geographies where the discussion on a global basis will be measured by orders of year-over-year and at times sequentially. When you look at both product orders and geographies what a difference a year makes. Q3 product orders were up approximately 34% year-over-year. Just one quarter ago, product orders grew at 11% pace. Two quarters ago, they were down in high single digits. And 3 quarters ago in comparing year-over-year numbers, they were down in low 20s year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Now on to the discussion first as it relates to customer segments. Our service provider business on a global basis in terms of product orders in Q3 was up approximately 30% year-over-year. Commercial was up 40%. Enterprise was up 26%. And consumer was up 50%. In fact over 50%. Ned, sorry about that. He just kicked me under the table.</p>
          <p>In terms of geography, which is the primary way we run the business, results across all 4 of our largest theaters were remarkably consistent in terms of enterprise, public sector, service provider, commercial and consumer with every customer segment in each of our 4 largest theaters growing approximately 20% or better year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Again, the total U.S. grew year-over-year approximately 34%, Europe approximately 30%, Emerging Markets in the high 40s, Asia Pacific approximately 34%. The balance across these customer segments was remarkably very solid in each of these theaters as well. Japan continues to see some challenging economic times and our growth in Japan was up 2% year-over-year. In the U.S., to provide additional detail, the enterprise grew 27%, public sector 44. Service providers grew 30%. Commercial grew 34 and consumer grew 64%, all on a year-over-year basis. Given the interest that many of you have on specific countries around the world, and especially as it relates to Europe, the following is a summary of some of our top countries' year-over-year growth.</p>
          <p>The UK grew 28%. Germany grew 12. France grew 27. The Netherlands grew 23. Italy was down 1% and Switzerland grew 28%. In the rest of the world, Canada grew 36%. Australia grew 22%. Brazil grew 80%. India grew 40%. Mexico grew 63%. China grew 24%. And Russia grew 31% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>We also saw outstanding year-over-year and sequential improvement in the product numbers in Q3. The following discussion of products will be in terms of revenues year-over-year. As you would expect given product book-to-bill of approximately 1, product orders and product revenues in each product category were relatively close in terms of year-over-year numbers. Again, product revenues grew approximately 31% year-over-year, while orders grew approximately 34%. Service revenues grew approximately 11% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>We made major improvements in our order lead times during Q3 and anticipate bringing the remaining product lead times back into our desired range in Q4, assuming there are no major surprises in our supply chain. However, while we are seeing improvements, the supply chain for the industry still has some challenges.</p>
          <p>Our core switching revenue growth was extremely strong with approximately 40% year-over-year growth. Balance was also very strong between Modular and Fixed Switching growing 45% and 37% year-over-year, respectively. As we mentioned earlier, the new Switching products were very strong. In terms of new Switching products, Nexus 7,000 from a revenue perspective grew 281%, and now has an annualized run rate of over $1 billion. The Nexus 5,000 continued with very strong revenue growth year-over-year of 425%, and at a current run rate of 250 million a year. The Nexus 2,000 revenue run rate is now above 160 million on an annualized basis and achieved year-over-year revenue growth of 486%.</p>
          <p>Our core routing products also had a very strong quarter with revenues up 23%. High end Routing, which as we currently have it classified, represents about two-thirds of our total Routing business, grew an outstanding 37%. In terms of new Routing products, we again saw very strong year-over-year growth in revenues. The ASR 9000 with an annualized revenue run rate of over 160 million, grew 740% year-over-year and 180% quarter-to-quarter.</p>
          <p>Of potential equal importance is the number of ASR customers, particularly large service providers, which grew from about 45 in Q2 to approximately 100 in Q3. And for the total ASR family of 1000, ASR 1000 to 5000, 9000, the number of customers moved approximately from 1,600 in Q2 to 2,350 customers in Q3, once again a very strong indicator of future growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>The ISR G2 achieved a run rate in its second revenue generation quarter of an annualized 500 million, up sequentially 429%. The ISR 3900 achieved an annualized run rate of over 200 million and increased sequentially Q2 to Q3 at 489%. The ISR 2900 is on a revenue run rate of approximately 250 million and achieved sequential growth of 371%. The ISR 1900 is just starting to ship and is off to a good start. The ASR 5000 from the Starent acquisition is at an order run rate of over 350 million a year.</p>
          <p>The key takeaways from these outstanding year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth numbers for our newly introduced products, is how fast they are ramping up and how fast our customer base is expanding using these new products. And it's going across all of our new innovative product lines with this type of success. I've never seen this broad a base of new product families with this broad of balance and extremely rapid growth rates in my career from any high tech company.</p>
          <p>In other product areas of interest, Security grew year-over-year approximately 15% with over 400 million in revenue in Q3. Unified Communication grew 26% with approximately 720 million in revenue. Wireless grew 27% with approximately 270 million in revenue in Q3. And Storage grew 100% with approximately 140 million in revenue.</p>
          <p>Video Systems grew 9% with approximately 580 million in revenue. ANS grew 22% with approximately 100 million in Q3. And Optical revenue grew 15% year-over-year with approximately 170 million in revenue. From a revenue perspective, the CRS product family grew 75% year-over-year to an annualized run rate of approximately 1.4 billion. I think it is even more important than the growth rate, with the CRS family, that the next generation of the internet build around the CRS 3 with its ability to do a billion videos is the &#x2013; in a multi-year leadership position we now have, versus the core, compared to all of our competitors.</p>
          <p>IP phones grew year-over-year 45% with approximately 225 million of revenue in Q3. I'd like to spend a few minutes on the data center growth opportunity in front of us, and highlight the early successes we've seen.</p>
          <p>As we stated previously, we believe the data center virtualization has quickly emerged as a major disruption and represents a key market transition in transforming the data center into a more agile and efficient infrastructure culminating into a compelling growth opportunity with over 85 billion in total addressable market by 2015. Cisco, in my opinion, is best positioned to lead the transformation of the next generation data center. And with our end-to-end architecture approach to enable a market transition and accelerate the adoption of virtualization, by delivering a unique architecture to our customers that can lay down the foundation for them to journey from virtualization to building clouds going forward.</p>
          <p>Last quarter's conference call you asked us for an update on the data center and UCS momentum. The core Nexus 7000, 5000, 2000 product lines now have over 2,000 customers and have hit the key milestone of 1 million 10-gigabit Ethernet ports shipped. The UCS system continues a strong customer acceptance with an annual revenue run rate of 200 million, up 186% sequentially from a revenue perspective. The UCS customer base has more than doubled since last quarter, which was about 370 if I remember right, to currently over 900 customers. Nearly all of the UCS customers were competitive wins verves large incumbents.</p>
          <p>Customer acceptance is very strong, with the majority of initial buyers coming back with repeat purchases. We've seen strong traction in our verticals within the Enterprise segment. We built a powerful global partner ecosystem in addition to VCE coalition with the Vblock offering and Acadia, a joint venture Cisco-EMC now led by industry CEO veteran Michael Capellas to expand our data center growth opportunity and enable customers to move to Cloud Computing.</p>
          <p>Our architecture sales approach is rapidly not only gaining traction, but accelerating. This is different than the stand-alone product approach of our competition. Simply put, Nexus sales pull through UCS, UCS sales pull through Nexus. Vblock sales pool Nexus, UCS, VMware and EMC sales. Key takeaway? Cisco's momentum into data center is rapidly accelerating.</p>
          <p>The second area that you asked us to cover on last quarter's conference call was an update on TelePresence, and how we're doing with the TANDBERG acquisitions. The TANDBERG acquisition is going extremely smooth from a customer, employee retention and business integration perspective. As a reminder the integration was just formally approved approximately 2 weeks before the end of Q3. Every customer I've met that has either a Cisco or a TANDBERG installed is extremely positive on the combination, with the key takeaway being a continued acceleration of next generation videoconferencing capabilities and the business model changes. And we're starting to get our first joint wins together, even though it's only been in position for 2 weeks. Last calendar year, TANDBERG's full-year results were approximately 900 million.</p>
          <p>Now moving onto Cisco TelePresence. We continue to see solid acceleration during Q3 with orders increasing year-over-year by approximately 50%. The current annualized run rate is approximately 175 million based on Q3 order rates. We are beginning to see the very large wins with the 200 plus initial commitments of high end Cisco TelePresence during Q3. One of those is Bank of America, which will deploy over 200 systems initially while another of the wins was in an emerging country's government social services area where we received an initial order for 250 systems. We announced 5 new TelePresence experiences, bringing our total to 10, which include boardroom, broadcast, financial services, expert, lobby ambassador and media solutions.</p>
          <p>As we tend to focus on key vertical applications, there were 3 major areas I would like to briefly discuss as it relates to video capability. First, Cisco announced Cisco's Health TelePresence, a unique telemedicine experience, and we are seeing major global interest. In education, Duke University announced their classroom of the future, tightly integrating Cisco's TelePresence into a new education experience. And third, in retail, British Telecom announced a novel use of TANDBERG TelePresence deploying virtual fitting rooms at Tommy Hilfiger.</p>
          <p>Video capability is obviously one of the key drivers of network loads, changing business models and potential major productivity improvement in every industry vertical. While we traditionally do not break future growth rates down by individual product families, I believe it is fair for you to ask our expectations of growth from this combination with all the appropriate caveats. I believe that a good job for the combined TelePresence business, TANDBERG and Cisco TelePresence would be for growth in the next fiscal year to be in the mid-20s, before any adjustments based on deferred revenue from the TANDBERG acquisition.</p>
          <p>A third area that you asked us to discuss in last quarter's conference call was the Starent acquisition. In many of our customer environments the Starent acquisition was a tipping point in Cisco's architectural play from the core to the edge, wired and wireless of the large service provider Networks. Growth rates over the next year for the product family with all the appropriate caveats are forecast by our team to be in the mid-20s.</p>
          <p>On a last note, both the Starent and TANDBERG acquisitions not only are they off to an extremely strong start from business momentum, business integration and cultural match, they have probably I think, Ned, been the 2 of our smoothest large acquisitions that we've ever done. Your team's getting good at that, but I think the cultures are getting well, and good selection by the way.</p>
          <p>In summary, although we would all like to avoid the downturns, our vision of how the industry is going to evolve appears to be playing out very much as we expected. We believe our differentiated strategy is also achieving the benefits to both Cisco and our customers that we thought were possible.</p>
          <p>And finally, our execution is on target in terms of results measured from a customer-partnership perspective, market share and share of our customer's total communications and IT expenditures as the network becomes the platform for delivering these capabilities. Make no mistake about it, we are poised and ready to capitalize on the opportunities, especially those related to data center virtualization, collaboration, video and other market adjacencies.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it back over to Frank for additional financial guidance and other financial highlights. Frank, back to you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP.</p>
          <p>For Q4 FY'10 we anticipate total revenue to be up approximately 25 to 28% year-over-year. Because the sequential increase between Q3 and Q4 needs to be adjusted for a few one-time items, we want to also provide a quarterly guidance bridge here. Our analysis of historical quarter-over-quarter growth between fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4 results in a typical sequential increase of approximately 5 to 6%.</p>
          <p>On a sequential Q3 to Q4 basis, the impact of the extra week in Q3 is 3 to 4% of total revenue. This should be reduced from a normal sequential increase as we return to 13-week quarter in Q4.</p>
          <p>Additionally, please note that throughout 2009, TANDBERG recorded revenue in the range of approximately 200 to $300 million per quarter, depending upon seasonality. Based upon projected revenue after adjustments for purchase accounting and for normal TANDBERG seasonality, we believe TANDBERG will contribute 2% to the sequential growth in Q4, or approximately $200 million, which is also included in our revenue guidance for Q4.  If you assume a normal sequential increase of 5 to 6%, reduced by the 3 to 4% for the extra week, then adding 2% for TANDBERG, we arrive at approximately a 3 to 5% increase on a sequential basis for Q4 FY'10. On a year-over-year basis, this equates to 25 to 28% guidance for Q4 FY'10.</p>
          <p>At this point, let me remind you in light of Regulation FD, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. Let me now give you some additional details on the Q4 financial guidance.</p>
          <p>As we have said in the past, forecasting gross margins have always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, variable component costs, customer and channel mix and competitive pricing pressure. That being said, we believe total gross margin in Q4 will be approximately 64 to 65% reflecting the revenue guidance I just shared with you.</p>
          <p>With recent acquisitions and our entry into some lower margin markets, gross margin could be negativity impacted by product mix. There will be times when we will be at the high end of this range, but we'd encourage you to be conservative in your short and long-term modeling. We believe Q4 operating expenses will be approximately 36.5% to 37% of revenue.</p>
          <p>We expect interest and other income to be approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter. Our tax provision rate for Q4 is expected to be approximately 21%. We are modeling share count to be down approximately 10 million shares quarter-over-quarter in weighted average shares outstanding for EPS purposes. In this estimate of share count, we are not taking into consideration any further change in stock price that could occur in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 10. While we expect to continue our share repurchase program, it is difficult to predict the exact weighted average shares outstanding. As a point of reference, a $1 movement in our average stock price would change the calculated shares outstanding for purposes of determining earnings per share by approximately 17 million.</p>
          <p>While we are extremely pleased with our TANDBERG acquisition and our customer buy-in to our collaboration strategy, going forward in the near term, we expect the impact of TANDBERG to be slightly dilutive to our non-GAAP EPS by slightly less than $0.01 per share on a quarterly basis.</p>
          <p>Regarding cash flow from operations, we would expect to generate 2 billion to 2.5 billion during the fourth quarter. For our Q4 FY '09 GAAP earnings we anticipate that GAAP EPS will be $0.06 to $0.09 per share lower than our non-GAAP EPS, primarily due to stock compensation expense and acquisition-related charges. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more details.</p>
          <p>Other than those items noted above, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or other events, which may or may not be significant.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call back to you, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Frank. The following is a summary of my views of Cisco's momentum and opportunities entering Q4 o fiscal year 2010. As we discussed in some detail during the call, it has really been a pleasure watching the steady evolution of business momentum improving for Cisco over the last year.</p>
          <p>Our early optimism about the economic downturn over a year ago in the January and February and March period of 2009 turned out to be very accurate. We have continued to see the momentum improve each quarter, and the results of this quarter were truly outstanding although helped by an extra week as discussed earlier. Our long-term comfort level with our goal of 12 to 17% year-over-year growth with all the appropriate caveats appears to be even more likely, and our current guidance for Q4 year-over-year growth in the 25 to 28% is obviously well above our long-term goal of 12 to 17%.</p>
          <p>Our balance of innovation, as illustrated from almost a complete product refresh cycle across every major product family as well as our technology architecture really coming to light, and most of our customers understanding, is achieving the desired results. While it's still early in the business architecture innovation with our leading edge customers, we are also achieving and often over-achieving the desired results in both the customer business partnerships as well as our revenue growth and market share objectives.</p>
          <p>Our new innovative dynamic network organization structure, consisting of counsels, boards and working groups are clearly getting the results as indicated in proof points from Q2 and Q3. And we are starting to see our customers are having interactive discussions with us regarding how they can move their organization model to this new dynamic structure. The key enabler of this organization structure and supporting business models is the intelligent network, delivering both the communications and IT capabilities of a company. At the forefront of these market transitions is video, data center virtualization and collaboration. In terms of the new emerging technologies that are enabling the desired government and business results for the future.</p>
          <p>So in summary, while there are always challenges in front of us from the economy, job creation, competition, supply chain and regulatory environment and many other factors, that could be a surprise to us versus our expectations and guidance, we are, in my opinion, the best positioned we've ever been to achieve our long-term goals and aspirations. We will continue to attempt to be as transparent in terms of our views of the economic challenges, especially in Europe, as well as other challenges that we discussed on this and prior calls. And as we said many times before, it would not be a dramatic surprise to see our results differ in a given quarter, either below or above our guidance.</p>
          <p>Balance this quarter as evidenced from a country, theater, product family, customer segment and market adjacencies perspective was probably the best we've seen in recent history and definitely the best given our rapidly expanding role into 30 plus market adjacencies. As you would expect given our productivity increases and the success in our innovation from both a product and a business perspective, we are going to expand our sales, engineering and other resources, especially in these new market adjacencies. As we continue to aggressively invest, we will also continue to maintain our focus on the financial models. Once again with our usual caveats as discussed earlier in our financial reports, our Q4 guidance is for year-over-year revenue to increase in the 25 to 28% range.</p>
          <p>I want to thank the entire Cisco family for working together as a team to ensure that our company is in a solid position to not only weather the challenging economic environment, but even more importantly, to be ready to continue to accelerate our investments assuming the current trends hold. I know it has not been easy and we are all working hard to maintain our culture of innovation, trust, stretch mentality and giving back, all during a tough period of time for ourselves, our family and our friends. While we expect a continued recovery throughout the entire year, and we clearly gave a very aggressive forecast for Q4, it is important that expectations do not get ahead of market realities, especially until we see job creation.</p>
          <p>It would not be a big surprise to us to see economic growth and markets bounce up and down over the next 12 months, and we strongly urge our investors not to dramatically change their models beyond Q4 guidance just given. We will continue to share with you what we are seeing in the market and our own expectations for our business as transparently as we can. As always, I want to thank our shareholders, customers, employees and partners for their support and continued confidence in our ability to execute during rapid industry consolidation, market transitions and challenging economic times.</p>
          <p>Laura, let me now turn it over to you for the Q&amp;A session.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. And before we do that, John, just real quickly, I want to confirm that our GAAP EPS will be between $0.07 to $0.09 per share lower than non-GAAP EPS. I think, Frank, you were talking a little fast and you said 6 to 9. It's actually...</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Laura. Thank you. My first question is about the sequential growth rate. I was wondering if you could help us understand a little bit how much this, the declining lead time is contributing to you? Is that helpful in your outlook for the July quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the declining lead times mean that people won't be ordering as far out ahead as they normally do. And we clearly were also giving a little bit of indication that when you compare order growth rates for Q4 this coming quarter to order growth rates of a year ago, order growth of a year ago, Rob, was very, very strong. I think we said in double digits in the call. And book-to-bill was comfortably above 1. So in terms of the sequential growth, I think you're now seeing it come back into normal lines. I don't think it makes a big difference in terms of sequential growth Q3 to Q4 in terms of numbers. Do you Frank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't. Again, we've seen improvement in lead times coming into this quarter, Q3, and we're saying that we'll continue to see lead times improve as we go through Q4 as well. And what we expect to do by the end of Q4 is seeing our lead times actually recover to normal for most of our products.</p>

          <p>Wondering, Frank, when you went through the detailed math of how to compute sequential growth, how you got to the conclusion that the extra week added 3 to 4% to your overall growth, or that that should be put in as a correction factor?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Jeff, one of the things we mentioned this last quarter as well going into Q3, it's always difficult to actually determine exactly how much the extra week is worth. We also went back 5 or 6 years ago when we had it as well. But what we've done throughout the quarter and after the quarter closed is we've done &#x2013; we performed significant amount of analysis both on our order side as well as on our revenue side. And based on looking at some of the trends we saw throughout the quarter, we feel fairly comfortable with the estimate that I've provided. Whether you look at it from a year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter. It's about &#x2013; it ranges from like 3 to $400 million. So on average, about 350 million in the quarter for the extra week. And looking at it, again, several different ways, we feel comfortable that, that was what the extra week was worth. So whenever you're doing any compares, it's important to kind of remove that to get to a normal sequential trend from a Q3 to Q4 perspective. And that's what we try to do in providing that guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a question about the revenue. So my question is about Advanced Technologies. When you look at this quarter and last quarter sequentially, Advanced Technologies are slowing down from 12% to 5% to 2%. And then you see growth, the stronger growth is coming from "the legacy part," the switches and routers where you have product refresh. So the question is, just how much of the growth you're seeing is coming because you're refreshing your products? And second is, what is happening on the Advanced Technologies side? Why don't we see a stronger growth? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to kind of repeat the numbers. I think in fairness, a number of you challenged us saying, how are you doing on your core Routing and Switching technology a year ago and saying are you getting too much growth from Advanced Technologies? And in this quarter where we clearly re-invented ourselves and core Routing and Switching grew 23% and 40% respectively, now the question is, are Advanced Technologies not growing as fast? Fair question.</p>
          <p>Advanced Technologies grew at 18%, our core 1 group of Advanced Technologies if I remember right, grew at about 22%. And the Advanced Technologies last quarter were, I think, plus or minus 1%. So I'm actually pretty comfortable with where we are in those. Some of them such as the areas of Unified Communications and we used the example of phones to give you some real, real positive updates, were good. You saw Wireless picking up momentum again with the next generation of Wireless within it. And I'd say 18% was pretty solid in that.</p>
          <p>I think the key takeaway, and I was teasing Frank earlier, whenever we have a question if it's about traditional products, say 20 to 40% growth, or additional customer segment, say 20 to 40. And if it's about new product introductions, say 200 to 500% either sequentially or year-over-year. So I was actually very comfortable with the mix. You will see big orders swing that. But I think 18% up from 1% a quarter ago is pretty good numbers on that. And the momentum's going in the right way. Rob, I don't want to make any comments but you, when you really think about our sales force, they're across so many product areas now and such a broad base. I think when you see an 18% number in that category, that isn't bad.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, John. Hi. If we net out the TANDBERG and we look at it just from a year-over-year point of view, it seems to imply some deceleration closer to 23 to 25%. Is there something brewing in Europe which is giving you some pause in your conservatism for July? And it seems you mentioned seasonality more on this call, implying a return to steady state. Does that mean that in the October quarter we kind of get back to more seasonality and down sequentially which is often seasonally the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a series of questions, Mark. So let me take a crack at the overall concept. Our long-term growth projections are 12 to 17%. Q4 last year was a &#x2013; the first solid quarter we had in terms of these sequential numbers. It was up comfortably, book-to-bill comfortably above 1. Bookings were growing, if I remember the numbers, almost 10 points faster than revenues sequentially within that. And so it's beginning to get more of a normal Q4 to compare it to. So it isn't all the way back to a normal run rate but it was a lot different than Q3, which is very easy year-over-year comps when things were flat and only the enterprise customers had started to turn up.</p>
          <p>So actually if we're in the 20s in the markets versus a reasonable Q4 of a year ago sequentially much less than the mid-20s taking out that 2% for TANDBERG, that's pretty good numbers. So I'm very comfortable with that positioning on it. I don't think it indicates a deceleration at all. I think the numbers were very easy comps, just like many of our peers will see for the next couple quarters.</p>
          <p>We turned probably a couple quarters earlier than our peers did. We signaled that to the market and we're very pleased with growth now in the mid-20s off of a Q4 that was clearly a tipping point on the upside. Not a continued real easy year-over-year comparison.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And for what he's asking you on seasonality then going into Q1, we're going to wait and talk about that next quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can talk about that, but I've watched how that, the momentum plays out a little bit. To answer your indirect question, normal seasonality should apply. But the real issue is, what are the growth rates long term? What are the directions? We just don't want our shareholders getting ahead and people questioned us just 2 quarters ago, could we grow 12%. And now all of a sudden we're coming into the mid-20s and people saying is there a deceleration occurring? Of course not. There's not a deceleration occurring. The momentum feels good on a global basis. The year-over-year numbers versus an upturn. Remember the next 3 to 4 quarters are all now starting to compare against reasonably good sequential growth from years before. That's how I'd answer it, Mark. And I know you are setting me up because there are a lot of questions from some of your peers that may not grasp that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you're not worried about Europe, John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Europe, if you're watching our projections, Mark, it grew 30% this quarter. And if you look at the countries, the balance was really good. The UK at 28%. France at 27%. Germany, if I remember, at 12%. The Netherlands was in the 20s, etcetera. Southern Europe's soft, so you'd expect that out of Italy, Spain perhaps, etcetera. But it looked reasonably good. If there was a segment of our business that we would probably model at a little bit slower growth rate than the other 4 large theaters it would probably be Europe. But their forecast is comfortably in double digits for next quarter with all the appropriate caveats. Whether that's in that 20% range or the 10% range, time will tell. Europe's about 22% of our business, if I'm remembering right, to kind of give you the data points off that.</p>
          <p>To answer the indirect question, have we seen that issue spread globally other than business awareness? No, we've not. The momentum feels pretty good on a global basis. I'd agree with our optimistic comments of some of our peers of the last week, that technology spending is clearly on fire and going in the right direction. And again, repeating a common theme. It doesn't get much better than this Q3 and if we'd told you a year ago that Q4 we'd be talking about year-over-year growth rates in the mid-20s, I think most of you would have said we were missing the direction. And yet that is what's occurred.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Had a, just a clarification, Frank, and a question for you, John. On the clarification, Frank, you haven't mentioned the year-over-year growth rates in Home Networking, if you can provide that?</p>
          <p>And John, I wanted to tie in Tal's question with margins. If you look at a change in mix, if I remember correctly, Switching and Routers are your higher margin products, whereas Advanced Technologies is typically below the average. And so with this change in mix, more in favor to theoretically your higher margin products, just given the growth rates here, we're still seeing a quite decline here in gross margins. And so if you could provide a little bit more color as to where are you seeing the compression in the gross margin in your businesses? A little bit more granular, that would be appreciated. Is it really coming from your core Switching, Routing business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So breaking the question into a detail point. Our Home Networking group, now remember, the reason we still report this as separate area so you can compare apples-to-apples. If we talked about Consumer, the total Consumer business was up over, I think, 55% year-over-year. So our total Consumer business is, including this, is up 55%. The Home Networking group as we used to define it as a standalone category, was down about 8%, and then came in about $210 million in terms of revenue for the quarter. So you can see what the current base is and the current balance.</p>
          <p>In terms of the margins, I think this is just normal pressure. To answer your question, I think it's just normal mix that goes slightly up and down. We encouraged people, when the margins were in the 65 to 66% range which they still are, not to get overly optimistic about that. We think 64 to 65 is right. And there might be times where we dip below the 64. But we think day in and day out the margins are in the product range that we expect, and we want people to encourage you to model in that 64 to 65% range.</p>
          <p>There's nothing unusual going on from competition. There's no more major price competition than we traditionally have seen. I think it's more of a mix issue that tweaks up and down, but to be able to break it by individual products would be mathematically almost impossible to balance up and down. There's so many different moving balls on it. But to answer your overall question, there's nothing unusual going on other than just normal mix that might tweak up or down.</p>
          <p>So again reminding everyone, when it's above 65 don't get overly excited. When it's below 64, don't get overly pessimistic, 64 to 65 is where I encourage you to model. We don't see anything at this time unless we do unbelievably good in some of the low-margin products, better than we're forecasting, that would change that in the short run. Does that answer your question okay?</p>
          <p>Okay. I assume silence means okay or the operator didn't get you back in. I apologize. Next question?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of questions. One for John and then one for Frank. John, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about government exposure in Europe? And if you can give us any idea how much revenues is coming in from the Government sector, that would be helpful over there.</p>
          <p>And also in Europe, if you could talk about, and I think this is probably too short a timeframe, but if you could talk about the last couple of weeks, the debt crisis really has only come to the forefront then, whether you've had discussions with business managers or others that might suggest that there's more caution over there? So those are my two questions for you.</p>
          <p>And then for Frank, could you quantify for us what the balance sheet impacts of the TANDBERG inclusion in the quarter were, particularly on inventory, but it would be nice to know what the working capital impacts were just so we can go and back out what the underlying movements in working capital look like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rod, I think to keep things moving I'm going to ask John to address the European questions, and then we'll take the others with you offline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if we have time at the end to bring it back, we will. We're going to try to hold it to one question. So is the European and what we're hearing the one you would like for us to do?</p>
          <p>Operator, you've got to leave them open to let them come back to me if that would be okay.</p>
          <p>So the European markets were up 30%, as we said before, breaking by category I'll just give them to you. The Enterprise was 19%, Public sector was 26% growth year-over-year, the Service Provider was 32%, Commercial was 54% and Consumer was 24. So when we teased, the answer is 20 to 40% in most categories it is pretty accurate. It was remarkable balance across every theater in terms of the customer segments, the key products, the country growth, etcetera.</p>
          <p>In terms of nervousness, I think it had everybody's attention in Europe, but we have not seen, Rob, I think anything unusual from our teams and actually they're forecasting a reasonably good Q4 from the European side with the appropriate caveats. If there's one theater we're watching, we watch that one carefully, but I haven't seen anything that makes us abnormally concerned at this time.</p>
          <p>In fact, when we polled our top, I think it was 1,800 partners the other day in a meeting, we said how many of you anticipate the second half of the year being better year-over-year growth than the first half? It was all but maybe 1 or 2% raised their hand. So optimism is pretty good around the world. I think there will always be a couple challenges as we now see in Europe. I think we're cautiously optimistic they'll work through that. If we get surprised, we'll adjust but at the present time we're not seeing anything that makes us abnormally nervous.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So it's in that range. It's not an abnormally big or abnormally small. It's right in the middle of the other groups. Enterprise is very strong and our other groups &#x2013; let me see if I can do the math here real quickly. I think you're close to it being about 15 to 17% of our business in Europe.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you so much. Just wanted to clarify first if the incremental 2 to 3,000 in head count additions was on top of the 1,000 you just added this quarter? Or including that?</p>
          <p>And then the question I wanted to ask you is in terms of the recent debate that has kind of reemerged on net neutrality, can you give us a sense, John, for any change in tone of your discussions with the major service provider customers in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So the increase in head count from acquisitions was about 1,700 people. The net incremental increase in new hires that were truly incremental was 1,000. So 1,000 of the 2 to 3,000, and we're clearly indicating a trend here to accelerate that hiring position, especially in sales and especially in new market adjacencies.</p>
          <p>In terms of the change on the net neutrality issue, I think you are seeing a concern from many groups about are we going to be one of the first countries to regulate the Internet and to begin to determine what services etcetera can run over it. So I think this will be a pretty active discussion point going back and forth between organizations, regulatory groups and in the business community. I think there will probably be a pretty healthy give and take.</p>
          <p>I think the objectives people are trying to achieve aren't necessarily bad at all, but I think all of us have concern with regulating the Internet and the dangers that go along with that. And a difficulty for us to say as a country in the U.S. what we believe in open standards and not regulating the Internet and openness, while we would do it when we're strongly encouraging other countries not to do so. So I think the discussion is just beginning. I hope we'll find a way to go back and forth between all the interested parties to achieve the benefits and not the negatives that could go with this.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much, guys. Actually I had a clarification, a comment and a question.</p>
          <p>First the clarification. Frank, you mentioned that several times in your narrative about higher discounts in various areas. Can you give &#x2013; is that &#x2013; were those higher than normal? Is that why you mentioned them? Or because there are always discounts, I'm wondering. Is that in certain areas and just more detail about the higher discounts and how it impacted you?</p>
          <p>My comment is that when you mentioned 4 to 5% on the 14th week on a year-over-year basis in 3 to 4, I'm guessing you mean that's the actual 14th week. My guess is that in most quarters you're back-end loaded so that in the final week, whether that had been the 14th week, the 15th week, the 12th week or a 7-week quarter, you would have a disproportionately high amount of your revenue in that week. So I would imagine that you're actually hurting yourself a little bit by saying it's 4 to 5% if that's actually the way you're calculating it because by the very nature of it being the last week it is higher than it otherwise normally would have been.</p>
          <p>So I'm wondering if it actually maybe didn't &#x2013; the 14th week by itself maybe isn't that high. And that's just a comment just to throw out there.</p>
          <p>And then finally the numbers, it was terrific that you gave those numbers specifically on the products, like the Nexus 7000 and the ASR 9000 and the growth rates and the run rates are terrific. But given that they are somewhat sort of next generation types of devices on your Catalyst 6500 and your 7600 router, do you have any sense as to what the combination of let's say your Nexus 7000 and CAT6K and your combination of the ASR 9000 and your 7600. How are those doing as a grouped category?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Ehud, that's an awful lot of questions. Far more than I let Rod get away with. So Frank, why don't you &#x2013; I'm playing favorites &#x2013; discounts and then the week, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So when we look at margins as we talked about in prior quarters, the factors that drive margin variability have to do with the volume, the mix, the costs and then also the price, which is discounting and rebates. So what I highlighted from a product perspective is really just looking at some of the major drivers, not to identify that it was a significant amount but just the main drivers in the quarter were discounts and rebates with benefits offsetting that was driven by the higher volume and cost savings. So nothing significantly unusual. It's just some of the drivers of that, that comes into play from the product side.</p>
          <p>On the services side, primarily related to the mix between our Advisory Services, Technical Services and also the extra week does have an impact with higher costs there. So those are just some of the factors that we constantly look at, as John said before, that impact our margins. So nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of mix on the products, we gave an unusual amount of detail, which we won't repeat in future calls once we have a &#x2013; more growth because the start-ups are tremendously powerful here in terms of how quick acceptance occurs. This is about as good as you do with a next-generation product in a single category, but to do it across every product category from the 7000 Nexus to the 5000 to the 2000, from the ASR to the 9000 to the 5000 to the 1000, to be able to do it with UCS etcetera, it was across the board very rapid increases.</p>
          <p>So the best way to arrive at the number that you asked is that if you have Switching growing at 40% and it's about 35% of our total products, total business, and you have Routing growing at 23% and it's about 16, 17% of our total business, you can kind of back into the numbers. But overall the numbers were very solid no matter how you get them, market share gains, normal transitions, good mix, etcetera. It doesn't get any better on product transitions than what's going on now is the answer I would come away with on that.</p>

          <p>We want to watch our time. Frank, on the week.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I quickly wanted to come back because I want to make sure that there's a correction there on the extra week. The extra week does not necessarily mean that, that was the 14th week. I just wanted to clarify that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So it was not the last week of any quarter. The last week of any quarter is very high in bookings and revenue shipments as you would expect. It wasn't the first week either. So I would model it in the middle. We had a lot of give and take. This is an art on the number, and you can do the math. You can come up with a number of 300, 400, 500, or 600. We believe the numbers that Frank shared are the most likely on that. Each of you can make your twist, but it is a, I would consider it a week in the middle and it's a tough number to anticipate. Because when I asked around the room how many people were here when they did this five years ago, other than myself, no one in the room had been through it before. So it's our best estimate. If you're a little bit more optimistic, you could adjust appropriately. If you're a little bit more pessimistic on one of those, you can adjust the others. It's probably right in the middle if I were guessing. Next question, please.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Nikos Theodosopoulos with UBS. Your line is open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. My question is on the lead times. Can you talk about which products are currently the ones that you still want to bring the lead times down in the fourth quarter? And at the end of the fourth quarter once that's accomplished, would you expect your purchase commitments to start declining, or do you think there would still be reasons for it to grow? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We're probably not going to go by individual product areas. It varies because one time it can be as simple as some IPM materials, the next time it's power switch and next time it's an ASICs one. I think in terms of starting to discuss individual lead time product areas, would probably just start down something I don't want to start during the conference call, but I want to try to answer your question.</p>
          <p>We made progress in almost all areas last quarter and then again this quarter on lead times. There will always be two or three product areas that either we mis-forecast or there's a problem with one supplier. As long as it's two to three we're fine on that, but we do need to bring them down a little bit tighter in terms of total by another one to two weeks. And there are a couple product areas that are currently running at the high end of that in terms of the categories, but breaking it down individually on it I think would be probably something I don't want to start down the path on. So let me give you one more question, Nikos, in terms of asking so that I can answer one for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I mean, maybe we can just stick on this topic. I mean, assuming you accomplish the lead time reduction, what do you think happens to purchase commitments? Because they've been going up quite rapidly. Should we see them start to grow with revenues or start declining post the July quarter? I'm just trying to understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Very fair question. What you're going to see is we think supply will be tight for the entire year, and we will assume that it will be tight. What I've asked Frank to do and Randy and Angel to do is to make whatever commitments we need to, to meet our customer delivery dates. So I'd expect us to continue to make commitments in terms of being sure we get the components in and stretching out over a period of time.</p>
          <p>So I'm really asking us to model not just for the next quarter but looking out 2, 3, 4, or 5 quarters and take the issues of supply constraints out of our dynamics on it. It's a relatively inexpensive insurance policy to be doing that and I think the way that we're handling it is right. So I'd look for us to continue to make commitments throughout the year, and I think that's required candidly that we think the supply agenda will be tight throughout the entire calendar year and maybe well into next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>John, when you, you talked a little bit about the order trends by enterprise and service provider. But could you talk a little bit about some of your discussions when you travel around the world, you talk to enterprise customers, you talk to service provider customers. What are the trends there? And what are the important topics on their mind right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Almost without exception, in this &#x2013; what a difference a year a makes. A year ago I think we were one of the 2 optimists in Davos, or a year and a half ago and I couldn't find the other one. And when you talked to the business leaders, it was &#x2013; the majority of them were very concerned.</p>
          <p>I'd say now almost without exception, most people are beginning to slowly turn cautiously optimistic. They're very hesitant about adding head count, especially in the U.S. However, almost all of them have squeezed their expense levels down, have tightened things, probably cutting into muscle at times. And so they're looking as they want to grow new revenues, move into new markets by driving productivity and technology.</p>
          <p>It's a nice way of saying that I think you're going to see the optimism in the technology industry continue throughout the next year, and that most of our customers we talk to are now getting very much involved with how they drive productivity, how they move into new markets ,etcetera, as opposed to focused on cutting expenses. I guess the best example was in our partner community, the 1,800, I took that survey up in front of everybody else, represents every country in the world imaginable, every size account, etcetera. And they were 98 or 99% very optimistic about the second half of the calendar year in terms of the questions asked.</p>
          <p>I was in India just a short time ago, uniform across the board, they feel very good about growth in the 8 to 10%. It was just a short time ago people were worried about China not growing as well. And all of a sudden we're worried about them growing too fast. Barring a surprise, the Chinese leadership are very good. They'll manage through that as well.</p>
          <p>So I think what you see is optimism building on a global basis. It won't be as big a bounce back as you normally see off of this deep of an economic downturn, which would normally be probably 7 to 9% growth in GDP. In fact, most people are a lot more optimistic than just a year ago. And I have very few pessimist customers at this time, almost regardless of country. I think everybody's a little bit gun shy, not wanting to stick their neck out or careful when they see a concern that it might have a domino effect. But right now it's dramatic change in terms of what we're seeing from almost every customer in the world.</p>

          <p>All right. So John, I know you kind of touched on it but if you could give us some more insight on linearity, just a clarification. From what you said, I trust components do not impact EPS during the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Components did not impact &#x2013; have an impact on UCS, no.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, earnings per share. Did we make some of the shipments we could have made in the quarter because of long lead times? Absolutely. We didn't make some of the shipments. And in 2 tier and small business the products were either on the shelf or not.  Was it a major impact in the quarter?  No. Did it have some impact in the quarter in terms of either getting orders that could have shipped in this quarter, could have been on earlier lead times into the quarter? It had some impact from that perspective.</p>
          <p>First part of the question, Paul?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Linearity. Again, it's hard when you take that 5% out. I mean the extra week out. If you move the week out of the middle of the quarter, linearity was relatively versus what we'd expect, it was clearly loaded more in the second month of the quarter since that's where we put the extra week versus normal times. But people, Rob, are back on forecast cash very accurate. Congratulations to you and your team. And they were pretty accurate the whole quarter. So I feel much better about having a good feel for where our business is and the momentum. And again, it was remarkably well balanced with almost all geographies except maybe Japan and Italy, Spain, Portugal, all geographies doing pretty well.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>John, just to be clear, putting aside the extra week, if we looked at your last 4 weeks of the quarter, just from a sequential standpoint, is it what you would have expected in terms of ongoing strength?</p>

          <p>Hi, Jason.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Historical seasonality has been up 5 to 6% in your Q4. I think I got that right. Now you're guiding 3 to 5% for this fourth quarter. So does this imply there was catch-up spending in Q3 which makes the comparison a bit tougher, and therefore you're guiding a little bit lower than in historical seasonality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're reading too much into that. We are very, very comfortable with Q4. And this is why I really &#x2013; we made the statement beginning 3 quarters ago. We strongly encourage you to go back to year-over-year numbers because the quarterly numbers can vary by a big deals. They can vary by shipments, etcetera. This is why we said, beginning two conference calls ago, we would be switching back to year-over-year being the numbers, we strongly encourage you to focus in on.</p>
          <p>You can tell just by the questions on what did the extra week bring you or not bring you in this, the effect of TANDBERG in or not and so I would strongly encourage our shareholders to look at the year-over-year growth numbers as being the proper indicator, to really watch the run rates on. And as lead times come back tighter, customers won't be ordering as far out, so you will see a natural contraction in terms of the bookings that go with that. And repeating the same theme, Q4 of last year was the tipping point on the upside, and you had a very good booking sequential quarter that we're comparing it against in terms of numbers for the next time period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what &#x2013; one way to look at it then maybe would be if you guided 3 to 5% and you're able to show some exceeding of those expectations, it could be up sort of normal historical seasonality if you're able to exceed that 3 to 5%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're reading in too much for an extra point. The number I really think we ought to focus on, I'm going to be focusing on myself, this is how I run the business, is what's the year-over-year number? The year-over-year number is amazingly strong. It is almost &#x2013; well, it is &#x2013; it's 10 points higher than what we project our long-term growth to be off of not an easy comparable from a year ago. Our easy comparables were Q3, Q2, Q1. Now we're getting into the comparables that had good sequential growth and good numbers, and yet we're forecasting growth, even taking out TANDBERG, at a very high level.</p>
          <p>So my own point of view, I would not add in a lot of plus or minus, a point or 2 sequential growth being a major single. It is absolutely the reverse of that. Watch year-over-year numbers. That's where the real trends are. I don't think there's anybody in this group that wouldn't be extremely excited if we, over the next 3 to 5 years are at the high end of the 12 to 17% range. And yet we're talking almost 10 points above the midpoint there. So that's what I'd encourage you to focus on. If I'm missing something here, come back at us over time through Laura or myself. We want to listen.</p>
          <p>But the key signal is the market is extremely strong. We see very good trends. We're doing well in almost every product area, every geography, every customer segment. The innovation engine is on fire. We are transitioning from product line to product line, at a smoother pace when you're only doing one of these. Yet we're doing a dozen of them at the same time, and yet almost all of them are hitting, and still getting reasonably good balance even in areas like we addressed with Advanced Technologies which is a fair question, did you take your eye off the ball a little bit on that? Maybe, but it was 18% growth. That is unbelievably solid.</p>
          <p>Our views haven't changed. We do not have a problem with growth opportunities. It's about execution. Our long term vision and strategy is playing out exactly as we expected. Our game plan for economic downturns is right on the money and hitting on all cylinders and we're gaining market share in every product area. I don't think it gets much better than that. Again, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I appreciate the healthy give and take and look forward to some of the follow-up conversations. Laura?</p>
