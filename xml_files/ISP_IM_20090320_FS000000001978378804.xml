          <p>Welcome. Welcome to all of you and thank you very much for joining us today. I will just introduce the presentation with a few words on the way we are managing our Bank through the crisis and on the way we hope we will have our Bank emerging from this crisis even stronger than it is today. First point, we are bringing to you an almost &#x20AC;4 billion worth of results before impairment. It's in our opinion a good evidence of the resilience of our business model of our business system. It's a business model you know very well. It's focused on retail in especially one country, our country Italy. Three-fourth of our revenues come from this market. We believe this market has still a lot of attractiveness, a lot of opportunities to be exploited and we have the leading position, the coverage of the market that will put us in the position to exploit such opportunities.</p>
          <p>So the first point was the four billion in terms of pre-impairment net income. Impairment policy, we have decided to be very prudent, we have decided to do all the impossible impairments because we believe that this is the right way to manage a situation like the one we are presently living. There is an idiom in &#x2013; a way to say in Italian and that &#x2013; and what we have done is we have put some extra hay in the barn because we do not know how long it will last the winter. So it is a way to translate what we say in Italian, but that was exactly what we had in mind in preparing our 2008 accounts.</p>
          <p>Two &#x2013; a couple of real strength of our Bank. First one is the liquidity position. We believe liquidity is a key factor for success, will remain a key factor for success. We have decided to create a very strong position. As you know, as you probably saw in the presentation, we are amongst the very few banks with a net interbank balance. We have created it during the last 18 months and we are defending it. At the same time, we have accumulated on the side about more than 50 billion worth of eligible assets. We want to be the liquid bank. We don't want to have any surprise. We want to be able to meet the commitment and the engagements we have taken and liquidity will be one of our key competitive strengths.</p>
          <p>Second has to do with capital ratios. After the decision we have taken about the Tremonti Bonds and I will elaborate on that point. We are in a very strong, definitely strong position from the capital ratios point of view. Actually, from the point of view of, in my opinion, the most important ratio in terms of capital ratios, we are the best in Europe. And the capital ratios I have in mind is the ratio between tangible equity and tangible asset. At the end what really matters is tangible equity and what really matters is tangible assets. If you make debt ratio and you compare Intesa Sanpaolo with any of its peers you see our Bank is well placed, number one and will remain number one.</p>
          <p>So why the Tremonti Bonds, why the four billion? Because we believe it's safe and it is wise to have a short-term insurance policy in a situation like this one. I think that the terms and conditions at which this capital facility, this equity facility is now being offered to all the Italian banks is fair, is good, is a set of good terms and conditions. It's flexible because we can give it back any time we want and in the first four years it will be without any premium any penalty in terms of the repayment &#x2013; in terms of repayment and there is no dilution in terms of out &#x2013; the number of shares for our shareholders. So we believe that it was the right thing to do in a situation like this one and that we as you will see from the presentation we want to give it back as soon as possible, but since the winter I mentioned before will last for a period we do not know, it's a &#x2013; it was a wise decision to buy this sort of insurance policy in favor of our banks &#x2013; of our Bank, of our shareholders and of our customers.</p>
          <p>Two areas of known concern, the first one has to do with the provision policy on our lending activity. We have been very careful, we have been very prudent and the figures coming from this year 2000 and year the first figures of this year are the evidence of it. We have made a very strong provision at the end of last year and in fact in the first two months of 2009 the flow of the new doubtful loans, of new substandard loans is for the time being significantly lower than what it used to be at the end of last year. That doesn't mean anything because it's only two months and that we expect in 2009 to have higher provisions obviously than in 2008, but I wanted to just convey the massage that we have tried to be as prudent as possible also in that respect.</p>
          <p>The second area of known concern is our presence in Central-Eastern Europe. It's a strong network. It's a network of 10 banks, very well placed, very well managed and it contributes to our results and there are over 10% and in terms of assets is in the round of 7% of our assets. But 7% subdivided into 10 countries gives you the reason why we are not at all worried. We are not at all worried because we believe in those banks and we believe in the way they are managed. But in any case, there is no single case that can create any sort of concern to the overall stability and strength of our Group.</p>
          <p>2009. 2009 will be as you say, as people say, very challenging, I confirm it. We try to get as ready as possible for this challenge and the accounts and the way we have made 2008 accounts is in line with this expectation. We expect solid, strong, say solid profits for next year, and we are hopeful we will be able to get back to dividend payment and have just one year of interruption in our dividend payment.</p>
          <p>We are quite hopeful. We are quite sure about what I'm saying because as far as the interest margin is concerned, we are managing this environment on the asset side with a very strict and strong spread defense activity. On the deposit side, we have then in advance, a number of good choices in terms of hedging, to this hedging part of our structural deposit base. So that will help us to have a decrease in interest margin next year because it's unavoidable but reasonably low one.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost, we will have another minus year. We will have another strong performance in terms of cost reduction. As far as provision, I already mentioned what we have done in like last quarter. And maybe I can spend one word on trading profit. Trading profit reached their peak last year especially in the fourth quarter because we have decided to make a lot of provision there too, and that we have already taken into account the volatility of the first quarter 2009 in defining the evaluations on our trading portfolio at the end of 2008. And this decision will certainly make the performance of our trading line easier next year.</p>
          <p>Last point is about the overall reaction of our Bank. And let me tell you that it's a real pleasure, it's an honor, it's a real pleasure to be with the team of people I have around me. The kind of reaction I see throughout the organization is quite effective. The cohesiveness, not only the quality of the people that are managing the Bank is superb and that's the main reason why we see, we look at the future with an high level of optimism. At the same time, as you know we have introduced some further simplification and some further strengthening of our Banca dei Territori, the retail network organization. These changes have been very well received by our people, and completing the first tour around Italy, because I wanted to meet all the 8,000 middle managers we have in the field, and I really got the impression that we have taken a number of right decisions to make their job easier and more effective.</p>
          <p>Last point, investments. We never stopped our investments. All the investments provided for in the business plan have been completed. 2008 has the full amount of investments, innovation, human capital, long-term kind of investments. 2009 will have another important portion of investments because we want &#x2013; we tend to manage with a long-term view and that will not change only because of the strong but at the end contingent crisis we are living throughout the world.</p>
          <p>So these were the main points. Now we will go through the presentation and I will go quite rapidly through the pages because they are more than the needed to give you the impression of the way we are managing the company. And then we will have all the time that is needed for the questions.</p>
          <p>These are the main points I mentioned before. The core profitability of the Bank, we will see those figure more in detail. The strength of the domestic retail market and why we believe in our domestic markets. The liquidity profile that is one &#x2013; probably the strongest strength of the Group, the risk profile, very low leverage, that's another important point. Almost best-in-class also from the leverage point of view and certainly adequate capital strength.</p>
          <p>3.9 billion adjusted net income in fiscal year 2008. When we say adjusted, we mean for non-recurring items and bulk of these non-recurrent items are the impairments we've done on intangibles, on goodwill, on participations. 3.1 billion worth of impairment of equity investments goodwill and other intangibles only partially offset by 1.6 billion goodwill. So there are some extraordinary good news that partially compensate for the negative extraordinary items, but the net effect of the 3.1 and the 1.6 is net 1.5 billion, that flows entirely into the fourth quarter and brings the fourth quarter to minus 1.2 but that's all accounting, that's impairment. In fact, the tangible net equity during the last quarter has increased by 200 million. So that's the evidence of the fact that we are not talking of about, let me use the word real losses, but accounting losses. So the bottom line as stated is 2.5, and also the bottom line of the fourth quarter if we adjust it for the non-recurrent items is more than 350 million.</p>
          <p>Our business model, mainly concentrated in retail in Italy, very important role played by our International Subsidiary Division, we will talk about it and by our Corporate and Investment Banking Division that is area of asset of the Group. This is only to remember that on this market at this point we have &#x2013; this market, I mean the Italian retail market in a real strong position. And when you build a leading position, you benefit from it from a structural point of view. And this leading position is getting stronger and stronger year after year.</p>
          <p>Liquidity profile, excellent. Direct customer deposits higher than loans to customer, here is the reason why we feel comfortable. But even more than that these three evidences, first, one of the few banks with a positive balance on the interbank market. You might remember that we have built it quarter-after-quarter in the last five quarters.</p>
          <p>Second, a very strong amount &#x2013; a very large amount of eligible assets with Central Banks, 56 billion. Obviously these two decisions have a cost, you find part of this cost on the interest income because if you want to have a positive position here, you don't leverage on that kind of activity. If you want to have a portfolio of reserve assets, then you pay some cost of it but it's well within what we can afford.</p>
          <p>This is another very important point. Funding needs, long-term funding needs for 2009, if you compare this figure with what we have placed as a retail network during 2008, you see that we can do by ourselves the old job. Even if the interbank market, even if the international cash funding market becomes unavailable, we can easily cope with those needs with our own placing capabilities. And in fact, in the first two months of 2009, 12 billion have already been raised. So if you make this figure six times, you'll see that you more than cover the amount that is needed to match the long-term funding needs of the Bank.</p>
          <p>I mentioned, the very prudent provision policy we followed in at the end of last year, more than 100 basis points. I think it was a good decision given the situation. We see a concentration of the sub-optimal credit assets in the typical industries where that are mostly hit, immediately hit by the recession but that's absolutely forecastable. What is an encouraging sign is that in looking at the flow, the monthly flow of new substandard and doubtful loans in the first two months of the year, you'll see that they are much lower than they used to be last year and they used to be in the last quarter of 2008. Again I'm not saying that provisions will decrease next year. Provisions on our loan portfolio will increase. But what I'm saying is that we probably did very well our job at the end in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Another evidence of a prudent approach by ourselves, our separate, our doubtful loans are over covered if I can use this word because if we take guarantees, other collateral kind of support and we add the specific coverage, that the coverage we give, we accumulate every year, we get to a figure that is certainly higher than 100%.</p>
          <p>Don't look at the figure but we wanted to give you all the figures. This is the situation in Central-Eastern Europe. And you see that, and for each country, you have all the details. All together, the customer loans of all the total region, Central-Eastern Europe accounts for 7% and by, for example Ukraine is 0.1%. We wanted to give you these figures because you have to know what the situation is, and certainly that there is no case, no country can in itself create any sort of concern for the Group as a whole. But more than that, we are giving you all the details in terms of loans, in terms of loans in local currency and in foreign currency, in each of the country all the figures that can put you in the position to make a complete evaluation of our situation in each country.</p>
          <p>One point that I want to stress is this one, direct customer deposits in foreign currency are higher than foreign currency retail loans. So even if the amount of loans in foreign currency is a significant figure, given the small size of the <mark type="inaudible" />, we are to a large extent covered by the availability of direct customer deposits in foreign currency.</p>
          <p>Our doubtful loans are very well &#x2013; sorry I pushed the wrong button &#x2013; very well covered throughout the region. And the same way we have used, you remember when the problem with the structured credit products came on the table, we said we'll give you all the details, you decide. You will find all the details about our structured credit product portfolio also in this presentation. But since the anxiety about this region of the world was &#x2013; is growing in a number of other situations, we decided to give you all the details to put you in the position to evaluate what we are doing.</p>
          <p>Leverage, if you take it from the economic point of view, total assets over operating margins, if you take it from the capital point of view and you put tangible assets on tangible net equity, you see that the position of our Bank is quite strong. Actually if you reverse this ratio and you'll create the capital ratio I mentioned before, that means tangible net shareholders equity over tangible total assets that in my opinion, I want to repeat this point, is the real ratio to measure the capital ratio of the Bank you see that our Bank is in a good position.</p>
          <p>Capital ratio, the traditional ones. We closed the year with 6.3, 7.1, 10.2. Then we have a number of disposals that had already been completed and decided and the effect of the Tremonti Bonds. One comes from Tremonti and the other one comes from the disposals. So we present ourselves with 7.4, 8.2 and 11.3. What these bowl says? These cloud, let's say, says that we had a reserve in terms of non-core asset that will be disposed one day in the round of 150 basis point book value. One of the reasons why we have not sold them today is because we would get only the book value, while some of these assets had quite a higher, bigger value.</p>
          <p>This was part of the business plan you might remember. We have this reserve. We are working on all these assets because one day it might become a very important source of capital gains, of capital ratios and of liquidity. We are not forcing these says and certainly not even listing of some of these companies because as you know, this is not the right time to do it. But never forget that this is something we have as a further reserve for financing our growth.</p>
          <p>The Board today has confirmed the decision not to pay dividend. It's very consistent with the prudent approach I mentioned before to distribute what is provided for in favor of the saving shares and to buy an insurance policy, the Tremonti Bonds I mentioned before. These are the &#x2013; all the features, the characteristics, the terms and conditions of the Tremonti Bonds. We can get back to these points if you are interested. One point I want to stress is brevity. We are using this insurance policy for the shorter possible period. As soon as the situation gets back to normality, these bonds will be repaid.</p>
          <p>Outlook 2009, something I have already said before. We are quite confident we will be able to defend our spreads, and to benefit from the hedging activities with from hedging decisions we have taken in the last 12 months. So, we expect a decline in net interest income that's almost unavoidable but a decline that will be in this area mid-single digit.</p>
          <p>Cost reduction, further cost reductions because we are now completing the integration and completing the projects coming from the integration of the two banks and that create synergies. As I said, net adjustment, that means provisions on loans will be higher, but first evidence in the year are encouraging in that respect, and we don't expect further substantial impairment because we've been very prudent in 2008.</p>
          <p>Okay. We are preparing also the business plan, the new business plan. By the end of December, we are confident we will be able to provide you with this plan. We are waiting for the economic forecast to settle down and to become a little bit more reliable. We expect a difficult 2009, a difficult 2010, and then the history starts again in 2011. Maybe we are too pessimistic, but it's always better to get ready for the worst.</p>
          <p>Especially in the third year, revenues will have a good growth. Costs will keep going down and they will have a minus sign vis-&#xE0;-vis 2008 level. Asset quality will remain a priority, liquidity will remain a competitive strength, and then we will probably have at least part, maybe all, the effect of the capital actions we might take on this 10 billion book value kind -- amount of assets that might become a much bigger figure.</p>
          <p>Progressive pay-out means that year-after-year we expect the dividend pay-out to grow, as it used to be. Obviously our dividend pay-out will be defined in such a way to maintain capital strength, obviously. We want to remain at the very top of the rank in terms of tangible equity to tangible asset ratio, and the reasons I &#x2013; we discussed them before, and we will be very &#x2013; we will do our best in order to use Pillar II and Pillar II to optimize our capital requirements.</p>
          <p>2008. Again, some more detail on 2008. We have already mentioned most of this figure. Operating margin up 6.7, operating cost down 3.3. Asset quality, something I have not mentioned before, we have a strong generic reserve on performing loans. This amount is bigger than the expected loss, and that's another reserve we have in the balance sheet. Strict asset revaluation policy applied means that we have done all the possible impairments that were available. And we have also added almost 200 million worth of conservative valuation on structured credit products in the last quarter. The number of customers in the retail division has increased during the year by a reasonable figure. And we have completed, ahead of schedule, all the IT merger of the two banks.</p>
          <p>This is our balance sheet. Loans to customer, good figure. Financial assets decreased, mostly because of the four months' effect here in indirect customer deposits while direct customer deposits show a very satisfactory growth.</p>
          <p>The P&amp;L. Net interest income up 12.2%. These three columns, in order to put in the position to make all the relevant comparison, the first column is the comparison between the two stated P&amp;L. Then this column takes away &#x2013; takes out the non-recurrent items, especially the impairments, and this last column eliminate also the trading profit -- trading loss, actually, in order to have a feeling of the industrial performance of the Bank. And in fact, if you take away the bad year from the trading point of view, you'll see that also from the operating income we have a positive figure. We believe is good to have this kind of trend in terms of cost control, and this figure in terms of operating margin.</p>
          <p>From this line downward, we have all the effect of the goodwill impairment, more than 1 billion, then we have the increase of almost 1 billion in terms of loan provisions. We have the other impairments, almost 1 billion here, and we have here the last extraordinary effect of the 1 billion that brings everything to 2.5 billion. The 7.250 [billion] -- you remember we had almost 3 billion worth of capital gains for the disposals we had in 2007. I will not elaborate on this one, but you will find after each table, after each set of figures, all the details in order for you to understand what we mean by adjusted, what we consider non-recurrent, what we consider comparable or not comparable, because the P&amp;L and the balance sheets of banks that keep changing also in terms of perimeter is not an easy task, and we try to make this task as easy as possible.</p>
          <p>Last quarter, 353 million in terms of net income, if we exclude the impairment, and we get almost to 450 if we also exclude the trading profit. Most of these point have already been commented before. This is the last quarter of last year, certainly a decrease not unexpected, and then all the big effect of the impairment policy. And here the detail in order to put you in the position to understand the different comparisons.</p>
          <p>Net interest income, we believe it's a good figure at a yearly level. The trend is not surprising because interest rates and interest margins have decreased in the last part of the year, and again we have decided to keep our interbank position at the level we have it and that as a cost as well as the cost of keeping a certain amount of eligible assets. In terms of growth, here we see the percentage growth in the different segments of the company and the growth in terms of volumes in absolute terms. We have clearly supported the growth of the economies in the countries where we operate but we have been careful because the quality, the risk profile of our loan portfolio is let me tell you almost priority number one in order to keep a very safe flow of results. We will make any comment afterwards.</p>
          <p>Here we have the figure to explain the change in net interest income in the last quarter. Volumes accounted for growth, spread further decrease and here is the effect of the decreased volume of financial activities that have decreased the total amount of our interest income.</p>
          <p>Fee and commission down and we expect the 2009 to be another weak year. And all the banking, and all the commercial banking activities more or less are even where we have lost a very significant amount of money within the area of asset management and consultancy activity, minus 20%. Here is the area of concern but is also the area of potential growth of opportunity for the next years.</p>
          <p>We are investing. We are putting the right people in this area. We are not happy yet about what we are providing our customers with, but as you know, it's very difficult and this industry is suffering everywhere in the world. What we're doing might put us into position to benefit from the starting of the growth again in at the end of this year or the beginning we hope of next year. This point is important because if we look at asset under management, we see a very bad figure, but this money has not left the bank. These customers have not left the bank. They have simply switched to other ways to use the bank with their money, most of the money has gone to asset under administration and that quite an amount of money has become direct customer deposits. At the end, during the year, the net flows of retail customer financial asset is a positive figure. This is very important because as soon as the environment changes, and as soon we are good enough to offer the right products, these assets are there waiting for the right way to be serviced.</p>
          <p>Trading profits from 1.2 billion to zero, and especially the last quarter has been the bad one. But here you have the 184 million that has to do with the volatility we expect in the first quarter of 2009. So part of this loss, that is not the real loss but it's an accounting loss, so it's a loss has to do with the very prudent policy we have decided to take in the last quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>The details, in order for you to understand how this figure is created. Customer related activity not that high but not strange given the situation. Capital market still low but will grow. Prop trading and treasury negative and that has especially to do with the devaluations on the portfolio of government bonds we have as eligible assets, and that we decided to accept as a sort of cost of insurance. And this is the effect on our structured credit products. Half of it, a bit more than half has to do with first quarter 2009, the rest has to do with last quarter, last year. All the details about the structured credit product portfolio are in the presentation. Their portfolio is going down. We are succeeding in reducing it little-by-little. At the end, we don't expect to have real losses on the, the very large majority of these assets. And all the details are in the annexes to the presentation.</p>
          <p>Cost very much under control. All operating cost and especially the personnel expenses. We have some growth as usual in the last quarter of the year but well under control. Total cost in Italy are almost or more than 5% down. This figure accounts for the effort we are doing and we have been doing last year in a number of Central, Eastern European countries to strengthen the retail network of branches.</p>
          <p>Staff reduction, the yellow part is the one that will have to be realized in 2009. All these figures are connected with the trade agreements we have made with the unions. Three times we have discussed with them how to first get to the merger and then how to start the integration and now how to complete the integration. This part will be obviously done as planned in 2009.</p>
          <p>When we say staff reduction, we must always remember that at the same time we have kept hiring people so that &#x2013; that's the net effect but during the period we had more than 6,000 people hired in the bank. This table is only to give you &#x2013; tell you that we are growing well below &#x2013; well above in terms of target. So well below in terms of cost reduction and that was obviously due to the fact that the other components of our P&amp;L, revenues in particular are not inline with the business plan. And this part of the page is to say that we are now getting to the total synergies that the plan provided for and that will be realized by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Cost income. Cost income is another rank where our Bank is not performing that bad.</p>
          <p>Risk management policy, net provisions for risk and charges obviously lower than last year. Last year we had a couple of very extraordinary situations like the settlement with Parmalat, obviously higher than last year in terms of provisions on loans and especially the last two quarters have been very, very, very prudent.</p>
          <p>Net doubtful loans are still in the round of 1%, so well under control. The coverage I already mentioned before. The reserve on performing loans I already mentioned it. So, I mean in the next three pages you have all the details about non-performing loans in the different divisions, in the different countries. You have the addition coming from any point of view. We have all the details to make a judgment on the way we are managing this part of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Portfolio well diversified both in terms of business area and if we take the residential mortgages, that is the largest piece of the pie the risk profile keeps being very low. We are talking about an average situation where household's income account, the weight of servicing the mortgages is in the round of one-third the household's income. Loan to value is still in the round of 50%, and the average life of the mortgages is in the round of 20 years. In 25,000, 30,000 cases, we have agreed with our customers to make the duration longer to make them more sustainable by the households that has been done in the last two years and that has probably avoided problems for some of our customers.</p>
          <p>In terms of breakdown of industry, you'll see it's quite a well diversified situation. You might have in your presentation a mistake because the last two lines were mixed and you might have in your presentation a 8% doubtful loans that is 1%, while loans on foreign banks is almost 9%, you might then the reverse. So, this is the right one.</p>
          <p>I already mentioned this point. We got the foundation approach approved by the Bank of Italy and that brought us in the round of 15 or 13 or 15 basis points. You might ask a question about how much the cycle is embedded in these capital ratios and we can say that in the amount of the foundation after addition, almost 30% was kept aside for managing the profitability of the cycle, and we will have some further improvement available when the advanced Basel 2 will be approved.</p>
          <p>Divisional figures, I will not go through the details. I'm obviously available to comment on all of them. We have all the divisions providing a positive EVA in 2007. Obviously, if you don't apply to them, the impairment figures but all the impairment are concentrated. At the center, we have all the details of the divisions.</p>
          <p>2009, I already mentioned how we are going to manage the spread defense. I will be selective in terms of loan growth, how we will reduce costs, staff costs, other administrative costs and also amortization and depreciation already said. This is only to say that given the amount of impairment we had in 2008, we don't expect any significant further impairment in 2009 and conclusions are not surprising. The message is we think we got ready for the period we have in front of us. 2009 will be as I said a very challenging period. We count on a solid profit in 2009 and our capital position is now definitely secure and we expect and we hope to be able to get back to dividend payment already next year. This is the presentation and now we are all ready to answer your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Riccardo Rovere from Mediobanca here. Two, three questions. The first one is on the provisions, I just wanted to better understand if the billion loan loss provisions you posted in Q4, if there is anything one-off? Because if I remember correctly you previously guided in the previous quarter anywhere between 500 and 600 million per quarter and this is the amount you posted in Q3 once I deduct Icelandic banks and Lehman from the number you released in Q3 850 million minus 250. The second question I have is on Tremonti Bonds, you stated before that you think the leverage ratio is the correct ratio you should look at to assess the capital or the equity of a bank, I agree on this. And this is the main reason why I am a bit confused, why you are asking 4 billion of Tremonti Bonds considering that this is not equity, this is kind of quasi equity that the Bank of Italy is allowing you to compute in quarter one but doesn't affect the equity at all. So I'm wondering why you're asking 4 billions. And just wanted to be 100% sure of the guidance you're giving for 2009. You are basically telling us that 2009 attributable profit will be lower than 2.5 billion which is the amount you posted in '08, just wanted to be sure I understood this correctly? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>First question about the total provisions in 2008, if I remember correctly our guidance was 60 basis points for the year. So, we are certainly above what we expected on the basis of the September results but and I think we are not at all far from the 60 basis points we had in mind as the maximum for 2008. In fact it was higher than we expected and &#x2013; but we believe that adding and creating this cushion was a wise decision. Tremonti Bonds, Tremonti Bonds, so your question is why 4 billion or --</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, okay, okay. If you buy an insurance policy better to buy it for the most you can do. And I think it's wise to add one percentage point, or say 100 basis points and making very clear that our Core Tier 1 is well above 7%. You are saying is not equity, I am saying is equity because it is as the same treatment of equity and it's not good change that the Bank of Italy considers it a Core Tier 1 facility. We decided that making clear that we are well in excess of 7% sort of eliminate the doubts about our capital adequacy.</p>
          <p>We believe that even the risk profile of our bank in the, even in the present situation we would need less than that, but less as this very safe, this very comfortable position for the two, three years that the crisis will last. As far as 2009, I didn't make any figure. I said solid profit because it's really too early to say anything more than that. Everyday, the economic forecast change, so it would be reasonable for me to make any figure. But we expect and we have given the company targets that are consistent with the solid growth concept I used. Please? If there is nobody else here, we can leave to someone else from outside.</p>
          <p>Can we leave it? And I will not move until at least a couple of more questions arrive. Maybe the connection has been --.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, the Q&amp;A session for analysts only is open. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. First question comes from Mr. Zanardo Marcello from KBW. Mr. Zanardo, please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. The first question is one second, sorry, maybe you can hear me better. The first question relate on what you have the highest control on in 2009, is probably the most difficult year ever for Italian banks which is cost. If I look at the 3.3% adjusted costs '08 on '07 at the group level, and the 5.1 decrease in Italy, that's done in a year where you still have some investment happening in your Central Eastern Europe network up until I guess September or October. And you said that the investment that you made in 2008 were still at full speed. So my question is I know that you don't want to give more guidance than what you said. But would I be correct to assume in a year where revenues are going to be under significant pressure, at least on adjusted cost reductions similar if not above to what we have seen in 2008, because common sense would imply that? So that's the first question. And the second question is on NII. You've guided to a mid single-digit fall. Would it be possible to detail a little bit more on the hedging or how much hedging is done on the side deposits if you can give us a figure because your rival picked in October, just mid-October, and then it falls 70%, so clearly all liability-sensitive banks will fall a lot and I would expect actually a bigger fall in NII but if you can convince us that your hedging is there at in the market would take it quite positively?</p>
          <p>And then finally, more of a general question, listening to your comments and looking at how you are positioning your bank, it implies to me that you're entering 2009 with a quite very pessimistic view because the Bank has a lot of liquidity which are paying. You take a very high level of collateral eligible with the Central Banks. So to me again, I don't want to ask you guidance but if I analyze and adjust this Q4 number of 353 million times four for 2009 taking a 30% cut. I will be very happy for we're running the Bank to close with a net profit just below 1 billion. Is my, without you giving guidance, but is my reasoning correct or is there something wrong in it? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I agree on what you said at the beginning, 2009 will be the most difficult year also in term, not that much in terms of cost, in general terms. As far as costs are concerned given what we have interrupted from this year in the Central-Eastern European countries. And what we have already planned in terms of cost reduction in Italy, I can tell you very openly that the cost line will have a minus sign, but I will not elaborate more on the figure.</p>
          <p>Net interest income, our best bet in terms of decrease is in the round of, not a too big one digit figure, because from January, the hedging facilities we had organized are starting, being operational. And as of today, given what is happening in terms of markups and what and how volumes are moving very selectively as I said, that's the best we can tell you, let's say between five and 10, but we hope we would be able to stay as close to five as possible. Pessimistic view on 2009, and if I understood correctly, you will be happy if we make four times the --.</p>

          <p>Hello, this is Jaap Meijer from Dresdner Kleinwort. I have two questions from a bondholder perspective if I may. Could you clarify your view on coupon payments, on your hybrid capital instruments and related to that does the dividend payment to saving shares imply that from a hybrid security perspective you have distributed income to junior securities that you are now obliged...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll repeat myself. Could you clarify your view on coupon payments, on your hybrid capital instruments and related to that, does the dividend payments to saving shares imply that from a hybrid security perspective you have distributed income and that you are now obliged to pay on Tier 1 securities, the coupons. And also where would the Tremonti Bonds rank in liquidation versus existing Tier 1s. That's it from me.</p>

          <p>If I tell you the truth I have not understood. Is there anybody who have understood and can tell me what he asked for because I did not understand. It's not that I don't want to answer you because I'm sure that I have the answer. But if they ask &#x2013; if the question is, if we will pay coupon on Tier 1, the answer is certainly yes. But it's probably not the only question you asked. If that was the only question, we will pay coupon on Tier 1. And that then you mentioned something about the Tremonti Bonds that are junior versus Tier 1 and maybe that was the second question you made. Was I correct?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to everyone. I have just got three questions. One regards the Intesa Vita JV, what can you tell us in terms of timeframe, whether the JV will come back to you in full? And newspapers talk about 650 million put option in favor of alliance, so if you can give us a bit of clarification on that? The second question regards your generic reserve. You have pointed out you have 2.4 billion of generic reserves on performing loans, which is way higher than your expected loss. How much of this reserve could you use in a contingent situation to provide a buffer to your accounts in '09 and '010?</p>
          <p>And lastly, your previous business plan was about three pillars. The first was integrating the retail bank, and has been completed. The second was about the rationalization for the factories and the third about the growth in Eastern Europe. Can you elaborate a bit more still on your commitments on the latter two? i.e., you've said you want to dispose of &#x2013; the non-strategic assets. But what about CE, are you still committed to the region, and if through the crisis, you would face fire sales, would you be interested in growing there? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First point, Intesa Vita. Intesa Vita is a long-lasting joint venture with Generali that was very satisfactory business we had together for a number of years. We did not expect to discontinue this joint venture. They have decided to do it, and we will try to make the most out of it. The most out of it means two things, first now we have four bank-insurance companies, four product companies. That had to be like that, because one was a joint venture with Generali, the other one was the previous Sanpaolo company, one came from <mark type="inaudible" /> and the last one, Sud Polo Vita, was a decision made by the antitrust authority because of our alliance with Generali. So a very inefficient situation for us.</p>
          <p>The decision that was announced today by Generali gives us the freedom to completely rationalize our presence in the business. We will have one bank insurance company, a very strong one, a very effective one, a very efficient one. The number of synergies, both in terms of cost and in terms of revenues, will come from this opportunity that is now available for us.</p>
          <p>Today, the management -- the sale, the marketing management, the sales management of bank insurance products, is suboptimal because of these sub-division in four centers. After we have created one single company, and that will be done very rapidly. And I'm sure we have already agreed upon this point. I'm sure that Generali will be available to proceed with all the practical steps in order to put us in the position to get our 50% back and start the integration as rapidly as possible. So, by the end of the year, I hope that everything will be put in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Money, the price for it, our shareholders agreement provides for the formula, so it's something that, to a large extent, is predefined. They have made on the newspapers a scheme, a possible new system &#x2013; estimate of the price we will have to pay for the 50%. They mentioned 600, 700, obviously we will negotiate. But that is the &#x2013; more or less, will be the size we are talking about. It's something that we can afford both in, certainly from the financial point of view, but also from the capital ratios point of view. And so the answer to your question, the real bottom line answer is, we will probably turn something that was not expected into an interesting opportunity for the Group. Then in some years' time, this company will certainly have quite a value. At that point, as for the rather non-strategic or non-core assets, we will be able to decide what to do.</p>
          <p>Generic reserve, 2.4 is today at least, 4 &#x2013; 500 million above the expected loss. But in these kind of calculations the cycle has quite an important effect, and this figure can change during a short period of time. How much we can use? Theoretically up to 100%, but as you know we have always kept accumulating resources in this reserve but should the need arise, we can use all of it.</p>
          <p>Rationalization or disposal of product factories. I confirm what I said on a number of occasions, most factories, most product companies, do not necessarily have to belong to the distribution network. We might have -- and part of the &#x20AC;10 billion worth of assets are actually product companies that might be sold or listed, especially -- or disposed in a way or in another, and we keep this approach. Whenever we are the best owner, we keep the subsidiaries. Whenever there is a better owner, if there is a possibility to divest at the reasonable price, we'll do it. Growth in Central Eastern Europe, no plan to grow, no opportunities around the corner. You might be right and in the next years, some very good opportunities might arise, but as of today we are very happy with the metric we have and we feel very safe with the 10 subsidiaries we are presently managing.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The first question is about your loan book. You don't have a big amount of LBOs, but I don't know if you can give us an idea of the major client positions within this portfolio. And if not, if you can give us an idea of the concentration versus percentage versus client? And the other question is, you mentioned in the presentation that you have only 7% of your loan book that is coming from the CE. Just to be clear, does this include also product companies, or it's just referring to your international subsidiaries? And then finally, I don't know if you can give us an idea of the embedded value of your recent activities at Eurizon? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, let me say if I find the page, because the LBOs loan book is a very limited figure if I remember correctly, and if &#x2013; most are coming &#x2013; all of them, practically all of them, are Italian SMEs. For the average finance, we are talking about in the round of 4.500 billion, most of them Italian companies we know very well. So, we &#x2013; that's what I have here.</p>
          <p>Second, 7% loans in Central-Eastern European countries, that's all, because those countries have their own product companies working in those regions. There are some very limited exposure by our infrastructure bank and by our corporate division, but the product companies, especially credit, personal credit, credit cards, leasing, are managed directly by companies belonging to the CEE network, and so the figure I gave you is also -- includes also the product company loans. The embedded value in EurizonVita, if I remember correctly, is in the round of &#x20AC;1.5 billion.</p>

          <p>Hello. I would like to know if you can give us which could be the consumption in terms of capital ratios following the acquisition of the minorities of Intesa Vita, if you have this number. Secondly, maybe I'm wrong, but looking at the quarterly trend of the price purchase allocation, it seems that in the fourth quarter of the year you're putting something like &#x20AC;660 million, while in the previous quarters the amount was much, much lower, so I would like to know if there is a reason for this?

          <p>Okay, great. And one more thing regarding the &#x20AC;10 billion of assets, it seems that you could depose going forward. What I would like to know is, the degree of confidence you have in these? What I mean is that, it is nothing new because you mentioned it in the past. And in the past it was a very, very big news flow, so the market was extremely happy about this, while to-date it seems actually the contrary. So what I would like to understand is, is there any timeframe, even maybe one year or two years, I don't know, that could be given to the market in terms of arrival for the disposals, because they are extremely important, especially in the light of the redemption of the Tremonti Bonds?

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's say, that we hope and we count on having at least an amount of disposal comparable with the size of the Tremonti Bonds in the same timeframe work of the Tremonti Bonds reimbursement. We hope to do better than that but, let's say, that at least the amount that is necessary to repay the Tremonti bonds will be done in the period three years, more or less, that our Tremonti Bonds connection will last.</p>
          <p>As far as your second question, in the line you mentioned, there are at least 500 million worth of impairment of intangible assets. And that's the reason why we have them all in the last quarter of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On net fees was the first question, the fourth quarter was particularly weak, obviously because of the market. Can we assume that the level of the fourth quarter will be a minimum, and that we will slowly improve during 2009? And the second question is on loan loss provisions, which were 60, 65 basis points in 2008, just if you can comment on, let's say, the consensus that is in the region of 100 basis points, if you consider 100 basis points for 2009 a reasonable figure? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as net fees, if the last quarter is the minimum, hard to say. And would be not fair by me to say more than we expect a weak year. We are getting very close to the bottom, as far as I can imagine, but I cannot commit on the fact that the last quarter was the minimum one. Loan provision, yes, we are in the round of 60 basis points, next year will be higher, will be higher certainly. We expect certainly below 100 basis points, but it will be higher than 60 basis points.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I just have a couple of questions left. First, you mentioned that there was a stabilization or better, a slowdown, in influence of non-performing loans in January and February. Was that due, you think, from lower rates already having some impact, or it was mostly the result of the cleanup you did in the fourth quarter? And secondly, if I understand right, there was a reduction in risk weighted assets in Q4, and I was wondering how you expect the risk weighted assets to develop in 2009? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the first question, the stabilization, what you call the stabilization in the first two months cannot be even defined as such. For sure, I said it's encouraging that the flow of new non-performing loans is certainly lower than last year and the average figure of the last month. That is really very early to say. The very prudent provision policy probably has helped, but would be too &#x2013; it's really too early to say, so I don't want to commit to it, even if I'm very happy about these first two months' performance.</p>
          <p>Risk weighted assets, mainly volumes, loan volumes. The performance of the different divisions would be very different. We will not provide disclosure for each of them, but for sure in Central Eastern Europe they will have to walk with their own legs, and that would certainly make the growth lower than in 2008. Retail market will not grow very much. We are talking about a few basis points, both with the retail customers and small companies. We expect positive figure for SMEs, but a low one. And that would already be quite a results, because the demand for credit of &#x2013; demand for good credit is today very low. When I say good credit, I mean credit to finance turnover, exports, investments, while some not-that-good credit. The demand for good credit is increasing, and we have to be very careful to defend the quality of our portfolio. So as I was saying, a positive figure, certainly positive figure for us. It means certainly a positive figure for mid and large corporate. So overall, it's a positive figure. We are talking about a low percentage point vis-&#xE0;-vis, as I said, a very decreasing demand for good credit.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Really just two clarifications relating to the Tremonti bonds, the first one linking a little bit to the last question. What expectations are there from the government in terms of your commitment to lending and to growing lending in Italy, whether to small businesses or indeed the large companies or indeed supporting companies that get into difficulty? And then second question, in terms of your attitude to repaying it, you talked about brevity being a good thing. Do you expect you would repay these as soon as you feel you no longer need the insurance as you describe it, or would you have to wait until other banks are ready to repay their Tremonti Bonds for you to repay yours?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tremonti Bonds, the first question, commitment. The kind of commitments we will take and the protocol is still under discussion is in my opinion wise. I use the word wise because the kind of commitment that we are asked to take are not quantitative kind of commitment. We have to prove that we put our best efforts in providing more resources to SMEs and we are perfectly in line. We want to do it, we would do it anyhow. The protocol with the government says very clearly that we do not &#x2013; we are not asked to lend to the wrong people, to the wrong companies. We all know that the creditworthiness is our basic rule and we are not asked not to follow the basic rule of banks. So it's a strong commitment and we strongly believe in this commitment to provide and to put available for SMEs all the good money that can be lent to them. But certainly, we would not accept any quantitative commitment because given the situation and given the impossibility to forecast the growth of the economy of the country, it will be impossible to take such commitments. But we are not asked to do it.</p>
          <p>When the repayment? The repayment is totally up to each of the banks. There is no need to wait for others. We will not be blocked or affected by other bank's behavior. As soon as we believe that the bank does not need any more these insurance policy will be replaced and I also believe that this is in the intention of the government.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Two questions from me, the first one is on goodwill impairment. You made quite significant impairments in the fourth quarter. I am just wondering whether we could expect any further impairments on Fideuram and Eurizon Capital? The second one is going back on the risk-weighted assets. There has been a decrease of 7 billion risk-weighted assets in the CIB, Corporate and Investment Banking division, in the fourth quarter. I am just wondering whether you can explain that, whether it was a one-off ticket or whatever? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we do not expect any further impairment on those two companies. Obviously, we cannot commit to such a commitment, but we do not expect any further impairment on Fideuram and Eurizon Capital. On the other side, the decrease in risk-weighted asset in the Corporate and Investment Banking division was due to very specific one-off operations made by a couple of large corporates at the very end of the year, so they are not meaningful.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon. My question is related to whether you injected in the quarter any equity in your CEE division? I'm asking because if I compare the balance of the shareholder equity last quarter and this quarter, it went down by <mark type="inaudible" /> bit over 100 million, but meanwhile you also did take an impairment in products. And more in general, I wanted to know at least a bit more about your philosophy on how you actually manage capital and whether you'd be willing or able to inject any further equity in CEE at some point in the future, should there be a need. And also on a related point, if you could maybe provide some details also how you manage liquidity and funding for those subsidiaries, whether it's sold on centrally provided by the corporate center and if you have any guarantees or commitment or you can actually call that back in any sort of stress scenario? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Equity in our Central Eastern European subsidiaries, yes, we had some small intervention during 2008. We plan to have very limited ones for regulatory reasons in two or three of them, but we're talking about a few dozens millions. When we have to &#x2013; if and when we have to increase a little bit the equity in some of those subsidiaries we tend to transform credits into equity. So it's not new money that goes there. Pravex was &#x2013; the goodwill of Pravex, it's a small bank we have in Ukraine, was 100% written off in order to take into account the present situation of the country, but we believe that that bank will be a source of goodwill out in the next years. Funding on international markets is centralized and we don't have in &#x2013; we don't have the plan to increase significantly our funding facilities to our ten subsidiaries. Well -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I beg your pardon, sir. Sorry, obviously, I was a little bit slow in hitting the question button, but I am here. I have three questions if I can. On trading, excluding the impact of effectively on the structured credit, the trading line still seems to be effectively quite low, can you give us a little bit more visibility what else went through there? And also since you've taken effectively some of the Q1 impact into Q4, should we reasonably expect that actually you're back into profit for what you've seen so far in the Q1 numbers?</p>
          <p>With regard to your spread impact, which if I am correct is on slide 26, you've taken some hedges, does that mean that actually the spread impact we see in Q4 will not be as bad in Q1, Q2 or still despite the hedges there is going to be quite a lot of impact? And more looking longer term, what do you think is going to happen to the spreads in the banking business when interest rates stop falling, but actually may likely be very low for a long time? Do you think then re-pricing will allow you to increase spreads a bit or actually we should be looking at spreads still staying low and perhaps even more decreasing over time?</p>
          <p>One small question on your divisional, your Banca dei Territori, the rent deposit, the customer deposit, the actual balance seemed to be coming down from 322 billion in the Q3 to about 220 billion in Q4, so it's 10% decline. Can you just give us a little bit of indication of what is the reason for that? Is the actual deposits or it's bonds that have expired? Those are my questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, trading, very difficult to say what will happen. The first two months have been positive both in capital market and trading activities with the customers. First quarter will certainly have a benefit from the fact that we had decided to provision a part of the volatility we expected for the first quarter, but hard to say anything, and I think it's wiser for me not to give any guidance. For sure, we want to have a line in the very positive side in 2009.</p>
          <p>Spread, we will not give any guidance on the effect of the hedging facilities we have organized, but for sure from January they will have a visible affect.</p>
          <p>Long-term spreads. Long-term spreads will be the product of two different strength working one against the other. Competition in our market will keep growing. At the same time, a number of banks will remain with very low liquidity, and that will make the market a bit better for the provider of funds for banks. At the same time, I think that everybody in the industry realized how dangerous is not to give the right price to risk. One of the reasons why we are suffering now from the global crisis is because throughout the world risks and money has not been properly valued. So I expect the spreads on average to be higher and higher, certainly not that much higher, but I certainly do not see markdowns going down. Markdowns will certainly go up.</p>
          <p>Now, we are &#x2013; the spreads are compressed because of the lower level of markdowns, but if you look at, as you said, the medium-term, I expect higher spreads than in the last few years. Last point, yes, was on deposits in the Banca dei Territori division. Actually, the growth &#x2013; the deposits grew in the last quarter. What makes the stated figure decrease is because you might remember that we had to change <mark type="inaudible" /> comparison on last call. We had to sell a &#x2013; we decided to sell a number of branches, but if you take the same perimeter, the actual deposits growth by 4 billion in the last three months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So effectively, it's only the consolidation perimeter change quarter-on-quarter on the asset side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you think spreads on the markdown can actually go up even if interest rates stay low?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, I don't expect it because given the very abrupt step-down in market view, I see almost impossible to increase spreads given that <mark type="inaudible" /> is &#x2013; it's not 1.5, 1%. So very hard to extract a markdown higher than what we have given that situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then one last point, since you mentioned competition, have you noticed since you are nation one &#x2013; large nation-wide bank, have you noticed a sort of decline of competition by some of the foreign banks in Italy, which were coming over the last two to three years. And I am not referring to banks that have actually made acquisitions but those who are doing cross-border transactions. Have you noticed a change there?</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Hi, this is Per L&#xF6;fgren from Morgan Stanley in London. I have one question and that goes back to capital. Again, just a clarification here. The Core Tier 1 of 6.3 that you report, you also mention here that you are going from standard to foundation, having this effect then of, is it, 10,15, basis points. But you mentioned here as a response to a question that part of this effect we had some cyclical effect in it. I just wanted to &#x2013; if you can talk me through, if I am at 6.3 foundation today, if you back that &#x2013; go back one step to standard, ignoring the cycle and all that, ignoring the capital measures that you are planning with regards to Tremonti bonds and also potential disposals, from that starting point, what would it be in an advanced world given that its approved by the regulators? And on that new number, how far down will it go at the bottom of the cycle? How much will the cycle bring according to your <mark type="inaudible" />? I hope it makes sense <mark type="inaudible" /> question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I am not sure I understood all the details of your question, but if your question was, what the ideal Core Tier 1 you want to have in the next years, I will not answer because now we feel comfortable with what we have reached and I think that's a safety situation, given what we have in front of us. The only thing I said and I repeat now is that for sure, as soon as the economy gets back to a normal situation, the figure we have today would be too much as almost all of you kept saying to me until a two months ago. So let's see. For the time being, we put us on the safe side and we will have to manage according to the situation that would develop.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks for taking a follow-up question. It's on the construction sector. Looking at your slides, if you add on construction and building material and commercial property for what is worth, given that is more risky than the venture property, which I'm very comfortable with your statement. The question I have is, if you can tell us a little bit how you're treating this kind of sector at the moment in your provisioning? And although I know you don't like to talk about individual names, when they go into the front page of the sort of Intesa Torrei, I have to ask a question. But I would want to understand how you're treating your exposure versus Zaleski and how you're treating your exposure versus the Zunino Group, the Risanamento Group whose market cap has evaporated in the stock exchange?</p>

Our position in the different credit lines we have with them is very different. In a number of places, they are very well guaranteed. So we are following those two cases with the right attention and we are hopeful that &#x2013; we're very hopeful that in most cases those two groups will get out of the problems they have accumulated in the recent number of time.</p>

          <p>As in practically every industry, you cannot &#x2013; or at least I don't want to make any statement that holds true for the whole industry. In any industry you have champions, you have companies that are not following competition. And more and more, you cannot make &#x2013; you cannot take credit decisions on the basis on the industry. Obviously, you have to take into account if an industry or a segment of an industry is particularly under stress. But we have difficult industries with companies performing very well. We have mature industries where the entrepreneurs put the right amount of money in their companies, keep investing and are successful even if theoretically they belong to a non-performing industry. That's one of the reason why our activity is getting more and more complicated. That's why we have to invest more and more in trading, training and that's why we have to accumulate in some way the experience that the bank as it ranks.</p>
          <p>Construction and real estate in general will be very much affected by the decisions of the government in terms of infrastructure building and in terms of making &#x2013; you probably read on the newspapers &#x2013; making the procedures for enlarging family houses more easily. So let's wait for that. One policy we have followed very strictly in the last period, in the last few months more than probably in the last few years was not to be involved in projects without a significant component of equity in the project itself. So we have tried to not to be involved in two elaborate construction projects. That policy has probably helped us in remaining out of a number of difficult situations that are today on the market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I had a quick question regarding the pro-cyclicality of Basel II. I was wondering if you had made any scenarios or stress tests and if you have any numbers you can give on eventual pro-cyclicality effects of Basel II during this crisis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basel II, you are saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As to Basel II advanced, we might have a further advantage. As you know, it will depend on when the advanced will be introduced because you know that Basel II has a very strong pro-cyclical effect and we expect many banks already applying Basel II advanced to have a negative effect because of the cycle in the next month. So we are very careful in making an estimate of the net effect for us in the next month, let's say, by the end of the year because if the situation is still very bad, the advantage might be limited. We have a range, if worse come to worst, it's zero, and if the situation is reasonable one is in the round of 25 basis points.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Three easy questions. And the first one is on the potential losses that you would have recorded excluding the amendment of the IAS 39? And the second question is on the fiscal positive impact that you had in the last quarter, if I'm not wrong, some 1.6 billion. If I understand properly, some 1.1 is coming from the goodwill deductibility. So I'm wondering where the other half billion is coming from? And the third is if you can simply quantify what's the actual tangible book at the end of the year? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Net &#x2013; what net tangible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Book. The equity value, the tangible equity value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Net tangible equity, I know that we're talking something in the round of 28 billion, but I don't have the figure with me. I remember very well that during the last quarter the figure increased. The net tangible asset or the goodwill we have in our equity was your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The equity minus the goodwill minus intangible asset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we are in the round of 22 billion if I remember correctly. Little bit more or less but we're in the round of 22 billion.</p>
          <p>Fiscal policy. Yes, we made very clear that we had debt advantage in the round of 1.6 and 1.1 was related with the goodwill amortization. And the other one has to do with the optimization of our fiscal position in the European countries that accounted for in the round of &#x20AC;500 million. So that's both fiscal, and at the end is 1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>The first question, let me say, if I have the page for the losses on IAS 39, if you take page number 59, you have all the details and I strongly suggest you to read it. In any case if you want me to read it, the last lines of page 59, 459 million as negative impact from fair value measurement, of which 318 in like the fourth quarter 2008. But you will get all the details in that page 59.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. If I can, when you talk about the fiscal optimization of 0.5 billion, is that something that is going to be repeated in the future or is something like a one-off that you benefit of in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That one is a one-off. Others can be repeated, at least partially in the next future.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Giovanni Carriere from Execution. Mr. Carriere, please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Apologies, a very quick follow-up question. I noticed the balance of your available-for-sale valuation reserve, you changed from minus 700 to minus 1.4 billion, <mark type="inaudible" /> maybe to improve it a bit because you have taken some impairment, so if you could comment on exactly what &#x2013; which securities are changing in value, whether it's the bond that's used for hedging or anything else? And also on the fiscal income, I feel tax assets actually increased very significantly beyond the 1.6 billion, if there is any other benefit that you have taken not through the P&amp;L that we have been noticing. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wish I had understood what you said. So we have two alternatives, you repeat it or I wait for someone to explain to me what you said. The first part of the question was about the AFS reserve that increased up to 1.4 billion and that's the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And I was expecting it maybe to reduce the balance because you have taken some impairments, right, on some of the securities that you hold in AFS portfolio. So if you could comment on what is driving the change in the value of the AFS portfolio? To what extent, is it just transitory, temporary impairments maybe on the bonds that you use for hedging or to some extent it's actually the equity that is &#x2013; equity securities <mark type="inaudible" />, if it's possible to quantify? I know we will get the detail at some point in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We took all the possible devaluations on our fixed income securities and we expect that situation to change, but it's hard to say when. For sure, that was the most prudent decision we could have taken and that has mostly to do with our portfolio of fixed income securities at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect, thank you. That's very clear. And the other question was under tax assets. There is an unusual positive surprise jump of 3.3 million, if anything has to do with the optimization of the fiscal position of the goodwill amortization, if there is any impact of those decisions that actually comes through the balance sheet rather than through the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will use the escape answer of and I will say that our IR people will answer your question, but not because I don't want to answer. I still do not understand what you said, but it's my fault. So I apologize. And if there is any other question -</p>
