        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. And welcome to the Westpac Group's 2011 Interim Result Presentation.  My name is Andrew Bowden, and presenting the results this morning will be Gail Kelly, our Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Coffey, our Chief Financial Officer. As for the normal format, Gail and Phil will present the results, and then we'll open up for questions.</p>
          <p>So without further ado, let me invite Gail to present her seventh Westpac result.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Thanks very much for joining us today for our first half 2011 results presentation. I know it's really a busy period for all of you, so I appreciate you're being here in person or hooking up and making in. I have all the team here with me today and George Frazis, who's connecting in via the telephone.</p>
          <p>So I think the theme for these results and the best way to describe the first half of the 2011 year is that of building momentum. This is a good quality result with all of our divisions delivering core and cash earnings growth from the second half of 2010. I'm pleased to say, we're making strong progress in our strategic agenda with clear evidence of delivery in terms of earning all of our customers' business and making it easier for our customers. We've come a long way here.</p>
          <p>This is being aided by the excellent work and milestones being achieved in our strategic investments program, and our productivity agenda. Increasingly, multi-brand is a key point of differentiation for us and the announcement of our Bank of Melbourne launch further enhances this.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet is strong and well positioned. We have a high common equity ratio of 8% and a high quality book and sector leading provisioning coverage. So all in all, our results reflecting solid progress and building momentum.</p>
          <p>Turning to the financial scoreboard, and you can see that on every metric, we have a favorable trend. Cash earnings has come in 8% higher than the second half 2010 and reported the impact of a very solid outcome, up 14%, boosted by the tax consolidation benefits associated with the St. George merger.</p>
          <p>Pleasingly, core earnings increased 4% over the half, a turnaround on the last two halves. Asset quality continues to improve and our impairments charge to average loans of 19 basis points is the lowest it's been since 2007. This strong performance reflects the very high quality of our portfolio and is something this bank is very proud of.</p>
          <p>Our expense-to-income ratio of 41% sits well below peers, with the productivity program we implemented last year leading to a 1% reduction in expenses over the prior half. As you would have seen, we've raised our dividend by $0.02 this half to a record $0.76, maintaining our consistent growth path. This slide looks at cash earnings across all the divisions. And you can see from the right hand side and the green arrows there that all divisions are up this half, relative to the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>And turning to the next slide, we see the same for core earnings. This is the first time since 2007 that we've delivered higher core earnings across all divisions. What this result shows is that the external environment has improved, and that all our divisions are in good shape.</p>
          <p>I'd like to pause on this slide a moment, and say a few words about each division. Starting with Westpac Resell and Business Bank, this is our largest division, making up around 30% of earnings. That's been a strong performer this half with core earnings up 4%. This division has seen a sizable investment over the last two years through our Westpac Local program, which involved a significant upgrade in capability in our frontline staff.</p>
          <p>Effectively, we've transformed the way the Retail and Business Bank is run. Westpac Local has involved a substantial investment in our network with one-third of branches refurbished, 31 new branches, 172 new ATMs and an extensive upgrade of our front-end systems. This investment is delivering, we've achieved above system mortgage growth, excellent customer retention, and improving a net promoter scores particularly in business where we are number one.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing tangible growth in the cross-sell of Wealth products to Westpac Banking customers, something that's not easy to do. Having Rob Coombe and Brad Cooper working so closely together has been key to that.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Institutional Bank, through the division we're very proud of, it has performed particularly well relative to peers throughout the GFC. And again this half, we see an outstanding performance with regard to credit quality. A further highlight is the success, our WIB business is achieving in increasing the depth of customer relationships. I know that Rob Whitfield and his team are delighted with the progress here. A higher proportion of income is coming from customer activities with good customer flows in debt market and transactional banking, and these have been the standout business units for WIB this half.</p>
          <p>St. George has been through a transformation since the merger, including its organizational restructure into regions, diversifying its exposures away from commercial property and focusing more on growth through its own channels. While these structural changes have reduced growth in the short-term, the St. George brand remained strong, continuing to enjoy close relationships with its customers.</p>
          <p>St. George net promoter score for both consumers and business customers leads the major banks and is continuing to improve. It's worth noting that St. George has recorded positive growth in retail customer numbers each month since the merger in 2008.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to say that the repositioning of St. George is now complete, and Rob Chapman and his team are infusing energy and momentum into the business. In all this, we take the next step in our multi-brand strategy with the launch of Bank of Melbourne, a local bank for the Victorians. And I'm happy to say the initial response to the announcement has exceeded our high expectations.</p>
          <p>Turning to Wealth, our BT Financial Group delivered a record result this half, and I'm really pleased with how the business is performing. The higher than usual insurance claims this half were able to be absorbed and the team has managed the claim process for the customers exceptionally well. Our investment in BT and our Asgard platforms is delivering with the continued number one ranking in new flows. We have a strong connection to our retail bank distribution channels that is unmatched by peers. And we're well placed for the significant slate of regulatory changes that are coming our way.</p>
          <p>New Zealand, as we as we all know has been through a very difficult period with the Christchurch earthquake. Last month, I saw firsthand the devastating impact particularly in the CBD, and it's going to take a lot of work and resilience from the people and businesses of Christchurch to get back on their feet, but something I'm confident they will achieve.</p>
          <p>Overall, our New Zealand business is performing well. George Frazis and his team have effectively delivered a big turnaround from a year or so ago. Westpac Local is being progressively implemented across New Zealand with a strong focus on enhancing banker capability.</p>
          <p>In key areas, we're growing share, albeit in a soft market and we're seeing margin improvement. As well as our division's delivering solid results, this has also been a significant period of achievement on other fronts. As we are applying to last October, we have a five-year, 2 billion strategic investment program underway, which we refer to as our SIPs as well as a productivity program to help fund that investment.</p>
          <p>We're now almost 18 months into the SIPs program, and projects are being delivered on time and on budget. Two key success stories during the half have been the completion of the first stage of the collections platform consolidation, and the successful migration of St. George cards onto an upgraded, multi-brand card platform, a single platform serving all brands. Both of these were large pieces of work, and were completed without any disruption to customers.</p>
          <p>On our productivity initiatives, we're running slightly ahead of plan, and have delivered 120 million worth of benefits in the first half. Our productivity agenda centered around enhancing the customer experience, improving our front line being available for customers and creating a culture of continuous improvement. We provided more detail in the investor discussion pack on progress to date on both of these programs and we will provide regular updates.</p>
          <p>With that, let me hand over to Phil. And at the conclusion of Phil's presentation, I'll return to make some brief remarks on the operating environment and our key areas of focus for the future.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks Gail, and good morning, everyone. It does feel like a pretty good half, and given the challenges that we've been facing over the last couple of years, it was really pleasing to see all of the divisions now making a positive contribution to the group. And I'd like to step through in some detail how the half played its way up.</p>
          <p>The first slide highlights how the past 12 months has really been a period of two that are quite different halves. In the second half of 2010, which is on the left-hand side of your slide, you can see we're still dealing with the consequences of bringing our markets based revenues back to a more sustainable level. And there were no real assets to the higher funding costs that we experienced. And together, these impacted the revenue picture and you can see that in the chart.</p>
          <p>Expenses were also higher as we built up the front line, but we haven't, at that stage, began to deliver the benefits of our productivity program. In the latest half, the picture is quite different with growth returning to revenues and our productivity program clearly delivering. There was some further easing in impairment charges but all lines contributed to earnings growth. And as a result, I think we can call this a high quality performance.</p>
          <p>Like most halves, we did have some a few one-offs, but when you look at them in aggregate, they're pretty much balanced each other out. And so the 8% uplift that we recorded in earnings over the previous half is a fair reflection of our underlying performance. The picture of a high quality result also extends the divisional view of earnings with all divisions contributing to the higher result. And as the similar picture when you look at core earnings as well with all the areas contributing, you can see that other here has had some material swings from half to half and that's mostly from Treasury revenue and the release of economic overlay provisions. But this has had only a modest impact if you look at the two halves together.</p>
          <p>It's worth noting that while the group business unit had a few benefits in the half, they did not have the cost associated with the natural disasters where most of those were recorded in the operating divisions of BT and New Zealand.</p>
          <p>Credit growth was relatively modest over the last 12 months. At a system level, the banking statistics released last week, showed that, housing growth over the half has softened and that business lending has also been relatively weak. The business picture looks a bit stronger in recent months, but there is some volatility in the month-to-month numbers, and the underlying picture I think the business just remains mixed.</p>
          <p>For Westpac, apart from that system growth, there had been some specific factors behind our performance. The left of this slide shows mortgages growth, which has been solid in total growing around 0.8 times banking system. As we touched on last year, given the investment that we've made in our own distribution, this has been our priority for growth. And as a result, a proportion of business written through brokers has eased and that picture is true both for Westpac RBB and St. George, although the impact is more pronounced for St. George.</p>
          <p>We remain supportive of brokers, but our investment in our own brand networks is delivering faster growth. And that's going to have obvious benefits for us to our margin now and in the future. The right hand chart highlights the components of our business lending decline. With $4.3 billion around 50% of the fall is due to the deliberate winding back of commercial property exposures. Within that decline, we have continued to support our existing customers.</p>
          <p>At the end of the half, our total commercial property concentration is at about 7% of total committed exposures, TCE. And so, our book is now positioned to grow at a pace consistent with the system. Other business lending was subdued over the half with the continuing pay down of debt, mostly by institutional and corporate customers. And we had seen some modest lending growth with smaller businesses and SME customers.</p>
          <p>We've also seen some significant shifts in the composition of deposits in the half. Customer deposit growth exceeded loan growth by around $2 billion in the half and by almost $8 billion from a year earlier. With loan growth covered, we took the opportunity to firstly improve the quality of deposits, reducing balances of more price-sensitive single-product customers, and that was both in the at-call online space and in term deposits.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we restructured our at-call online pricing to lift the base rate and reduce the complexity and the size of the bonus premium. In our view, this gives a fairer return and more rewards ongoing relationships. Both these moves improved overall margins, but reduced deposit growth in the period. Excluding those strategies, customer deposit growth was a solid $16 billion (sic) [$17 billion] in the half.</p>
          <p>The good growth in our deposit base has also enabled us to wind back on wholesale funding with a more modest $12.4 billion in term money raised over the half. Combined with the excess of deposits, we've used the opportunity to further increase our funded liquid assets by $5 billion in the half and buyback $3.8 billion in government guaranteed debt. That buyback has helped smooth our debt maturity profile and it reduced our 2012 refinancing requirement by around 15%.</p>
          <p>Liquid assets growth over the year was all in the highest quality level one liquids. Our net interest margin outcome highlights the deposit strategies I've been talking about. You can see that in the second half of 2010, which is the left hand part of this slide, deposit spreads contracted sharply as customers took advantage of the rates on offer and higher deposit costs reduced the overall margin by 10 basis points. In this latest half, the impact was much reduced at just one basis point and that negative impact was mostly from mix.</p>
          <p>The rise in wholesale funding costs continued in the later half, although, the impact was also lower. And that's not surprising given the more modest amount of term funding that was raised. Repricing of loans, benefited margins in the half with both mortgages and business re-pricing contributing.</p>
          <p>In aggregate, if we look at the two halves together, so for the full 12 months, and take out the impact of the more volatile elements of markets and treasury interest income, we can see that margins have recovered five basis points in the half and are now little changed over the year at 2.08%. So that's only one basis point lower than we were 12 months ago. Overall margins of course are still five basis points lower than 12 months ago and that's because treasury income was lower. Given that over the 12 months, we've also funded $6 billion of additional liquid assets, $5 billion in the last half, and increase deposit funding as a proportion of loans and maintain our stable funding ratio, this feels like an appropriate management trade-off of balance sheet risk and margin return.</p>
          <p>Turning to non-interest income and after a period of rebasing, we're now in a much more stable base from which to grow. Fees and commissions income was higher from good activity levels and the gradual reprocessing of business line fees. Growth in insurance income was also up, about 6%, compared with 12 months earlier. And notwithstanding the sharp increase in Home and Contents claims from flood and cyclone victims, revenue growth over the prior half for wealth was still positive at about 2%.</p>
          <p>Trading income is stabilizing from the very high levels we saw during the GFC; and in the half, represented a much more sustainable level of 12% of total non-interest income. Looking at markets and treasury income in a bit more detail, shows that revenue in the half was slightly lower in both the customer and markets business and from treasury risk management activities. This outcome was consistent with the lower market volatility we experienced including a relatively stable RBA cash rate.</p>
          <p>Customer flows have continued to improve and customer revenue held up well and represented about three quarters of total markets income. We've clearly had to absorb a marked reduction in the contribution of revenue from these activities, and the last half revenue in total is $250 million lower than a year earlier. This has been a pretty material headwind, but we think, it's now largely stabilized with the latest result only $45 million lower than the prior half.</p>
          <p>Importantly, the lower, but sustainable revenue results are a result of stabilizing, the market stabilizing &#x2013; market environment or lower market volatility, and it's not from us reducing our risk appetite. And I said to the team this morning, we continue to support and invest in these activities. We've got experienced and talented risk managers, and I'm going to be happy to manage the problem of a jump in trading revenue at some point in the future.</p>
          <p>Our expense result is one of the highlights of the half, with additional merger synergies and productivity savings from the program we commenced last year, contributing to a 1% reduction in expenses and growth of only 2% on a year earlier. We've continued to invest in both distribution and through our SIPs program, although, the nature of the SIPs expenditure has seen little impact on expenses this half. And this will change in future periods as the expense components of SIPs increases and the amortization of capitalized expenses inevitably kicks up.</p>
          <p>Our capitalization balances have increased as we foreshadowed as most of our investment spending is capitalized at this stage of the projects. And I'll highlight that impact when we look at capital ratios a little later.</p>
          <p>One of the changes we are seeing is that more of our project spending is being directed to address new regulatory and compliance requirements, and that burden is slightly to continue at least over the next few year. What has been placing was the significant progress made on the productivity initiatives. There've been a wide range of these initiatives that have made it easier for customers to deal with us, and in the process release excess capacity. And this provided the desired expense offset to the investments we are making.</p>
          <p>There are three divisions, I'd like to spend a little more time on. Starting with Westpac Retail and Business Banking. And Westpac RBB has seen a focused and consistent investment in the Westpac Local strategy in the past and the most recent half has begun to demonstrate the benefits of that strategy.</p>
          <p>Earnings growth in the half was good at both the cash and core earnings level. And this was supported by good sales and customer retention. As this chart shows in the top half, in mortgages, RBB has consistently grown ahead of the banking system through its proprietary distribution as we'd hoped and as we'd planned.</p>
          <p>This result has also been supported by the deepening of customer relationships. We've been particularly successful with Wealth, where already high levels of general insurance cross-seller further picked up and we've lifted the number of leads originated. As a result, interviews are up 15% and advisory fees in BT are also higher. And you can also see that in the proportion of customers with four or more products, which improved 80 basis points in the half.</p>
          <p>On the business front, Gail mentioned the strength of our customers force. And you can see that in the chart, where our net promoter score has increased and the lead on peers has also widened. This success gives us confidence that the Westpac Local strategy is having the desired impact at the local business level. And we will benefit from the further &#x2013; future resurgence in business activity.</p>
          <p>St. George has been through a period of repositioning taking it closer to its strong regional roots. And St. George has also reduced the concentration to commercial property lending. Similar to the Westpac RBB story, you can also see that the performance of St. George in the mortgage market has been significantly impacted by the winding back in the use of brokers, particularly in those geographies, where their direct representation is light.</p>
          <p>When you look at growth through our own networks, the performance has been sound. This combination of commercial property and less broker lending has seen limited growth in lending balances, but improved margins. And so revenue growth has continued. With the repositioning of this division completed, combined with a range of initiatives to restore momentum, including the launch of Bank of Melbourne, we're expecting improved growth in coming periods.</p>
          <p>Very pleasingly, the asset quality of St. George business exposures has clearly improved over the half. And the division recorded reduced amounts of business stressed exposures across all categories, watch this substandard and impaired. BT has also delivered healthy financial growth, notwithstanding the increased cost of House and Contents insurance claims that have been associated with the natural disasters.</p>
          <p>On the fun side of the business, the strength of the platforms of BT Wrap and Asgard were very evident in the half with 39% of new flows captured. Super for Life has also continued its excellent run and our Corporate Super business has also been growing share.</p>
          <p>Life insurance has been one area that's received more attention in recent periods, and we have improved BT's life insurance offerings to independent financial advisory groups including from building Life on Wrap. The growth here has been excellent with a 20% compound annual growth rate in earnings for the past two years and Life in-force premiums were up 11% over the past 12 months.</p>
          <p>General insurance has, of course, been impacted by the range of natural disasters that occurred over the period, impacted BT's cash earnings by $39 million in the half. From a risk management perspective, we positioned the business to be protected by the reinsurance arrangements we had in place. And had those contracts not been in place, the impact would have been more than two times the level recorded.</p>
          <p>Haven't been broadly stable for the last three halves, the most recent periods are improved an important improvement in asset quality. We've used this chart for some time now as it represents a consistent picture of our customer exposures, which are demonstrating financial stress. And you can see that in the most recent half, total stressed exposures reduced by 35 basis points or a bit more than 10% with watchlist and substandard exposures down by about 20%.</p>
          <p>We saw a modest increase in mortgage delinquencies due to both some underlying deterioration and some measurement factors. But losses remain low and the security of the portfolio is very strong. Net new and increased impaired assets were down 13% from the previous half. But deterioration in some stressed exposures to impaired continued, whilst write-offs was slightly lower. In all total impaired exposures to TCE were little changed.</p>
          <p>Whilst new impaired assets are beginning to fall, particularly for larger exposures, stress from the rise in the A dollar continues. The commercial property sector remains our largest stressed portfolio and within that, exposures in South-East Queensland are experiencing more difficulty, where the oversupply of properties is still playing out. Nevertheless, we are seeing conditions overall gradually improve, including more companies upgraded and returning to full health.</p>
          <p>The total impairment charge for the half at $463 million was down $114 million or 20% compared to the previous half. Most of that decline was because of reduced new individually assessed provisions, which were lower consistent with less new impaired assets.</p>
          <p>Collectively assessed provisions were $43 million benefit for the half, which was $7 million better than the previous half. This slide shows the composition of that $43 million and you can see the impact of reduced and new economic overlays.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding that we've had a net release of those overlay provisions, our provisioning cover remains at the top of the sector. We've collectively assessed provisions to credit weighted assets at 1.38%. And our impaired assets also remained well covered by provisions.</p>
          <p>The past half also saw good improvement in our capital ratios with organic growth after dividends adding 41 basis points to the Tier 1 ratio. The agreed benefit of the St. George tax consolidation for the 2011 tax year also contributed 10 basis points, while the high deduction from increased software capitalization balances reduced the capital ratio by 7 basis points.</p>
          <p>It's important to highlight that we have an additional 30 basis points in capital to flow through from tax consolidation over the next three years, and so our underlying capital position is even stronger. We have a little more clarity of how the Tier 1 ratio will be capital on the Basel III, especially around market risk. And our best estimate is that the additional deductions would take about 120 basis points from our common equity ratio today, which would leave us at around 6.75%.</p>
          <p>Of course, upper calculations involve a number of additional conservative measurements, which we estimate are equivalent to 285 basis points. So our common equity ratio on a fully harmonized basis at 9.6% is a strong picture both locally and on a global comparison. And we feel in good shape to transition to the new capital requirements on the Basel III, which are likely to commence at the start of 2013.</p>
          <p>The strength of this capital position and the current stage in the earnings cycle, where risk-weighted asset growth is low or negative and earnings growth is supported by reducing in payment provisions has allowed us to modestly increase the payout ratio. Our interim dividend of $0.76 per share represents a payout ratio of 72%. The $0.76 dividend also conforms to being back on a path of steadily increasing dividend payments, which has been a hallmark of the Westpac Group over the past decade.</p>
          <p>We've had a relatively low take up of the dividend reinvestment option in recent halves, which we continued to offer without a discount. And this has seen a small dilution impact to earnings per share.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we are expecting the second half to evidence broadly similar conditions and trends. System asset growth is expected to remain modest, perhaps picking up later in the half, but the improved momentum we're experiencing sees us in a likely stronger position in the second half particularly as business lending begins to improve.</p>
          <p>Given the work we've done, focusing on our proprietary distribution, we expect that the returns from any growth should also be good. Margins for the half will benefit from the full period impact of pricing changes already made, and these will offset the continuing impact of higher funding costs.</p>
          <p>On the expense side, a further reduction in costs is not expected, as salary increases processed in January fully flow-through and as we see the level of expenses associated with our SIPs program and compliance rise a little. However, productivity benefits will be ongoing and disciplines maintained.</p>
          <p>We are confident in the relative quality of our assets, whilst mortgage delinquencies will likely rise in the short-term in the regions impacted from national disasters and economic pressures. Other elements in stressed exposures should continue to improve. We're entering the second half with more confidence, and while there remain global uncertainties and regulatory challenges, all our divisions are well-placed to grow in their target segments.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Let me hand back to Gail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Phil. And let me conclude by touching on the economic environments, our strategic journey and priorities ahead. On the economy, Australia continues to have a sound and flexible growth path with an enviable set of metrics on growth, unemployment and inflation. I think as we're all aware, there are clearly different dynamics that play for different industry sectors, the so-called multispeed economy. And I think that's something we just need to get used to.</p>
          <p>Our lowlight for the half has been the unusual number of natural disasters that has created so much stress for those affected and has resulted in short-term negative economic impact. For Australia, the rebuilding work has already begun and is expected to add to GDP in 2012.</p>
          <p>Globally, uncertainties remain high with a variety of challenges across various jurisdictions. Not surprising with one considers the magnitude of the financial crisis that we just come through. From Australian point of view, the flexibility of our economy and our connectedness to Asia are key strength that I believe will continue to support a solid growth path for the period ahead.</p>
          <p>Consumer and business caution has been a feature of this half, and while it has resulted in subdued credit growth, it has also put Australians in a healthier position with strength in balance sheet. This is an important point and together with a very low unemployment, underpins are quite confident.</p>
          <p>The key question is when will business credit pick up in a meaningful way. We have, over the last year, been more cautious than our peers on this point, and based assessment for us is towards the end of calendar year 2011. Our forecast for business credit for the 2012 year is 4% with housing remaining around 7%.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our strategic journey, in early 2008, we asked ourselves the question of where we would like Westpac to be on our 200th anniversary in 2017. And while that date is a long way at that time, it gave us scope to think broadly and deeply and to be bold. So the 2008 year can basically described as a transforming year and we focused on four key themes.</p>
          <p>Firstly, developing our customers into strategy, of course, dealing with the global financial crisis. The St. George merger is a very big agenda item for that year and in getting to grips with our underlying IT environment and its issues.</p>
          <p>2009 was a year of strengthening and integrating, starting of course with ensuring a stronger balance sheet particularly with regard to capital. We strengthened our retail distributions starting out with our Westpac Local initiative. The integration work on the St. George merger was largely tackled during the 2009 year, a very heavy element of completion in that year.  And our IT strategy and blueprint work was developed and of course, we put a significant focus on stability.</p>
          <p>2010 was the year of significant structural adjustments and there are many of those. Certainly, a big focus on funding, improving the quality of our profile of funding and indeed of tenor of our funding. The repositioning work of St. George taking it back to its regional roots, reducing broker reliance across both Westpac and St. George and reducing our commercial property exposures. Those are the year of very significant fee reductions and our SIPs and productivity programs got underway. So now in 2011 and future years, we have a very strong focus on execution and delivery, making sure we realize the full benefits of all the initiatives that we put in place.</p>
          <p>The theme for the first half is one of building momentum. And we fully expect to continue to build momentum through the year, leveraging off our strong balance sheet, current and prior investments. Our multi-brand model will reach a new stage of maturity. In a few short months, we'll launch the Bank of Melbourne providing Victorians with a local brand and a genuine choice in a market that is missing a strong local player.</p>
          <p>We will continue to deepen customer relationships, particularly through our super insurance and deposit products. Our executive team has extensive wealth experience and they work very cohesively together. A huge advantage is delivering the cultural change that's necessary for a bank to meet all the wealth needs of customers.</p>
          <p>In our institutional bank, we will drive deep customer relationships through our superior transactional banking capabilities and our effective risk management. The period will also see a significant increase in work associated with the extensive regulatory and compliance agenda. And this will require proactive and disciplined management.</p>
          <p>Finally, we'll methodically execute on our SIPs program and continue to deliver on our productivity initiatives. Overall, we're driving for quality and we're driving for consistency. And we are approaching the future with quiet confidence. So let me invite Phil back to the stage, and we'd be happy to take questions.</p>

          <p>Okay, I might take a question down the front, Jarrod there. Thanks.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse. Two questions. First of all you are talking about payout ratio targeting sort of around the 70% mark &#x2013; 72% in the first half implies 70% or sub-70% in the second half. I just wanted to get some clarification on how you look at that, and then just how &#x2013; because your organic capital growth generation is actually quite strong, why you wouldn't consider even pushing that payout ratio higher? Then second question just on business lending and your forecast of 4%. Latest sets of RBA financial aggregates in the last two months have seen a bit of a rebound. I just wanted a bit more color of what you are seeing at the coalface in terms of where that lending is going and why you are probably a bit more conservative than what we can see in terms of initial signs of a rebound?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's start with the capital question, and then move to the business. I might actually ask either Rob Chapman &#x2013; sorry, Rob Coombe or Rob Whitfield can say, like to add to what they're seeing in the pipeline within the business field. On the capital one, it's not just the payout ratio we look at. It's actually also the trajectory and as you can see, if you look at Phil's slide that he presented, it's a pattern that we're looking for as well. There was only one period during the midst of the global financial crisis and SIP change done, but for the rest of it. There's a steady pattern of continued improvement. That's more or less track to payout ratio, but we look at both. We think the current payout ratio is appropriate to 72% level. For this half, bear in mind where we are in the cycle. It's a slower credit growth environment and a lower impairment environment, so we think it's about right for now. Philip, don't know if you want to add to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I just think that the &#x2013; so the question a bit behind a bit behind it if I'm right, Jarrod is that, you know is there potential for capital management talk activities, and I guess &#x2013; I think that the answer is, it feels a bit early for us. We'd like to see the details from after in terms of how the capital is going to be calculated and get the final arrangements. Get it down from the Basel Committee. And then we'll have a better idea at that point. But the point that I did make, and then we feel strongly that is that we feel in a good position today from that capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on business lending, it's being subdued as you know the whole period, in fact, business lending, system business credit has been negative to flat. There's been some modest pickup and it's different and different segments. In the SME area, we're certainly seeing some good pick up in recent months. But we think it's still going to be subdued in overall terms, in the near-term. We think it's more likely to pick up towards the backend of the 2011 year. But for a bit more color, which Rob? Rob Whitfield &#x2013; Whitfield, would you like to add something to this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. Thanks, Gail. Look, in terms of <mark type="ph" /> institutional lending (42:37), we have seen a fairly subdued and a continuation of the deleveraging, Jarrod, but we would say that has really run its course. So we think for our own books at around the end of calendar year 2010 that was probably about the bottom of that part of the cycle. So we do expect to see an increase from here. In terms of the early signs M&amp;A activity, certainly is picking up. However, that M&amp;A activity is taking longer from gestation through to conclusion. And so boards are taking more time to make more considered decisions, and then to actually execute the transaction. It's a great forward indicator in terms of the top end for a business pick up. So it is there, we are seeing it. Activity is coming but we think it's just going to happen and evolve at a more sort of considered pace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we &#x2013; I'll say that the 4% rate probably is reflective of an annualized view of it and I think we had a bit of a slow start. I think if you were looking forward from the 12 months from here, it's probably, we would see it more being in the single digits to middle to higher single digits. That's based upon the confidence that we're seeing from business. The profitability of business obviously the general outlook for the economy. There's some negative aspects as well, the high Aussie dollar is hurting some sectors as well and we're yet to see consumer confidence flow through as well. But based on what we've seen in the past couple of months where we've had positive system growth in business lending, of which we have participated in and matched, we would be expecting that to pick up over the next 12 month from here higher than the 4% figure that we talked about.</p>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take a question from the phones from Craig Williams, Citigroup please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Firstly on page 16 of your release, could you provide a bit of a reconciliation between your sort of spot loan balances at the end of September and March and the average loans and other receivables balance that we see for the period? That's my first question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Craig, it's Phil. The lower average growth rate compared to the spot growth rate simply reflects that we actually had a decline in business balances in the first quarter and that's translates through into a lower average for the whole period. So that was the major factor behind that differential, if that's your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, I presumed that was the case. Thank you. And second question, just looking at your bad debt charge impairment expenses 19 bases points in the half, in fact I think on a second quarter run rate basis the number might have been something more like 16 basis points. You have noted that impaireds are trending down, so I suppose my question is how low can you go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's lower than the average of the cycle. The average of the cycle would be more in the sort of mid-20s sort of range and as you know with cycles like these, you have a number of years, more years below the average of the cycle and then just a couple of years that actually spike it up and pull over the overall average. So, we wouldn't expect to see much improvement from where we are in the short run. We would expect to see a sort of continuation of the current pattern with regards to impairments. We are, as I think our results show, seeing more in the way of stressed assets moving back to health, but nevertheless, there's still a fair bit of stress out there. So Phil, would you answer that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jon Mott from UBS. Just following on from that, if you just look over to page 80 of the investor discussions, it's got some pretty good charts on delinquencies, so I'll just give you a sec to look over. What you can see there is that across all states, mortgage delinquencies are really picking up. It's not just the Queensland flood issue, but also the 30-day delinquencies picking up a lot more aggressively than the 90-days, so I presume that will flow through over time and I think some of the comments you made it's around 2007 and '08 vintage mortgages, the first-time owners really coming to struggle a bit with the pressures on the their budgets given that the federal budget is going to be tough next week, there are probably going to more rate rises, the high Aussie dollar coming through.</p>
          <p>It's not too hard to assume that you're going to see even more pressure on the consumer and on many industries throughout Australia, so what gives you such confidence to start releasing economic overlays through to the P&amp;L when we're seeing stress come from our consumers at the early stages and albeit off a low base? And that will flow through to a number of other risk industries we're seeing profit downgrades come through very regularly through the market at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jonathan, I think what we've seen over the course of the global financial crisis was &#x2013; the cycle play through exactly as we would have expected Phase I, top institutional and single name exposures, direct impacts there, the inflow through the commercial, the commercial sectors in SME and now we're into the third phase, and it's exactly what you would expect to see a pickup in consumer delinquencies. We do think it's off the small base, and we think it's very manageable. It's an orderly pickup, but it's exactly what we would have expected to see.</p>
          <p>The overall health of the portfolio just remains exceptional. The other element that underpins our confidence here is unemployment remains in very, very good shape. And consumer balance sheets are in better shape than they've actually been. Prior to the global financial crisis, you were in a position where consumers were spending more than they were earning. So for every $1 that they were earning, they were spending more like $1.05 or $1.10, they're now in a position where they're saving 10% of what they earn. So they're saving $0.10 of that $1.</p>
          <p>So their own balance sheets are in better shape, they've been quite cautious. They had a shock and they're being quite cautious. But we would expect to see delinquencies pick up. It's not flowing through the losses though, loss rates remain exceptionally low.</p>
          <p>As you know in Australia we've got an overall mortgage book of close to $300 billion with close to 1.5 million accounts of customers. And our actual losses in Australia was something like $32 million for the half. So they're not flowing through the losses, and that's a function of the very strong underwriting standards that we have, the approach that we take towards assessing credit and assessing a customers' affordability.</p>
          <p>So, feeling very confident there. Let me ask Philip to talk more about the overlay and the factors that actually sit behind that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and maybe I could also just pick up, because I think the consumer delinquencies is going to be something that is going to attract attention in this reporting season. And I think it's &#x2013; you picked up the point around the measurement factor here, Jon, which is that because we did quite a large amount of mortgage lending in '07, '08, '09, and because history shows us that delinquencies kind of reach a peak in that two to three-year period after drawdown, what you're seeing is that pool of large loans coming through and reaching that period of maturity and lifting the overall average of our delinquency feature. And because new lending has been quite a bit less than that, the lull of delinquencies you get on the new lending of the book are not there to help offset that. And so, that's what drags the average up. And so that's &#x2013; it's a statistical issue.</p>
          <p>The actual delinquencies that we're getting from those cohorts are a bit high, but not dramatically higher than what we've seen in the past. It's more just a statistical factor coming through. And it's not particularly connected to first-time buyers. First-time buyers continue to perform better than the average. But they were a bigger part of that overall lending pool. So you're seeing that in their overall picture.</p>
          <p>On the economic overlays, half of the overlay you'll see is actually a release of specific overlays around the property cycle and that's not only reflecting the fact that, if you look in aggregate across Australia, the commercial property sector is healthier with vacancies lower et cetera. It's also because over time, it's harder to argue that you need to keep it in an overlay, and that it hasn't been recognized somewhere in an individual exposure.</p>
          <p>And so through time, we've got to a point where we feel very confident that almost all of our problems in property &#x2013; we know about, they're recognized in our gradings. They are recognized in our individual or collective provisions and so, you can't justify holding it as a provision &#x2013; in an overlay and that's what is behind that.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs. Just a question on pre-provision growth and in particular, I note that there's some quarter-on-quarter noise from time-to-time, but just wanted to get a sense on your quarter-on-quarter growth in pre-provision earnings was actually flat, despite the fact that you actually had two additional months of loan re-pricing in that quarter.</p>
          <p>I understand that cost inflation was one of the issues and you mentioned that in the quarterly update that you had some wage increases, which is one of the headwinds you had. Can you just talk to though &#x2013; what may have caused just the flat growth over the quarters for the market and, more importantly, as we look forward, what gives you confidence that you're going to see improving momentum into the subsequent half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the factors was less in the way of market income. So, treasury and markets income was lower in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. So, that would be one factor. Our actual core businesses are absolutely evidencing momentum and a deep momentum in activity. So, lead indicator momentum as well as in terms of applications going through and applications being approved. So, that was one of the bigger factors in the second quarter relative to the first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean and the other two are insurance costs, clearly they were much bigger in the second quarter than the first quarter. We took our provision at the end of December, but &#x2013; the magnitude of the floods in Queensland and the cyclone that knock on floods in Victoria. All of those things were second quarter events which actually contribute much more to the insurance costs.</p>
          <p>And then, the third factor which is not huge, but which was evidently, we've seen over the last two years actually is that that has corporates have sort of repaid debt in the December quarter prior to December balance sheet rule off. That generates establishment fees being crystallized in the Institutional Bank. And so we've extended to have a better December quarter than it has March quarter. So some technical stuff, some trading stuff and some claim stuff. But as Gail said, the underlying business actually grew quarter-on-quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to get an idea on the cost, obviously a very good performance in this half. You mentioned a couple of headwinds. It's also just is looking, there are a couple of tailwinds as well. You've got spot imbalances in the number of staff, well below where the average is. So, it will help kick through in the second half.</p>
          <p>And just a bit of an idea as to where the productivity improvements are going to be tracking for the second half? Just trying to get an idea as to exactly where this cost picture goes. And if you could wrap into there the &#x2013; when the amortization expense comes through for SIPs and what sort of profile we should be looking for there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't you go for it, Philip?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I think the bits that we have identified where we think we'll have additional costs, which is &#x2013; the full impact of the higher salary and wages that we pay, that's just a natural consequence of that increase happened in January. The SIPs amortization will pick up, but it will actually be quite modest in the next six months. But some of the SIP's expenses will actually drop through the bottom line, a bit more of that will drop through the bottom line rather than to be capitalized.</p>
          <p>We kind of &#x2013; as you look at the big projects, we're sort of moving through that capitalization phase and there'll be a period in which we've got less going on to the balance sheet and more dropping through to the bottom line. I think there the major factors you've pointed out that we've got &#x2013; one of the ongoing benefits of productivity program is that trajectory on FTE costs and we would expect that to help offset that. And we continue to look for more ways, and particularly in the kind of lending processes, we still think that there are some clunky things that we do that can reduce rework, that can reduce duplication, that can reduce doing things quite differently in different parts of the company.</p>
          <p>So that will all help us to both deliver more time for the Relationship Managers with their customers and our costs. I think we took most of those benefits in terms of costs in the first half. We to have more of those benefits back into the Relationship Managers with their customers in the second half. So we put all that into the pot and we believe that, for you to have an expectation that costs are going to continue to climb is too aggressive and which is what we called out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then is it fair to assume then the rate of productivity improvements will start to slow or is the first half have normal as to what you would expect on a half-on-half basis? I mean can we do anything with that number? Can we annualize it or how should we be looking at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think the issue is that we would see productivity both in costs out and revenue up from more engagement and happier customers. And what I'm pointing to is that I think that that productivity mix is actually going to shift more to the latter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. I just want to ask a question about the Westpac Retail and Business Bank. There seems to be a lot of good things going on. You've got a decent deposit growth, you've got mortgage growth above 16, you've got more than four months benefit of standard variable rate rise, deposit pressure is easing. So there's a lot of good things going on in terms of lead indicators and yet revenue growth was only 2% half-on-half and the margin was down. So I'm just wondering if you could provide an explanation as to why some of those indicators aren't playing through to better revenue growth and also give some sort of outlook for revenue growth in this division going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well you're right, there are some really good indicators there and I think they bode well for the next period. I mean, what Rob has done is an outstanding job of actually managing for his mix of business, deposits in particular. We used the period quite fully to actually make sure that we get the deposit profile that we'd actually like to have. And that did result in some improved margin of his deposit business. So you're going to see more of that actually flow through into the second half and more of the re-pricing on the mortgage side actually flow through into the second half as well. I don't know, Rob, if you'd like to add anything to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean just on the margin, we book our line fees in non-interest income. So if that was reflected back into interest income, you would've seen a flatter margin performance there, so if you look at the difference between the two. The other thing I'll say, it's not &#x2013; I wouldn't say it's a huge factor at this point in time, but it's significant and will be growing at the time. We don't book the revenue generated for the wealth businesses in RBB as well. That obviously gets booked in a separate business. But if that was attributed into the P&amp;L, you would see a different outcome there as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last thing I'd mention is they are still of course rising cost of funds and that business had the biggest growth in terms of lending, both mortgages and business lending. And so it could absorb the highest factor there with regard to those increasing costs of funds. So it's growing at a less accelerated rate than last year, but it's still there.</p>

          <p>Can I refer to page 98 of the results, the provision roll forward question for Phil. Phil, if you have a look at the collective provision move, it's gone down from 3.4 billion to 3.188 billion. And when you have a look at the components of that, we see pretty consistently a write-offs figure, which I'd always been led to believe that's where you basically collectively provide for the expected impairments on the credit provision &#x2013; on the credit card book and when they come through, you write them off there. Now to me, that feels more like an individually assessed &#x2013; that feels more like a specific loan loss than a vague kind of collective provision.</p>
          <p>If we net that out, then it means that the individually &#x2013; like the specific loan loss charge was substantially higher. My question is how much longer do you reckon in this environment we can see Westpac basically augmenting earnings or basically reducing the collective provision? I understand all the problems that you have getting it through the accountants, but I'm just wondering, I suppose, when you have a look at the result, it's a good result. But that's largely what drove it, is that reduction, the collective provision. Can you give us some future direction on the quantum of that collective provision balance?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You're right. That write-off in collective assessed provisions is against credit cards and personal loans. so It has to do with &#x2013; as those customers go longer than 90 days delinquent, we write them off. It's seen as impaired if it comes up through the collectively &#x2013; it's accumulated through collectively assessed provisions and then written off against them as well. I mean if you'd like to put them into individually assessed provisions in your model, <mark type="ph" /> Brian (1:00:44), obviously that's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I do but my point is that  The total charge by about &#x2013; that net reduction in the collective provision boosted this result by about a quarter of $1 billion. Now I'm just wondering if we can get some direction on how much longer that will continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look I think if you look at the change in total, in payment charge as I showed in a different chart. Actually, it's to do with lower individually-assessed provisions against what was lower new impaired assets. The actual collectively-assessed provision charge was only $7 million different half-on-half. So, the story there in terms of how the provisions charge changed over the half is really one, which is totally consistent with a better-impaired asset story.</p>
          <p>In terms of your bigger question which is how long can we get earnings supported by lower impairment charges, I think Gail made the point that we think impairment charges can head lower but we're not going to see the same kind of benefit that we've seen in the past. But we've been dealing with a very low credit environment as well. And part of the reason that we haven't had better results is actually average asset growth has been quite low and it was again in this period. But if you're like us and you believe that that will pick up, then we would expect to see our bottom line more supported by core earnings and less supported by the reduction in impairment charges and that's what the company is setting out to achieve.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you presume to get your interface with APRA you've got an expected lost charge, which ANZ actually disclosed. In Australia, I think from memory it's probably mid 30s. Could you tell us what that figure is? First of the 19% result.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't disclose it. We disclose the regulatory expected lost, which you can see in a day. That obviously deals with the downturn loss expectation. But I think as Ian did explained last &#x2013; yesterday, that expected loss number is a bit lower the average number that Gail talked to. It's a number that probably never be right in a period and for most of a decade, you're going to be below that number. So, we haven't put it out for that very reason because it suggests to people that's what you should expect to get, well, maybe over 10 years that's what you should expect to get but not in any one particular period.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it'd be totally wrong to suggest that Westpac has forgotten that. I mean, it's something that is deeply etched in a way that we manage risk and it's why we maintain sector leading coverage in our impairment provisions. It's why we have deliberately set out to reduce our commercial property exposures over the last two or three years. If we've been chasing revenue, we would have held on to those exposures. But we've actually re-titled the portfolio to reduce risks. So I think there's a lot of things that we've done to demonstrate that we are and want to be considered a first rate risk manager.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. A couple of questions relating to Phil's considerations for the second half. Firstly, just with the comment around pricing changes to offset rising funding costs, should we read that as you would expect group NIMs in the second half to be at least flat on the first half, if not up? Then the second question just related to the SIPs expense going forward. Last year you mentioned that you expected to capitalize half of the SIPs expenditure and in this deck, you're saying that you expect to capitalize most of the SIPs expenditures. So I'm just interested in the reasons behind that and what sort of headroom that gives you on costs near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the margins point, I think the best way to use for the second half relative to the first half is stable. Clearly, there's some benefits flowing through from pricing decisions already implemented on mortgages and deposits, so that's on the upside. On the other side, there's continued increase in funding costs. So we're &#x2013; the best word we're using for expectations for second half is stable and that's on margins.</p>
          <p>On the SIPs, it's very much a function of what the actual program is that's being implemented, because some carry high levels of capitalization than others. So for example, aiming to do with data centers, which is a infrastructure, much higher capitalized charge than some other SIPs programs, which draw more on salaried people and there's more direct expense associated with that. So, I think there was some shift in timing around which programs we did in what order that actually translated it to some of that shift.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:45), excuse me. Group costs of about 44 net operating &#x2013; operating expenses to net operating income, and you've got in BT, you're running at about 50, which has come down from about 52. Have you got some sort of clarification on targets for that as a percentage, going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think we would normally expect the wealth business to run with higher overall expense for revenue generated, that's sort of an industry average. But I think BT would also, and I'm sure Brad would be keen for me to point out, has actually dropped that ratio quite a lot in the last two or three years as they've improved the processing of the business and done a lot more end-to-end sort of functionality in how investments are handled.</p>
          <p>Overall, we've said we don't have a target for expense to income as one of our peers has but we would expect that as we deliver the benefits of our SIPs program and get the benefits of these real scale economies of bringing St. George and Westpac together that we would expect our cost to income to track lower. And we still are firmly of the belief that that's likely and it will happen particularly as we deliver the real big benefits of SIPs, which is 2013 and beyond.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just one on looking at the expected presumption growth for the second half and also into next year, just the funding consequences of that. On slide 13 you've got the mix of customer deposits where you've rolled off the high yielding deposits and rolled that into other areas. When we look at the APRA stats the household deposits haven't actually grown during the period, so it looks like the growth in the deposit base is being funded through the business deposit book. If business credit growth is expected to come back, you would expect the business deposit growth to come down.</p>
          <p>Therefore, how are you thinking about funding that growth, going forward? Do you need to get back to system levels of growth in the household deposit book and, if so, what's going to be the margin consequence seeing as you have not grown that book for six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll certainly expect in the second half to be growing at system growth for our retail deposits and we'd expect to do that without material margin erosion and that's because we've used the past six months of lower credit growth to actually really adjust the mix of our portfolio in retail deposits. So, we've rolled off some of the deposits that aren't associated with our customers that actually had a deep relationship with us that are more, more price sensitive, more sort of hot money, if you will. So we've rolled those off.</p>
          <p>We've also adjusted the structure of our e-saver account with the bonus saver account so that we've actually raised the baseline for that account. But we've reduced the amount of incentives or upfront that's associated with that. So we've got a better profile for that account that we think is actually fairer and more transparent as well.</p>
          <p>So having made those structural changes to the mix of our portfolio, we fully expect to grow at system growth for Retail deposits and indeed, to grow at system growth for business deposits as well.</p>
          <p>But we've been managing the overall profile of our maturities pretty well too. And as you can see, we've looked ahead into 2012 and actually, done some pre-purchase there of the government maturities, the government-guaranteed maturities that are falling due in that year.</p>
          <p>So, I think we've absolutely going to be growing deposits at system. We continue to have very strong names and offshore wholesale markets. Covered bonds will be coming towards the end of the year and we'd expect to be out of the blocks with that. As well as actually, we've got a manageable maturity profile for next year.</p>

          <p>Thank you. So I'm Victor German from Nomura. If I could just get your comments that you know in the full year results. You've given guidance on positive <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:10:02) for this year, which you've clearly delivered in this half. Should we take that guidance as a full-year guidance or would you expect to continue to deliver positive <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:10:08) half on half in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we haven't started to give positive guiding or guidance, particularly on this particular topic. I think we've shown that we can manage costs well. And I think that we've shown we can manage costs well relative to revenues. So we're very cognizant of revenue trends.</p>
          <p>A big prize for us is that we grow our revenue quite a bit higher and then we'd be happy to see cost grow quite a bit higher, too. So that would be a much better mix for us overall. So we're going to retain some flexibility on growing our costs if it's going to support a high level of revenue.</p>
          <p>So we're not giving guidance particularly on it, but very cognizant of the various levers we have.</p>

          <p>It's Brett Le Mesurier from BBY. Question on market shares and growth. Residential lending has been below system as you relied less on brokers. Do you see that you're going to be performing at system going forward for the next six months? And could you also say for business lending in general that you would expect to be growing at system in the next six months as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brett, if you look at the different components of our business, Westpac RBB has actually grown above system the whole way through the year. So in this past six months, it have grown to 1.1, 1.2 and for the March to September six months, even higher than that. So Westpac RBB has grown above system the whole way through and had really had outstanding customer change in something like 99% of customers retained in that brand.</p>
          <p>I've seen at St. George that we'd had the softness in mortgage volumes. So they've grown well below system and that's been largely driven by the reprioritization of first parties over third parties. And it's been most marked in those geographies where St. George doesn't have as strong a physical footprints itself.</p>
          <p>So going forward we'd certainly expect Westpac RBB to continue with its strong momentum and continue to grow above system. St. George, we'd expect it to grow at system, around system, in its core geographies which are New South Wales and South Australia because that's where their own proprietary distribution exists. So that's what we'll be expecting to see there. Obviously as Bank of Melbourne comes on stream and as we roll those branches out, you can see a pick up there, too. But that's a little bit over the horizon for the moment.</p>
          <p>Business credit, we similarly expect a similar pattern. Westpac RBB has grown above system and we expect to see that continue. There's really strong momentum in that business based on the investments that we've made. And at St. George we've been through a very significant repositioning, I suppose around commercial property. And there's still deleveraging going on in commercial property as a run-offs in commercial property within the St. George business. But we certainly expect to see a pick up, again, New South Wales and South Australia in particular.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I think, to anything to add &#x2013; on top of that is that the Institutional Bank balances you heard from Rob earlier, outlook looks good and we think we're well-positioned. But, in any particular short period, the balances can get really moved around by the kind of transactions that they do. And that can distort growth in any particular short-term, whether they've taken a deal on in one period and underwritten it on to the balance sheet and then sold it into the market in the next period, that can distort the period-on-period growth. But in terms of our share of credit activity in Institutional Bank, we'd absolutely be expecting to get our fair share of that.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's <mark type="ph" /> Piers from Southern Cross (1:13:57). If you just turn to slide 20, you know the slide indicates that you're going backwards in WA in terms of mortgages. Is the slack being taken up by Westpac Local or do you have plans to bring in another regional bank?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Western Australia, yeah, you're right because we've obviously deprioritized the mortgage-broker channel, St. George has very little presence within Western Australia from a retail point of view. It's just literally a handful of branches that they have there. So, you would expect to see exactly what the results are with regards to mortgages there. Westpac RBB is doing well, as expected, well as expected within Western Australia. We're not trying to pick up the slack from St. George but they're travelling very well, in Western Australia.</p>
          <p>And no, we don't have any plans around any further regional branch at the moment.</p>
