          <p>Good day, welcome to the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2011 first quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.PMI.com.</p>
          <p>During the our call today we'll be talking about results for the first quarter 2011 and comparing them with the same period in 2010 unless otherwise stated. References to PMI volumes are for PMI shipments, industry volume, and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions, which for this purposes of this presentation, also include our business combination with Fortune Tobacco Corporation in the Philippines.</p>
          <p>Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating company's income, or OCI, is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You'll find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides which are posted on our website.</p>
          <p>Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. It's now my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, our Chief Financial Officer. Herman.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We reported a very strong financial performance during the first quarter with, most notably, an increase in our adjusted diluted EPS of 14.4% excluding currency. The events in Japan and North Africa, while distressing, only resulted in temporary logistical disruptions for our company and did not have a material financial impact on our overall results in the quarter. Thus again emphasizing the advantages of our business' truly global footprint.</p>
          <p>As reflected in early February, our organic volume performance was dampened by anticipated softness in Japan, Mexico, Pakistan Spain and Ukraine, as well as by the events in North Africa. Indeed, these markets collectively suffered a volume erosion of 8.4 billion units, over 18.5%. All other markets contributing slightly more than 80% of our volume base grew their combined volume at an organic rate of 1%.</p>
          <p>I am delighted to announce that we are increasing our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2011 by $0.20 to a range of $4.55 to $4.65. Compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an increase of approximately 17.5% to 20% at prevailing exchange rates and approximately 12.5% to 15% excluding currency. $0.10 or half the increased guidance are attributable to more favorable prevailing exchange rates. The other $0.10 are attributable to an improved business outlook in several markets, including France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands and Turkey, partly offset by some additional investments in marketing and sales and slightly more conservative pricing assumptions.</p>
          <p>As you are all aware, Japan Tobacco is facing significant supply disruptions as a result of the tragic events in its home market. It is our understanding that full supply will gradually be in place within the next few weeks. We, in turn, have taken all necessary measures to ensure that we have sufficient in-market inventories to supply the market and fill the anticipated temporary vacuum that is likely to occur. While we have certainly witnessed a moderate lift to our in-market sales in the last few weeks, you should know that there are still competitive products available for sale in numerous retail accounts, and accordingly, it's proving difficult to gauge the full extent of the likely uplift in sales.</p>
          <p>As retail stocks of our principle competitive competitors' products disappear, we will be in a better position to determine such levels. We anticipate that the second quarter will prove critical in this regard. It will allow us to have a much better read on total consumption levels and whether or not and to what extent consumers will return to their prior brand of choice.</p>
          <p>At this point, we face significant uncertainty, but rest assured that all actions are in place to optimize our entire supply chain.</p>
          <p>We have a positive momentum in the Japanese market, where our share increased by 1.4 points to 25.6% in the first quarter of this year, driven by the success of consumer relevant, innovative Marlboro line extensions. Our slightly more conservative pricing assumptions are attributable to the continued economic difficulties and consumer affordability issues in such markets as Greece, Spain and Ukraine, and the need to react to certain competitive price moves such as selective tax absorption, brand repositioning, price discounting, and delays in the implementation of tax-driven price increases.</p>
          <p>Pricing will nevertheless remain the key driver of profitability growth at PMI and our pricing variance in 2011 is expected to surpass the level achieved last year. Overall, our competitiveness is strong and our business is in good shape. This is notably demonstrated by the results during the first quarter in our Asia region. Volume was up 14% in the quarter, and on an organic basis, it was down just 1.7%. Marlboro continued to perform strongly in the Asia region with volume up 0.7% overall and by 5.5% excluding Japan.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we achieved volume and share gains in the key markets of Indonesia, Korea and the Philippines. In Indonesia, we expect industry volume to grow by around 4% this year, despite the potential unfavorable impact of higher food prices on consumer disposable income. Our tactical entry last year into the low price segment in certain regions has enabled us to start to grow market share again.</p>
          <p>In Korea, we achieved a record market share of 17.8% in the first quarter with both Marlboro and Parliament driving our success. In the Philippines, we expect the industry volume this year will be broadly in line with last year, following tax-driven price increases in January this year. Both Marlboro and Fortune are gaining share in this promising market and we are making good progress in realizing our planned synergy savings.</p>
          <p>Our financial results in the Asia region were excellent, with net revenues up by 11.6% and adjusted OCI by 34%, both excluding currency and acquisitions. The other market in the Asia region that has been in the news recently is Australia, where the government has released an Exposure Draft of its Plain Packaging Bill which would mandate plain packaging in 2012 and has opened a consultation period on the matter through June 6.</p>
          <p>PMI is firmly opposed to such a measure as there is no credible evidence that it will achieve any reduction in smoking rates and the government has ignored the fact that it may actually be counterproductive to public health. Plain packaging will lead to price erosion over time and will further encourage the growth of illicit trade which already increased in Australia by over 25% in 2010 according to a recent Deloitte study. Plain packaging will also result in the illegal confiscation of our trademarks and branded assets in violation of international trade laws and treaties.</p>
          <p>Unlike other governments which have focused on establish establishing whether there is evidence to demonstrate that plain packaging would have public health benefits taken benefits taking into consideration issues such as competition, trade and legal implication, as well as the likely impact on elicit trade. The Australian Government seems to be forging ahead without due consideration of any of these important issues. PMI will take all measures it deems appropriate including recourse to the courts if necessary to oppose the Australian Government proposal.</p>
          <p>Our overall performance was also very good in the Latin America and Canada region despite the significant impact on volume of the disruptively large excise tax increase that occurred in January in Mexico. Industry volume in Mexico during the first quarter was down by 27%, though the underlying decline is estimated to have been about 14%. Marlboro and Benson &amp; Hedges have remained resilient with Marlboro reaching a quarterly market share of 50.3%, up 1.6 share points. Across the region, Marlboro has been performing strongly with market share gains in all key markets. On a regional basis, strong pricing growth of 15.7% increase in adjusted OCI and a 1.9 point improvement in adjusted OCI margin, both excluding currency.</p>
          <p>While the economies of most emerging markets have now almost fully recovered, those of Southern Europe remain depressed, with unemployment still continuing to climb, most notably in Greece, Portugal and Spain. Industry volume was down by 25% in the first quarter in Spain, as the situation was exacerbated by the introduction of a total indoor smoking ban, tax-driven price increases, reduction in trade inventories and a sharp increase in contraband off a low base. For the full year, the industry volume in Spain is forecasted to decline by around 15%. And consumer down-trading is expected to continue. It is worth noting that competitors have introduced or repositioned brands below the kick-in level of the minimum excise tax and have thus not rolled over the full effects of the most recent excise tax increase.</p>
          <p>Greece continued to be a drag on PMI results in the first quarter, with industry volume down 10%, consumer down trading due to a large price gaps and a difficult comparison as this market was not impacted by large tax increases until the second quarter of last year. While there has been recently structural improvements in the excise tax system, one crucial reform remains to be introduced, an effective minimum excise tax. In addition, a higher specific to total tax ratio would also benefit government revenues. Excluding just Spain, industry volume in the EU region in the first quarter was down 2.5%, in line with the longer-term consumption decline trend. PMI net revenues in the EU region were down 3.5% and adjusted OCI by 2.3% in the first quarter, both excluding currency. This was driven by the lower industry volume and the decline of 0.4 share points on a regional basis.</p>
          <p>We expect our performance in the EU region to be helped this year by structural excise tax improvements implemented by governments in France, Greece, The Netherlands, Sweden and the UK, following the new and improved EU excise tax directive that will be in force through 2018. In addition, both Germany and the Czech Republic have implemented multi-year excise tax programs calling for regular reasonable increases. The first step in the German tax increase program will take place this May.</p>
          <p>PMI has announced a &#x20AC;0.20 per pack of 19 cigarettes price increase across its portfolio while the pure pass-on required is &#x20AC;0.04 from Marlboro and &#x20AC;0.11 for L&amp;M. This will be a benefit to profitability in the German market, and our decision to eventually follow competitive moves by also offering discounts on large pack sizes enabled us to regain 0.5 share points in the first quarter to 35.7% thanks to the continued stellar performance of L&amp;M and a stable Marlboro share. In parallel, we increased our share in the important German fine cut market by 0.9 points to 14.9%. In both Italy and France, industry volume was stable in the first quarter. In Italy, Marlboro has been performing well. Its quarterly share was down just 0.1% to 22.5%, and more importantly, its share amongst young adult smokers or YAS defined as legal age minimum 18 to 24-year-olds has been growing again following the launch of Marlboro Gold Touch and remains well above its market share.</p>
          <p>In France, a slightly improved market share performance has been driven by the continued growth of the premium priced Philip Morris brand whose quarterly share grew a further 0.6 points to 8.2% and the brand's YAS share has reached 16%. More generally, we have witnessed a greater resilience of Marlboro across the EU region with share of just 0.1 point in the quarter at 17.8% and notable gains in Belgium, Hungary, The Netherlands and Poland. L&amp;M strong momentum continued with a further 0.2 share point gain to 6.1%, driven not only by Germany but also by Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden. Our volume in the EEMA region decreased by 0.8% driven by the continued industry decline and low end share losses in Ukraine, as well as some temporally logistical disruptions in North Africa, partly offset by favorable comparisons in Romania and Turkey where there were large excise tax increases in January 2010 but none this year.</p>
          <p>Premium brands accounted for more than 40% of our regional volume for the first time since the last quarter of 2008 with increased volumes for both Marlboro and Parliament. The Russian market was influenced in the first quarter by the impact of rampant food price inflation resulting from last summer's heat wave and drought, as well as by cigarette price increases. For the full year, we are forecasting industry volume will decline moderately and consumer uptrading may be more modest than originally expected. Our volume declined by 0.8% in the quarter and at 25.5%, our 2011 quarter one share was up compared with the fourth quarter but down 0.2 share points year-on-year. This was driven by the timing of the implementation of tax-driven price increases as well as the increased price gaps at the bottom of the market.</p>
          <p>In Ukraine, we have observed the market contraction in the greater polarization with growth in the premium and super low price segments. PMI is underrepresented in the latter and consequently we lost 3.6 share points through the end of February compared to the same period in 2010. We have started to address this share issue by strengthening <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:10).</p>
          <p>The Turkish economy has been performing very strongly. During the first quarter of this year, industry volume in Turkey was down by a modest 2.1% compared to last year, when the market was significantly impacted by large tax-driven price increases. Our volume increased by 10.4% driven by Parliament, Muratti and L&amp;M. Net revenues and the adjusted OCI and EEMA region were down by 1.7% and 4.4%, respectively, both excluding currency. However, also excluding the tax price windfalls in Q1 2010, adjusted OCI would have grown at a double digit rate.</p>
          <p>Our good share momentum continues. In the first quarter this year, our share in our top 30 OCI markets increased by 0.5 points to 35.8%. Our market share momentum is supported by the strong performance of our two key premium brands, Marlboro and Parliament. Marlboro volume declined by 2.9% in the quarter driven by the specific issues I mentioned about Japan, Mexico and Spain. In all the other markets together, Marlboro volume was up 0.5% in the quarter and the brand's global market share trend continues to improve.</p>
          <p>While many consumer good sectors are being impacted by significant increases in the cost of raw materials, we are expecting stable U.S. dollar prices for the 2011 tobacco leaf crop, driven mainly by a larger crop in Brazil. Direct material prices are also stable so far this year despite higher energy costs. For the full year, we expect manufacturing costs to increase broadly in line with inflation, partly offset by our $250 million annual productivity and cost reduction target which we are fully on track to achieve. Strong pricing most notably in Japan, as well as our continued focus on productivity improvements, resulted in an increase of 2.2 points during the first quarter in PMI's adjusted OCI margin excluding currency and acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Our free cash flow increased by 22.6% in the quarter to $2.2 billion and by 21.1% excluding currency, driven by higher net earnings, lower pension contributions and lower cash exit costs. We continue to focus on reducing inventory levels though it should be noted that year-end working capital requirements remain subject to the level of tax price increases and our success in convincing governments around the world to implement strict forestalling regulations.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we spent some $1.36 billion to repurchase 22.2 million shares at an average price of $61.21. We continue to expect to spend about $5 billion in total this year on share repurchases. In summary, our results this year so far have been very strong and our business outlook is favorable, though the positive impact of Japan is difficult to measure at this time.</p>
          <p>We will increase our investment behind our portfolio of leading brands and are being slightly more conservative in our pricing assumptions to ensure that we remain competitive in our key markets. We have raised our 2011 reported diluted EPS guidance by $0.20 to $4.55 to $4.65 to reflect our positive business momentum and more favorable exchange rates. We will continue to use our strong cash flow to generously reward our shareholders. Thank you. I will now be happy to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is coming from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, hi, Hermann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Judy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First, in Japan, so, I think you said total cigarette market was down 16.4% in the first quarter. So, it looks like that's come in better than the 20% decline that I think you had projected at the outset of the year, and it also implies that March was even better than the run rate in January and February. So have you seen any changes to just the underlying demand decline post the earthquake? And then what are you assuming for the market decline as a whole for 2011 at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, we have previously assumed an annualized 20% decline, annualized October last year to September of this year. Your number on the year-to-date actual 16.4% is correct. I think we'd better look at the year-to-date February number which is 17.1, 17.5 percentage points down because there has been already some consumer hoarding of product in March. So, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:12) but yes, there is of course an improvement overall. From their own, of course, what is going to be the effect of the tragic events itself? That's very hard to predict but let's put it this way, we don't see a quickening in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just in terms of your assumptions that's embedded in your guidance as it relates to any market share gains that you might experience as a result of Japan Tobacco's disruption, at this point, given it's difficult to gauge, are you embedding any upside in terms of the market share situation in Japan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll give you the elements but let me say in general, first, that of course, there are scenarios possible, and of course, the scenario plannings. We have not taken the most conservative one; we have not taken the most bullish scenario that you could take. We kind of went into the sound middle ground and that as a net-net means that about half of the increased business guidance is attributable to Japan.</p>
          <p>Now, let me give you a little bit the elements there which go into which &#x2013; which at the same time, make it so hard to give a clear cut answer, but I'll try to do my best to describe the situation. I mean, yes, year-to-date share we said that's up to 1.4% to 25.6%. In March itself, the share was up 2.9 points to 26.5%. So, essentially, it looks like we cover more than 60% of JT's temporary losses there. But now, of course, to estimate today what the retention level is going to be thereafter is impossible to predict now.</p>
          <p>I would say only one thing, I would expect it to be lower given the market Japan, given the Japanese consumer than it would be otherwise in another market somewhere in the world. And then when it comes to the potential volume benefits of that disruption, well, of course, the first question mark is, how long is the disruption going to last?</p>
          <p>So, how many of the SKUs will come, how quickly back into the markets? Actually, how efficient JT can be with their replenishment of the product pipeline? Then we have seen where I mentioned it in the prepared remarks that, yeah, there were fairly high retail stocks out there, higher than what you would have originally have thought, so consumers were searching for their brand. So, all that comes together. Of course, what we made sure already in the first effort in March but mostly now in the second quarter that, of course, we have the products available in the Japanese market, because the shipment number that you see is, of course, only the number essentially driving, of course, the financials of shipments from our factories to our importer; that is not the number of market &#x2013; in-market sales or even of consumer uptake.</p>
          <p>So, all that together, these are the elements and that gave us the conclusion that I mentioned at the very beginning and that leads to a net result of about half of the increased business guidance is assumed to be attributable to Japan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. Then just your commentary about taking a little bit more conservative pricing assumption and then more investments behind your brand. Is this a little bit of a different posture just in terms of the last two or three years where you really focused more on getting the pricing realization at the expense of volume and is there a little bit more urgency at this point to make sure that you're getting some of that volume back or the volume decline to show some moderation in some of these more challenging markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean, the first and most important point to say, yet again, is that we continue to expect that our pricing variance 2011 is going to exceed the pricing variance of 2010. Already that I think tells you a lot. Also, in our general approach where you know me saying that earnings per share are more important than cigarettes per share for the shareholder, also that conviction has not changed.</p>
          <p>The thing simply is, I had been discussing and reporting on skirmishes here and there already in the past, and we see a little more of those selective brand repositionings and other tactical moves, and to those, you simply then have to respond and you have to protect your competitive position. I give you one example.</p>
          <p>Maybe if you look to Russia where we had announced a price increase in December, we're in the market with new prices in January; other competitors have made public their decisions later on and still today, kind of we see now the last competitor coming in to the market with new prices right now in April after an announcement in January. This is the type of thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Hermann.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Good morning, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two different things I wanted to ask you, two different markets. First, in Russia, there's been some chatter in the press from different politicians about the prospect of a fairly substantial multi-year excise tax increase in that market. What's your read on what's really happening and what's likely to happen once you get beyond 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, the discussion essentially has started for the final tax decisions for January 2012. As you know, there is an existing law in place that brings the ad valorem rate as of January 1, 2012 from 7% to 7.5% and the specific from 280 rubles to 360 rubles. There is a 30% increase of the specific component. And the discussion that was very much in the media was to double the increase of that specific component eventually from 30% to 60%. So it is the start of a discussion; final decisions I would not expect them before the end of the year, October, probably even November of this year. This is when this will have finalized but what you hear there in the press is by no means final.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then Hermann, I wanted to ask you in Australia with respect to plain packaging, can you give us some sense of the relative strength of your arguments with respect to expropriation intellectual property, the confiscation of your business, if they do implement plain packaging in that market, verses the strengths or the relative strength of the legal arguments in your defense that you could bring forward in other developed markets, if other markets were to pursue similar types of legislation.</p>

          <p>Well, let me describe a little bit the situation there. I mean, for understandable reasons, I would not want to go into the legal strategy here but I can give the parameters. So, it's not only Australia, it's also the UK that go through a consultation period right now. The difference being that in Australia, it's a consultation of a draft legislation, whereas in the UK, it's on a draft concept.</p>
          <p>In Australia, the government appears to be predetermined; in the UK, this all appears to be following a normal regular process. In terms of now expropriation of trademarks, confiscations of our business, you raise one of the three critical facts that governments must look at and that also Australia must look at, because there are of course litigation possibilities both under Australian law an under Australia's obligations under international treaties and laws.</p>
          <p>So, those are the two avenues. That litigation situation and the legal situation has actually not changed compared to the time when Australia itself, and also the UK before, had been looking at the situation. And in both cases, both in Australia and the UK, they had come to the conclusion not to implement the measure. So, you would think still, that where there is no change in facts, there also should be no change in outcome. So, so much on the background, but please bear with me, it would not be wise to go into the discussion of the legal strategy itself.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have two things as well. First of all, quick one. Was there any trade loading in Germany in advance of the tax increase for you? And secondly, you refer to wanting to invest more in your brands and marketing. Is there any particular regions or countries where you think there's a need to up your spend versus what it is now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In Germany, while that remains to be seen, certainly, we see now &#x2013; already now some uptick in consumer purchases but you refer to trade. Well, we will have to see what individual competitors have done, i.e., what their respective stocks of old tax, old price, volumes will be. That's &#x2013; I don't know. We will have to see what the outcome there is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and your second question on investments, well, this is very, very specific and we talk about individual large markets where we see consumer response and real immediate returns, so it's not just spreading a little bit more money everywhere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Good morning, Christine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question for you or two questions for you, firstly, you talked about half of the increased business guidance outlook coming from Japan. I'm wondering if you can elaborate perhaps on where the other half of that business outlook is coming from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The other half would be a series of markets, some examples here. Here is first one, Germany; you read about the price, you also read about the improved share performance. Another one would be Turkey, where Turkey has come fairly quickly out of the crisis they were in last year, a market size decline of 2% only in the first quarter is a good sign and our share performance is really doing &#x2013; we are really doing well in the market, again, thanks to a complete portfolio. So, we are doing pretty well there in terms of shares.</p>
          <p>Mexico, while we had expected quite a market reaction, if you kind of take out of the 27% decline in that market in the first quarter, if you take out really the trade load/deload effect over year-end and if you take out also additional selling days that we have in this quarter compared to last year, then you're rather in the 14% or say in the 13% to 15%, so that's better.</p>
          <p>And the second good news in Mexico really is that the premium segment is holding on very well. You see where Marlboro share is growing, premium is holding on better than the low end, so no down-trading in the market, that's good news as well. Indonesia, we are really doing well, share performance, pricing. We have implemented market size growth fairly nicely. France, good news, essentially stable market and now improved share performance as well. Holland would be another example of very solid share performance. So, it's in a number of places that helped.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, it sounds like rather than just better than expected performance in the first quarter, there's some sustainable reasons for your outlook in a number of markets for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My second question really has to do with Romania just because you called out the market as seeing reduced illicit trade. I'm wondering how that's being accomplished successfully. Is that sustainable? And are there other regions that could follow suit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the situation in terms of illicit trade has improved quite a bit. This was well above 30%. I would say this has &#x2013; probably has gone down in the range of 10 percentage points. Well, let's put it this way, it is always a sequence of two things. First, you need to attract the attention of everyone, including the government, which we did in Romania which, as well, it's in other places as well. Well, take Canada, that was another example where you first need to get their attention. And then you need the willingness of government really to put enforcement behind. And we have seen that in both countries as well again, both Romania and Canada, so it's the two elements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up on pricing; you did talk about Russia as an example where there's some repositioning of competitive brands and that perhaps might lead to more conservative pricing on the aggregate. But I'm wondering if it's really quite isolated to Russia or any other markets where you feel this is necessary rather than a broad statement of product positioning and pricing around the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's a little bit more skirmishes as I said, it's selective repositionings and other tactics, Russia was one example. I give you another one. In Spain, you see there, the minimum tax kick-in is at &#x20AC;3.66 and we have prices in the market at &#x20AC;3.40 and &#x20AC;3.35 even, so there is clear absorption of the last tax increase, so that's just another example.</p>
          <p>Or remember the one we had been discussing earlier which was the discounting on the big and so called maxi packs in the German market. So, it is here and there, it is skirmishes here and there, but again, what really &#x2013; look at our first quarter pricing variance, which is very strong, and also at the statement that the sum of the pricing variance, 2011 is going to be greater than the one of 2010.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have two questions for you to follow up on Japan, not to continue harping on that, but I was just curious, you gave a number at a presentation, I think it was you, that &#x2013; about some amount of product you have in market, I think it was 10 billion sticks, sort of in Japan. And I wonder if there was an update to that number? And I guess, I'm curious, while you have a long lead time to getting product into that market, has there been a quicker drawdown because of the consumer response? Are you able to keep up with the inventory needs in that market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are keeping up with the inventory needs. Yes, our growth is coming out of the European factories, you're correct. By ship, that's a long way, by air freight, it's quicker. And we had to take recourse to air freight in order to get some volume in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then I wondered if there was any potential to spend a little more heavily in Japan, perhaps to use some of the benefit or windfall, whatever you want to call it, to try and sustain some of this market share? Is that part of your thinking for the remainder of the year for what you could do in Japan to potentially hold on to some of this market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, I mean, Japan, of course, in terms of spending overall, already before any of that happening is one of our focus markets in there. As I was just illustrating with air freight, there is also of course some additional cost that you simply have due to the situation. There is distribution and logistical costs.</p>
          <p>We will certainly also do everything we can in terms of <mark type="ph" /> plan (45:46) support and as we saw our shares are developing very, very nicely. However, really, I think the Japanese situation with the country in trouble, will lead to a different average behavior of the consumer than it would be the case elsewhere. So, I believe that the retention levels probably will be lower than there would be in another country. To what extent &#x2013; some of them, of course, we will be able to retain, I would think. To what extent, that today is just impossible to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just one follow-up for you, that's on the premium segment in general. In particular I was looking at Russia where Marlboro was down you clearly outlined a few factors that could be leading to that, as some of your competitors have not passed along some of the price increase. But generally, across the premium segment, I saw good performance overall out of Parliament, the Parliament brand for you and Marlboro itself, outside of a few troubled markets, looks like it's doing quite well. Would you characterize this as being still sort of an uptrading market, you're still seeing that broadly across your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say, I mean if you are now going beyond Russia and talking about worldwide picture, then yes, since &#x2013; if you go back to say, probably middle of 2008, i.e., before any of the crisis hit, and you compare it to today, then you will have seen a shift from &#x2013; very moderate shift, maybe 1% to 2%, from premium and mid to the low end, now talking total worldwide volumes for our brands but actually, if you would look at that more recently, say over the last 3 to 6 months, then you will have a slowdown or even a stoppage of that effect and I believe we are at the point there now where with improved economies around the world, our premium portfolio will serve us very, very well. It's just there are still a couple of markets out there, the known ones, where like in southern Europe, where the situation is &#x2013; the situation is still difficult but overall, I clearly see a return to uptaking over time.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Couple of questions. First of all, just on the LatAm and Canada region, can you give a bit more detail about why profitability is so strong given that Mexico is &#x2013; volumes are so heavily down, I presume Mexico is by far your biggest profit center there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mexico is a very profitable market and the price increase has helped so there is certainly a good part of the reason for the strong performance. It's not only Mexico, it is also other profitable markets in that region. Take Canada, where you had again an increase in the total market size. Or you take Argentina, where we continue our stellar performance and are now at a market share essentially in the range of three-quarters of the market, so there are others but Mexico is an important one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Mexican profits are well up despite the volume decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Say again, Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mexican profits are still well up despite the volume decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:37) price increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And going back to Russia, I mean, as you pointed out, the volume declines of Marlboro and L&amp;M are noticeable. Is that due to the actual segments, the premium and the mid price segment element being down or is that more a brand-specific decline? If it is brand specific, particularly for L&amp;M, clearly, you launched that a couple of years ago, what's the next step to try and stop Winston?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course, we were referring to our delayed increases of tax-driven price increases before. It's always easy to grow share at a lower price. Going back now to the portfolio itself, to our portfolio &#x2013; well, in the premium segment, let me remind you that actually Parliament in Russia is a bigger brand than Marlboro. Actually also, with much higher margins than Marlboro, and Parliament is doing very, very well.</p>
          <p>Marlboro itself, yes, to be self-critical here, yes, we need to do more work on the brand Marlboro in the Russian market and we have plans in order to strengthen the brand going forward into this year. From there, you go to Chesterfield which is a strong higher-end medium priced brand. L&amp;M which has suffered over the last couple of years, and that's true, that is not an easy situation. And then you go to the next one, to Bond Street where we have had tremendous increases, i.e., we had the best <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:25) international low price brand in the market. And then if you go further down, actually as we speak, there is now a lot of price competition going on at the very low end which is also very low margin. And at the time, with brands like <mark type="ph" /> Java (51:47) and others which are at very low prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it sounds like the decline of those brands, Marlboro and L&amp;M, is brand rather than sort of segment-specific brand. And given you relaunched L&amp;M a couple of years ago, is there anything more that you can do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean I was mentioning, I was saying that, yes, we have work on L&amp;M to do; we have work on Marlboro to do. But when it goes to segments then the story is different. Overall, in the premium segment, I was speaking about Parliament. We &#x2013; the segment itself premium is doing well and we are having a good share in there. Medium including Chesterfield, we are doing well and now there is simply intense price competition as well at the very low end which is chasing market share for not much margin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, two quick questions about Australia. First, is the deep discount segment still far more profitable than the premium segment in your non-OECD markets? And second, could you please just remind us about the price positioning of Longbeach and Peter Jackson which I think are bigger brands there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First statement, yes, what's called super low in Australia is still very profitable, that's correct. And it still is the margin of a premium brand elsewhere. The positionings of the other brands are mid-price to premium price brands, so we are present across the market. But overall in the market, yes, there is a certain trend towards the lower end but as you said yourself at the beginning, this lower end is still a very profitable end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. We'll go back to Japan but could you also talk about the shape of the quarter for other key markets that drag the Group volume performance in the first quarter? Just wanted to have an idea of the exit rates to have an idea if things are getting worse, stable or better, particularly in places like Ukraine and Spain? Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more on the, particularly on the markets that drive your performance in the first quarter. And I think we talked about &#x2013; already about Japan, so I think the ones left are mostly Ukraine and certainly on Spain will be appreciated. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Absolutely. Ukraine first then. I mean on one hand, this is of course a country which has actually very good macroeconomic trends right now. However, when it comes to the cigarette market, then the price increase effects on the market on the consumer are simply not over yet. So, I mean, for the price that you buy today, a low priced product, you could have bought &#x2013; a bit more than two years ago &#x2013; you could have bought a super premium Parliament brand, so that's really what's happening in the market.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of that, you really see polarization of the market. You see the premium segment, almost stable, actually our share up, doing very, very well, but then in particular, in our case, you see a very competitive low priced brand and for us, share losses at the very low price brand, so there is intense competition really at the low end &#x2013; completely polarizing market in there.</p>
          <p>So, that's pretty much the situation in the Ukraine. It will calm down over time but it is a difficult situation right now and there are many price promotions actually in place in that market. Now, moving over to Spain, what I would say, Spain is still very difficult because there are too many negatives at play for the economy to start with. We still have a stagnating GDP; we still have unemployment at 20%. Actually, 1.3 million households out of 17.3 million households total in the country &#x2013; I was told actually, in this 1.3 million households, both partners are unemployed, just to give you an impression of the problem.</p>
          <p>So not surprisingly, consumer confidence is low and the only positive for the economy overall is a recovery in tourism. So, in that context, it's not a surprise that the cigarette market is really depressed. Not to the level of the 25% that you see in the actual numbers of the first quarter because there is an important trade stock reduction in there as well. And there is the effect of a total smoking ban in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:17) in January of this year in there as well, so probably 15% is a better number for the full year.</p>
          <p>One sentiment also you see in the market now beginning, in particular in the south, we have made a recent study in three of the southern cities of Seville, Malaga and <mark type="ph" /> Cadiz (57:40) where almost 25% of the consumption were not Spanish tax paid products. So that is about double what it was a year before. That's just a snap shot that by no means is representative for Spain as a total market. It has always been higher in the south than anywhere else. But that's also, of course, something adding into the problems, and in such a situation, it is not a surprise that you see down-trading in the markets and even more so, of course, the more you go south, the more down-trading you see. So, that's a bit the situation on Spain.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Not to belabor the point, but I wanted to circle back to Russia, and in particular your expectation for excise tax increases as they stand now. If memory serves, I believe you guys are looking for roughly a 22% increase in 2012 and another 50 basis point increase to 7.5%. I'm just wondering, as it stands today, do you think that's adequately conservative? I believe it falls notably below the 30% to 40% increase JT is looking for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say that &#x2013; I have to say again you have one fixed point here which is the existing law. Ad valorem, 7% to 7.5%, specific from 280 rubles to 360 rubles. There was discussion about the doubling of the specific element but this is a discussion and you will hear many more people giving their input in this &#x2013; into this discussion until the end of the year.</p>
          <p>At this point in time, I feel it is impossible to predict the final outcome as I said earlier. Don't expect the decision there before October or even November of this year. We're only in April. So, a lot of water is going to still go down the Volga until we know that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. The other question that I have on Russia is, I guess, given your market share trend this quarter presumably before the skirmish that's erupted in April from one your competitors, it seems like there has been a resumption to a certain extent in down-trading in the market. If that's right, that surprises me given your commentary last month on the stabilization.</p>
          <p>And I know you highlighted the risk that uptrading could be prohibited by price increases but it's still kind of surprises me. Is there anything else that kind of caught you guys off guard a little bit in terms of the consumer trend? Because the food inflation, that was almost a year ago, so I'm you are priced by the change in tone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, it is the price increase effect as we highlighted earlier and you mentioned it. There is of course a certain effect in there. Don't forget that really, the recovery of the economy, nice to see it in the big cities of Russia, it hasn't really reached the countryside yet. In that context, the rising food prices are a concern because those have gone up quite a bit after last year's summer heat and the drought thereafter and the harvest problems that occurred as a consequence. So, it is those two elements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. My last question has to do with your Marlboro market shares in the EU. Certainly, I know it's so many markets make up that whole number, but it strikes me as potentially troubling that you have seen two sequential quarters of market share losses for Marlboro. I'm just wondering if you can drill down a little bit into how that breaks down between core Marlboro and the line extensions that you have been putting into the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me give you some information on Marlboro, how it performs in the EU region. By variance, those numbers I wouldn't know by heart but at the end of today, they are part of the Marlboro franchise and we do those for incremental volumes but also for the halo effect on the entire brand. Now, essentially going into it, if you look at the EU, I mean, minus 0.1%, I think, I justifiably call an overall stable performance in the EU, albeit, it's true that there are considerable market variations within the EU.</p>
          <p>Poland would be an example where the market share of Marlboro is nicely up more than one share point to about 10.5% share, there is clearly uptrading and that is an effect that you will see also elsewhere. There is up trading potential for Marlboro in Central Europe, let me call it, in general. Then, I will say you have markets where you have a stable situation in terms of market share, Germany and Italy, they will both be down 0.1% to 21.2% and 22.5%, respectively.</p>
          <p>Then, I would say, you find other markets where we are continuing to grow on an already high basis; that would be Belgium, growing 0.7% to 25.1%. And most importantly, Netherlands, it's growing actually again 0.7% to 34.9%, that's not too bad. And then, you have a large category of markets where we clearly see the effects of a down-trading environment and that would be Spain, Portugal and Greece.</p>
          <p>Spain, we are down quarter one versus quarter one, down 0.4%, even down more if you compare more recently to Q3 of last year. Portugal is down four percentage points to 18.4%, temporarily again, price gap increases due to delayed implementation of excise tax driven price increases of competitors. In Greece, again, down-trading environment where the brand is down 2.4% to 19.3%. So, down-trading environment, stable and growing in a number of them and uptrading in really more the Central European part. That's the categories that you find within the EU region.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Rey Wium with RenCap.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi, Hermann. Just a quick question regarding the production costs. You have gotten this whole manufacturing cost increase more or less in line with inflation. But if you look at the first quarter numbers, your cost of sales actually declined by 3.3%. I was just curious to know if there were any specific factors in the first quarter that resulted in a lower &#x2013; in a reduction in the cost of sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, overall inflation, that is a worldwide average, that is something about 2% to 3%. So, that's the range but as you know, we have our productivity programs in place. In terms of major components of our cost of goods sold, that's of course, first of all and most importantly leaf, that's about 35% of our cost of goods sold, on average is leaf and on a yearly basis, last year, it was $3.5 billion.</p>
          <p>So, within leaf now, you have leaf price increases. We all remember a situation in 2008, that is absorbed, that is no longer the problem today. The leaf price increases for this year that we still expect will be about two-thirds of what they had been in 2010. And now they are essentially driven by the currency strength of the underlying Brazilian real in the leaf price which then, finally, is in dollars of Brazilian leaf, that's the most important thing. But against that, go of course also our productivity measures, so that's what I can say on leaf.</p>
          <p>On direct materials which is about 25% in there, that is essentially stable. And then of course, you have conversion costs where you have productivity running against the salary increases that you, of course, have to give and give to your work force. So, those are essentially the components. But overall, I feel pretty good about it, I must say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but I was just curious about &#x2013; if my calculations are correct &#x2013; your production costs basically in the Asia region declined by 6%, so that's actually quite an incredible performance. I was just wondering if there was any specific once-off factor that benefited that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is probably &#x2013; I must say, that must be the effect of the Philippines that are included now. Yes, that's it. Of course, if you compare it to last year and this year, now you have all the Philippine factors in there which, of course, on average, have a lower cost base than others.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Your final question comes from the line of Thomas Russo, with Gardner Russo Gardner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning. You had mentioned that you will have synergy savings coming from Philippines over the year. Will those be part of the $250 million or is that on top the $250 million that you were citing originally? First question. The second question has to do with any further color on forestalling, which you mentioned steps are taken to thwart but where else are you still seeing that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The productivity and the synergies out of the Philippines is, of course, part of our total number because the Philippines are part of our total business. Second question, forestalling. We have made quite some progress in a number of countries in forestalling. The most effective measure has been with the so-called sell-by dates.</p>
          <p>Remember two years ago, it must have been, that we had really big problems in Poland. That's solved today. So, it is essentially one and a half, two months delay only. So, there is simply further room for improvement, also in markets where it's already existing. I was mentioning Russia before. Well, that's certainly is a country that would be on our priority list. But you also can always do better in other markets where it's already in place. Portugal would be an example for a second category.</p>
