          <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this year's International Investors Conference of Volkswagen AG in Wolfsburg. So this is the second time that we are here at Autostadt. We're pleased with that. This is the very heart of Wolfsburg, a very cordial welcome also to all listeners via webcast or telephones.</p>
          <p>Professor Dr. Winterkorn will be the first speaker, CEO of Volkswagen AG. He'll give you an overview of the past fiscal year 2007. Then Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, CFO of Volkswagen AG, will present the most important financials and ratios; and then Dr. Winterkorn again, offering a strategic outlook. And of course as always we'll be available for your questions afterwards and our Board of Management will answer them. Dr. Winterkorn.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our International Investors Conference. I believe that your trip to Wolfsburg will be worthwhile. Today, the Volkswagen Group will be presenting to you historic and record setting results: Never before has our company sold as many cars as it did last year. And never before did we make such a healthy profit in selling these cars.</p>
          <p>For the Volkswagen Group, 2007 was by far the most successful year in our history. In my opinion, we impressively demonstrated the unique potential that this company has to offer. This is also reflected in very concrete form in our key figures: In 2007, Volkswagen Group increased its sales revenue to &#x20AC;108.9 billion which is growth of 3.8%. Our deliveries of nearly 6.2 million vehicles were up substantially by a full 7.9%, a new all-time high. And we also set a great record in terms of operating profit: In fact, it was &#x20AC;6.2 billion, which more than trebled the figure of the previous year and pre-tax profit also rose significantly to &#x20AC;6.5 billion. This means that we not only reached our earnings target that we originally had for 2008 one year early that is &#x20AC;5.1 billion.</p>
          <p>In fact, we not just reached it one year early we already exceeded it significantly.</p>
          <p>And our automotive success in 2007 was mirrored on stock markets too. The Volkswagen Group turned in the best share price performance of all listed car makers in 2007. Ladies and gentlemen, 2007 really was a pivotal year for the Volkswagen Group. This was the year that we brought our company to training camp and we really made ourselves fit for the future in a number of respects, in three ways. First of all, we increased productivity at our plants by 10%, and at the same time we substantially reduced the manufacturing costs of our cars. Number two, we reinforced our presence in the world's growth markets and unveiled four new plants in Russia, India and China. And then number three and above all we launched a total of 34 new models and product enhancements. 34 new vehicles, that's a truly impressive number which really sets the pace in the automotive world in 2007. However, this of course did not happen by itself.</p>
          <p>Behind this success, there is a lot of focused effort and a real passion for automobiles. And my colleagues and I would like to express our sincere thanks to our employees for this and for their tremendous commitment. The encouragingly strong demand for our vehicles shows that our efforts have been rewarded.</p>
          <p>I'd like to stress the figures again, nearly 6.2 million vehicles delivered that's an increase of about 8%. In other words, we grew almost twice as fast as the global market. Our performance was especially dynamic in automotive growth markets. We were up by 28% in China, up by 32% in Brazil and up by 21% in Central and Eastern Europe. These are figures to be truly proud of and figures that will give us a great boost for our future activities in North America and Western Europe.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we were faced with stagnating markets. In fact, the German automobile market shrunk by more than 9%. The group delivered 1.06 million vehicles here; that is 4.8% fewer than in the previous year. The reasons for this development are quite clear, the impact of the increase in VAT, the value added tax, and rising mobility costs as well as uncertainty related to the debates on the climate and the tax framework. All contributed to weak domestic demand in Germany. But nevertheless we extended our market share in Germany to 32.7%. In other words, every third new vehicle in 2007 sold in Germany came from the Volkswagen family, and we're also the clear leader in the German fleet business because we account for five out of the top ten models last year in this market.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, one particularly encouraging sign is that all eight group brands increased their deliveries in 2007. With deliveries of more than 3.66 million vehicles the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand set a new delivery record. The brand achieved especially strong growth in Brazil, Central and Eastern Europe, and in China.</p>
          <p>Our new models, the Golf Variant, the station wagon, and the Tiguan, were given an excellent response by our customers. We have in fact now a mere four months after its launch received the 100,000th order for a Tiguan. This is a sensational success and illustrates the sort of potential the Volkswagen brand has to capture new customers, in new market segments too. Volkswagen continued its BlueMotion initiative in 2007 and unveiled no less than six new environmentally friendly models at the Frankfurt Auto Show. These included the most fuel efficient Golf of all time with a consumption of a mere 4.3 liters per 100 kilometers. Its little brother, the Polo BlueMotion is still the absolute CO2 champion with emissions of a mere 99 grams per kilometer. But these vehicles also demonstrate that the best contribution you can make to protecting the environment is to buy a new car. With BlueMotion, you not only help the environment, you also save money.</p>
          <p>Our Audi mark made substantial progress towards its goal of becoming the world's leading premium manufacturer. They delivered 964,200 vehicles, which meant that the brand set its 12th delivery record in a row. Audi scored in almost all key markets with rising sales figures, and Audi is the best example of growth and dynamic performance. In 2002, the Audi brand sold some 740,000 vehicles, and in 2008, this year, their sales level will pass the 1 million vehicle mark.</p>
          <p>In 2007, Audi laid the foundations for a new model series with the launch of the A5 Coup&#xE9;. Together with the successor to the A4, Audi is providing an impressive example of their efficiency and superior state-of-the-art technology. And that's because both vehicles are based for the first time on Audi's Modular Longitudinal system or kit, and on top of that, both cars are constant winners in comparative tests run by the motoring press.</p>
          <p>Our colleagues at &#x160;koda too celebrated new records, 630,000 vehicles delivered. That represents the best ever result in the history of the company and a strong increase of 14.6%. Clever, high-quality and nevertheless affordable cars, &#x160;koda's formula is winning over a growing number of customers around the world. With smart, likable cars like the &#x160;koda Roomster, the planned Yeti compact SUV or the new &#x160;koda Fabia, the brand appeals as much to smart shoppers in the West as to its strong established client base in Central and Eastern Europe. At the SEAT brand, we had not originally been expecting an operating profit until 2008, but I'm delighted to be able to say today that SEAT in fact returned to operating profit last year, twelve months earlier than planned. They're back in the black.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, anyone who thinks about writing off SEAT would be making a big mistake. Our colleagues in Martorell have laid all the foundations for successful growth. More than 431,000 customers and increased deliveries in 2007 are a clear and unmistakable signal. One important innovation last year was the Altea Freetrack, the first SEAT with four-wheel drive. SEAT recently showed in Geneva with its show car how the future of the brand will look. This show car is based on the new Ibiza.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, Bentley has been an unparallel success story in recent years. Today Bentley is by far the most successful luxury automotive brand in the world. Let me remind you that in 1998 Bentley sold 992 cars. Last year it was more than 10,000, a new all-time high. This mark is a real gem for its demanding and sophisticated customers and also for the Group, because Bentley plays a key strategic role for our company. And incidentally it also earns us good money. In 2007, one of their product highlights was the new Continental GT Speed, and I'm convinced that with exceptional vehicles like this, Bentley will further extend its leadership position in the highly profitable market for luxury automobiles.</p>
          <p>Our sports car manufacturer Lamborghini was no less successful. Since Lamborghini became a member of the Audi family 10 years ago, its unit sales have increased more than tenfold. Deliveries were up in 2007, once again by a healthy 14.8% to 2,400 vehicles. And not just in terms of unit sales, but also in terms of profitability, Lamborghini's success has been a delight to us. With vehicles like the new Revent&#xF3;n super sports car, the mark has again proved beyond a doubt that Lamborghini is and will continue to be a unique manufacturer of extreme and uncompromising sports cars.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles too recorded very healthy growth, 488,700 units represent a new worldwide delivery record. Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles set new records in 37 export markets last year. Growth in deliveries was especially strong for the trucks and buses manufactured in Brazil and Mexico. In 2007, the new Caddy Maxi was an important new product. This miracle of spaciousness is one of the largest models in the compact shuttle and van segment.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we didn't just thrill our customers with fascinating cars last year. We also created genuine value added with financing, leasing and insurance packages for our vehicles. Value added for our customers and for us &#x2013; for the Company.</p>
          <p>Our clever mobility packages ensure that the costs of driving remain transparent and above all calculable. This is more important than ever before, especially for private households. Now, three out of four Volkswagen customers in Germany finance or lease their new vehicles from Volkswagen Financial Services.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen Financial Services again proved a trendsetter among automobile financial services providers, systematically expanding and internationalizing its products. A good example of this is the formation or the founding of the first automotive and direct bank in Mexico. Against this backdrop, the Financial Services Division performed extremely well in 2007, again making a significant contribution to the Group's overall earnings. The contract portfolio grew by 4.2% to 6.6 million.</p>
          <p>We will build on this and integrate the marketing activities of the Automotive and Financial Services divisions more tightly in the future. Because this will not only enable us to tap another extremely profitable business field or business area, these services also help improve long-term customer loyalty.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, one thing is clear the Volkswagen Group can only be successful in the long term with a strong and successful Volkswagen brand. And that's why we set a lot of things in motion at the Volkswagen brand in 2007. As you know, it is our stated goal to make the Volkswagen brand the most innovative volume manufacturer in the world.</p>
          <p>Our new global brand claim, "Volkswagen &#x2013; Das Auto." underscores this objective. And it expresses just how much Volkswagen has driven the development of the automobile forward and will continue to do so. Volkswagen stands for vehicles that set standards and have helped define whole generations' attitudes toward living.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, we have given the Volkswagen brand a new target brand image &#x2013; customer intimacy, affordable innovations, outstanding value, uncompromising quality and safety, and, last but not least, responsibility for the environment and for society, that's what Volkswagen stands for.</p>
          <p>This vision, this target brand image and this claim together make up the new, self-confident Volkswagen brand, and they underscore the high standards that we set for our vehicles and, of course, our work.</p>
          <p>These can also be seen, if you look at the Volkswagen brand's corporate objectives &#x2013; by 2018 at the latest, the brand aims to be an employer of choice, as measured by international rankings. We want to be among the best car makers in the world in terms of customer satisfaction, quality and processes. In 2018, the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand is looking to sell 6.6 million vehicles a year worldwide. And, with a return on investment of 21%, the brand intends to be one of the most profitable companies in our industry.</p>
          <p>Our strategy for 2018 sets the framework for the Volkswagen brand's successful future. And we have taken similar steps for all Group brands. At present, we are systematically rolling out this strategy to the workforce. And we have taken all necessary steps to ensure that these ambitious goals and plans are translated into measurable and positive results.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, in 2007, Porsche AG further increased its stake in Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft &#x2013; Volkswagen AG. This move demonstrates the long-term nature of the investment by our largest shareholder. And the announcement that it intends to acquire a majority stake underscores that our colleagues at Porsche and its owning families appreciate what a gem the Volkswagen Group is. We are extremely pleased about this move, and we're looking forward to even closer cooperation soon.</p>
          <p>The Pi&#xEB;ch and Porsche families have written automotive history. They have been closely associated with the Volkswagen Group for a long time.</p>
          <p>An automobile company is now emerging that will usher in an entirely new era. Two absolute industry champions are joining forces here. Let me put it another way, combining Porsche and Volkswagen is like lending the talent and attacking skills of Marcelinho and Mario Gomez in one single player. Volkswagen stands for the technology leadership and purchasing strength of one of the largest automotive groups. And Porsche stands for the power and maneuverability of one of the most coveted brands in the entire world.</p>
          <p>Our competitors are fully aware of the tremendous potential of this partnership. They know that they are witnessing the birth of a player whose appeal, whose profitability and whose innovative strength will make it the world's best automobile manufacturer. And with this in mind, we hope very much that the current dispute between the Volkswagen Works Council and Porsche will soon be resolved amicably. We need clarity. We must deploy our teams and finally start controlling the game together, because that is in the interests of all concerned.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, just a few days ago, we announced that Volkswagen would increase its share of Scania's voting rights to 68.6%. For Scania, this is a historic step towards a clear, long-term shareholder structure. We at the Volkswagen Group are delighted that Scania will now become the ninth strong brand under the roof of Europe's largest automobile company. And we are committed to Scania and the Scania team, and we are firmly behind Scania's management led by Leif &#xD6;stling, who has put the company on an excellent footing. We will remain committed to this successful strategy.</p>
          <p>As with all of our Group brands, Scania will retain its own corporate headquarters, its own corporate culture and its own unique profile. I'm convinced that, together, we will harness our market opportunities even more effectively. Going forward, the Volkswagen Group will be a commanding force in the business with heavy trucks and buses. Our holdings in MAN and Scania are highly profitable. In this respect, we do not currently see any further pressure to act.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, that finishes my roundup of the key data, new products and significant events of last year &#x2013; last fiscal year. My colleague on the Board of Management, Hans Dieter P&#xF6;tsch, will now explain the most important key figures to you in detail. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to extend a very warm welcome to you. Last year, here at the Customer Center in the Autostadt about the first successes of our restructuring program, and confirmed that we would record profit before tax of at least 5.1 billion euros at the latest in fiscal year 2008. Over the course of 2007, the encouraging development of our business then prompted us to indicate to you that we would actually accomplish this ambitious objective a year earlier than we originally expected. Today, we can tell you that we not only achieved profit before tax of 5.1 billion euro in 2007, but even significantly exceeded it, at 6.5 billion euro. Moreover, with a return on investment of 9.5%, we not only earned our cost of capital &#x2013; as announced for 2007 &#x2013; but we also exceeded our minimum required rate of return of 9%.</p>
          <p>I'm sure you'll recall the difficult decisions we had to make in recent years that is a part of our restructuring program, that were necessary to enable us to increase our productivity enough to weather the dramatic increase in international competitive pressure. Today, you can clearly see the success of these efforts.</p>
          <p>The positive development of the global automotive market also made itself felt in 2007. However, growing markets do not necessarily mean that a manufacturer's own sales will also grow in line with that. However, with just under 6.2 million vehicles delivered worldwide, the Volkswagen Group succeeded in capturing an above-average portion of this market growth, allowing us to extend our share of the global market from 9.5% to 9.8%. There are a number of reasons for this. In addition to the internal process improvements already mentioned, coupled with strict cost discipline, they include our broad regional line-up and our product offering covering all classes of vehicles. This is something that our clients worldwide regard as particularly attractive. However, there's still a lot to do.</p>
          <p>The latest consolidated financial statements are only one more step towards a considerably higher level of earnings. We are continuing to push ahead with our plans to increase the Group's competitiveness so that Volkswagen can still present good results even when or if the business environment clouds over significantly.</p>
          <p>Allow me to make a comment in this context on the current uncertainties in the international financial markets. We do not expect that they will directly affect our business activities, not even in our Financial Services Division. The high cash surpluses at the Automotive Division and the broader equity base in both divisions allow us to limit the effects of these external factors on Volkswagen. You can see how soundly our company is rated by the capital markets from the fact that in January, in other words right in the middle of the U.S. mortgage crisis, Volkswagen Bank was able to securitize loan receivables from automotive financing in a 1.25 billion euro placement.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, let's now take a look at the Volkswagen Group's income statement. In fiscal year 2007, it no longer contains any special items from restructuring measures. These still amounted to 2.4 billion euro in 2006, and they were contained in cost of sales, distribution and administrative expenses, as well as the other operating result portions.</p>
          <p>The Volkswagen Group's sales revenue rose by 3.8% last year to 108.9 billion euro. Because growth in the cost of sales was slower, at only 1.7%, we recorded a 17.6% increase in gross profit, the gross margin rose from 13.2% in the previous year to 15.0% in 2007.</p>
          <p>The increase in distribution expenses was less than sales revenue growth, while the increase in administrative expenses was slightly higher. The significant increase in the other operating result or results is due primarily to the discontinuation of special items I mentioned just before, as well as to positive currency hedging effects.</p>
          <p>Overall, we generated an operating profit of 6.2 billion euro, three times higher than the previous year's figure or three-fold that figure. This improved the operating margin from 1.9 to 5.6%.</p>
          <p>The financial results also recorded healthy growth in 2007. This reflects firstly the increased income from the measurement of our equity-accounted investments, in particular the investments in our Chinese joint ventures, in MAN and in Scania. Secondly, it echoes the higher interest and securities income resulting not only from our improved liquidity, but also from one-off factors in 2007.</p>
          <p>The operating result, the financial result taken together produced a profit before tax of 6.5 billion euro. This is not just a considerable increase compared with the previous year: above all, it also means that we significantly exceeded the target of 5.1 billion we originally set for 2008.</p>
          <p>Our income tax expenditure last year was 2.4 billion euro, corresponding to a tax rate of 37%. The positive figure of 162 million in 2006 was due to extraordinary tax income amounting to 951 million euro which at the time resulted from a change in German corporation tax law.</p>
          <p>All in all the Volkswagen Group generated a profit after tax of 4.1 billion in fiscal year 2007, more than double its 2006 profit from continuing operations. Including the 2006 profit from discontinued operations, which was mainly a result of the disposal of Europcar, the year-on-year increase in profit after tax in 2007 was still around 50%.</p>
          <p>I would like to note at this point that you will find a presentation of the key indicators for the fourth quarter of 2007 on our Investor Relations website.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, last year, we recorded consolidated sales revenue of 108.9 billion euro, a 4 billion increase compared to 2006. At 3.1 billion euro, volume growth was the largest factor driving this development. Prices and product mix together accounted for around 700 million euro. The stronger euro caused an offsetting effect from exchange rate movements amounting to 1.1 billion euro, although the corresponding currency hedges had a positive effect on other operating income. With an increase by 1.3 billion euro, the Financial Services Division again made an important contribution to the Group.</p>
          <p>Looking at the regional breakdown of sales revenue, we can see that growth in Europe, including the Other or Remaining markets, equals the average for the Group, at 3.9%. We recorded above-average growth of 18.2 %in the South American and South African markets, and 12.8% in Asia-Pacific. In North America, on the other hand, we recorded a decline of 9.5%, due firstly to a change in the model mix and secondly to less favorable exchange rates.</p>
          <p>I would also like to note at this point that the sales revenue figure for Asia-Pacific contain only the deliveries to our Chinese joint ventures, and not their own sales revenue in the Chinese market.</p>
          <p>Operating profit grew at a much faster pace than sales revenue, more than tripling in 2007. Even eliminating the special items of minus 2.4 billion in 2006 there is still produces an increase by 40.3%.</p>
          <p>It is not only the absolute amount of this growth that is remarkable, but above all the fact that all divisions and brands, without exception, succeeded in improving their operating profit compared to 2006, making positive contributions to the Group's operating profit. This applies in equal measure to Volkswagen Passenger Cars, SEAT and Commercial Vehicles, which recorded significant increases over a low prior-year figure, and also to Audi, &#x160;koda and Bentley, as well as the Financial Services Division, which again exceeded the already high level recorded in 2006.</p>
          <p>Please note that the figures for the brands and divisions also include intra-Group transactions, mainly intercompany profits, whose elimination is contained in the "Other" category.</p>
          <p>An analysis of the reasons for this encouraging growth in operating profit shows that positive volume, product mix and price effects amounting to 2 billion euro made a particularly good contribution. These were partly offset by negative exchange rate effects of around 500 million.</p>
          <p>Product cost savings of 1.4 billion euro more than exceeded our target for 2007. The 1.2 billion euro negative effect of fixed costs and depreciation and amortization is due largely to development costs incurred to expand our product portfolio. With an addition of approximately 100 million euro to its already high level of earnings, the Financial Services Division again contributed to the improvement in the Group's operating profit. Because there were no special items in 2007, our operating profit increased to a total of 6.2 billion euro.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, such a significant improvement in earnings of course doesn't just happen. It is the result first of all of the success of our products, and secondly of the stringent and strict restructuring program with which we addressed the Group's structural problems. Considerable progress was made in Europe, but also in Brazil and China, although we still have some way to go in North America and at SEAT. Overall, we have by no means exhausted all of the opportunities available, and we still do see considerable potential for enhancing efficiency, a potential that can and must be tapped into.</p>
          <p>ROI, the return on investment, is the ratio of operating profit, after tax, to invested capital. ROI increased substantially in the Automotive Division last year from 2.1 to 9.5%. This figure means that for the first time since 2001, we not only earned more than our current cost of capital of 6.7% but generated a positive value contribution of 717 million euro. But we were also able to exceed our minimum required rate of return of 9%. And we have now reached a level that allows us to aim for double-digit ROI. A condition of course here is that we maintain our strict cost and investment discipline.</p>
          <p>In the Financial Services Division, here of course we have less fluctuations traditionally and we already had a very high level in the previous years, we were able to record a further slight improvement. Measured by the broader equity base, however, the return on equity before tax decreased slightly from 16.9 to 16.1%.</p>
          <p>The broader equity base produced a further significant improvement in our already sound balance sheet ratios last year. Group equity rose by 5 billion, primarily as a result of the higher earnings, and the equity ratio increased correspondingly from 19.7% in 2006 to 22% in 2007.</p>
          <p>The Financial Services Division's equity ratio also improved from 9.6% at the end of 2006 to now 10.4%. In the Automotive Division, the equity ratio increased clearly from 28.8 to 32.3%. In addition to earnings growth, the conversion of stock options and higher fair values of hedging instruments played a role here. On top of this, higher capital market rates resulted in the recognition of lower actuarial losses from pension obligations directly in equity.</p>
          <p>Pension provisions decreased accordingly by 1.3 billion year-on-year to 12.6 billion. Overall, however, the Volkswagen Group's provisions were 5.6% higher than in the previous year, at 34.3 billion. This level adequately reflects all risks that we can currently identify for our company.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the steady upward trend in net liquidity in recent years continued in 2007. At 13.5 billion euro in the Automotive Division, the already high figure at the end of 2006 was increased by a further 6.3 billion euro. In a time of persistent uncertainty in the global capital markets, this figure is indicative of the soundness of our Group's finances that should not be underestimated.</p>
          <p>Gross cash flow improved by 4.2 million (sic) [4.2 billion] in line with the increased earnings, 4.2 billion euro. Following the release of substantial funds tied up in working capital in 2006, the Automotive Division again recorded an inflow. At 1.8 billion, however, this was 2.3 billion lower than in the previous year, when previous provisions were increased by the effects of the restructuring measures.</p>
          <p>Cash flows from operating activities, which are calculated as gross cash flow net of changes in working capital, thus increased by 1.9 billion euro. Together with the cash outflows from investing activities, which were almost 0.5 billion euro higher, this improved our net cash flow by 1.5 billion to a total of 7.1 billion euro.</p>
          <p>The investments in property, plant and equipment included in investing activities rose by 25% in 2007 to 4.6 billion euro. This means that we left the particularly low level of the previous year and increased the ratio of investments in property, plant and equipment to sales revenue from 3.8% to a still moderate level of 4.6%. Our future expectations concerning this indicator are for a competitive level of around 6%.</p>
          <p>Our disciplined approach to cost management is not affecting all products though. This is only possible because particularly the modularization of vehicle concepts that we are driving forward with is cutting one-time costs for developing individual models, and at the same time we also save unit costs.</p>
          <p>While the Automotive Division's net liquidity continue to record positive growth, the expansion of business in the Financial Services Division resulted in an increase in its structurally negative net liquidity to minus 52.4 billion euro.</p>
          <p>The figure for the Group, as the total of the two divisions, amounted to minus 38.9 billion euro, was thus 3.4 billion better than the previous year's figure.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Volkswagen Group generated profit after tax of 4.1 billion euro in fiscal year 2007, corresponding to undiluted earnings per ordinary share of 10.43 euro. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will therefore propose to the Annual General Meeting to increase the dividend of Volkswagen AG and to pay a dividend of 1.80 euro per ordinary share and 1.86 euro per preferred share.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your attention.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch. Ladies and gentlemen, recently in Geneva I stated that the Volkswagen Group is the most future-proof automaker in the world; and here at our Autostadt, in particular, you can really sense exactly what makes us this future-proof, ready for the future.</p>
          <p>Who else so successfully manages eight strong and independent brands? Each of them an automotive gem! They will now be joined by a ninth brand, Scania, which fits perfectly in with the Group's other brands because it too is an absolute pace setter in its segment. And who else, apart from us, offers the end-to-end automotive spectrum from a clever subcompact to a super sports car to a 40-tonne truck. With more than 160 passenger cars and commercial vehimoticles (sic) [vehicle models], the Volkswagen Group today has a diversity that is justifiably the envy of many a competitor.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, in 2007 we laid the foundations for sustainable and profitable growth. However, despite record unit sales, record sales revenues and record profits, we are still a long way from having achieved our goal. We at the Volkswagen Group are not satisfied with what we have achieved so far and I can promise you that we will continue our drive forward to reach the top of the international automotive industry.</p>
          <p>In doing so, we will make use of three levers; one, higher productivity and declining costs; two, a product initiative that will rollout vehicles tailored precisely to the needs of our customers; and three, taking systematic advantage of our global market opportunities.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, increasing productivity at our plants every year by at least 10% remains our target. The "Volkswagen Way" and the continuous improvement process are core tools towards achieving this.</p>
          <p>In 2006, collective wage agreements were reached by the then Board of Management with the Works Council and they laid the foundations for higher productivity and competitive costs. And we have built systematically on these foundations. Our teams throughout the Group are working tirelessly at further improving workflows and processes. In 2007, we conducted 4,600 workshops at our plants to optimize products and processes. And we trained 475 cost reduction specialists who ensure that all inefficiencies are systematically eliminated. This is a strategy we intend to drive forward, this year by conducting, for instance, another 7,000 workshops.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, all of this strengthened our competitiveness, and it helps us to safeguard jobs in the Group over the long-term. In order to be able do this, and increase productivity at the same time, we've got to sell more cars. And that's why we are investing selectively and judiciously in our future; and this future lies most definitely in highly innovative and desirable vehicles.</p>
          <p>The Volkswagen Group in 2008 to 2010 will invest some 28.9 billion euros in the Automotive Division. Investments in property, plant and equipment will account for 20.9 billion euros; more than half of that will be spent in Germany. At 13.8 billion euros, we will spend the bulk of this figure to modernize and extend our product line up. Our aim is to finance investments in the Automotive Division using internally generated funds. In other words, we will leverage our financial strength to fund our growth.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, these investments in new vehicles today allow us to create the basis for tomorrow's success. If you'd like to see what happens if an automotive manufacturer doesn't do that, you can just take a look at the United States. And what happens if you get it right is illustrated by the repeated unit sales and earnings at Audi.</p>
          <p>And at the same time, and this is important, we are keeping a firm grip on costs. Our Group-wide modular systems or kits are a key to achieving competitive costs despite a high level of model and brand diversity. At the Volkswagen brand, for example, everything from the Polo to the Passat will in the future be based on a Modular Transverse system or kit. In the next few years, we will develop 43 Group models on this basis alone. And this will mean we will achieve a quantum leap in purchasing and in production and it also means massive cost reductions in development.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have set ambitious growth targets and in order to meet them we need, first and foremost, new and attractive vehicles, vehicles that truly thrill our customers.</p>
          <p>And that's why the Volkswagen Group has initiated an unparalleled product initiative. We will launch more than 20 additional new models by the end of 2010. One focus here will be on segments such as SUVs, vans and pickups. Plus, of course, the successors to existing model series, such as the new Golf.</p>
          <p>In the years to come, we will make the Volkswagen Group the world's most international car maker. The days of the "world car" are long gone. Our customers in China and India expect us, a global player to offer entirely different products than we do in the United States or Western Europe. And we will be tailoring our model portfolio precisely to meet these regional customer requirements.</p>
          <p>In our established markets in Western Europe, Germany and the United States, we will ensure that fascinating automobiles again capture the imagination of all car drivers. And we will capture market share with an even more differentiated line-up. At the same time, we will fill in the gaps in the map of the Group so to speak. Russia, India, China and the ASEAN region will be the focus here.</p>
          <p>And these markets, ladies and gentlemen, offer enormous growth opportunities. In China, for instance, there are 300 million people &#x2013; 300 million people that are poised to buy their very first car. In Russia, there are 40 million, and in Asia, in India, 250 million people aspire to motorized mobility.</p>
          <p>And, we will take advantage of this immense potential with local production and local sourcing. Last November in Russia, we opened our 48th plant in the world. Starting in 2009, up to 150,000 fully locally manufactured vehicles a year will role off the production line in Kaluga. This year, we are adding 20 more dealers to the current number of 70 dealers in the Volkswagen dealer network there.</p>
          <p>In India, &#x160;koda has, since 2001, been producing vehicles in Aurangabad. Production of the Audi A6, the Volkswagen Passat also started there recently, and production of the Jetta will be launched in mid-2008. In addition to that, in Pune, 180 kilometers from Bombay, 110 miles, another major plant for up to 110,000 vehicles a year is being built, as I said, in Pune. We will start producing the &#x160;koda Fabia there in 2009, followed by a small car based on the Polo in 2010.</p>
          <p>Then Southeast Asia; we also want to build a forward-looking production and distribution basis there. As you know, we broke off talks with Proton in Malaysia last year. Currently, we are intensively examining various options for entering into markets in the ASEAN region without the need for substantial new investments.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, going forward, the Volkswagen Group will focus to a greater extent on small, environmentally friendly and attractive vehicles. One project that we think is extremely promising is our New Small Family. We have plans to launch one version of the up! for urban drivers in the West, as well another basic version tailored to emerging markets. In the long-term, this will bring us an additional sales volume of at least 500,000 cars per year.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, China is and remains a core market for the Volkswagen Group. In 2007, we set a new record there of 910,500 vehicles delivered. We are very optimistic about selling more than one million vehicles in China for the first time this year.</p>
          <p>Two new models developed specially for China will help us achieve this. In 2008, Volkswagen Group China will complete the restructuring program initiated three years ago. Among other things, this features a 40% reduction in product costs and an increase in local content to more than 80%.</p>
          <p>In 2008, Volkswagen Group China is going to be a national partner of the Beijing Olympic Games. This will set an important environmental example. Volkswagen has set itself the goal of becoming the most environmentally friendly car maker in China. That's why we will cut fuel consumption and emissions of the models produced in China by more than 20% by 2010. To do this, we are utilizing state-of-the-art engines, transmissions, gearboxes, and lightweight construction in all Volkswagen, Audi and &#x160;koda models.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the U.S. market was our problem child for a long time. And that's why, in 2007, we hit the reset button there and fundamentally restructured the Volkswagen Group of America: a leaner organization, a more powerful dealer network and the relocation of our U.S. headquarters to the East Coast. All of this will help us to be closer to our customers in the future.</p>
          <p>By 2018, we intend to sell 1 million vehicles a year in the world's most important car market and about 800,000 of these will be Volkswagen brand vehicles, with 200,000 coming from Audi. However, to allow us to grow profitably, we must produce significantly more vehicles in the dollar zone. And that's why we are currently examining in detail various operations to develop additional production capacity there.</p>
          <p>However, to capture the hearts of our customers in the United States, what we need more than anything else is a model lineup whose design, equipment levels, quality and price are exactly what the market wants. The Volkswagen brand is showing its true colors in 2008, with five new products. In the coming years, the next generation of the Jetta and a new midsize sedan of about the same size as the Passat will follow.</p>
          <p>We are launching extremely clean diesel models in the U.S. market this year. That is, Volkswagen's BlueTDI models and the ultra low emission system in the Audi Q7. I am convinced that these vehicles will give a boost to the market for diesel-powered cars in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, protecting the environment is a top priority for the Volkswagen Group, and not just since this issue started being discussed in the public arena. For many years now, we have been working successfully to make our vehicles more and more economical and cleaner and cleaner. And at the same time, we are pursuing the goal of reducing dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
          <p>We're achieving this by further optimizing the TDI and TSI engines and the Turbo FSI technology at Audi. We can obtain substantial fuel consumption benefits, especially in combination with our innovative twin-clutch transmission DSG. Model series such as the BlueMotion at Audi, the e-models at Audi, Ecomotive at SEAT, or GreenLine at &#x160;koda stand for considerably lower CO2 emissions and lower fuel consumption, without sacrificing driving pleasure. None of these vehicles are pie in the sky or pipedreams. They're already an affordable reality today.</p>
          <p>And at the same time, we are working towards bringing alternative drive technologies to volume production readiness in the long term. Examples of this include hybrid technologies, fuel cells, or plug-in electric drive systems. At the Geneva Auto Show, we've just showcased and are showcasing a Golf TDI hybrid concept that utilizes, or consumes a mere three point liters of diesel per 100 kilometers. And we're also investing heavily in second generation biofuels, which have a carbon footprint that is up to 90% lower and which don't compete with food production. That is why since 2007, Volkswagen has held a stake in a company called CHOREN in the Canadian biofuel producer Iogen.</p>
          <p>The Group invests a lot of effort and money into these issues, and we expressly endorse demanding limits stipulated by environment policy. However, a sense of proportion must be applied to any target. We need targets that make economic and environmental sense.</p>
          <p>The European Commission's published proposals on cutting CO2 emissions are a far cry from this. Exaggerated penalties for larger vehicles are not only hostile to innovation. They also jeopardize the competitiveness of the German automobile industry.</p>
          <p>And, ladies and gentlemen, these are true battles we are waging here. We are talking about the very existence of Germany as a location for business and industry. We're talking about a fair framework for business. That's something worth fighting for, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Volkswagen Group can look to the future with confidence. This is due above all to our 929 &#x2013; our 329,000 employees who are among the best in the global automotive industry. The Volkswagen Group wants to offer them secure, sustainable jobs. And we want to offer prospects for the future for young people in particular. Our goal is to recruit the best minds in the automotive industry, and that's why in Germany alone, we offered permanent employment to 1,200 apprentices. After completing their apprenticeships and we recruited about 500 university graduates in 2007.</p>
          <p>Other companies are shedding employees, but at the same time Volkswagen is bucking this trend. The Group will specifically target young specialists and university graduates for its recruitment programs this year. And I am encouraged that our company is again an employer of choice for young engineers. With the new hiring of some 1,300 university graduates and 2,200 apprentices in Germany in 2008, we are sending a clear signal for Germany as a location for business and industry and also for the future of the company. Around the world, we're talking about 2,700 university graduates and 2,800 apprentices.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, based on our current plans, we will be launching no fewer than 39 new models and product upgrades in 2008. Allow me at this point to present some of the vehicles which we hope will inspire our customers. The first debut this year was the new Passat CC which is being built in Emden. Just a few days ago, we unveiled this vehicle to the European public. And this elegant coupe is packed with our latest engineering and is meeting with an excellent reception.</p>
          <p>The Passat CC will be launched in the European market in the second quarter of 2008. Volkswagen of America was at the Chicago Auto Show where they presented the Routan. This vehicle, which will be sold exclusively in the United States, is based on a successful Chrysler minivan. The Routan shows how we tailor our vehicles precisely to the specific wishes of our U.S. customers.</p>
          <p>The new Volkswagen Scirocco builds on the first two generations of this legendary sports coupe. The Scirocco is an affordable sports car for everyday use. And this car is an impressive demonstration of how emotional, young and sporty Volkswagen is, and will certainly inspire new customers for the brand.</p>
          <p>Audi presented the A4 Avant at the Geneva Auto Show. The Avant is extremely important for this model series. In Germany it accounts for two thirds of Audi A4 unit sales. So it's good news that the Audi Avant successor has emerged as an all-around compelling car.</p>
          <p>In Geneva, &#x160;koda scored a real hit with its new flagship. The successor to the &#x160;koda Superb sets entirely new standards in terms of outstanding value, spaciousness and comfort and the Superb GreenLine is the environmental champion in its class with fuel emissions of just 136 grams per kilometer.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, these are not the only new models to come this year. There are even more to come. SEAT will unveil the new Ibiza in May. Audi brand will present the Q5 at the Beijing Auto Show. And the second half of the year, we'll witness the launch of our most important model. I am convinced that the Mark VI Golf will write a new chapter in the history of the world's most successful automobile.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we've set ambitious goals for ourselves. By 2011, the Volkswagen Group intends to sell 8 million vehicles per year. A strong demand in January and February gives us every reason to be optimistic. We estimate deliveries in these months to be 952,500 vehicles which is up by 10.5% on the previous year. The Volkswagen Passenger Car, &#x160;koda and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brands recorded especially strong growth.</p>
          <p>And the environment we're operating in is not making it any easier for us at all. Global economic growth in 2008 is forecast to be slower than in the previous year. Persistently high commodity prices and especially the higher price of oil are having a negative impact. And there are also risks to global economic growth from the current financial market and credit crises.</p>
          <p>For the automotive industry we are predicting double-digit growth for markets such as Russia, India and China. In Western Europe and the United States on the other hand, we expect new car registrations to be flat or even down slightly, while Germany we hope will experience a slight recovery.</p>
          <p>Driven by falling costs, improved processes and our new model initiative, we expect the Volkswagen Group to again beat the previous year's record figures for deliveries, sales revenues and operating profit in 2008.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, our company is facing major challenges as well as promising opportunities. The Volkswagen Group is excellently positioned to address them.</p>
          <p>Now allow me to recap please. First, we are one of the most fascinating and forward-looking future-proof automobile manufacturers in the world. And together with Porsche, we have an opportunity to advance into an entirely new league.</p>
          <p>Secondly, our nine unique brands need shy away from no comparison. Each of them has the ability to lead the field in its specific segment.</p>
          <p>And third, with an additional 20 vehicles from now up to 2010, we are powering forward at a fast pace and above all with lots of energy with our new product initiative.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Volkswagen Group is on the move and taking the offensive. We are not setting our sights on being number two or three, we are competing to win.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much, Dr. Winterkorn, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now the floor is yours for your questions. You will be given a microphone. You can, of course, also put your questions in English and please tell us who you are. Where shall we start? Adam Hull in front here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Adam Hull from WestLB. Three questions, sorry, four questions if I may. Firstly, on Audi and provisioning. It's a good result from Audi, but I notice you seem to have a very large increase in sales obligations. If I look at the provisions, the increase is 795 million, a 28% increase year-on-year. I wonder if you could give us a bit more detail there. Is there anything we should particularly be worrying about, or is this rather conservative accounting?</p>
          <p>Secondly, a question on R&amp;D. Could you give us some indication of what the cash R&amp;D spending in '08 and 2009 will be? I think my math suggests 2.6 or 2.7 as your average rate for the next three years. Just maybe help us a bit on that. And what is the capitalization rate on R&amp;D '08 and '09?</p>
          <p>And three, a question perhaps for Mr. Winterkorn on the new Golf. At the Geneva show, you mentioned it would be a quantum leap. Could you give us a bit more details, perhaps particularly on the production costs, and whether we should see a big impact on VW brand from the Golf in '09?</p>
          <p>And then very finally, perhaps for Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, on associates, if I look at the JV associate line on page 201 of the report, you have an 86 million loss in JVs, a very strong profit of 443. What is that loss, though, and is that a one-off item or an ongoing item? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me start with the first question. Concerning the increase in provisions, made for or at Audi. First of all, as a matter of principle, you know that we always try and keep trying to take risks into consideration and make adequate provision for risks. This is exactly our approach here. And when you look at the mix, the country mix, you will have seen that there are some new markets that we're heading into, trying to gain ground. And so, these provisions are made particularly for these projects there.</p>
          <p>Second, we do have a consolidation effect that we see here because different from the years before, when you look at the Audi accounts, Audi of America activities have been taken into account directly and in view of the volume there. That's about 10%, after all, of annual sales. So, we also have to make provisions amounting to the same level. So, there is nothing really to worry about there. On the contrary. As you know, you can rest assured that we just take the necessary precautionary measures and make provisions.</p>
          <p>Second, R&amp;D expenditure. First of all, you can safely assume that for the years to come, on average, we'll be at the level of 2007, give or take 10%. This might mean of course that in single or individual years, you might spend a little more. In other years, it might be a little less. You know that this very much depends on specific projects, and therefore when you look at individual years only, it's not very informative. You have to look at longer periods of time, and here we can say that the R&amp;D ratio as the ratio of sales is not really going to change significantly.</p>
          <p>And this brings me to the capitalization ratio of R&amp;D cost &#x2013; sorry, development cost, capitalization of development cost. This very much has to do with the fact whether we have a year where the milestones are reached for development ratios, or the milestones of the projects are reached, and there we also have fluctuations. We take it, however, that the average of the past three years to take this as a base year. So it was about one-third of primary costs that we had there, so that this is also the approach, or the numbers, that you can expect for the future.</p>
          <p>Stakeholdings, investments, JVs, we do consider whenever starting new activities here. Let me give you some examples. As far as engines are concerned and engine production, we started activities in China, and of course startup losses have to be incurred, it's unavoidable. So as I said before, our accounting has been very conservative, and the valuation was based on a very conservative level. And there is no reason whatsoever to worry about this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You asked me about the quantum leap. The quantum leap for the Golf or with the Golf. Now basically, this relates to three different topics. First of all, I'm firmly convinced that with the new design and styling of the Golf, we've really made a major step forward, major step forward to really have an even more clearly profiled Volkswagen identity. It's going to be unique and completely different from our competitors.</p>
          <p>Secondly, and I think you can see this when you look at the Scirocco down there, so the high level of quality is very apparent there. This will make the car very attractive and desirable. And of course, you e asked about my expectations for 2009. So I expect sales figures to meet our targets at least. At least. And as far as the costs are concerned, I think there hasn't been any product so far where the technical development, the production, manufacturing times, procurement, material cost, where we've had so much cooperation in order to meet the cost targets.</p>
          <p>And as far as manufacturing times are concerned, Mr. Heizmann can say something about this, Mr. Heizmann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is moving into the right direction. This is what I meant by quantum leap, and I can only repeat this. Prices, the prices that we ask for, for Volkswagen product, we'll only get them when our cars are desirable for our customers.</p>
          <p>Mr. Pieper in the second row?</p>
          <p>Okay, I will comment on this right away. So 20 to 25% &#x2013; so we'll need 20 to 25% less time to produce the new Golf than we needed for the predecessor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Dr. Heizmann. Mr. Pieper next.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bankhaus Metzler, Pieper. Three questions. More of a business administration matter. Mr. Winterkorn, you mentioned productivity plus 10% productivity targets, and product development, you said okay, we are going to continue like that. So, is that also true of cost? Will it be the same or identical, similar to 2007? The product cost will go down more than the fixed costs will go up? So, 2008, will it be similar to 2007?</p>
          <p>Second, on liquidity, probably to Mr. P&#xF6;tsch? What would be the optimum liquidity of the Volkswagen Group today? And what does it mean for surplus liquidity that might come about? How would you use that if you got it?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, when you talked about the segments, the intermediate returns, you have this leap forward also. Have you changed accounting methods? Or is that really due to the fact that there's been more intra-company activities between Audi and Volkswagen, like components, engines, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, on the first question. Now, what are the major influences really on the cost situation when you look at the operating result? I think we are safe to assume that the major trends that have started already will probably continue. We do assume that a very strict and consistent continuation of our cost discipline, our spending discipline, that through doing this &#x2013; I have to look at Mr. Garcia here, because he and his team really, they have contributed a major part here. So that, with all this we'll get, or we'll be able to achieve some major improvements. The Golf comes in here, definitely when everything is up and running in '09, and even plays a major role. So, the answer is yes. The main factors that influence the situation will continue to exist.</p>
          <p>Liquidity; you know that, but I have to disappoint you with my answer, because first of all I have to say there are certain topics or subjects that do cause more sleepless nights for me than liquidity. It's difficult to tell. I mean, without referring to a specific situation, I'm not sure whether it's possible at all to define what optimal, or optimum liquidity is. So, let me just say there is no pressure for us. We are not forced to do anything in order to get rid of surplus liquidity. When you look at our group and the size and the complexity of our activities, looking at the products and tapping into new markets, India, Russia, China, North America, after all, that's also in the pipeline. So, with all that, I think we are well advised to have a higher liquidity than on average for some years to come.</p>
          <p>And then there is something else, of course. The liquidity is still there, but I mean the contract, the agreement to buy further shares of Scania, once we get to the closing stage, then it's 2.9 billion after all, where we have an outflow. And without the money, without the liquidity, this would be a bit difficult. So, all in all, there is no pressure on us.</p>
          <p>Other items, you are right. We have a change of methods here; in the past, we had certain ratios for the different brands and that was rather difficult. Now, since we promised before to increase the transparency concerning the breakdown according to brands, we said okay, why do these lump sum allocations we just stated the way it is, and you know intermediate profits, you know how it works. They go up and down, inventories go down, intermediate profits also. It hasn't got to do &#x2013; but the results of the brands have changed.</p>
          <p>Concerning fixed cost, Mr. Winterkorn?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Material cost can best be reduced, and Mr. Garcia knows this, through procuring or purchasing; you can buy three or four units over six or seven years for just 0.5 million. And with a modular kit, when I develop the component only once maybe for different brands or models, then I can also reduce fixed cost. So much for the longitudinal, or lateral kit and the reduction here of cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Mr. Breitsprecher go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian Breitsprecher, Oppenheim. First of all, I have a question to follow up on segment reporting. Now, comparing the previous year in 2007, have you changed the methods? That was a question about that.</p>
          <p>And then Professor Winterkorn and Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, you said at the press conference that if you achieve the targets for 2018, that would be an operating margin of about 8%. So, 2018 is a long way down the road. Last year, it was 5.5%. Can you give us a few milestones along that road, when you're going to reach 7%, 8% or whatever? When you intend to do so?</p>
          <p>And then my second question about investments and free cash flow. In the next three years on the average, you will be spending about 7 billion on fixed assets, investing about 7 million per year now. What do you think sustainable free cash flow generation would be over that time period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me say the first thing very clearly. There is no change in our methodology, in our presentation. We are just showing the intermediate earnings separately in a separate line.</p>
          <p>Point two, objectives for 2018, our targets for that year. Well, I did say at the accounts press conference that corresponding to the Group objective of return on capital, and let me say parenthetically that that is less than 21% brand because there are certain Group costs that you have to take into account. Now, corresponding to our Group objective for 2018, we are looking at eight point something percent operating profit. And I said you don't have to wait to see major strides forward here. Each and every year we want to improve on this, but I would request that you should not underestimate what it means to add one percentage point of profitability here each year.</p>
          <p>And let me say one thing very clearly. Despite all the potential we have, it very simply is true that the additional increases in efficiency, additional cutting of costs and so on are going to become more difficult. It's quite simple. The closer you get to what's ultimately possible, well let's say it's like with a spring; the closer you get to the end of where the spring can go, the harder it's going to be to compress that spring, and it's like that for us, and we're going to see that for a while. It will take a while for us to reach our target. But, as I said, or as I can say here, every year we're going to improve this. In other words, we're not going to be dropping back.</p>
          <p>Then, let me answer the question about investments, and then there was a question about free cash flow. You always have to be comparing the same things, and if all other things remain equal, we don't want you to make any incorrect assumptions. In the past we were always talking about a specific range, a general range. Now, for instance, 3 billion, taking a stake in another company for 3 billion, that hasn't been taken into account. So, if you look at operating cash flow and generated free cash flow, then even though we are going to be investing at the level that you've mentioned, talking about our medium-term investment plans here, so that means that every year we'll have a free cash flow of at least two or probably even more billion per year, two or even more billion per year. That was Mr. P&#xF6;tsch.</p>
          <p>Okay, John Lawson go ahead, second row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>From Citi. Professor Winterkorn, I was a little surprised that you didn't take the opportunity of this conference perhaps to share with us your long-term vision for the company in a little more detail. I mean we've been hearing bits and pieces of the 2018 plan coming out through various interviews, but it seems that this was a great occasion for you to share with us your vision and I wondered why you chose not to do that and when we are going to hear about it?</p>
          <p>Following on from that I think one figure was actually mentioned that we've heard before, this rather ambitious target of a 21% return on invested capital at the VW brand. To help us gauge what it means to get to 21% on that brand, would you be kind enough to share with us what its achievement was in 2007?</p>
          <p>Then secondly, I acknowledge you've said that you're going to improve operating profit in '08 and that you're aiming for double digit returns on invested capital in the long-term. Actually the addition of Scania means that you're probably already achieving those on a pro forma basis, so what are you going to do about updating your targets for us as we go forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with regard to our vision, to explain that a little bit let me tell you two things. First of all, the vision for our modular system, modularization that can be seen in the new Audi family A4, A4 Avant, Q5, and will continue from there, that's the modular longitudinal kit or system and an entire family of vehicles will be on that system with many different modules and our expenditures have been cut dramatically for that. Development costs have been cut dramatically too for this.</p>
          <p>And that means that as you can see at Audi with one model coming down the pipeline after another, you can use the modular kit to build new cars relatively quickly. And this modular system will at some point in time reach the 1 million vehicle per year level. And in the luxury segment it will be an unprecedented modular system. And I'm looking to my colleague Mr. Garcia, having negotiations like this for luxury class vehicles will really strengthen his position in negotiations.</p>
          <p>And the second thing is something we're doing at Volkswagen in development there. The modular longitudinal system will be translated into a modular transverse system. As you know the upper class or luxury segment has longitudinal, the A235, the A0 and the Golf, they have transverse engines, and our colleague Dr. Hattenberg who's in front of you there with his team, is working with the production people, with the purchasing people to develop this modular transverse kit or system. A second even bigger modular system in the Group that all of our Group vehicles will be based on with transverse engines, beginning with the Polo, then the Ibiza A0 A vehicles all the way up to the Passat, everything will be built on that modular transverse system. We're talking here about something to the tune of, well, more than 3 million vehicles at some point in time.</p>
          <p>And then the third kit, the next vision that's here on the right, the Space Up! That's going to be our new small family modular system or kit. It's got a rear engine, and that's going to be a car for urban driving in Europe. Small cars, very small footprint, can go down to 3.4 meters. It could be a car with a footprint of 3.7, 3.8 meters in length. We've got this vision for Europe, and with this modular system or modular kit, it's conceivable for us to develop special cars for India and China with two-cylinder and three-cylinder engines.</p>
          <p>That is the general vision, our strategy for the future with our vehicles based on our modular systems. Then of course there are other sports car modular systems, the A8, the Lamborghini and you've got Scania and so on and so forth, but mainly we'll have these three modular kits. And with these three modular kits or systems we believe that we will be successful, we'll be well-positioned as a car company in the next decade to be successful and to grow in the next decade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I can add something to that briefly. Our financial framework is what I'd like to tell you about. Let me give you something a little bit more concrete here. We're talking about an objective of 21% return on investment for 2018 for Volkswagen Passenger Cars. Now, the first thing you have to imagine is that for all brands and all regions in the Group, there are comparable targets. It's a range from 15 to 21% return on investment at that point in time. And this equally means that for example a substantial improvement in profitability at SEAT will play a key role in this area, and also a key improvement at Volkswagen Passenger Cars. That's the core element of course.</p>
          <p>And the second point I'd like to point out here, second thing I'd like to mention is this: We've been talking about the brands so far, now let's look at the different regions. Now when you do this, we have to say that we're not performing that bad in certain regions in any case. We can recognize that we can achieve the necessary returns with one big exception, that's North America. And that's why our North America project, and I'm sure you're going to be asking about this later on, but in any case our North America project is not just an isolated issue of being successful in North America. Rather it is a true key that will allow us as a Group on the whole to achieve the targeted ROI levels. Now if you combine this with the structural issue that Dr. Winterkorn was talking about, that is the answer to the question about how we want to achieve that, above all with regard to the products, that is with our economies of scale and so on, while I do think that you do, or could, get a general picture here.</p>
          <p>And then let me conclude by saying this: When we talk about our key figures, for instance operating results and how in 2008 we want to improve them once again, Scania has not yet been taken into account. Now, at an appropriate time in the future, we will be telling you about this, taking account of Scania, but I would like to point out that we want to do this right. We first of all have to go through all of our antitrust activities before we have the final closing that we hope will be about the middle of the year. So you will be hearing from us in due time with these figures but right now we're talking about an objective for the Group as it is today. Everything else will be seen later. And as you can imagine it won't be negative.</p>
          <p>Okay let's stick to the second row there. Mr. Denniholm, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's continue with trucks perhaps. I have a question about your activities there; the numbers are in the annual report. How big are your truck activities in Brazil, revenues, profit, and in the future will they be and remain part of the Group or will they perhaps leave the Group? Another question about products, you have a picture of the Espada in the annual report, 68. What about Lamborghini? Could you develop that as part of a cooperative project?</p>
          <p>As a product of the last model cycle, we had the change of the Golf, in a phase yearly, but the overall environment concerning the demand was a bit weaker than before. Do you think there is a certain risk there maybe after all? Concerning the point in time, next fall or next spring maybe not so much for the results but as far as the number of the units sold are concerned, do we have to expect some delays maybe concerning a weakening of the demand?</p>
          <p>And then you mentioned new cars, the number of new cars, just to get an idea, how many different variants do you have, that you count under the status quo of this portfolio? And then one more question in the end, so there is a second round of bargaining agreements, internal ones, when you look at the capital cost coverage. Do you still want to do this although you've met your targets already? A success-related component was also paid. Is this a sustainable voluntary component, expecting that margins stay like this, or might it even go up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning the first question, Brazil, no changes really are planned. We are very happy to have what we got there. Lamborghini, a very interesting question. Our Lamborghini colleagues of course keep having new ideas. We have a clear agreement with them: once they've made enough money that they can afford a third series that's fine. So, the two that we got, that's what we're going to keep for the time being, open and close, the two versions both. The Golf, the Mark V Golf, the start of production and the launch, I don't want to talk about this again, some matters were certainly unsatisfactory there. But as I told you before, what I expect the new Golf to be &#x2013; desirable, attractive, very precise, just the way Volkswagens ought to be.</p>
          <p>And when you look at the Scirocco downstairs for example, when I talk about this you know what I'm talking about: design, styling, quality, visual appearance, attractiveness, all that is a given there. With the Golf we are not going to have problems of before. I know from my colleagues Mr. Heizmann and from Mr. Garcia as well, that the preparation of the launches is such that there are no problems to be expected and no delays either. The different variants, I mentioned the number before; 160, that's what it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning the bargaining agreements for the rates paid here. So, the profit sharing our agreements here are binding until 2011, 10% of the operating result is a profit, a bonus part that's paid out to the team. So, this will also remain valid for the years to come. The second part of the question, developing this internal agreement further. Yes, of course also in order to become even more competitive. And what's important here as a component is more focus on performance, individualization of the profit sharing scheme and the more traditional topics like HR development, workplace conditions, health and fitness. We have to focus on this in order to really have this top team before 2018, although it's the target for 2018, we want to get there as quickly as possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, a question from Jochen Gehrke, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jochen Gehrke, Deutsche Bank. Three questions. First of all, Mr. Winterkorn, you mentioned before that you've planned increases in productivity by 10% for the years to come. 6.2 million units were produced last year, 8 million is in the pipeline for 2011, or that's what you plan for 2011. When you look at the present capacity, is it possible to get to these volumes? It looks like it but in spite of this we know this from different newspapers et cetera, you have different plans of increasing capacities in different parts of the world. Does that mean that Volkswagen today has too high a level of utilization of capacity, and should we really expect a drop here over the years? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, concerning 2018 again, you pointed out yourself that this is quite a long time until then. I don't think it's cynical to state that both for you and for us not everybody will still be around in 2018 to judge what's been achieved then. Your predecessor looked at much shorter period of times for targets to be set. 2008, the target was '10 and it was achieved one year early. Why do you pick this long period or choose this long period, is it a matter of motivating your teams? Porsche announced that they wanted to go beyond 51%. Do you believe that your new majority shareholder will take an operating influence on Volkswagen, not just as so far from the supervisory board?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Capacity, I think Dr. Heizmann can answer this much better. I can only say here, when you look at the capacity or the utilization of capacity it's not just the units produced that are important. You also have to look at the content. We have a very clear program. The content of our cars, the levels of equipment will be increased. So you need more of the capacity that's available. So actually there is a very good match. The capacity that we are talking about for the United States, for China and India, so they will go online in 2010 or 11 but maybe Dr. Heizmann can say something about this. 2018, let me be very open, we picked this period of time, or the span of 10 years, we did the same by the way at Audi. We went until 2015 there because it just makes sense to look at such a period of time, it's very good to focus the team onto a target. Of course, we've got our planning rounds and we've got cycles of three and five years also and we report about them at the supervisory board meetings and the planning round meetings. We have these objectives and targets, but all in all of course everything is under the main umbrella of 2018 Porsche. The family, the company, even if they have more than 51% I assume, I am sure, that the operating business will be handled by the Board of Volkswagen and the supervisory Board will also deal with topics in the same way that has been dealing with us so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To add to this on the capacity, Mr. Heizmann. The level of utilization of our capacity is very high today. More than 90% the way that we compute this, and we have three shift operation that we take as a base here. If we calculated this on a two-shift base then we'd be clearly above 100%. Other companies do that. 90% plus therefore is a matter of principle, correspond to full utilization of capacity, because after all there are some other things that come in here. Certain vehicles have reached the end of their model cycle so there is some seasonal effect. So this is really full utilization of capacity. Capacities planned on the base of our growth strategy, capacity that we need &#x2013; this is really the outcome or the outflow of our growth strategy. So, we do not plan to have a lower utilization. We'll have the same high level as before, and the increase in capacity will take place step by step in line with the increase in demand and sales. So step-by-step, this holds to both of the factories that are being presently set up in Russia and India, and also for the North American region. I think the plants that we got there plus China also, particularly in China, they are going to step up things. Thank you very much, Mr. Schneider next.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Horst Schneider, HSBC. As a follow-up here to what you've said, Mr. Heizmann, Volkswagen has been quite like a big ship, difficult to control and steer in difficult times. The size, is it an advantage in the meantime, or when the markets decline, might it be turned into a disadvantage then? The capacity increases, how quickly can you actually take them back? You say that U.S. markets will decline only slightly, other people say that there is a stronger decline to be expected. It's difficult to forecast the future. When you plan for the future, can you revise your plans quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are very cautious with our plans and careful. And we actually will step up capacities slowly, step-by-step. This is true of all of our new locations. So it's a cautious approach, a careful ramp up based also on three shift operation, so all of the operating means will be utilized to full capacity. So again the risk is calculated for this approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe to add to this very briefly, something that you shouldn't forget here; with some of these decisions, when we actually want to be a player in certain markets we have to produce on location, it's a digital decision. If you want to be represented in India, you have to produce your products in India. The same in Russia. So basically it's a matter of deciding whether you want to be in these markets or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, producing means not just producing, it also means local content.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the, if I may. First of all on the truck business overall, with all the numerous stakes and operations you have, I was wondering how do you intend to structure those operations to extract the synergies with Scania, MAN and your old businesses as soon as possible? That's the first question. Second one on the general issue of cost competitiveness. You made a very good job, but you said that you still have a lot of things to do, and I was wondering what is the pace of restructuring we should expect? I mean, should we expect sort of a drastic restructuring or more gradual soft kind of adjustments? And when you look at the levers, you mentioned between labor costs on the one hand and purchasing on the other, which of the two will be the biggest contributor to the earnings improvement in 2008 and beyond? And final question on the Financial Services, if you could comment maybe on the evolution of credit loss ratios, delinquencies, cost of funding, both in '07, but more importantly entering into 2008, what you see as a trend, and if you could maybe focus on the North American operations and more specifically, the leasing operations in North America. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the truck business. I said very clearly that currently we're not thinking of changing structures at all. We're going to continue to have Scania as it is. But if you're asking about synergies, there might be synergies at some point in time in the future, possibly with Scania and MAN, but we shouldn't just ask about that, we have to ask about synergies with Volkswagen and Scania. Let me give you a couple of examples, very simple. Purchasing steel; Mr. Garcia purchases 3 million tons of steel a year and Scania maybe 10. Electronics; in trucks nowadays you use electronics just as you do in passenger cars, whether it's lane departure warning, braking equipment and so on. There's lots of different electronic equipment you can use in both. And then if you look at the inside of a truck you see that many things look like passenger cars: the quality of the leather, the controls, the switches. And I know that there is a lot of opportunity for synergies here, we will find lots of synergies.</p>
          <p>Then, secondly, the discussion of CO2, this is something that will also affect trucks. And, in the truck business, the subject of lightweight construction is much more important than in passenger cars because cutting consumption will also have an impact on payload. So we have expertise in lightweight construction. Lightweight construction, that comes from Audi, we know about building with titanium, aluminum, carbon fiber technology know-how. With all of this know-how I'm sure we're going to be able to help Scania. Those will be the initial approaches and then we'll see what happens from there.</p>
          <p>Then you were asking about the different levers we could apply. Well I'm sure we're going to be using both of those levers, labor costs, a 10% productivity increase and then cost of materials. We want to cut there, but that is one of Mr. Garcia's most well kept secrets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may, I'd like to say a couple of things now about the subject of restructuring; softer or harder restructuring. And it's important for me to get across to people what we are actually doing here. Now, looking to the past, in particular to 2007, we see that the situation in most markets has been and still is that if you've got the right product on offer you'll find your customers to buy it. This is the lesson we've all got to learn. And then we have to look into some details and ask, okay, what does it mean to have the right product on offer? And this is, no doubt, something that applies to everyone including Volkswagen. One thing is the price. You've got to have the right price. And if you want to be able to offer the right price and at the same time achieve an acceptable level of profitability, then you've got to focus on costs. But allow me to go into the details of this too.</p>
          <p>Now you don't have to share my opinion, but my opinion in any case is very clear about this subject as to what hard restructuring is. At first glance it perhaps always looks dramatic, if there is a company that shutters entire plants or dramatically cuts capacities or whatever. And I have to say to you what we do is actually much harder because, as Dr. Winterkorn said, imagine this, we will have a modular building kit for the lion's share of our lineups, and there are many people struggling to make this possible.</p>
          <p>It's much more difficult, much more demanding and much harder than to simply, and I will put it simply, to have the Board of Management just signing a couple pieces of paper saying we're going to cut thousands of jobs. I wanted to put that very clearly because otherwise people might have the impression that we are not taking something seriously, that's definitely not true. We see the risks in the fundamentals, in the general economic conditions and we are focusing systematically on costs, and the subject of productivity is one of these issues, and here too, the subject of the Volkswagen way is extremely ambitious, we have extremely ambitious productivity targets. So for us, basically that is a small revolution because this kind of thing doesn't happen by itself. And I really did want to convey this quite clearly here.</p>
          <p>Then you asked about financial services, continues Mr. P&#xF6;tsch. First of all, for the entire global organization the situation is that we have no substantial credit losses. In fact delinquency rates have gone down. This is due to the fact that we are very proactive in our work and as you know on the one hand we have customer loans and dealer loans. It's a problem more when you have dealer loans and we have certain teams for wholesale financing that focus on whether or not things could be becoming more difficult. And as a result we've been able to substantially cut our delinquency rates. And I think that many other companies would be happy to have achieved the rates that we've achieved. Now this of course means that we are actually quite cautious in granting retail and wholesale financing. This is not something that our automotive colleagues always appreciate, but over the medium and long term it's, I believe, the right policy.</p>
          <p>Then with regard to funding costs, well of course market developments are also impacting us. And let me first of all say that in the Group, in some months Group liquidity will be used for bridging gaps but the basic principle is that financial services does its refunding independently in markets so that we have clearly separated these two divisions. And, in my presentation, I pointed out briefly that we succeeded in issuing certain securities under conditions that are outstanding in view of the current market conditions, but this of course means for us that this results in an increase in funding costs. Okay, I think that we've actually covered all important subjects.</p>
          <p>Are there perhaps one or two last questions? Mr. Lubinetzki, go ahead.</p>

          <p>Lothar Lubinetzki, MainFirst Bank. China; last year China had an increase in profit that was quite dramatic, 200 million. At the end of the year you said that for China you're talking about or expecting a growth of 15 to 20%. Now can we translate this into meaning the following: On an absolute level the profit contribution from China will in 2008 grow like it did in 2007?</p>
          <p>My second question is more of a technical question. On the one hand it's clear where you have your reserves in your balance sheet but there are a couple of things where you might say you had a one-off effect on the positive side. First of all, financial results, I remember that for the first three quarters you were saying again and again that there were one-off effects from portfolio restructuring. Can you quantify that? And secondly, the other operating earnings, that's from hedging, there is a point in there and there is a swing; if you net the expenditures of 800 million you get that. Now could you tell us the background to that?</p>

          <p>I'd like to begin with China. First of all I believe that our team in China has done an outstanding job. Let me say that the opportunities for reacting in terms of our products were relatively small and we still had to do this restructuring, and it was achieved mainly by increasing efficiency, cutting costs, together with major improvements in quality. And I'd like to say this very publicly, hats off to that team, great respect for them.</p>
          <p>Now looking to the future, you know that we've got our Olympic Program and that is currently being implemented; it's not been completed. The Olympics Games won't be for a couple of months now, and that won't be the end of the line either because we're going to at least continue with the Olympic thought after that, but that means that we will be focusing more on new products to be launched. There will be two very significant ones launched this year, during the course of this year and then, when the fundamentals, or if the fundamentals remain as positive as they did begin this year, there will be another major increase in volume, in revenues and in earnings. I hope you understand that we cannot be any more specific and do not want to be any more specific at this point in time.</p>
          <p>Then the balance sheet. Well it's highly interesting to note that you found out that we've hidden reserves some place. I will stick to what I said, actually for many years, forever actually, we've always been very sound and conservative in our balance sheets, in our accounting, and 2007 is exactly in line, it's the same category. In my presentation, and you're right here about this, during the course of the year we did point out that in the financial results we would have a positive development and we can't just automatically assume that it will occur every year. Let me explain that briefly. You know that some of our liquidity is invested. We do asset management, and from time to time there's some investments that terminate or have to be terminated or wrapped up, and from this we do have a triple-digit positive effect in 2007, which, let me repeat this and it's important, which can't be seen as a basic assumption for 2008 or 2009. We'll have to see when we are able to get such favorable conditions again.</p>
          <p>And with regard to currency, I can only say that one thing always happens. If you're hedged at a relatively high level, then the exchange rate fluctuations mean that your hedging is all the more important. I don't have to hide from you the fact that if the exchange rate was better we would prefer it because that would be better for the exchange of products across the Atlantic.</p>
