      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mariel, and good morning to everyone. I'm glad to point out that Siemens had a strong start to the new fiscal year. We achieved broad-based order and revenue growth in further improving markets with an impressive book-to-bill of 1.16. Excellent profit in cash conversion, clearly ahead of the prior year, resulted in a significant increase in net income from continuing operations of 17%.</p>
          <p>This led to a basic earnings per share of &#x20AC;2 in the first quarter and we took decisive steps to further focus our portfolio on our sectors by signing an option agreement to sell Siemens IT Solutions and Services to Atos Origin.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we divested our minority stakes in Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Gigaset. In a nutshell, our first-quarter performance shows that we live up to our ambition of capital-efficient growth and are fully on track to reach our targets for 2011.</p>
          <p>Now let me walk you through the highlights of the first quarter. First, our order situation. As indicated, we have seen a continued pickup in demand, supported by a strong positive currency tailwind during the first quarter. On a comparable basis, orders were clearly up 13% versus the first quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>We saw particularly strength in our short cycle businesses, such as Industry Automation, OSRAM and the motion control part of our Drive Technologies. And we expect growth rates to normalize during the second half of fiscal year 2011 due to the basis effect.</p>
          <p>Our long-cycle businesses in Industry and Energy show further improvement and we expect this to continue. As I said, the sharp rise of the first-quarter orders from the previous year led to a book-to-build ratio of 1.16. This ratio was above one in all sectors and across all regions, with particular strength in the emerging markets, such as India and China. It helped increase the backlog from &#x20AC;87 billion at the end of fiscal year '010 to &#x20AC;92 billion in the first quarter, of which around &#x20AC;34 billion will convert in the remainder of this year and &#x20AC;58 billion in 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p>A major growth driver was an excellent flow of large orders in Fossil Power Generation and also in Mobility. Let me mention just a few examples of important order wins.</p>
          <p>First, the Mobility division signed a contract to deliver 10 high-speed trains supporting Eurostar's expansion plans for further cross-European rail services. Mobility was also very successful in winning businesses from various cities, a key focus of our account management strategy. We will equip metro lines in Oslo, Munich and Santo Domingo with trains or rail automation equipment.</p>
          <p>And second, Fossil won the Bugok 3 turnkey project in South Korea, which will be the ninth combined cycle power plant built by Siemens in this country during the last 10 years. And even more important, this is the first H-Frame deployment in the Asian market and has proven its success now on three continents.</p>
          <p>Revenue growth of 6% year-on-year and on a comparable basis was well balanced between the sectors. It was paced by strong double-digit growth in our short cycle Industrial businesses and backed by our robust backlog, for example, in Renewable Energy.</p>
          <p>As of this quarter the healthcare financial disclosure follows its new organizational structure. The new setup achieves greater integration of the Healthcare business and unifies sales and service in one sector-wide organization. Therefore, Healthcare numbers are shown on a sector level and they're in the Diagnostics division performance.</p>
          <p>In the Healthcare sector, we had a mixed revenue picture with strong demand from emerging countries, but weaker results in European markets hurt by governmental austerity measures.</p>
          <p>As expected, Diagnostics revenue growth is still very moderate at 1%. We address the structural challenges through increased investments in research and development and greater integration of Diagnostics and Therapy Systems.</p>
          <p>The gradual regional shift in demand towards emerging markets can be seen in the top line. A region like China showed remarkable organic revenue growth of 19%, clearly above the average growth rate.</p>
          <p>The good news is that we see also growth in the developed countries where our innovation-driven solutions for energy efficiency, infrastructure, modernization and industrial productivity help to build on our leading positions.</p>
          <p>15% revenue growth in Germany, considerably benefiting from export opportunities in emerging markets, and 12% growth in the U.S. are clear evidence of our excellent technology position.</p>
          <p>As I said, it was a quarter where we showed our ability to convert top line growth into rising profits and cash through stringent execution and targeted investments.</p>
          <p>Sector profit rose 6% against the prior year, despite the cost allocation of &#x20AC;261 million for the special employee remuneration from corporate to the divisions. The reported sector margin reached 12% and excluding the employee bonus effect, even more impressive 13.4%.</p>
          <p>Net profit from continuing operations increased even stronger by 17% despite a SIS goodwill impairment of &#x20AC;136 million. There are a couple of factors working together here to produce these excellent numbers.</p>
          <p>First, top line growth in our short cycle businesses resulted in fully loaded factories and a strong profit conversion. A great achievement of the Industry Automation team was to lift profitability above the 20% threshold due to the increased capacity utilization and a good business mix.</p>
          <p>OSRAM's profit continued to benefit from strong demand for LEDs, now accounting already for around 21% of revenues and the majority of OSRAM's research and development spending.</p>
          <p>Second, we executed very diligently on our projects and realized the expected gross margins. Fossil's new high in profit was also helped by high margin component orders and positive effects from project completions.</p>
          <p>Third, profitability in Healthcare was below the very strong first quarter of 2010, in part due to a less favorable business mix in Imaging and Diagnostics. Please keep in mind, the previous year also was supported by positive effects from currency hedges. In addition, profit was burdened by additional charges for the particle therapy projects of &#x20AC;32 million.</p>
          <p>And finally, we increased our research and development investment by more than &#x20AC;100 million, compared to the fiscal quarter of [audio skip] 2010 to maintain the innovation lead in area such as Wind, LEDs, or smart grids.</p>
          <p>Our innovation pipeline is very promising and we introduced several leading innovations during Q1. For example, Healthcare launched in &#x2013; at the RSNA, its new Biograph mMR, the world's first fully-integrated whole-body molecular MR and PET system. And once again, we started the year with a positive free cash flow, fueled by solid cash conversion in all sectors.</p>
          <p>Overall, we achieved a cash conversion rate of 0.51, slightly up from last year's 0.47 in a seasonally weaker first quarter.</p>
          <p>Advance payments and billings in excess so far held up well against our concerns of a &#x2013; of a change in customer payment behavior. Mobility and Fossil Power Generation still achieved strong cash conversion rates. Due to the steep revenue increase in our short cycle businesses, we saw a corresponding growth in working capital.</p>
          <p>Return on capital employed was at an excellent 23%, up 380 basis points from last year and well above the target range of 15% to 20% set as part of One Siemens. The main reason for our significant ROCE improvement is the increased profit level despite one-off SIS goodwill impairment.</p>
          <p>To a lesser extent, ROCE benefited from lower average capital employed. Main positive influence in capital employed was a &#x20AC;4 billion reduction in net debt compared to the first quarter in 2010. Before moving to our questions, let me close with a brief remark on our outlook.</p>
          <p>Siemens is off to a good start in fiscal 2011 and based on the assumption of a stable economic development with our markets showing further improvement, we are fully on track to achieve our targets for orders and revenues. We feel comfortable about the profit outlook of increasing income from continuing operations to exceed reported fiscal 2010 results by at least 25% to 35%.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to hand over to Joe for your questions and I unfortunately have to leave for the General Assembly. Over to you, Joe.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We will start today's question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>And our first question comes from the line of Andreas Willi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I have two quick questions, please, on the energy business. The first one on the Fossil business in terms of your strong order intake there, maybe you could give us a little bit more background and detail on where do you see strength from a regional perspective and also from a product prospective. Also, are there further potential orders in the pipeline for the H-Frame in the near-term, or was that Korea order kind of the last one of the near-term project you were working on? On pricing, maybe you could comment what you see there also in these new orders.</p>
          <p>The second question on transmission. There is pricing still getting worse? And also, you mentioned in your press release increased investments there. What exactly do you plan to do in that business to maintain competitiveness? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Andreas. Good morning, everyone, by the way and thank you for listening already that early in the day, but as you know, we have our AGM coming up today, so we need to get up a bit earlier.</p>
          <p>On Energy, in general I mean you've probably have already heard from the tone in the last couple of encounters we had together that we feel actually very comfortable about the for-sale market in terms of demand, and that demand is wide spread. It's about Asia, it's about Europe, while the U.S. is still awaiting its gas turbine renaissance. So it is about Middle East and the BRIC countries in particular, if you talk about growth.</p>
          <p>On H-Frame, as you know, we continue to, as I said, to further enhance the efficiency together with our customers and grow the H-Frame, so there is a lot of interest, obviously, based on our performance levels we have the machines. But there would not be any major orders which were to be announced anytime soon.</p>
          <p>Pricing definitely remains high topic in the Fossil environment. There are two areas to follow our customers &#x2013; customers are still demanding some positive input to their business plans in terms of cost per megawatt.</p>
          <p>And the second topic obviously is that we do see a sellers' market in terms of supply chain and material from the bill of material. So pricing remains a focused area. So far we have been able to compensate with productivity, but there would not, let me repeat, not be any incremental benefit from volume because pricing remains to be against Siemens.</p>
          <p>On Transmission, we've seen quite a &#x2013; we've been seeing quite a strong price pressure, predominantly in the Chinese environment, mostly stemming from the entrants in the market. That pressure has been easing on the levels which we have seen in the last couple of quarters, and we do expect to have seen the bottom on the pricing as far as order intake is concerned. So that obviously will take some time to make its way into the P&amp;L.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We now move on to our next question, which comes from Ben Uglow from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Joe and Mariel. Well, I guess, my first question was fairly similar to Andreas's, but in terms of the margins that you're seeing on the Fossil side, obviously the 19.3% reported is unusually high. Do you -- I mean, first of all, are there any one-offs or any particular special effects you want to outline there? And do you see this type of level, high teens, as being sustainable, or should we see this coming back down to what I think most people have in their models anyway? So that was issue number one.</p>
          <p>Issue number two. Joe, given the sort of lack of granularity now in Healthcare, could you just give a sense on the imaging and IT, a qualitative sense of what's going on there? We've seen numbers from GE and Philips, which I think the order growth has been a little bit muted. And I wanted know when &#x2013; what your experience or what you think the outlook is for top line in that business this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Ben. On Fossil, absolutely in agreement with you. The 19.3% is quite a high level of profitability. It has seen not really positive one-offs in a way, but it has seen some tailwind on currency. Also a bit on the change of the market &#x2013; of the mark-to-market valuation on hedges. So therefore a slight tailwind, but not material. The real material impact has been that the mix between service and hardware has been very favorable, so I would not expect that to continue for the rest of the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>So if you continue your models with a profitability, which we have basically also seen in 2010 levels, that would then certainly put that on the safe side. Well, actually, I mean on the underlying profitability, so I think a 17% plus would be something which is something the company would be comfortable in achieving.</p>
          <p>On Healthcare, I mean obviously this has been flat for quite some time, latest when I was in New York in early January. We do have our real sweet spots in Healthcare and that obviously <mark type="inaudible" /> in the Imaging environment. We still see very enjoyable margins there. There's no change in the strength of that segment.</p>
          <p>Diagnostics, I believe, has been disappointing for several reasons. We discussed those. The new management now knows what it is doing and, unfortunately, it will take time until we see a change to the better. But the programs which we have launched are well on time and in &#x2013; meet our expectations. So it will take time until we resume to grow.</p>
          <p>As far as Q1 is concerned on Diagnostics, we've seen a mix towards a more hardware-oriented revenue structure. That basically means more instruments, less consumables, which is -- naturally has its effects on the margin. By the same token, I also want to caution you here, there's not going to be a short term positive on the margins in Diagnostics. It will take time until we fix the efficiency, stability and world-class performance on the instrumentation side. There is some maintenance involved, so Diagnostics, totally new, but still something to look forward to.</p>
          <p>On the &#x2013; so the question is now what happens with the rest of it. I mean we made it repeatedly clear, we do have our challenges outside the Imaging field. The new management in the sector Healthcare has taken the right actions. Among other things, a new organizational approach to the market, which is intended and designed to take care of our challenges outside Imaging and the well-understood Diagnostics programs.</p>
          <p>So that's as much as one can say on Healthcare. Obviously, we did have our negative impact with another charge we had to take on particle therapy, which is in the neighborhood about &#x20AC;30 million. We also had a one-off in connection with our distributor in the United States. There has been a section 13D filing, which basically gives you all the need and the information, which is being needed to understand what is there, and what needs to be done there. And that's, I think, pretty much how we see the Healthcare sector. So still strong. We still are in most parts in the lead, but we do have our challenges and our work to do in the quarters to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very clear. Just one quick follow-up, Joe. Just be very specific &#x2013; on the imaging and IT portion, based on the order intake that you see at the moment, we should be seeing, I would expect mid-to-high single digit growth, revenue growth in that business this year. Is that a fair assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean if you bear with me a mid single digit environment, I would feel comfortable. Everything else would be a stretch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter Reilly of Deutsche Bank will have our next question. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Joe. Two questions, please. Firstly, you made reference to the mix in Industry Automation being very favorable. Is that a short-term issue, which is going to change? Or do you thing this is a sustainable mix given what you can see in the end market outlook?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on your capital structure target, you're now debt free. You obviously have your new 0.5 to 1 times net debt to EBITDA target. Is that something you're going to wait for the full year results to think about or is it something you might consider addressing sooner than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. On Industry Automation, I mean, definitely one has been the mix because there was very strong demand also in the high-end toolmakers environment, which usually carries a &#x2013; given the sophistication of the product and the software, carries a higher margin. And that &#x2013; there is no reason why this should not continue at least in the current fiscal quarter, which is Q2.</p>
          <p>The question to me is much more what will happen in the second half of 2011. Do we have a somewhat overbought supply chain in the channel already, or is it still continuing on strong end markets? I mean, obviously, Automotive sector and all the discrete part of process industry have been very strong, especially in China.</p>
          <p>By the same token, I mean, the customers in that sector really have not flagged the downturn, so why should they see it this time? So therefore, we are reasonably cautious about the long-term outlook on short cycle businesses. Our working assumption is that we will see some ease of growth in the second half of 2011, based on the assumption that there will be a fully loaded supply chain in the channel.</p>
          <p>And secondly, obviously, and this is what we promised at the downturn. We do want to see the incremental drop in revenues to the bottom line and this is what the company has been making good on, and this is what we put our focus on. And that's what we are delivering. So therefore, not a really big surprise, but I consider the margins we have at peak, peak levels. And I would not expect that to expand in a material way in the quarters to come.</p>
          <p>Now, on the capital structure, when Siemens was designed as an operating model for the company as an &#x2013; communication and information to investors, what to expect management to do in the company. And the capital structure of 0.5 to 1.0 industrial attractive net debt to EBITDA is the range.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and that's what we are committed to executing, but those &#x2013; that execution would not happen in the very near future. So if there was some sort of redistribution of any kind, this definitely would be at the end of the fiscal year. So please bear with me if this question now is considered to be a bit early, as you recognize obviously the situation on the capital structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We move on to our next question now, which comes from Simon Smith of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yeah, I had &#x2013; I had three quick questions. The first one was in terms of the Fossil orders, you obviously had a very impressive quarter, but I just wanted to check, the announcement that you made of the H-Frame contract in January. Was that included within this quarter?</p>
          <p>My second question was in terms of margins on the sort of non-fossil power areas. In general, you seem to come in with margins a little bit lighter, making sort of quite a step down in some areas such as transmission. And I just wondered, is there anything specific about the quarters or would this now be considered to be a sort of reasonable run rate of the orders that you have in the backlog for that area?</p>
          <p>And then my third question, which really goes back to what you've just explained, so sorry if it's just me being an idiot and not understanding it, but in terms of the industry business you've obviously had a fantastic quarter for sales, now really looking at sales higher than where they were in sort of previous peak quarters.</p>
          <p>And you are talking about slower growth going forward, but when you're saying that, are you actually suggesting that you would see any decline from these levels? Or is that just as we would expect, with tougher comps are sort of fading as the organic year-over-year annual growth rate? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Simon. On Fossil, the H-Frame announcements were not part of the numbers, so it's been a broad base order intake sectors on the other generations and technologies in Fossil.</p>
          <p>Now you talked about the margins on non-fossil. I mean, there have been a few impacts on some divisions, the flat renewable division. We knew that would &#x2013; based on the product mix, that would be somewhat light in Q1. We expect a similar appearance in Q2, but also expect the division to be back on levels, which we used to see in 2010, in the second half of 2011. So that pretty well understood in terms what happens there based on the distribution of the orders, which are coming into revenues.</p>
          <p>There is also, of course, a still material impact from the integration of the Solar business in renewables. That impact could be as much as a mid double-digit amount, which should be taken into consideration, should also be there in Q2, but then also ease for the rest of the year. We do believe order growth in revenues to be decent &#x2013; in Renewables to be decent.</p>
          <p>On Distribution, we've got some incremental costs on building up the smart grid applications, which is an intentional spend, which has been already mentioned in our Analyst Conference that we would want to invest into applications, some engineering R&amp;D and also some go-to-market areas, while growth continues, and at that time was considered to be accelerating which you now saw in Q1.</p>
          <p>Transmission, obviously has been coming as a outflow from our information and disclosure that pricing would be quite heavy in &#x2013; especially in China. As I said, that starts to be easing now in terms of order intake. But overall, in terms of TD and Renewables, the margins would actually at least be at the levels, which we have seen in Q1, going forward.</p>
          <p>Then on Industry, it is right, we believe that those margin levels which were in Q1 are peak levels, especially also assuming that the Q1 has been negatively affected by those employee bonuses, which had been scrunched down. That's always something to consider. And there should not be come as a surprise, because right now we still did not need to invest reasonable CapEx into the factory, because we still have been benefiting from a lower utilization, now nearing that the &#x2013; the max capacities utilization. Obviously, we need to spend some CapEx and some OpEx, so that we obviously also influence the margins coming forwards. So, yes, we do believe those margins to be peak levels, but there is also no reason to believe that they should be significantly down in the current fiscal quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Joe. Just two questions, please. The one back to Healthcare, in terms of the order intake, can you give us a sense just of the various geographic strengths of where you saw your strength and weakness in orders?</p>
          <p>And second, you mentioned that in Energy, you've seen pressure from input costs. And is there any further other areas where you're seeing significant input costs on pressures and what you are doing about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Martin, could you give me the second question, please, again, I didn't -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, on input cost in terms of, you mentioned in Energy that there was input cost pressure. Are there other areas where you're seeing input cost pressures and -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. Thanks. On Healthcare, the weakness we've seen is mostly related to Europe, which had been very strong during the difficult time in the last couple of years. Asia is still strong and it's got decent growth and we do expect that to continue.</p>
          <p>We've got very solid market position there with our locally designed engineered and manufactured product. So that is a stronghold also for the foreseeable future. The U.S. was okay, but Europe still remains the growth engine. On factor cost input, I mean obviously, matters have changed from a buyers' to a more sellers'-related market. We see that also in the discussions with our suppliers.</p>
          <p>And if you remember our assumptions on the guidance, which I have been leading the market through in November, you also might remember that there we said we'd have a decent gap in our CNI, which is the contribution to net income from purchasing.</p>
          <p>So that remains and that has actually been coming in a way, which we have been anticipating. The good thing is we do not see shortages, neither in components nor in other critical materials, which would prevent us from shipping the goods and services to the customer. But there will be a more adverse environment from the purchasing side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Two questions, please. First of all, just again back to power pricing. It appears that your U.S. based competitors seemed a lot more negative, talking about double-digit price declines in gas turbines and wind. Are you &#x2013; or just &#x2013; because of your product range, are you seeing a different development there?</p>
          <p>And the second one, just a second question, you talk about the run rate for corporate expenses for the rest of the year, and are there any other special items we should be aware of at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thanks, James. Power pricing, you said, we continue &#x2013; on Fossil, I said earlier that you know pricing is a matter which is in focus because of the customers' demand, higher efficiency in cost per megawatt, but we do not see any acceleration on pricing as compared to what we have, and have had in the last several quarters on order intake. But therefore, no real acceleration of any sort, at least not in the negative and that is also true for Transmission.</p>
          <p>On the Renewable -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of wind, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Renewables side, obviously there is a continued &#x2013; a continued and likely if at all &#x2013; if it at all changes, likely accelerating pressure on onshore due to capacity increases, also through new entrants into the market. The offshore area is still &#x2013; it's a decent environment, obviously given the fact that there are only a few who are able to deliver those orders. But therefore, also no change in guidance on Renewable, continued consolidation pressure on onshore and still a decent market environment on offshore. This is also where we are obviously focusing in getting the new orders coming in the quarters.</p>
          <p>On the run rate of corporate expenses, you may recall that we &#x2013; at the beginning of the year, we said it's going to be about a &#x20AC;300 million per quarter, which would make it at &#x20AC;1.2 billion for the year. Now with &#x20AC;1.2 billion, you can expect about a &#x20AC;500 million, &#x20AC;550 million to be allocated to the sectors. That basically means operational nature of the cost. So that would get us to a level of about &#x20AC;650, &#x20AC;700 million. Then you may recall that SIS is about &#x20AC;200 million to &#x20AC;300 million, what we expect for the full-year in terms of carve-out and associated costs with the transaction. So that basically would give us a run-rate between &#x20AC;150 million to &#x20AC;200 million on average for the corporate items. If you take &#x20AC;200 million, you'll be &#x2013; should be on the safe side.</p>
          <p>Now obviously, if and when SIS was to be dropped to the discontinued operation, which we likely expect to happen in Q2, then we would give you a new guidance on the items because SIS, obviously also plays a material role in those &#x20AC;150 million to &#x20AC;200 million per quarter. Other than that, you should be fine in using what we have flagged during the &#x2013; November 2010 conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We move on to Ga&#xEB;l De Bray de Bray of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale for our next question. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question is actually just a follow-up on what you just said about the corporate cost. Because I think within the corporate cost, you have some centrally carried pension expenses and there was a very big swing this quarter of around &#x20AC;90 million in a positive way. So, don't you expect these centrally carried pension expenses to remain positive during 2011? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second one is about the oil and gas division. We have seen very good order growth there now for many quarters with a book-to-bill above one times probably for the past six quarters in a row. But sales growth have remained really muted so far. Is there any reason for that? Any &#x2013; I don't know, any execution issues or something like this?</p>
          <p>And my final question is about the Drive Technologies business where obviously new orders have been particularly strong in Q1. I was just curious to know how much of this growth is actually related to the large orders you had in mobility at the same time. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks, Ga&#xEB;l. On corporate cost, as I said, if you take &#x20AC;150 million to &#x20AC;200 million, you'll be safe but that includes SIS, so therefore upside in Q2. On the pensions, been a decent swing in Q1. We would not expect the pension item on the P&amp;L to turn negative during 2011, okay? All the details and assumptions we use for the pension matters and also the relation between the expected return on pension asset versus what that does to the P&amp;L of a company, is been articulated in the annual report, so it's very detailed report and description on how that works technically.</p>
          <p>On the oil and gas, obviously, that's a &#x2013; first of all, you all need to know that in our oil and gas division about half of the business is industrial turbines. So that also follows the upward trend in the process industries and the industrial recovery.</p>
          <p>The second half is through oil and gas sector. We do have some large orders, which you know, go way into the future. So there is some time to work those orders into the &#x2013; through the P&amp;L. There are no real issues on execution or delivery. So therefore, matters are fine and we just execute the backlog as you know the customers want us to proceed <mark type="inaudible" />. So no particular aspects or negatives or anything else in the division.</p>
          <p>Now Drive Technologies, the Drive Technology division is in part, is a really short cycle business, if it comes to Motion Control. And that pretty much follows the Industrial Automation picture in terms of revenue and profit growth.</p>
          <p>The second part is the more longer-term oriented malaise-type environment and that contains the large price, as well as of course the orders for Mobility. So about half of the business is following the cycle like Industrial Automation, strong order intakes, strong book and bill business, with decent margins and the second half will see more longer-term oriented work on the backlog if it turns to revenues. Okay?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is time to take one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We take our last question from James Moore of Redburn Partners. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody, it's James at Redburn. I think many of my questions have been answered, but I wondered if you could just put a number on the degree of pricing pressure in orders versus sales for both Fossil and Transmission. So we could get a sense of what the quantum difference is.</p>
          <p>And also below the line, I noticed quite a good CIMP and equity investment performance. Could you just give us a little more color on whether that's one-off or whether we could see that continuing through the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, James. On the pricing, I mean it's &#x2013; it always depends on how it moves from the backlog into the P&amp;L, and when and what the mix conditions will be. So it's very hard to take a real meaningful number on it. But as an orientation, the price decline in the order book, order intake is still higher than what we see in the P&amp;L on revenues.</p>
          <p>Remember, I gave some orientation already for 2010, which was 7% on Energy, total sector Energy on bookings and about 2-ish%, 2.5% on billings. And while the billings' price decline now has been obviously picking up in Q1, in the P&amp;L, we have a similar order intake scenario as we had in 2010. So nothing really new in terms of adverse impact. But it hasn't very much eased in terms of positive recovery either. So we should expect the pricing environment on Fossil to be just about what we're seeing &#x2013; what we have seen, no acceleration. But also it still takes a lot of activity to cover the adverse impact for both the customer and the suppliers' environment.</p>
          <p>On &#x2013; below the line CMPA, that has been a nice finish of the Pick &amp; Place business. As you know, we put it below the line in &#x2013; during the crisis to make our industry divisions focus on what their core businesses were. We did some restructuring. We eventually and successfully executed the turnaround of the business, which you always need to do before you sell something, because otherwise nobody is buying it, at least not in a responsible way. And we have done that. So we've seen a nice finish on the matter and now it moves over to the new owner of the business. So consider that to be a one-off and no material impact for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I just follow up on the Transmission comment, how much have you gone through an environment like ABB, Alstom and others, where the raw material pricing has been favorable for insulation, oil, electric grain steel and that's now coming back at a time when the revenue pricing is deteriorating? So, what I am getting to is, can you see ahead of you in the next couple of quarters a precise quantum of what the margin squeeze will be as the revenue pricing deteriorates? Or is that difficult to see from here? And if you can see it, can you quantify it for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> those type of crossovers always happen when cycles change. They are still on a decline in pricing, yet the suppliers already feel the fresh air of what they consider to be spring. I mean, those topics are &#x2013; they ask what we basically do in order manage that is that whenever we get a larger order from our customers, we do a back-to-back agreement with the suppliers. So if that can be executed in a back-to-back way, which is highly probable, except the suppliers go bust or something else, then that should not pose a material impact in the short term, but obviously this is a matter which always needs to be considered. So no real red flag on this topic. But, of course, there could be crossovers like that where we see some inflation in material while there is still some decline on the top line. But I would not feel compelled to consider this as an issue which still needs to be managed by the division or the company.</p>
          <p>If you go into Q2, then on the Transmission side, there is still &#x2013; and I think we also have disclosed that in our earnings release that <mark type="inaudible" /> is working very hard on productivity. And those include that we rearrange our footprint in a way that demand is. I would not overly surprised if that could, you know, lead to some immaterial <mark type="inaudible" /> to the company, material charges in Transmission to make sure that we have the right footprint. So the focus is on productivity to cover all those adverse methods which we have already discussed.</p>
          <p>For the full year on Transmission, I would expect the division to be obviously below a very favorable 2010, but still in a decent range of profitability as we focus on productivity here, and that will get us through the adverse impact of pricing definitely in Asia, as well as some headwind on the purchase environment.</p>
