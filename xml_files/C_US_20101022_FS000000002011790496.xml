        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CFO, John Gerspach, will speak first. Then Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, will take you through the investor presentation, which is available on our website, Citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, included without limitations the Risk Factors section of our 2009 Form 10-K.</p>
          <p>With that said, let me turn it over to John.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to be hosting our fixed income investor review this quarter. Last quarter we discussed some of our key accomplishments, particularly our strong capital position, robust structural liquidity, and disciplined balance sheet management. Today we're going to update you on our continued progress in those areas. Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, is going to take you through some specifics on credit fundamentals, our capital position, and liquidity profile, as well some of our thoughts on Basel, and then discuss our current funding plans for the remainder of this year and the coming years as well.</p>
          <p>Many of you may have joined us on Monday's earnings call, and there are some key points from that call that I would like to reemphasize to start us off here on slide one. As you saw, we earned $2.2 billion this quarter. This is our third consecutive quarter of operating profitability, and we have earned $9.3 billion through the first nine months of the year. Achieving our third straight quarter of positive operating earnings is continued evidence that we are successfully executing our strategy, and we believe we have put in place a strong platform for sustained profitability. We remain completely focused on serving our clients to the best of our abilities as well as capturing the growth potential inherent in the core businesses within Citicorp.</p>
          <p>Regarding Basel, while we recognize that there is a lot more work to be done, including the calibration of risk models, Citi will meet every capital requirement as the implementation details and guidelines are finalized. We believe our customer-focused and service-oriented business model is well suited to Basel's capital standards. We also believe it is prudent to operate above the minimum capital standards. Given our businesses, our strategy, and our current understanding of Basel requirements, we believe the right level at which Citi should operate long term is at a Tier 1 common ratio of 8 to 9%. We currently expect to exceed these levels in 2012.</p>
          <p>As we have been saying, we believe that 2011 will be a year of rulemaking in the U.S. and model calibration across the industry. As a result, we anticipate that we should be in a position to return capital to our shareholders in 2012, subject of course to our regulators providing additional guidance to the industry.</p>
          <p>As far as the liquidity coverage ratio called for under Basel, with our current liquidity positions, we believe that we are already in compliance with the requirements that are scheduled to come into effect in 2015 as we currently understand them.</p>
          <p>Let me highlight some of our quarterly results for you, starting on slide two. Citigroup reported third quarter net income of $2.2 billion or $0.07 per diluted share. Net income from continuing operations was 2.6 billion or $0.08 per diluted share. Discontinued operations include the announced sale of Student Loan Corporation. Revenues of 20.7 billion were down 6% sequentially, driven primarily by lower revenues in Citi Holdings. Citicorp revenues were down 1% sequentially.</p>
          <p>Expenses of 11.5 billion were down 3% from last quarter, primarily due to the UK bonus tax of approximately $400 million in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of the UK bonus tax, expenses were up 1%, as continued investment spending in Citicorp was offset by expense reductions in Citi Holdings.</p>
          <p>Net credit losses of 7.7 billion improved for the fifth consecutive quarter. And we recorded a net loan loss reserve release of $2 billion, primarily in Citi Holdings.</p>
          <p>Consumer credit trends continued to improve. Consumer Banking improved from the previous quarter in the U.S. and also internationally, where deposits, loans, and accounts all grew.</p>
          <p>To give you some texture around our results on the institutional side, Investment and Corporate Banking improved as Citi executed transaction such as the Petrobras offering and the Tomkins LBO. In the third quarter, Citi won mandates for several key transactions which are scheduled to close for this quarter. While our fixed income trading was impacted by lower volumes, our equity trading rebounded strongly. And despite a low rate environment, our Global Transaction Services business continued its strong performance, as highlighted by its designation as paying agent and corporate trustee for BP's $20 billion compensation fund.</p>
          <p>We also continue to make consistent progress in reducing the size of Citi Holdings as quickly and economically practical. With the completion of the sale of our Student Loan business currently anticipated in the fourth quarter, we expect that the total assets in Citi Holdings will be less than 20% of our balance sheet by the end of this year versus almost 40% at the beginning of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our unique footprint in the emerging markets has us well aligned for the growth trends we see globally. And we continue to make investments in our franchise so we can serve our clients and our customers at the highest level all over the world. Our Citicorp businesses in Asia and Latin America combined to produce approximately $2 billion in net income during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>And now, let me turn it over to Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Let me turn to slide three. In 2010, Citi is a fundamentally different company than it was just two years ago. We are uniquely positioned in the banking industry to capitalize on our strong presence in emerging markets and our global capability to generate growth across a range of products. We have a focused strategy to grow our three core businesses, Regional Consumer Banking, Global Transaction Services, and Securities and Banking.</p>
          <p>Our strategy combined with an unparallel international footprint is yielding results. For example, in our international Consumer Banking business, as John said, we grew our loans, deposits, and accounts in every region during the third quarter. And we're also investing. Just one example can be seen in our Asia-Pacific franchise, where we are expanding our Consumer Banking business and significantly investing in technology such as interactive touch panels, video conferencing, and full service banking capability using a variety of electronic devices.</p>
          <p>In addition, we're also making progress in several other respects. We're seeing continued improvement in credit trends and are well reserved. We continue to make progress in reducing and derisking the balance sheet through asset dispositions, which provide us with ample liquidity to strategically invest in the future. And our capital base is strong, no matter which capital measures you use.</p>
          <p>Let me start out by taking you through our credit trends, which show continued improvement for the fifth consecutive quarter. Slide four shows total Citigroup net credit losses and loan loss reserves. Net credit losses continue to improve, down 4% sequentially to 7.7 billion. And we recorded a net LLR release of 2 billion, over three-fourths of which was attributable to Citi Holdings.</p>
          <p>Let me describe our credit trend into three broad buckets: corporate, international consumer, and North American consumer. First, at the top right, corporate credit costs were 347 million compared to a benefit of 211 million in the prior quarter. Corporate net credit losses nearly doubled to 922 million due to a loss on a specific corporate credit. Overall, however, we continued to see improved credit performance in every region. As a result, we recorded a net corporate LLR release of 575 million, reflecting both FAS 114 releases as well as the continued general improvements in corporate credit quality.</p>
          <p>At the bottom right of the page, you can see that the majority of our credit costs continue to be generated by our consumer businesses. Consumer NCLs declined 10% sequentially to 6.7 billion. And we released 1.4 billion in net loan loss reserves, mainly for retail partner cards and international Consumer Banking.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide five, you find the second major area, international consumer credit, where we are seeing sustained improvement in credit trends. NCLs declined in every region for the fourth consecutive quarter, albeit at a moderate pace as we continued to grow international loans. In Asia, Korea credit trends remained stable, and India continued to show the most significant improvements in NCLs and delinquencies.</p>
          <p>For the region, 90-day delinquencies were up slightly on a dollar basis but declined as a percentage of loans. In Latin America, Mexico remained the main driver of improving net credit losses. In EMEA, charge-offs and delinquencies improved across most markets. Additionally, in international local consumer lending, credit trends continued to improve for the fifth consecutive quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide six shows the third major area, North American consumer credit. This includes our cards portfolios at the top and our Citi Holdings mortgage businesses on the bottom. Both Citi branded cards in Citicorp and retail partner cards in Citi Holdings continued to show improvement in net credit losses and delinquencies this quarter. In Citi branded cards, NCLs declined for the second consecutive quarter. NCLs decreased by 8% to 1.9 billion, and 90-day delinquencies were down 15% to 1.8 billion. In retail partner cards, NCLs were down for the fifth consecutive quarter. NCLs decreased by 15% to 1.5 billion, and 90-day delinquencies declined by 13% to 1.7 billion. For both portfolios, early-stage delinquencies also showed improvement on a dollar basis.</p>
          <p>Within our Citi Holdings mortgage portfolios, NCLs and 90-day delinquencies in both first and second mortgages improved again this quarter. In fact, the sequential decline in first mortgage delinquencies was due primarily to asset sales and HAMP trial mods converting to permanent modifications, offset somewhat by the continued backlog in foreclosures in process. We continue to see encouraging results for HAMP modified loans, indicating that redefault rates for HAMP mods will likely be lower as compared to non-HAMP programs.</p>
          <p>Against these three major categories of loans: corporate, international consumer, and North American consumer, we wanted to share with you the size of our loan loss reserve on slide seven. Loan loss reserves were $43.7 billion at the end of the third quarter, or 6.7% of total loans. Consumer loan loss reserves were 37.6 billion, or 8.1% of loans. Corporate loan loss reserves were 6.1 billion or 3.2% of loans. Along the bottom of the page, you'll see that the coincident months of coverage of our consumer portfolio increased from 15.9 to 16.7 months, and is significantly above the 13.3 level from a year ago despite the reserve for leases.</p>
          <p>Now that I have covered credit trends and reserves, let me describe our progress in reducing the amount of our higher risk assets. Slide eight shows the asset trends in Citi Holdings. We ended the quarter with $421 billion of assets, a reduction of 284 billion or 40% from the third quarter of 2008, not including the sale of Student Loan Corporation, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter and will reduce assets by additional 31 billion.</p>
          <p>The $44 billion reduction in assets this quarter was comprised of: 32 billion of asset sales and business dispositions, including 15 billion of sales from the Special Asset Pool; approximately 9 billion of net runoff and paydowns; and 3 billion of net cost of credit and net asset marks. Citi Holdings now represents only 21% of our total assets. The Special Asset Pool is now below 100 billion of assets and Local Consumer Lending is under 300 billion.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide nine, we provide an additional breakdown of the end-of-period assets in the Special Asset Pool over the last five quarters. As you can see, overall, these assets continue to decrease at a good pace, down 42% or approximately 68 billion from the end of the third quarter of last year and down 15% or approximately 17 billion from the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>As you scan the information here, I want to highlight a couple features of this asset base. First, we have made significant progress with respect to reducing our exposure in higher risk areas such as subprime securities, which represent only 200 million in assets at the end of the quarter, and monolines, which are down to 500 million. This is extremely small relative to past levels. Second, many of these positions have been significantly marked down, as you can see on the right side of the page, looking at their face value as compared to the current carrying value.</p>
          <p>Now that I have covered our credit trends and the smaller size of our Holdings balance sheet, let me turn to slide 10 and talk about capital, which continues to be an area of significant strength for us. This slide reflects our strong capital levels at the end of the third quarter, with 129 billion in tangible common equity and 104 billion in Tier 1 common. Relative to the second quarter, our Tier 1 common capital is up, primarily driven by net income and the conversion of ADIA [Abu Dhabi Investment Authority] debt to common stock. Compared to the pre-crisis era of 2006, our capital measures are up between $25 billion and $50 billion. Our capital base is one of the strongest in the industry.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 11, at the end of the third quarter our Tier 1 and Tier 1 common ratios were 12.5% and 10.3% respectively, up from year end and also from the second quarter. With these strong capital ratios, we believe we are currently well positioned to weather any economic uncertainties, while at the same time have the flexibility and the appetite to take advantage of growth opportunities around the world.</p>
          <p>While credit markets have clearly reflected our progress as measured in bond and CDS prices, we believe that rating agencies have started to recognize our progress as well. You will recall that since late in the fourth quarter of 2008 and early in the first quarter of 2009, our ratings at the Citigroup level have been unchanged at A3 with Moody's, A for S&amp;P, and A+ for Fitch. During the first quarter of 2010, S&amp;P upgraded our standalone credit profile by a notch. At the same time, they also reviewed the outlook &#x2013; revised the outlook on Citi's supported ratings from stable to negative, in line with peers. As we have previously disclosed in our 10-Q, we believe that Fitch is currently reviewing this issue, and we anticipate Fitch taking similar actions very shortly.</p>
          <p>And last quarter, Moody's changed the rating outlook on our standalone bank financial strength rating from negative to stable, based on our strength in capital position and improved risk profile. At almost the same time, Moody's conformed our supported ratings outlook from stable to negative based on their ongoing review of support assumptions for the entire financial services industry.</p>
          <p>We are obviously in ongoing discussions with the rating agencies and provide them with continuous information about our progress over the past year across many dimensions, including lower credit losses, higher reserves, smaller Holdings balance sheet, and more capital.</p>
          <p>Let me now touch on some of the Basel III capital requirements that John mentioned at the beginning of this call here on slide 12. While we recognize that there is a lot more work to be done, we believe that Citi will meet every capital requirement as the implementation details and guidelines are finalized. We believe our customer focus and service oriented business model is well suited to Basel's capital standards. Given our businesses, our strategy, and our current understanding of Basel requirements, we believe the right level at which Citi should operate long term is a Tier 1 common ratio of 8% to 9%. We currently expect to exceed these levels in 2012. As a result, we anticipate that we should be in a position to return capital to our shareholders in 2012. This is, of course, subject to our regulators providing additional guidance for the industry.</p>
          <p>Many of you have asked about risk-weighted assets in relation to Basel. We all know that risk-weighted asset calculations will become more risk sensitive. This will require greater use of models, which will need to be validated and calibrated across institutions, in theory on a global basis. Citicorp's risk-weighted assets will increase net of mitigations such as the optimization of trading inventories and hedging of counterparty risk by approximately 30% to 35%. Holdings assets are expected to have a bigger percentage increase, but of course these assets will continue to decrease as we execute our strategy to divest and liquidate them. We continue to maintain very strong capital. And based on what we know today, we expect to be well above the Basel III requirement without issuing additional equity.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 13, beyond the absolute amounts of capital, the components of capital will be important in the future as well. As we just discussed, Citi's current Tier 1 common, Tier 1, and total capital levels are strong. You can see in the bar chart on the middle of the page how this breaks out by capital instrument, with qualifying Tier 1 common of 103.7 billion, preferred stock of 0.3 billion, and trust preferred securities of 20.3 billion.</p>
          <p>As you may have heard, earlier this week Citi's Board of Directors reinstated the dividend on the remaining outstanding preferred stock. As you know, Dodd-Frank generally eliminates trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital with a three-year phase-out period commencing in January of 2013. Basel III eliminates trust preferred starting in January in 2013, with a 10-year phase out. So we will carefully balance U.S. regulatory interpretation, Dodd-Frank, and the Basel requirements when reviewing our outstanding trust preferred and enhanced trust preferred securities.</p>
          <p>As you may be aware there are regulatory call options on virtually all these securities, and legal counsel has been providing guidance as to when these call options can be triggered; for example, when the bill was signed into law, when rulemaking occurs in 2012, and perhaps when the rules are implemented at a later time.</p>
          <p>In addition to the regulatory call features, our trust preferred portfolio is redeemable via contractual or regulatory call options prior to the implementation of both Dodd-Frank and Basel III. Also of note, more than 11% of our trust preferred securities are grandfathered under Dodd-Frank. We will consider various factors when evaluating each of our trust preferred and enhanced trust preferred securities, including financial terms such as coupon, currency, rates, and optional and regulatory fall options and the timing of such options. We will keep you posted.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 14, let's take a closer look at our liquidity levels, as we've reduced and reshaped our balance sheet and strengthened our structural liquidity as measured by one of the traditional metrics that you see on the left side. Together, equity, long-term debt, and deposits form the heart of a bank's liquidity. This combination of structural funding has risen from 62% to 71% as a percentage of total assets during the nearly three-year timeframe that you see here. In fact, we have consistently been in the 70% range since the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side of the page, you see our aggregate liquidity resources defined as cash and unencumbered liquid securities, which were approximately $330 billion at the end of the third quarter. We have maintained these resources at this level over the past year, and currently believe they are proportionately calibrated to the size of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In addition to successfully building these high levels of liquidity, let me take a minute to talk about the fungibility of our liquidity at Citi. In general, Citigroup can freely cross-fund legal entities within our bank vehicles, and Citigroup non-bank vehicles can fund their bank vehicles. In addition, under section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, our bank can fund our non-bank entities with as much as 30 billion as long as it is collateralized appropriately.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 15, with these levels of liquidity, we are well prepared for the Basel III liquidity standards as defined by the liquidity coverage ratio proposal. As many of you know, the liquidity coverage ratio is a 30-day stress test which compares the cash and liquid securities buffer on the balance sheet with potential outflows that might occur in a 30-day period as severe disruption. As you may expect, we at Citi run a wide range of liquidity stress tests to ensure that we have ample liquidity, including one that is not dissimilar from what the Basel III committee has recommended. Given our current liquidity position that I just described, we believe that we are already in compliance with the Basel liquidity coverage ratio requirements that are scheduled to come into effect in 2015 as we currently understand them.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 16, in addition to executing on our overall business strategy, part of the way we strengthened our structural liquidity is by implementing a sound funding strategy. Our current funding strategy is designed to provide ample high quality liquidity to ensure we are well positioned to grow our core businesses and navigate various market conditions. In both the bank and non-bank, short-term liquidity takes the form of cash and highly liquid securities such as treasuries and agencies and other G7 instruments.</p>
          <p>We execute on this funding plan in both our bank and non-bank businesses by leveraging a spectrum of appropriate funding sources. In our bank businesses, our funding is primarily in the form of stable, globally diversified deposits, which I will delve into in more detail in a moment, and is supplemented with some asset-backed securitizations as well as underlying equity. In our non-bank businesses, we use a modest amount of short-term funding such as commercial paper and repo to finance liquid assets. We then use a broad range of long-term debt instruments to cover our broader business needs; these long-term debt instruments, including fixed and floating term debt both senior and subordinated, and as well as our underlying equity.</p>
          <p>As I just mentioned, stable, globally diversified deposits are our primary source of funding in the bank. Looking at slide 17, firm-wide deposits were up approximately 4% or $36 billion compared with the second quarter to 850 billion at the end of the third quarter. In keeping with our client focused model, we saw deposit growth across almost all of our deposit taking businesses, including Retail, Private Bank, and Global Transaction Services. Particularly this quarter, in Global Transaction Services we continued to see inflows based on the strength of our product and service offerings as well as due to the highly liquid position many corporate clients find themselves in. We have a high quality, diversified, and stable deposit base across our businesses and across the globe, as you can see.</p>
          <p>As I have said before, deposits are one of our lowest cost sources of funds. Moving over to slide 18, you can see that while deposits have grown, the overall cost of funds on deposits has decreased by 15 basis points year over year and even more from prior periods. This reflects both the low rate environment and our ability to lower price points and widen our spreads and margins while still remaining competitive.</p>
          <p>Part of the way that we have managed to lower cost of funds is to have a healthy amount of balances in non-interest deposits, which you can see has ranged from 106 billion to 118 billion over the last year. Even more importantly, within our interest bearing deposits, we continually seek out pockets of balances that provide us with lower cost funding.</p>
          <p>Turning to the bottom of the page, international balances increased by 35 billion quarter over quarter, with 21 billion due to changes in FX and 14 billion due to volume increases. Since there is a significant portion of foreign currency denominated deposits in the base, which sometimes come from higher interest rate markets, the overall cost of funds may increase as our mix may shift. We saw a bit of that this quarter. Remember, though, these foreign deposits are typically invested in higher yielding foreign assets.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 19, at the end of the third quarter we had structural funding in the form of 387 billion in long-term debt. Approximately 70% of that debt is used to fund our non-bank businesses such as our broker-dealer, with the remaining 30% funding the bank. In fact, the 30% of long-term debt that is found in the bank is primarily related to asset-backed securitizations, largely credit card securitizations, which you can see here in green at the top right bar on the right. Securitizations are a supplemental form of funding for the bank.</p>
          <p>In our non-bank entities, you can see on the bar on the right in dark blue, the vast majority of our long-term debt is comprised of senior term debt which is both fixed and floating, along with senior and subordinated instruments, as well as trust preferred.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 20, as you can see, our expected maturities of long-term debt over the next three years; this chart clearly shows that maturities peak in 2012 and come down in 2013. As we see in light blue atop each column, TLGP debt represents a significant amount of maturities in 2011 and 2012.</p>
          <p>Many industry observers have noted that this wave of maturities is an industry-wide situation which came about as many banks issued TLGP and other government guaranteed debt in 2008 and 2009. For us at Citi, however, we do not expect to replace TLGP maturities. The reason is very clear. As we've discussed before, as we continue to reduce and derisk our Citi Holdings balance sheet in both our bank and non-bank entities, our need for long-term debt is coming down. Year to date, we have issued approximately $15.7 billion of long-term debt. We have issued across multiple tenors and currencies, and expect that we have approximately 4.5 billion left to issue in the fourth quarter. Our forecasts remain unchanged. In the coming few years, we currently expect our issuance levels will stay consistent at approximately 20 billion of long-term debt at the Citigroup level.</p>
          <p>Moving to our last slide, let me summarize four major points. First, we see growth in our core businesses, particularly internationally, as well as continued credit improvement. Corporate credit is improving. International consumer credit trends continue to improve, and North America consumer credit trends are improving.</p>
          <p>Second, our capital base is one of the strongest in the industry, and this is reflected across every one of our significant capital ratios. The strength of our capital base means that we currently expect to be in compliance with the Basel III capital requirement without needing to issue any additional equity.</p>
          <p>Third, we have significantly improved our structural liquidity by increasing our capital base and deposits, reducing assets, and extending liability duration. We believe we have ample liquidity and currently expect to be in compliance with Basel III liquidity requirements as we understand them.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we will have a significantly lower proportion of wholesale funding going forward. We currently expect modest reissuance needs and do not expect to replace TLGP debt that is coming due.</p>
          <p>That concludes our fixed income review. John and I would be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Okay, great. Thanks. Can we go to the mortgage reps and warranties issue because you knew you were going to get a lot of questions on that? And can we talk a little bit, take a step back and talk about reserving methodology, how you at Citi are looking at that? What is the methodology for reserving for reps and warranties? How far do you look out? Do you look at the pace of incoming, the composition of incoming? And do your reserves include litigation reserves? And then I wanted to ask a bit about the role of Citi as a securitizer as opposed to an originator.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We started with the call on Monday, and I don't know if you tuned in for that, but obviously, there are three broad issues I think facing the industry right now: the validity of securitization process, the whole foreclosure documentation, and then the reps and warranties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, so let's just focus then. You want to focus on the reps and warranty issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. We actually in the appendix to this package, we included two slides that we used during Monday's call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right; right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, so our methodology for reserving, the reserves that we currently have pending or currently have on the balance sheet, which is shown &#x2013; I think it's on slide 24.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, the 952.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 952 is intended to be a lifetime reserve for all either current or future anticipated claims that we would have against potential put-backs. So we based that reserve based upon several key indicators. We track both package requests, requests for information that we get.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How many of those then translate into actual claims; of the claims that we get in house, how many have we rescinded, how many do we expect to rescind in the future, of those that we actually pay, what's our severity of loss; and then finally, of the claims that we actually pay, how much can we actually put back to a third party and anticipate recovery from them. So it's a methodology that takes into account at least five different drivers. And it's a methodology obviously that we continue to refine our estimates as we get new information and we see trends developing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us your working assumption on the percentages for each one of those levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to go through each and every level. But obviously from a rescission point of view, I think what we noted in the call is that of the claims that we actually settle, it represents about 50% of resolved claims.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, that seems to be consistent across the industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's based upon what others have said. I would say you're correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and the 952 also includes any kind of litigation reserve as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't specify any litigation reserves. Obviously, if we set aside any significant litigation reserves, we would comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is basically put-backs. And now you also asked, I didn't forget, you also asked about our role as a securitizer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so what we said on Monday was that both of our businesses, we basically run mortgage securitization through two businesses. Call it our Consumer Mortgage business as well as our Securities and Banking business. During the period of 2005 to 2008, our Consumer Mortgage business issued about $25 billion of securitizations. And they roughly split out, about 50% of them would have been prime mortgages and 50% would have been Alt-A. On our Securities and Banking business, private label securitizations during that '05 to '08 period totaled about 70 billion, seven-zero. And the rough breakdown of those issuance would be about 25% prime, about 20% Alt-A, and then the balance in subprime.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now let's just look at the securities side of this and the 70 billion. I'm assuming that you took collateral from third parties and securitized that. How did you treat the reps and warranties in that? Did you backstop any other parties' reps and warranties? Did you just pass them through? How does that work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually a mix of both models, Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, because I think that that's part of the next wave of concern that people will have about the business and put-backs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think you're right. We're actually &#x2013; what we anticipate is giving you a bit more disclosure on all of this when we file our 10-Q.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, terrific. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Rob.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of David Knutson with Legal &amp; General.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. On your disposition of the Student Loan Corporation, you took a loss, as I recall, from where you had it on the books, and then you also provided I think significant financing. And so I guess my first question is as you look to run down the Holdings book in the future, should we expect additional financing will be required to make sales and are assets going to be below &#x2013; executed below the book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, this is John. I think what you've seen to-date in our dispositions of Holding assets is a mix of models. And we've had straight sales. We've had sales where we had to restructure businesses such as the IPO that we did on Primerica. Now you've seen this rather complicated three-party structure with Student Loan. So we are trying to be flexible and creative in our approach to each of the dispositions.</p>
          <p>You've also seen dispositions where we've had gains, dispositions where we've taken losses, and dispositions where quite frankly it has been almost a non-event from a P&amp;L point of view. So I don't think that you can look at that Student Loan deal and call it a trend going forward. Each deal will take its own structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then a couple other quick questions, on the question that I think Rob mentioned, the Fitch &#x2013; it's stable now. Are you saying that your review is &#x2013; you expect it to move to positive, or is it more of an industry comment that the industry is probably going to be positive? I want to make sure that I'm clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I alluded to it broadly. I think at this point, you probably just need to contact them. It's probably most appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the targets for the Holdings shrinkage, what percent do you think will stay with the firm ultimately and move back to Corp? If it's 20% at the year end, do you expect there will be a point in time when it will flow back into Corp, or is that just not on the table?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Never say never; that's something that I think always serves people well. But when we split the company into Corp and Holdings, it wasn't to set up a good bank/bad bank structure. It was actually the result of a strategic review, and we decided that the businesses that we wanted to run going forward, because they fit the customer-focused strategy that we have, are those businesses in Citicorp, and the businesses in Citi Holdings just didn't fit the strategy. So it's not so much about getting Citi Holdings down to a particular number and then blending it back into Citicorp. It would really mean that we have reexamined one of the portfolios or several of the portfolios or one of the businesses that is now within Citi Holdings and decided that it now fits in with the Citicorp strategy. So it's not really so much about getting down to a number. Ultimately, we would expect Holdings to get down to zero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then the last question is more just on a strategic. This call is taking place four days after the equity call, and a lot of the slides are similar. And I'm wondering why &#x2013; there is probably maybe a reason to have the call a bit closer to the equity call so we get an answer or we get an opportunity to address management along with the equity analysts. I think fixed income is a pretty important part of your capital structure and your future, and I'm just curious on why the delay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have a great answer for that. We schedule it when we can. And unfortunately, we think that it's better to actually separate the two calls because they are two different constituencies, and I think fixed income investors might have a slightly different tack that they want to go through than the equity investors. We'll try to schedule them as close as we possibly can in the future, but I can't promise you that one will immediately follow the other.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Mark Kehoe with Goldman Sachs Asset Management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thank you for the call. The first question I have was in terms of your comments with the ratings agencies. It sounds like you're concern over the short-term ratings pressure that we had in the earlier part of the year has now receded. Is that your thoughts and how do you reconcile that with the elevated liquidity levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, it's Eric Aboaf. Our perspective is that the markets are still somewhat uncertain. There are a variety of factors out there that could be positive from an economic development standpoint and others that could be more uncertain or negative. And so in our mind, it's behooves us to maintain an ample amount of liquidity. And as I showed earlier in the materials, we've been keeping what we would describe as an ample amount reasonably consistently here over the last few quarters.</p>
          <p>With regard to the rating agencies, clearly they are reevaluating some of their government support assumptions, which we understand. They had originally said that they would do that this year. I think now they're doing that at, at a more measured pace. Some of them have said six to nine months. Some of them have said 12 to 24 months. And so in a way, the underlying question is whether and how much of that support notching they're going to continue with; and with regard to that, how our underlying profile &#x2013; often others in the industry improve during that timeframe. And clearly, as I've shared, you see some real significant improvements, whether it's in credit losses, it's reductions of high risk assets, it's capital levels, it's reserve levels, and we certainly expect all that to be taken into account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then how do you reconcile with the FDIC proposals the commentary in terms of the resolution bank and the treatment of short-term debt holders better than longer-term debt holders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. I think we're going to see a number of proposals. We saw one from the FDIC. We obviously expect others from the FDIC and other agencies. Clearly they are asking for comment on those from industry participants and industry associations. I think they are early in their rulemaking. In fact, these are just early pieces. These aren't rules yet. And they are I think looking for commentary and thinking on how they should treat different liability holders, right, should long-term debt holders be treated a little differently than short-term debt holders? And I think we'll learn more over the coming months and quarters and maybe years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just lastly, you said the TruPS may be callable in 2012 and during the rulemaking process. Could you elaborate on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We're clearly working with our internal and external counsel on this question. TruPS have regulatory call provisions in most cases, and the legal information that we're developing is when is that regulatory call invocable. And so the early information from a variety of legal counsel, some of which you have probably read about, is clearly at signing the bill; likely to be also at the implementation of the rules, when the rules get promulgated; and then lastly, potentially at the implementation of those rules, so after they get written, but when they actually apply to institutions on implementation date. And as we learn more about that and confirm the guidance we're getting, then we'll clearly keep you all abreast and share with you some of our evolving plans.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just to follow up on that, I just wanted to understand. Are you viewing these securities as senior debt once the regulatory benefit fades?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, it's Eric. Some of those could be considered senior debt. In effect, they are debt instruments. And if they no longer count as Tier 1 capital, they could then work down to count as sub-debt potentially in the capital structure or to senior debt, so those are certainly options for us. Clearly, though, they have certain coupons and rates and currencies associated with them. And as you can expect, we'll do some optimization with regard to those coupons, rates, currencies, and think through what would be an optimization for us as a company on an economic basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is it your interpretation that true preferreds will be qualifying eligible capital under Basel III?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not exactly sure what you mean by true preferreds. But our...</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Non-cumulative, perpetual preferreds?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point, I think the indication is that preferreds will count as Tier 1 capital, but obviously we've got to see the rules as they're written and as they're finalized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I just was wondering what your impressions were so far, all right. Just on the funding piece...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you update how much repo and short-term debt you have outstanding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the repo is on our &#x2013; and the short-term debt outstanding is on our balance sheet disclosure and our supplemental disclosure that we released on Monday. So I think you can &#x2013; I think it's page three of that 40-plus page Excel or PDF that you can find on the website.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you talk a little bit about how the composition or tenor of the collateral for the repo has evolved since the liquidity crisis back in '07 &#x2013; '08, how you think about that repo and the composition of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We clearly carefully calibrate the repo and what is really also the matched book because on the other side of that repo book we have reverses. And in fact, you actually have to look at it as two sides of the trade in which we make markets, and then we use a subset of that repo to fund our trading inventory. If you think about that matched book and the repo book, clearly there are ways to carefully calibrate it to make it a robust funding source. And so clearly, as you think about reverses, you want to have a certain term structure of your reverses. But typically you want to have a repo term structure that is longer dated with the reverses, so that under stress you have an ability to unwind reverses as repo markets ebb and flow.</p>
          <p>I think in addition, we are all very careful of the type of repo counterparties that we all work with. Obviously, some are more sensitive to ratings than others. There has been a lot of discussion about 2a-7 funds, for example, and some of their rating sensitivity. And as you can imagine, we actually calibrate the type and segment of the different counterparties that we work with and have thoughtful limits that apply. And then finally, we obviously have concentration parameters to calibrate the individual repo counterparties.</p>
          <p>So it's really &#x2013; I would describe it as a matched book concept to start in addition to some additional inventory financing. And it's one that carefully calibrated can be used as a good market making activity as well as a good funding activity. I think pre-crisis, I can't speak to exactly how things were done, but I can imagine that there were some firms or others who may not have been as careful in those calibrations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just two more quickly. On the reps and warranties, what really happens when a claim is put back to you and you decide you don't agree with the claim and you send it back to them? Is that just how it ends? Do you just have the final decision and you just say no, this one was fine; or yes, this one we'll take back; or do they then have &#x2013; what's that next step?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And it's just literally just back and forth between the two of you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sometimes it's back and forth. Sometimes it's back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. And then very lastly on the liquidity coverage ratio, I was surprised that you are expecting to already be in compliance with that because we heard from JPMorgan that their estimate of the ratio is 53% as it stands today. And so I'm trying to understand, big picture, what qualitatively might be the difference in the business model between Citi and some other peers who have a material way to go in order to comply with that ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, It's Eric. We really I don't think are in a position to understand or comments on others. What we can tell you is we went through the QIS, the quantitative impact study, with our supervisors. We reviewed the results with them. We went through that process in a very careful way, and are confident in our preliminary conclusions given what we know about how the rules have been written at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Tom Christolini with Fidelity Investments .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A question on CoCos and what are your thoughts there, and how much is the Fed and others, how much are they encouraging you guys on that? Potentially like the Swiss, could that be part of the systemically important capital charge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Eric. Clearly there has been a lot of discussion on different capital structures &#x2013; different capital instruments for different parts of the capital structure, and I think it's still early on, to be honest. Clearly supervisors around the world are thinking through what those can be and what amounts. We've seen a few, just a few specific versions of contingent capital instruments. And clearly industry participants are trying to figure out, we included, whether they make sense, could be developed, could be developed in bulk. And I think we're going to see and learn more as an industry over the coming years.</p>
          <p>I think part of the question obviously will be the kind of demand that we see from investors, and whether you'll all be interested in those instruments, at what price, with what optionality, with what parameters. And so I expect it will be a dialogue and an exploration that will take some time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then one, just to understand, a clarification. The 11% trust preferreds that are grandfathered in, I'm assuming that's the government, what was the government TruPS. What is the grandfathering under Dodd-Frank for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, it's Eric. It's under one of the laws at the time, I think it is the EESA Emergency Act that a subset of TruPS that were issued by certain agencies under certain &#x2013; or two certain agencies in certain configurations were grandfathered. I think if you're interested in more of the specifics, I think just give Ilene Fiszel Bieler a call later today and we can get you the specifics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The bottom line is those would not phase out between '13 and '15 in the way the rest under the Collins amendment would?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Samuel Crawford with Stone Harbor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Rob did a great job of opening up the mortgage area, but let me ask a couple of follow-up questions, if I may please. First one would be just to get rid of this particular piece of it, I don't believe I've ever seen you all estimate the 2005 to 2008 originations that were sold away servicing released, and so are just out there in the market that you all do not see direct either as a servicer or as a securitizer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. I didn't get the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any portion of your originations from 2005 to 2008 that have been sold away servicing released?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay, I'm sorry. The numbers that I quoted for our Securities and Banking business, the $70 billion of issuance, they were largely done service released, servicing released.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in the careful laying out of variables that you're using in your reserving process, I'm probably not alone in getting the feeling that the GSE process is going to be very different in frequency and severity from private label. I'm wondering if you all are finding it useful to make a separation in your estimations of reserves needed by the process in which it will come, whether it's GSE versus private label, and does that have important implications for frequency and severity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The vast majority of the experience that we've had to date has certainly been on the GSE side. I think you can see that in some of the slides that we've included in the appendix. And if you take a look, for instance, we break out on our consumer mortgage business the number of claims and settlements that we've actually had over the course of the last almost three years now. And you can see that &#x2013; I'm not quite sure what the right word is, vast majority, lion's share, almost all the claims as well as the repurchases have been with GSEs versus private investors. So we are still building up the experience that we have with private investors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given the &#x2013; I'd have to call this the higher degree of optionality that's associated with the private label process just because it's so much more litigated and then subject to reversal in the legal process, do you think that if people get over the 25% threshold per tranche or otherwise organize themselves collectively that you've got more of a severity issue in the private label per se?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I'm trying to understand; more severity in the private label?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Severity of ultimate loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think again, you need to take a look at the loans themselves, prime versus subprime versus Alt-A. And I don't know of any reason why a loan of a particular type included in a whole loan sale to a GSE would be any different than that same type included in a bundled sale for securitization. But again, it's early days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Shifting slightly, I believe this is something that you all may not have put out before, but I'm wondering if you are ready to do so at this point, at least I have not recalled it. Can you say what portion of your seconds at this point, seconds in home equity where you control the firsts, and therefore able to take a more comprehensive view on possible modification loss?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have not commented on that and I'm not prepared to comment on that right now either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a last thing if I may, the valuation of the MSR, I imagine you all use outside consultants as well as internal models like many others. Is the possible shift in cost of capital required to hold an MSR in the future a relevant consideration now or in the near term future about its valuation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that probably the better answer to that is should &#x2013; and again, this is still Basel III rules are in, they've been issued, we still don't have actual rules issued of course by the U.S. regulators. But if in final implementation mortgage servicing rights do end up being 100% deductible from your capital structure, I think the industry will look for other ways of structuring mortgage deals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and if you'll permit me one last question, please. This also is in the state of a proposal, the FASB proposal which would influence reserving policy towards a life-of-loan approach rather than a one-year look forward, as has been the case to date. And I'm just wondering if you have any comment that you might be able to make, even at this early and provisional stage, about what kind of differences in estimated intensity of loss would be involved in looking at things life of loan rather than one year forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to correct one thing. We are not currently on a one-year look-forward methodology.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's something that I've heard oftentimes from other people, even if not explicitly from you all. I am oversimplifying, but it tends to be a calendar year as the range of estimation. If that's an incorrect impression of mine, I'd love to hear more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We estimate our loans based upon the losses that are inherent in our portfolio, whether those losses are recognized in the next year or the next 15 months or the next two years, so it's not a one-year look-forward. That certainly isn't our interpretation of current GAAP.</p>
          <p>But to your question as far as what the FASB may do in the future, there are two models out there right now being proposed for expected losses. FASB has one and the IASB has another. So under FASB's proposal right now, it would be an immediate recognition of all expected losses on a loan. IASB, their proposal has you take a look at expected losses, but then you would recognize them over several years. It would be very helpful to the industry if IASB and FASB did in fact converge their two views, and we are somewhat hopeful that that will happen before there is a final standard issued by either body.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your final question comes from the line of Regan Buckley with Liberty Mutual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. There is a lot of discussion in Europe, in particular about imposing losses on senior bank bondholders. There is not a lot of senior bank paper for U.S. banks and Citigroup. Is that because there are other deposit funding and other cheaper sources of funding that there is not a lot of senior bank debt out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Eric. I think on one of the slides, we actually described how the debt funding maps against the various vehicles that we have. So you saw I think back on page 19, $387 billion of long-term debt. Two-thirds of that is against the parent broker-dealer sometimes in terms of non-bank entities, and then there is the balance, about a third is with the bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So the mix of that, so a big portion of that is securitized, it looks like, and some structured note. Is that how you decide the mix of that, is that just economic? Or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, to be clear, on the bank we obviously have deposit funding as the primary source. It's the lowest cost funding source if you look at some of the average balance and interest rate cost of funding schedules that we have in the detailed supplementary disclosures that we put out on Monday. And as a result, first and foremost we want to fund the bank with deposits, obviously in the right currencies and the right mix.</p>
          <p>We supplement some of that with securitizations on the bank side, card securitizations, and obviously we do that in a supplementary form, but that's not the bulk of our funding. The bulk comes from deposits. And together that actually puts the bank in the right funding profile, and so the bank itself needs a little unsecured long-term debt in effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I just had one further question. It's similar, but for the 20 billion annual issuance going forward the next couple years, people have talked about convertible term securities or even like covered bonds securities. The mix of that 20 billion, obviously there are a lot of factors that go into it. But will it look similar to what you have now or are you considering different types of securities in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Eric again. Right now, we expect to be similar to the kind of debt we issue now. The large majority of that is benchmark issuances that we do dollars, euros, and around the world in Asia or in Latin America or in other countries. We do, do a modest amount of structured debt through our CFI entity, which also provides some very healthy funding. And I think for now, we expect that that funding mix to be similar to what we've seen over the last couple years. Obviously as either new instruments develop or different funding opportunities develop in different parts of the world, we're obviously conscious of borrowing cost and demand, and we'll adjust accordingly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so right now, there's no instrument you're looking at in particular?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
