          <p>Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompany this call and are available on our website.</p>
          <p>Let's begin by taking a look at page four and reviewing a few financial highlights. The first quarter reflects a strong rebound following a slow fourth quarter, net income was $599 million and EBITDA was $1.24 billion. The recovery was led by improved margins in the O&amp;P Americas and Refining &amp; Oxyfuel segments but all segments recorded gains. Earnings per share increased to $1.</p>
          <p>Karyn and I will discuss the quarter in detail but I thought I would quickly summarize a few highlights and trends for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In North America, we benefited from increased ethylene margins. The European polyolefins volumes returned to third quarter levels following the fourth quarter slowdown.</p>
          <p>Intermediates &amp; Derivatives results returned to a more typical level following the completion of fourth quarter maintenance. Refining spreads improved as the quarter progressed, while Oxyfuel margins were unseasonably strong throughout the quarter.</p>
          <p>As a result of our 2011 performance, we were honored by Hart's Energy as Refining &amp; Energy Company of the Year.</p>
          <p>Operations at the Berre refinery were suspended on January 4 and we refinanced majority of the remaining balance on our 2017 and 2018 bonds at an average interest rate of 5.25%.</p>
          <p>Overall, it was a good quarter. Our personal safety performance was no exception. On slide number five, we've updated our safety data. I'm proud to say that we have started the year well. There were some minor injuries primarily related to Channelview turnaround work, but our first quarter statistics improved versus 2011, a tribute to both our employees and contractors. Our safety record is very near best in class.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn the call over to Karyn to discuss some key elements of our financial performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim. Please turn to slide number six, which charts our first quarter and last 12 months' segment EBITDA.</p>
          <p>The $1.24 billion of EBITDA reflects a strong beginning a strong beginning to 2012, particularly when one considers that the first quarter is typically a seasonally slow period. From a segment perspective, O&amp;P-Americas continues to be our strongest segment, generating approximately $600 million of EBITDA. The majority of this was in olefins where the benefits of ethane cracking were particularly strong. It is also important to note that these results were generated while we conducted significant maintenance at our Channelview site.</p>
          <p>O&amp;P-EAI produced approximately $100 million of EBITDA. Consistent with past quarters, the differentiated polyolefin products and our joint ventures performed well. The improvement versus the fourth quarter was driven by improved olefin and polyolefin volumes and margins.</p>
          <p>Following fourth-quarter turnarounds, Intermediates &amp; Derivatives segments results return to strong historic levels with EBITDA of approximately $280 million. The Refining &amp; Oxyfuel segment generated over $190 million of EBITDA in what is historically a seasonally slow quarter. Oxyfuel results were particularly strong.</p>
          <p>The Technology segment continued to benefit from steady catalyst sales leading to EBITDA of approximately $55 million.</p>
          <p>The bar chart on the right depicts the last 12 months EBITDA by segment. Over the period total EBITDA was approximately $5.1 billion. Approximately 45% was generated from O&amp;P Americas while the Intermediate &amp; Derivatives and Refining &amp; Oxyfuel segments each generated approximately $1 billion.</p>
          <p>You would turn to slide number seven, we have plotted the key components of our cash flow. During the first quarter, cash balances increased by approximately $600 million, closing the quarter near $1.67 billion. Typically, the first quarter is characterized by relatively weak cash flow, as several annual payments including property taxes, customer rebates, insurance premium payments and employee bonuses are made during the quarter.</p>
          <p>This year was somewhat of an exception as strong earnings and a receipt of approximately $250 million from tax refunds more than offset these items. CapEx spending was slightly less than our planned rate. On the right side of this chart, you can see that over the last 12 months, our cash balances declined from $4.4 billion to $1.67 billion.</p>
          <p>Operations including working capital generated over $3.6 billion of cash while uses included approximately $1 billion for CapEx, $2 billion of debt repayment and $3 billion in dividends. Before I leave this chart I would like to point out that our first quarter financials do not reflect the premiums and other costs associated with our recent financing. The transactions were closed during the second quarter and will be reflected accordingly.</p>
          <p>By way of guidance, I estimate the second quarter will include a charge of approximately $330 million representing tender premiums and the write-off of previous financing fees. Of course, this is a non-recurring item and approximately $35 million is non-cash. Most importantly, I want to highlight that going forward, our cash interest expense will be approximately $250 million annually. The average interest rate on our remaining debt is slightly greater than 5.5%.</p>
          <p>Let's move to slide eight to look a few balance sheet statistics. On the left, you can see that working capital was relatively unchanged during the quarter as inventory declined while receivables increased. The inventory reduction is related to both out Channelview turnaround and the sale of the Berre refinery inventory. On the right, we have included a key statistics. As you can see, we closed the quarter with $4 billion of debt and net debt of $2.3 billion.</p>
          <p>During the past two quarters, we have significantly restructured our debt and improved the balance sheet. In fact, since our original financing in 2010, we have reduced debt by more than $3 billion, reduced the average interest rate by approximately 4.5% and decreased annualized interest by more than $400 million. Additionally, our credit rating has improved substantially. Notably, one of the agencies recently raised our corporate rating to investment grade.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn things back to Jim for a further discussion of our business results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Karyn. Let's discuss segment performance beginning on slide number nine with Olefins &amp; Polyolefins-Americas. First quarter EBITDA was $598 million, an increase of $191 million versus the fourth quarter. Olefins' EBITDA exceeded $500 million despite having significant downtime related to the Channelview turnaround. During the quarter, maintenance activity reduced ethylene production by approximately 200 million pounds. The combination of fourth quarter product purchases and the first quarter inventory drop enabled us to meet our customers' product needs.</p>
          <p>I'd like to discuss a few metrics to put results in perspective. Relative to the fourth quarter, our average ethylene price increased by approximately $0.02 per pound, while the cost of ethylene production metric decreased by approximately $0.10 per pound. The latter decrease was primarily related to the lower cost of ethane.</p>
          <p>Our average ethane cost declined by $0.28 per gallon in the Gulf and approximately $0.10 per gallon in the Midwest. During the quarter, 82% of our ethylene was produced from natural gas liquids with ethane accounting for 68% of the ethylene production.</p>
          <p>Polyolefin results also strengthened versus the fourth quarter as EBITDA increased by approximately $60 million. Margins drove the increased performance. Versus the fourth quarter, the average polyethylene sales price increased by approximately $0.06 per pound, while the polypropylene price increased by $0.02 per pound. Volumes for both polymers were relatively unchanged.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we received a $10 million dividend from our Mexican joint venture.</p>
          <p>Overall, the first quarter was a good quarter for this segment and the underlying fundamentals have remained intact. Ethane prices have remained low while industry turnarounds have made ethylene availability tighter than normal.</p>
          <p>Our Channelview olefins plant turnaround is complete and the plant is being restarted. During April, the turnaround impacted ethylene production by approximately 150 million pounds.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide number 10 and review performance in the olefins and polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. First quarter EBITDA was $103 million, a $41 million improvement over the fourth quarter. The improvement was generated in European olefins and commodity polyolefins. During the quarter, our differentiated products, such as polypropylene compounds and Catalloy resins continue to perform well, generating results consistent with prior quarters.</p>
          <p>Equity income associated with our joint ventures increased. But due to the timing of payments, we received $40 million fewer dividends. Although profits in European olefins and polyolefins increased, they were still relatively weak as most of the improvement occurred during March. Product prices increased as the quarter progressed, but raw material cost increases offset a significant portion of the benefit. Quarterly sales volumes improved returning to third quarter levels.</p>
          <p>First quarter results were negatively impacted by an explosion at one of our low-density polyethylene facilities at Wesseling, Germany. During the quarter, we recognized a $22-million charge for damage to the asset and estimated about a $10-billion impact from lost sales. Thus far, second quarter trends have remained largely unchanged. Within Europe, the environment for olefins and polyolefins remains difficult. However, raw material cost have stabilized and we are benefiting from butadiene pricing. We anticipate that joint venture dividends will be consistent with historic averages but it can be difficult to predict the timing of payments by quarter.</p>
          <p>Now please turn to slide 11 for a discussion of the Intermediates &amp; Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $282 million, an increase of $109 million from the prior quarter, which included the impact of substantial maintenance activity. First quarter results were on track with performance seen during the first three quarters of 2011. Absent the impact of the fourth quarter turnaround, propylene oxide and derivative results were largely unchanged. Volumes have benefited from the absence of the turnaround activity and stronger trade sales.</p>
          <p>Acetyls volumes results also improved following fourth quarter maintenance and PO co-products TBA derivatives benefited from strong margins but styrene margins declined. Ethylene oxide and glycol results were relatively unchanged. Underlying business trends are largely unchanged from the first quarter as we head into the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's move to slide number 12 for a discussion of the Refining &amp; Oxyfuels segment. First quarter EBITDA was $192 million. Throughout the quarter, Oxyfuel spreads were strong and as the quarter progressed, the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark spread improved from the December low point. Houston refinery quarterly EBITDA improved by approximately $30 million. Margins improved as the quarter progressed and the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark spread averaged approximately $20 per barrel.</p>
          <p>The refinery operated near full capacity consuming approximately 259,000 barrels of crude daily. Although quarterly results improved, they lag the benchmark. The following factors contributed to the shortfall: January results were negatively impacted by the residual effect of late 2011 crude price volatility. Deficiencies between the refinery and Channelview were impacted by the olefins turnaround. This impacted results by approximately $20 million. And although the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark serves as a good indicator of trends, it does not reflect the pricing of byproducts such as coke which did not increase in concert with first quarter crude oil prices.</p>
          <p>As I previously mentioned, our Berre refinery ceased operations during early January. During the quarter, we continue to incur fixed costs and some utility spending as we secured and mapped all the asset. This resulted in an EBITDA loss of approximately $35 million. However, we also sold the existing product inventories out of game, a portion of which is related to our use of LIFO inventory accounting. Consequently, EBITDA was near breakeven and we generated positive cash flow.</p>
          <p>First quarter Oxyfuel results were unseasonably strong, improving by approximately $80 million versus the fourth quarter. Margins accounted for the majority of the improvement. Relatively good demand for octane, coupled with high gasoline prices and low natural gas base raw material costs generated strong margins.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide number 12 during April, Refining &amp; Oxyfuel margins have been very strong. However, margins declined as the month progressed. And although we expect them to remain quite good, they may not maintain April levels throughout the quarter. Specific to our operations, the Channelview turnaround impact should be limited to the first quarter. But coke pricing has remained depressed relative to crude. The Houston Refinery has operated near-full rates and is expected to do so throughout the quarter. We should anticipate that the Berre refinery will continue to incur fixed costs during the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's step back from the details and summarize the business environment on slides number 13 and 14. Most important on slide number 13, you can see the pace and magnitude of the industry margin recovery across the first quarter and then to April. Clearly, our O&amp;P Americas and Refining segments are in a good position. As I mentioned, we're also seeing positive trends in oxyfuels and good butadiene pricing.</p>
          <p>In our other businesses, trends have been largely unchanged during the first quarter. Before we finish our prepared comments, I want to mention that our growth projects are moving forward consistent with the spending and timing outlined at our Investor Day presentations. We will do our best to bring these additional volumes online as soon as possible given the excellent margin environment, we expect to see in the future for U.S. Olefins, methanol and European butadiene.</p>
          <p>We'll open now please to take questions, Debbie.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I know it's not your preferred method of talking about the business but a lot of people seem pretty cautious about stepping into a stock like yours with all the crackers coming up over the next several months and the draw that's going to put on the ethane side of things and potentially the amount of ethylene that it puts into the market. Can you kind of give your best guesstimate how this summer looks as far as the spread between ethane and ethylene goes and just that interplay with all the crackers coming back up in the near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a number of crackers are already coming up, there are several down. As I mentioned, OP-2 came up earlier in our company, a day or two ahead of schedule. OP-1 is starting up as we speak. If you look at ethane pricing today, things are about where they've been. It's Gulf Coast $0.50 plus or minus a gallon and EP at Conway's in the teens, so that's looking pretty good. Volumes have been holding up; the economy's been pretty good in the United States.</p>
          <p>As a company, we don't export much as you know, Duffy, so we're not as dependent on the China market. So things still look very good. And remember we've had incredible margins in this business recently. So we expect them to be good. The question is how good?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. And then you mentioned a $20-million number for the synergy that was kind of foregone between Channelview and the refinery. Was that just for that aspect or was that also including the purchases that you're still underwater a little bit for January within the refining business as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Duffy. This is Doug. Now that $20 million is related to the turnaround only. If you recall, we have the Alky unit and also an MTBE unit over at the Channelview site that process refinery materials. That's where that impact was, it's in that quarter and that's a completely separate thing from any purchasing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing that you're mentioning there, Duffy -- we did have some residual effects of some of the WTI and Brent pricing flow into the first quarter that we had experienced at the end of the fourth quarter. That's separate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, can you talk a little bit about the residence time of a gallon of ethane going through your system production into ethylene and down into derivatives and then ultimately being sold and put on a cost of goods line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we try to make that very quick. We don't hold much inventory of either ethane or ethylene. The industry has gotten to the point &#x2013; it's really a very rapid process. And then even into polyethylene, if you look at our days to sale on hand, it's always in the 20s kind of number of days, so things move through the system pretty rapidly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how much capacity do you have to store and how fixated should we be on spot trends? That certainly gets most of the attention on Wall Street, but I suspect most of your sales are on monthly contracts. So can you tell me how much or what you've been storing from a raw material standpoint? And then is there a reason to or not to fixate on these spot trends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first, let me comment on ethane storage. We do store some ethane but we try not to hold a lot of inventory. It just doesn't make a lot of sense. So that's not a big issue. We did hold a lot of ethylene inventory from the fourth quarter into the turnaround at Channelview because when you have your two largest units down like that, that's pretty significant. And we wanted to make sure that we were in good shape. So you saw that the inventory's depleted here in the first quarter, that's as a result of the turnaround and the use of that ethylene we stored.</p>
          <p>Spot prices are somewhat important, but it just kind of helps on trend on contracts. So we don't &#x2013; it's important, but the contract price is far more important.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned that you're restarting Channelview now. There seems to be plenty of real estate at Channelview. Any thoughts on the condo cracker that you've talked about at that site? And do you have any partners lined up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a number of people have come to us when we indicated that we would be interested in a condo cracker. And there are multiple parties have announced crackers; I don't expect most of those to build their own cracker. They're raising their hand to say we're available. A number of them have contacted us. Channelview could be a site, but we're still in early discussions with folks on that. So, I don't want to signal anything at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just wanted to get your thoughts, Jim, on core products, propylene and butadiene. Can you give us an update on your metathesis expansion?</p>
          <p>And then, the industry's now beginning to talk about BDH units &#x2013; that of butane-dehydro units. What do you think can be done in the tight butadiene situation? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Well, as you may recall, we announced butadiene expansion in Europe. We had the feedstock &#x2013; one of the big questions is do you have the feedstock for that kind of an extraction unit, and we did within our European system. So, while we're not trying to grow Europe in general, a butadiene unit at our Wesseling facility made a lot of sense and has just really outstanding economics. And that project remains on track, it was approved, it's in construction, and so that looks very good.</p>
          <p>The reason butadiene is so strong is because everybody is cracking lighter. As a result of that, the propylene molecule's been short, butadiene's been short and you've heard people talk about PDH units, metathesis units. We also are looking at expanding our metathesis unit at Channelview and continue to study that. We'll pay a lot of attention to the propylene molecule as we make our final investment decisions. There have been a fair number of announcements related to PDH units. And as you know, people can overbuild pretty rapidly. So we'll look at relative economics and make sure that that still make sense as we developed the engineering on that project.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>When you look at the amount of ethane capacity, which is coming on in the United States, is it sufficiently visible that you can make an assessment of whether you think ethane prices on average might be lower in 2013 than in 2012 or is it not so well-defined?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at this point in time, there's over 1 million barrels a day showing up. That's more than last year against basically the same capacity. There's been a little bit of debottleneck. We've done a bit of that, be able to take a little more ethane. But the nice thing about having retained our swing capacity, we'll watch every day and see does it make sense to crack ethane. Does it make sense to crack a little more propane? We've got some very nice condensate pricing from some of the South Texas fields and the Eagle Ford that have been coming on, and we'll make a daily call on all of that. But at this point in time, things look reasonably balanced and we think that following year, in 2016, ethane gets pretty long and should be very, very good for our industry. But coming into the second, third quarter, I think things are pretty balanced and then start to go long ethane.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. One of the things I'll add that I probably didn't focus on enough is propane is pretty helpful. The propane track is pretty good right now. As you know, it's a pretty warm winter. Propane went long. Everybody's exporting as much of that as they can and still very readily available, and so that's a pretty nice crack right now, which takes some pressure off of ethane.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jim. Two questions on demand. I mean once all these outages are behind us, I think <mark type="ph" /> CMI's (28:48) talking about current nameplate offering rights about 83%. I'm just wondering what you're seeing in terms of polyethylene demand domestically. Are buyers holding off in anticipation of lower prices? And I know you don't export much, if any, to Asia but what are your thoughts on Chinese demand and any implications for them being able to take more Middle Eastern material and hence, make Europe a little less oversupplied as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, when China came out of the Chinese New Year very early in the first quarter, people expected demand to pick up and I don't think we've seen that. I think demand has been slower than we expected in Asia at the present time and that has put pressure on European margins.</p>
          <p>As a company, as you mentioned, Don, we do not export to China much out of the United States and so it's had limited impact on this business. You saw the impact that it had on Europe, it continues to have. It's to be seen. A lot of people are watching which way crude is going, which way naphtha is going.</p>
          <p>Here in the United States demand has been pretty good. People again are watching &#x2013; as people have the turnarounds being completed, which way our margin's going to do. so if you try to predict within a given week or two, you'll probably miss it and a lot of times that's what people try to do. But I think the U.S. economy has been pretty good overall. China has been reasonably weak and Europe quite weak. And so you see that reflected in the first quarter numbers. But we remain pretty optimistic going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We're in pretty good shape on that. A lot of the work in Bob Patel's area, in olefins and polyolefins is nearing completion. We continue to work on some of the other staff costs. I try not to go in too much details because we have works councils there and we always have to have robust discussions with our employee groups in advance of announcing things and quarterly reports like this. But we remain very, very actively engaged of reducing costs because, frankly, Europe's profitability is problematic as you can see in first quarter results.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen, and Karyn. Hey, just a couple of questions on the Refining &amp; Oxyfuels side of the business. You had a good oxyfuels results in Q1. It sounds like you're expecting more of the same here in Q2. So should &#x2013; I guess at this point, if the quarter were to end, you're pretty much looking for a pickup relative to Q1 on that <mark type="ph" /> FTU (31:47)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oxyfuels has performed very well and seasonably strong results in the first quarter. We get some benefit out of low natural gas prices in that business. So spreads have been good, demand has been good, the people have wanted octane. Gasoline prices have been very high because of high crude prices. Usually the fourth and first quarters in oxyfuels are weaker and we did pretty well through those quarters. So that continues. It usually gets stronger going into the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We've seen Maya 2-1-1 do pretty well into April. It fell off a little bit over the last few days, but it's still pretty strong. And so as I've mentioned in the planned remarks that coke prices, some of the byproduct prices are a bit depressed but overall Refining &amp; Oxyfuels should do well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. I'd like to expand a little bit on a previous question of butadiene and other co-products and the international olefins. I think we addressed that, been looking for perhaps a bigger earnings boost from the co-products. Can you provide us with a little bit more background on prices you've been seeing in local markets, maybe sequentially and the strength that we might be looking at three months from now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mike, this Doug, I'll you first then maybe Jim can pick up in a broader answer. One of the things we want to think about across the first quarter is, what you saw was rising prices across the quarter and mostly is co-products as if you recall we finished the fourth quarter pretty weak and then we moved up as we went across the quarter.</p>
          <p>Also, with Channelview site being down for the turnaround in March, that is one of our main co-product locations and producer of our key co-products for us. So C4 recovery units were down, metathesis, and of course, the cracker the OP1 and OP2 for a while. So all of those things had some impact on our side of things at co-product area. Jim mentioned before we'll have to see how things come as people come from turnarounds, but you still have a lot of capacity off in April and you do in May as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Butadiene prices have come down just a bit, but from very high elevated levels. And so we still feel very good about that business in co-pricing. Again, as people continue to crack light in the United States it puts worldwide pressure, butadiene, propylene or world-traded commodities. And so we expect that pricing to stay in good shape.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, it's fair enough. And then can you discuss a little bit more on the timing issue, the JV dividends that you highlighted in your prepared comments? Would the dividends just push forward into 2Q, so whether it would be the $40 million seen or realized in 2Q versus 1Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on dividends, it's fairly lumpy. It's very hard to predict when the JV boards are going to actually declare dividends, but the earnings have been nice and strong across those businesses and so we expect the dividends to come. We just can't tell you whether it's first quarter or second quarter, and so we expect that the forecast that we've given on that will remain true. The business has been reasonably strong, still.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there, Jim. I just wanted to expand a bit further on the dividend side of things. I know there was a bit of a power outage in Jubail as well as, as I understand it, some PDH-related issues as far as Al-Waha goes. So was that factored into the timing of the dividends or the timing of the announcement, and if you could just give us a sense of how much earnings will reduce the cost of those things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First, you're correct that there was a power outage across all of Jubail and that did slow things down for a couple of weeks that isn't that material in our overall program. The significant dividends that we see are from the other two joint ventures not Al-Waha. In Al-Waha, we're still paying down debt. we have had periodic PDH-unit issues in terms of hitting maximum rates, but the economics of that plant have improved over the last year and a half.</p>
          <p>We've gotten rates up in general. Polypropylene plants run in a lot better, we have our own plant manager in there. But you haven't seen dividends from Al-Waha, you've been seeing it from SEPC and SPC. And while there's a bit of an outage, I don't think that was that material given our percentage interest.</p>
          <p>And then of course, Thailand is another venture we have, a nice feedstock advantage and you see good dividends. You'll see bits and pieces, sometimes in <mark type="ph" /> Delpro (37:40) like you saw a $10 million in this quarter. Those would come periodically but the couple big Saudi joint ventures, Thailand joint ventures are the ones to really watch.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Jim, as your cash builds nicely through Q1, can you update us in your thoughts about another one-time special dividend towards yearend perhaps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll let Karyn talk about our dividend policy. We get that question an awful lot and so I'll let her discuss that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just in terms of a special dividend, it is a good way to return value to the shareholders if there's no other immediate or appropriate accretive opportunity to do so. Of course, we would balance that with any potential other opportunities we have and then also in terms of our goal becoming investment grade and maintenance of strong investment credit grade metrics.</p>
          <p>But generally speaking, our cash balances today in absolute terms as well as a percentage of our market cap or EBITDA is lower and in many cases, significantly lower than our peers. So no urgent cash deployment needed in the very short term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jim, just on the Conway advantage, can you talk about the sustainability of that advantage as some other efforts underway to move some of that Conway EP down to the Gulf Coast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There will be a pipeline built to move some of that product. We think that's a 2013 event. For now, though, ethane and EP is very long there and we're seeing prices in the teens, so a very strong advantage. We have couple billion pounds in that region and so it's very helpful recognizing the stranded nature of that, like, always happens. There will be pipelines built and some of that will be remedied and we expect that to happen.</p>
          <p>Now, having said that, there's still would be an ethane advantage there with the transportation differential and those crackers are still going to look good going into the future and the supply and demand tightens. We still feel very good about our Morris and Clinton assets and in fact, doing a little bit of debottlenecking to the extent we can to maximize that.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I guess first &#x2013; I guess you mentioned in the quarter you were 68% ethane in the U.S. With Channelview back on line, has that figure increased further and if so, how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me give you kind of a couple &#x2013; kind of high level comments on that. We can &#x2013; at this moment I would guess 80%, 82% maybe system-wide U.S. reduction from NGLs. And by the time we get into September that'll probably be closer to 85%. In terms of ethane, high 60s maybe 68% system-wide ethane and again in September following a little bit of work we're doing that will probably be around low 70s. I think our target is about 72%. So I think those numbers will give you a pretty good idea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then just trying to part some of the commentary around the Houston refinery and then the R&amp;O segment, I guess, can you clarify that in Q2 there are no substantial overhangings that allow you to earn closer to or even above the industry margin benchmark? And I guess, in the common scale in Berre in terms of the $30 million to $35 million, is there any other inventory that you could still liquidate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a little bit of inventory left at Berre, but it's fairly modest and that will be liquidated at the right time. In terms of the overhang, the Channelview turnaround impact that Doug talked about, that's done, that was &#x2013; those units were started up a couple of weeks ago, and so that impact is gone. Now having said that, when you look at the Maya 2-1-1, one of the points I continue to make is, by product pricing, like coke has been depressed, all right, and so you don't always realize the full Maya 2-1-1. This depends on how co-products move in that business, too, so to speak.</p>
          <p>And so, the crude oil trading between the WTI/Brent, that caught us at the end of last year. That was more of January event. And so things look pretty good, and we're still buying some distressed cargos and they're running very well at the refinery and so, hopefully, it will post some good numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can I just clarify the last point? So theoretically, the Houston asset might be roughly $100 million below what the benchmark would have suggest the Maya 2-1-1 and your cracks per capture rate. $20 million is from the synergies. Would the remainder, if you had to divide it up between coke versus other trading activities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Rob, this is Doug. I would say you had $20 million from January, the trading activity and hangover. The WTI, we had about $20 million from the turnarounds. And then the balance really are things like the coke side. Also, just timing of things. One thing you've got to remember, these refineries are very big facilities. So the timing of purchases and sales could have an impact on results on any given quarter. So there's always going to be a little bit of variability from the benchmark here.</p>
          <p>And sometimes, that'll be on the positive side. Sometimes, it'll be a little bit negative. I think there was a timing impact that impacted &#x2013; that had a first quarter impact to us. But we wouldn't really change our thoughts going forward and what we've guided you to for a metric and a formula to use for the benchmark with the exception of &#x2013; remember what Jim said is some of the co-products like coke &#x2013; lower price being depressed <mark type="ph" /> rights (44:05) right now so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think an important takeaway though is that this refinery is running so much better than it did in prior years. We can exceed nameplate fairly regularly and we're much smarter about the way we buy crude and sell our clean products. So it's totally a different asset than it used to be.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I just wanted to circle back on the ethane price commentary. And if I mischaracterized what you said, Jim, please correct me. But I believe you were sort of indicating that you were concerned about ethane prices going up in the back half of the year which is consistent with what one of your peers said last week. So I just wanted to revisit that and then also, I do have that slide deck out from the presentation I believe that it was referred to earlier.</p>
          <p>And if you could just sort of comment a little bit on what your expectations are on the demand side of things over the next, let's say, 12 or 18 months? And then maybe specifically what I'm thinking about is just sort of the level of capacity creep that could take place in the industry that might not be announced or visible from some of your competitors and how all that factors into your thought process here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, I think the specific thing that I said, Vincent, is that ethane was around $0.50 right now, plus or minus some. Could it go up some in the third quarter? I think it could. How much is very, very difficult to predict. But we have a lot of variables at play here. As you know, rig count has dropped pretty significantly as a result of lower gas prices. We're above $2 an M now again. It really needs to be much bigger than that to sustain the heavy rig count looking for natural gas.</p>
          <p>Having said that, because liquid prices are much better, you still see pretty good rig counts in the fields that are wet and that's positive that they're still looking for that and adding the volumes. We've had some studies done internally where we looked at supply-demand on NGLs and &#x2013; say they're reasonably balanced I think was the words that I used into the second, third quarter maybe starting to go a little long in the fourth quarter and then to next year we think it should be long-term everything we see.</p>
          <p>In terms of the demand side, the U.S. economy has been better than other parts of the world. This is a lot of our product goes into the domestic market and so a lot depends on the economy but it's been reasonably good. So we still feel pretty good about our business going forward. Out into 2013 and 2014? We feel very good. Ethane gets long. Propane's been helping us some and we think that there's not much new capacity being added in the early years and so it should be very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just then, is it fair to assume that you do not believe that there's any risk from &#x2013; I don't know, what would you call a sort of hidden capacity creep from your competitors in the next 12 or 18 months that's probably reflected in your forecast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, hidden capacity increased on the ethane consumption side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Or is it just not &#x2013; or is the risk just not material, that could be the answer to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've just got done explaining to someone that we might go up 2% or 3% here or there and our capacity to crack ethane and another NGL. And I think other people are trying to do that. Part of that depends on where they in turnaround schedules and all of it because sometimes you needed a turnaround to capture that capacity. You have to actually change hardware and you need to be down to accomplish that. So I think everybody who could has been.</p>
          <p>But I do want to make a special point about propane because this is helping. Propane has been pricing reasonably close to ethane and obviously you get some more co-products with that. And so, if other people were like us, they may be running some more furnaces on propane than they had in the past based on relative pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Vincent, one other thing I'd say is one other thing to think about with the turnaround activity, what you've seen this year is we're talking about ability to consume but we're also seeing ethane production records and ethane and propane inventories both rising over the past multiple months. So, we'll see how the balance sheet work through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question is from Andy Cash of UBS. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. With the stock behaving the way it is in, I would imagine that you would like to buy back some stock here, but given the Dutch tax penalty. I was just curious maybe if you could go through and explain to us what's the earliest date that you think you could buy back some stock without that penalty. And after that penalty is waived, what will be the latitude, let's say, over 12-month period of time, how much stock you could buyback if you decided to buyback?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, beginning in January of 2013, we could potentially review our options as it relates to share buybacks without that significant tax penalty. Beyond the tax modifications, we would look at, obviously, any share buybacks in relation in the other accretive growth projects, cash needs or overall outlook in the market. It doesn't mean we will or have the intention at this point, but just to those tax issues with no longer precluded.</p>
          <p>However, regardless of this, we would still need to keep in mind our current ownership structure and the potential concentration of ownership, our larger holders did not participate in that share buyback. But going forward, after January in 2013, those tax issues will no longer have that kind of owner as a consequence for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as far as the magnitude, excluding the potential ownership, it is something that has related to the dividend, how much dividend you pay and then how much buyback it could be, could you talk about that and explain that stuff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Andy, there are, just standing on dividends you've paid thus far and, of course, we're not tuned at that point in time yet, but it's a substantial amount.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just a quick follow up, given that your turnarounds are behind you now, Channelview, was the 1.5 billion pounds of polyethylene in the first quarter, was that a low watermark for polyethylene this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll see how the year develops as far as the sales you mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as far as the volume, I mean, I was surprised how strong it was. I mean, it was very strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But remember, Andy, Jim spoke about we built inventory of ethylene and product in the fourth quarter. So, we can meet the customer requirements. So, I think it is &#x2013; as you're commenting on demand was okay in the quarter. And we were able to meet the demand through the actions that we took in anticipation of the turn-on. We'll see how the rest of the year develops out for us.</p>

          <p>Okay, second question. The Clinton shutdown as I understand it, that has been scheduled in May perhaps five to six weeks. Is there any chance of delaying that outage now that the margins are so spectacular on the very cheap Midwest ethane?</p>

          <p>We don't have a turnaround in that one. It's scheduled as you're suggesting here. We've had a little bit of an outage but they'll turnaround activity like that. We've been doing some furnace maintenance but I'm not sure where that's coming from.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys or afternoon as the case maybe. Quick question, on the turnaround at Channelview, what would you characterize the cost of sort of using inventory ethylene instead of because it's got a lot of higher cost structure in it from whatever feedstocks you were using considering especially the drop across from fourth quarter into 1Q in terms of the cost structure. Can that get quantified in the first quarter? How much of it in effect cost you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Charlie. I think the key thing to think about is basically the turnaround work impacted production by a couple of 100 million pounds. As we said, we really met our customer needs. So we had a couple 100 million pounds. But have we been able to produce it? We would dissolve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. But I mean what you used then as the inventory because basically you're eager to supply more of or less than...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you recall from our fourth quarter call, we've said we actually had purchased and built some inventory and we say purchased inventory here. So we we're purchasing under 50s, we're producing in the 20s.</p>

          <p>Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Jim. You referenced a few times that the propane crack is becoming fairly competitive with the ethane crack. And so I'm wondering if propane continues to lengthen over the summer here such that that becomes an advantage feed relative to ethane, what is the maximum amount of propane that your U.S. asset base could handle in percentage terms, and does that figure change at all with your Channelview feedstock flexibility project once that's done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can go back to where we were. We can still crack very heavy at Channelview. We can still do the same thing down there at Corpus, and so propane is very, very easy to take into our furnaces. And so I don't think we'll be very limited on that. In fact, another way of thinking about that is if we can do high 60s in ethane and we want to start pulling in propane, that number goes up if we need it to.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm not trying to infer that propane will overcome ethane longer term in terms of overall pricing. I am saying that it does kind of help put a cap on things and it does overall improve the relative pricing of ethane because of additional propane that's being cracked because of good economics. But I don't see us going really long propane and a lot less ethane. I think ethane will stay favored.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And realistically, I think polyethane has to react.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to clarify. If I look at the 82% figure you mentioned for NGLs and 68% ethane, I guess you're running 14% as the sum of propane and butane. It sounds to me like that number may not necessarily move a lot higher. But if the propane crack improves, you benefit through a looser ethane market essentially. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It could increase significantly if we wanted it to, but we wouldn't probably because what I'm saying is that ethane should stay the lower and the favorite crack. But, let's see, how would I say that differently? I'm trying to say that ethane &#x2013; this goes to the argument that ethane gets short into the third quarter and fourth quarter, and as a result the price will spike like we saw following some outages at Bellevue last year related to a fire. I don't see that happening absent some unusual situation like that again because we are very long propane right now. It's a warm winter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think key thing to remember, Kevin, is really only one -- two places for ethane to go. One, it can stay in fuel up to a certain extent but at that point it's only worth about $0.15 like we're seeing in the Midwest right now. The other alternative is to crack it. So you tend to think it's going to remain, have to remain competitive to the propane side of it, and that as Jim was saying, propane kind of cap your ethane situation.</p>
          <p>So if you think about it, what we've done is, lately opened up the feed slightly. There's always a lot of discussion about how much ethane coming off of these wells, so 40-some percent ethane and about 28% propane. So it's really opened up the cracking slightly <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:38) propane is competitive.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me just finish up. I believe we did have a very solid start to the year. First quarter is normally a weaker quarter, but several of our businesses had excellent results. U.S. olefins had over $500 million quarter despite Channelview OP-1 and OP-2 being down a fair amount of that quarter. It's very rare when both of those are down, but we still had that kind of olefin result.</p>
          <p>Refining &amp; Oxyfuels also had a very good start to the year and I&amp;D continues to perform well quarter-after-quarter. Obviously, the fourth quarter, we had some turnaround activity but if you look at a normalized I&amp;D quarter, very, very solid. We're finishing up our refinancing efforts, and Standard &amp; Poor's has given us an investment grade corporate rating. And this is a major milestone for the company, something that we wanted to see for quite some time, a very solid balance sheet at this point in time.</p>
          <p>We're in cyclical businesses. We're going to closely monitor European and Asia business conditions but overall, we feel very good about our relative competitive position.</p>
