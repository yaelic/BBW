        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning to you all, thank you very much for attending this conference. We have a very brief presentation today. And I believe that at the benefit of that understanding of our results and perspectives we will have Mr. Agnelli, Mr. Martins and Mr. Ferreira's comments together with our presentation. So I'll try to be brief on the Vale presentation itself.</p>
          <p>First, our performance in the second quarter, we believe that we again delivered a very outstanding performance amidst a very challenging environment, operationally wise. We delivered record in outputs of nickel, iron ore, pellets and coal. And record shipments of iron ore pellets &#x2013; iron ore and pellets is 78.9 million tons. Record revenues, almost $11 billion. Net earnings, $5 billion. And EBITDA, $6.2 billion.</p>
          <p>In the case of the drivers as you can see in page 6, the major drivers were of course the price variation of $2.1 billion, again in the first part of '08. Volumes; despite the operational problems that we have faced as we explained in our release. Dividends 1.75, but a very important contribution of cost reduction associated with increase in production of our &#x2013; our facility in Rico and other elements in our cost structure.</p>
          <p>So it was a very impressive result, I would say, considering the very sharp appreciation of the exchange rate and also the massive effort in terms research and development. So it's a very &#x2013; we are happy with what we could get, considering again the very challenging environment.</p>
          <p>Another important point was the upgrade to BBB+ that we achieved in this quarter, associated with the global offering, that's implemented in that month of July. Again Vale proves the quality its credit and also the quality of the strategic firm that it has in its pipeline. And we were able to attract a very important set of investors to buy our shares, then there was surplus for transactions achieved again in the most challenging financial environment of the of the last 20 years.</p>
          <p>And after this transaction we were able to get BBB+, it's the only company that &#x2013; headquarters in Brazil with this rating. It's the only one with this proximity to the A league which we want to get to as soon as possible. And this of course is related to the very strong cash flow generation. The steady cash flow, the reduced volatility of our cash flow. The limited leverage of our balance sheet, despite acquisitions that we made. And of course a very comfortable debt profile, reflected in the debt maturity above 10 years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>We're driving through the A league you promised me sooner than later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. So I have to deliver. That's right. So speaking of delivering, we delivered in the last six months, six world-class projects. Four of them in Brazil, where we had the bulk of our investments as of now at 15.8 million tons a run of mine, Samarco, the third expansion of Samarco is 7.6 million tons.</p>
          <p>Paragominas, now has been able to produce &#x2013; Is able to produce almost 10 million tons per year and there is a last expansion of Alunorte one at stage six and seven and now Alunorte is producing 6.3 million tons per year, is the largest alumina refinery in the world.</p>
          <p>And two very important investments in China; Zuhai palletizing plant, with 1.2 million tons capacity and the nickel refinery in Dalian that we inaugurated in the first half of the year. So, very important investments. We invested almost $4 billion in the first half of '08, 2.7 billion in projects, 440 million in R&amp;D and stay-in-business $915 million.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, our basic view is what is in the beginning of this section, fundamentals remain strong. In our view, there is phenomenons relative to company of emerging market economies. We expect it to continue. We believe that the growth rate of the world GDP would be around 3.8% over the next five years and in 2012. So even above what we observed in the last 37 years and in 2007.</p>
          <p>So this should continues and this drive will be determined by the major market economies, which have been absolutely key to the permit of the performance of the mining and metals industries over the last several years. And you can see in chart 11 that out of seaborne trade growth over eight years, ending 2007, China represented 95%. And in the automotives steel, aluminum, copper and nickel a major contribution by emerging market economies to the global consumption growth.</p>
          <p>And this of course has to do with the structural changes that are associated with the growth of the emerging markets economies. So there is a massive effort in infrastructure building, industrialization, urbanization. And those are very much biased &#x2013; those elements are very much biased towards mining metals and increase naturally and structurally the demand for minerals and metals.</p>
          <p>So the UN estimates that the emerging market population in urban areas will increase by 1.2 billion people until 2025. This is the &#x2013; double of the combined population of the US and Europe in less than 20 years. And this is the number of people that do have to get urban infrastructure in place over the next several years.</p>
          <p>So, this is a massive investment. Infrastructure investment is expected to reach almost $5 trillion over the next 10 years and beside, the increase in per capita income and the development of consumer and houses financing in emerging market economies also contribute to add demand &#x2013; associate the demand for metals.</p>
          <p>And finally the very response to the energy shortage that we cannot serve today, also leads to a rise in consumption of metals, particularly copper and other materials.</p>
          <p>Our view about the cycle is that, this is again a long cycle that is very much comparable to what we observed after the Second World War and the beginning of the 20th century. It's a long cycle. And one of the key characteristics has a put there a long metal cycle is above trend growth of global steel output. Above trend referred to by the global GDP growth.</p>
          <p>So, during the 50s and 60s driven by European and Japanese demand, global steel capacity grew 6.2, 5.5% respectively, while the global GDP was limited to 4.8. The same is happening now, in that the Chinese another emerging market cycle with the steel capacity growing, 6.7% average since 2000. And the global GDP growth again around 4%.</p>
          <p>So this is a major &#x2013; it's a major drive that should continue in our view, because they, in our view as well, are far from done as we mentioned before. A lot of infrastructure is still required and they are in way barely beginning.</p>
          <p>On the supply side, we are &#x2013; on the other side of the supply, we face as we put there, multiple headwinds. So as we perceive demand as a very strong one, the supply is not &#x2013; has not been able to catch up with this growth in demand. And so the structural gap between supply and demand will continue in our view.</p>
          <p>Due to institutional barriers, we saw some of our competitors with difficulties in some African countries in the last few days. And this is part of the game today. We have to go to more complex geographies and it's harder to find stable situational environment in everywhere that we dig, in everywhere that we operate.</p>
          <p>Resource endowment, overall decline in resource quality is short. That is of course the major issue for several operations.</p>
          <p>Bottleneck and infrastructure, logistics, power and also the shortage of the skilled people to work in the expansions that we have and our competitors also have.</p>
          <p>Higher CapEx costs, technological charges, altogether the environment is not conducive. So, our timely response of supply to this strength of the demand that we have been observing in the last several years.</p>
          <p>At this point I'd like to turn the floor to Martins to comment on the iron ore perspective and how we see the market and the iron ore business as a whole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. It's a pleasure to talk with you.</p>
          <p>As Fabio has extracted we continues to be very bullish about iron ore market, because we really believe it, that infrastructure is pending in new developing countries. We've continued to foster demand mainly for steel, which is the main material for infrastructure. Much bigger influence than any other materials is steel for infrastructure. And behind steel you have iron ore, you have the met coal and you have the manganese. So we believe that this infrastructure needs will continue to drive demand for steel and also for iron ore.</p>
          <p>The current market condition is very tight, continues to be very tight. We are working very hard to cope with the demand. We continues to lag behind our commitments in terms of delivering what the customer are buying. So in the, this first half we faced a lot of difficulties. We have a big accident in one of our ports. We have a lot of landless people taking &#x2013; blocking our railroad for three times.</p>
          <p>Rain is something we normally haven't disputed. But this year was a little bit stronger. So we are not able to deliver all the iron ore we produce. So we stuck by a lot of iron ore, that now we are delivering because now the system is working better. So only in July, we reached our record number in terms of shipments. And August is going very well. So we expect a very stronger quarter. And we hope that we can recover part of the volume that we lost in this first half based on these problems that we face.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; but looking the markets we continues to be very bullish. When we looked the sourcing of iron ore in China, we see a lot of these small miners, I would 100 of small miners, local miners producing at very high cost. Because the market is demand and is willing to pay a higher price to get this ore.</p>
          <p>Even in the seaborne parts, the number of I would say non-traditional suppliers appearing is a lot, which means that they are buying iron ore everywhere. Just in the next year from now, they are supplying iron ore from third, fourth source.</p>
          <p>In 2006 and '05, it was around 28, and in the beginning of this decade was around 10 to 11 suppliers. So, they are looking for iron ore everywhere. Not only domestically, but also outside. Which means the pressuring cost &#x2013; are pressuring price and you see this going on in the spot market in China which is &#x2013; price is very strong and very high.</p>
          <p>Also the situation in the freight market helped to push this prices high. And we think that we are in a very good position because our benchmark price is a little below the delivered price in China nowadays when you consider the spot market. So we have a &#x2013; we see some upside in price even during this current year, based in the situational.</p>
          <p>So we do not see big changes in volume in this year. And for next year after all of this impact of the Olympic Games, which is sure is bringing impact on the steel production in China, because they manage to us. We're shutdown because of the impact on the environment. So we think that after Olympic Games, the situation there will be even much stronger than what it used to be.</p>
          <p>So when you look forward, we see that the possibility of local ore taking market share there and we need it, because of quality constraints. We do not see more than 45 to 50% usage of local ore because of quality. So &#x2013; and the more they buy from of China sources or India's sources the more they need the correct ore and the more they need high quality ore.</p>
          <p>So we do not see any kind of problems in any market situation, because of this quality constraint they have. And they also &#x2013; they always &#x2013; you need high-quality ore to correct the lower quality ore they are using from all of these different source. So, that put us in a very strong position.</p>
          <p>And we're just glad to see we are developing in the shipping side. We can strength even more this quality advantage that we've have. Because for sure that the long distance between Brazil and Asia is one of our weakness that we are now trying to correct by developing a fleet of vessels that will help us to keep this freight market a little bit less volatile than it has been in the last two or three years.</p>
          <p>So, market-wise we don't sell too much iron ore in United States, we sell less than 10 million tons of iron ore in United States and we continues to sell even with this different situation in the States..</p>
          <p>And in Europe the market is really stable. There is no big changes in the market. And the customers continue to ask you for the contract that they have, for the volumes that they have. So far even in the Western world we do not see big challenges.</p>
          <p>In Brazil the market is very strongly, we sell in Brazil near 50 million tons of iron ore and the market continues to be very good in Brazil. And besides that we have the situation with pellets. With the current situation with met coal, the demand for high quality ore and also for pellets is very strong because you can save coke by using a better iron ore.</p>
          <p>So this is helping us a lot, relating to the high quality ore we have and also for pellets. So we see a very good position not only in the short-term, but also in the long-term for our products. So that is generally speaking how we see the situation.</p>
          <p>Nowadays on the investment side, we are speeding up our programs of investment mainly in Caraj&#xE1;s area and we expect to reach &#x2013; increase our capacity for 120 million tons up to 212 [sic 2012]. And this is our long-term investment there. And increase building a lot of pellet plants to improve our asset base in pellets production. We believe that pellets is becoming more and more the most important ingredient for the line of production because of environmental impact, which is lower.</p>
          <p>Second because you can save energy, you can then use less coke. And also because pellets is very much used in DRI production. And there is big increase in DRI production in the Middle East using the natural gas they have. Also the demand for pellets is really bullish and we have a very strong factory line of investment in this area.</p>
          <p>We are finalizing the conclusion of investment in the Parauapebas project, which is a 7 million tons per year pellets plant in the south system. We are in the middle of investment in number number eight pelletizing plant which is Southeast system. And also we approved in our board in the investment on a new pelletizing plant in Oman in Middle East.</p>
          <p>Besides that we are analyzing new investments in pelletizing plants in Brazil, and also in the Southeast Asia, where we think steel production will grow very fast in that area also.</p>
          <p>So, we are moving very fast with our investments. We are trying anticipate some production, because the market needs it. And mainly in Caraj&#xE1;s there as we see a lot of opportunities to speed-up production.</p>
          <p>Logistical-wise, we solved the problems we faced in the first half of this year, and the investments we are doing there is now under &#x2013; coming upstream &#x2013; coming on stream. And the perspective is very good. We have a lot of iron ore in our mines available for shipping. And as we streamline the logistic system, as we improve our port operation, we have had a very good possibility for increasing volumes, even above the production level, because we have in our base a good volume of iron ore in the mines available for shipping.</p>
          <p>So we see very good situation operationally speaking and also in terms of long-term perspective for the market. Cost wise, we had to been under strong pressure in cost because of lack of a lot of inputs, a lack of labor, a lack of suppliers and also the strengthening of Brazilian currency.</p>
          <p>But as far as we understand we stopped the movement up and now we are working to bring the cost down. It is not easy to bring cost down when we are trying to get an additional ton every day &#x2013; every month. The margin of cost of producing this additional ton always is higher than the previous one.</p>
          <p>But I am very confident that now we stopped this long-term grow in our cost structure, if it really happened from 2002 up to 2006, it was a big grow in our cost structure, because of this way we are producing, trying to get additional tons from every mine, going deeper, moving quantities higher distance so this puts a lot of a pressure in our costs. And we hoped that with developing &#x2013; the development of the new mines with these investments, we can even decrease our cost structure sharply. So that's-the main aspects of iron ore business.</p>
          <p>I would like to add another point, which is manganese businesses is doing tremendously well price wise and volume wise and the product that two or three years ago for us was a question mark and now is running very well productivity wise, quality wise and also profit wise. It's now one of our main products and generating near $1 billion cash flow per the year. And we expect to improve these numbers going forward.</p>
          <p>As I told you in the beginning our discussions, we really believe that iron ore, Metco and manganese will continues to be very well supported by this long-term investment cycle in the infrastructure all over the world, mainly in the less developed countries. That's it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Fabio, thank you very much, good morning, good afternoon. I think that the global growth deceleration is lower today recover of a stainless steel industry output after contraction in 2007.</p>
          <p>In this regard I would like to say some comments, after some improvements that we noticed in the first quarter. A stainless steel production growth is slow down in the second quarter. We know it's the nickel prices starting to fall as the stainless steel production cuts were announced in May. And the inventory de-stocking continue in 2008 as nickel prices fall, as the stainless steel buyers remain concerned to restock in a slow economy.</p>
          <p>The nickel inventories are declining. It's very important, as stainless steel prices contributes to increase the volatility of the nickel price. But we can note easily-in the page 20, the LME stocks at 11 day of conception. They've fallen over 7000 tons, since the highest level in April.</p>
          <p>And going ahead, despite of this sharp price declines nickel outlook is very promise. And the price volatility is characteristic of nickel business, we know very well. It's mainly following the stainless steel with steel industry. But, the accurate price we will force mainly the nickel pig iron producer to shut our operations. And I will do some comments as you know these nickel pig iron most of them they are very inefficient to do the high-cost and a strong pollution controls. And they will struggle to stay into the business.</p>
          <p>In June and July, the estimate cost of the average blast furnace NPI rose above the market price. This is very important. Mainly, this cost ASP was affected by the higher coke price and a strong Chinese currency. The under-blast furnace production represents roughly 70% of the capacity of the NPI and it was strongly affected.</p>
          <p>About the lack of furnace production I think that we needed to understand the lack of enough power in China, it's a big constraint. Then the challenge, I think that we continued the short term for the NPI, it's mainly associate that with the coke price and the risk of the increase of the electricity and the Chinese currency appreciation.</p>
          <p>The demand for the nickel non-stainless steel application, it's much more stable and remains very robust. I am talking about the non ferrous alloys, alloy steel, fabric all continue very strong and driven to the oil, gas, mining, energy, chemicals in our space.</p>
          <p>Then the combination of low stainless steel inventories and decline in nickel inventories can build an environment to a strong nickel price recovery in the next cycle. I think that as Martine said that's, Fabio point out, the long run fundamentals, linkage to damage and cancers we can stay very positive in long-term basis to the nickel market.</p>
          <p>We know that we have a huge results around the world and mainly Canada, Indonesia, New Caledonia, Brazil. Your increases substantial our penetration as a supplier to the stainless steel industry through Goro and On&#xE7;a Puma. We have good assets we can meet the demand in Asia. And we are doing a big program in terms of the restart integrity of the assets and optimization looking for higher productivity. And to try to maximize our high end refinery nickel products. Thank you Fabio.</p>

          <p>Thank you Botelho. And now l like to ask our CEO, Roger Agnelli to make his comments. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. It's also a pleasure for me be here with you today talking a little bit about the results and our future.</p>
          <p>But before say some words, I would like to invite <mark type="inaudible" /> who is our new Managing Executive Directors that was elected last month to be to be responsible for Engineering Department.</p>
          <p>Let me tell you a little bit what we are looking for with this creation of this new area. As you know, CapEx today is a big part for our business. It's a big part of our responsibility. And to push all the investments ahead we needed to have people completely concentrating, fully dedicated to delivery on time, on budget and the most important thing, bring a new generation of projects, using new technologies, automation, using new routes to process and to produce materials. So <mark type="inaudible" /> responsibilities going to be to implement the best practice in the company as I think we are sharing a lot of best practices, with the Inco, with the coal mines that we have in Australia, the iron ore mines. I think we are really learning and we are really improving our standards of production.</p>
          <p>Another point that is going to be responsible is the automation. We needed to upgrade it at our plants and we are doing that intensively. We need to reduce cost, production cost. We need to give more reliability and more stability to our clients and of course we have a good standard. But I would like to have excellent standard in terms of reliability.</p>
          <p>In terms of engineering, the goal or the main target of <mark type="inaudible" /> is going to reduce the OpEx. This is important. We are thinking that the new generation of products or the new production that is going to come to the market, we don't know exactly how is going to be the markets or the environment at that moment. The only thing that we know and we needed to be sure, that we will be able to deliver is to have a low cost production; that is what we are looking for. So even the investment in iron ore in Caraj&#xE1;s is going to be a-let's say different from the old ones we wanted to hire less people even though people today is really a constraint for everybody. It is not easy to find out excuse or to develop or to train people in our days, mainly in the North of Brazil.</p>
          <p>In other areas like Africa or even there in Indonesia et cetera we are facing the same problem. So excuse is really a let's say a bottleneck so we need to reduce the number of people that will be dedicated to our future co-operations.</p>
          <p>If I may ask Phil, what he feel that is I think he is connected to say a few words about his-of his challenges and Phil, you are welcome.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Roger. Good morning and good afternoon everyone. I think Roger you have summed the position up very well there. I think in recognizing our very ambitious growth program over the next couple of years, we recognize that, in executing that, we need to have a very good governance structure, very good risk management structure to ensure success for the future, and I think Roger has mentioned the areas. We want to ensure that in our growth projects we employ global best practices, make use of technology automation to ensure lower production cost for the future, and make sure that all the resources required for our ambitious program is managed and coordinated in a responsible way to ensure that we can be on time with these deliveries of these large projects.</p>
          <p>And we also have to make sure that we utilize the best technical competence in our governance of the execution program. And that basically sums it up. The key is for us to ensure an absolutely maintainable operation of the future and a very cost-effective operation for the future in a very responsible growth phase.</p>

          <p>Okay Philip. Thank you very, very much. Let me give you some ideas about our concerns or what we are really dedicating ourselves to deliver for the company. The one point that is very important of course is the management of the company, our global company. Yesterday, we had the roll out of the EM systems in Incope. And Murilo, if you can make some comments because this is really very important to have a company completely and full integrated.</p>
          <p>So, today we have Vale group completely integrated in the same system that give us a visibility what's going on, all in real time, this is so important to gain. Yes, Murilo could you please make some comments about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Roger for sure. We are very proud to say that we have already started to work in a common platform in the whole of Vale, including Vale Inco. It's based in oracle system and we are-we spent a lot of time, a lot of people, good professional with a dedication demonstrated by everyone, both directly and indirectly. And the result at least of this point of time, it's very early to say but we are very confident that the scope and the complexity was higher than expected. But we stay with the project, we are working very well at this stage in today's working. And it is on budget, it's one thing that is very important as well. I think that working very well with a unit platform will bring a huge merit for us in procurement in financial process in the whole Vale group. And I think that its part up to have a governance model which will bring a huge merit for the whole company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good Murilo. So this was one of our goals. And we delivered that yesterday. Of course we needed to follow and to fix any problems after a second it's going to appear. But we are working and, we are on time, we are in budget and this was a very important step for us the company.</p>
          <p>Let's talk a little bit about our tax here. I think of course costs is a very important issue for everybody. And we are work-we had been working hard to reduce or to keep the cost under control. I think the worst part of the inflation-the cost inflation that we faced I think is, is part of the past right now; of course, we need to pay attention to what's going to happen in the future. But I think today, we are much more prepared and this part of the homework to reduce costs, I think we have already done. Of course, always we have more space, more room to improve and we are working to improve all our operation.</p>
          <p>In terms of performance, our first quarter was good, but not very good because we have a as Martins mentioned several issues in our operations and in the second quarter of '08, I think we overcome this part of those issues, so the second quarter was better than the first one, but it wasn't really an excellent performance. I feel that in the third quarter, we are going to have our normal, let's say, speed and normal performance in terms of operations. I am very optimist that we are going to have a very good and very strong second part of the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of marketing, the market is still very strong, is very good. What we need to do is to delivery our production. Our clients, they need that, they are count on us to deliver everything that we have promised and we have in terms of contract, I think we will be able to do that without any problem. Of course, everybody today is concerned about the slowdown in the economy, the market economy, the world et cetera, et cetera. I think this is a reasonable question due to the problems that we saw and it's happening right now in the United States mainly in the financial area that is spreading out of the consequences of these financial crises or these credit crunch in the United States.</p>
          <p>But what I can tell you is that we are not scared-or we are not feeling any big movement in the market. Of course, if we are not honest today-China is on vacation, Europe is on vacation. China is going to be back to business in more 30 days. So, we are going to face the economy recovering again in the normal speed. Europe, I think the consequences of the crisis is there are some countries that are feeling that, but I think it is not really dramatic. But here in Latin America, the Latin America is growing and we have a big part of our market here in Latin America.</p>
          <p>So, certainly, I'm not pessimist about the near future, and I'm optimist about the long-term or the medium-term market for our sector. So, what we needed to do right now, is to concentrate to analyze other opportunities that we have, opportunities to grow and we are deeply analyzing each possible project that we can develop and I can tell you that we have a huge pipeline of projects that we are right now implementing. But we have new ones that we are finalizing the feasibility studies and I think soon we are going to announce a new project, new organic growth. As I have been mention to you that we have of course two-three areas that we would like to grow or to increase our presence in the market. Of course, magnesium and iron ores, we will always working to strengthen our leader position in the market, but copper and coal, mainly coking coal, these are the two main focus to-because we feel that we have a room to grow with a higher speed and that's what we are looking for.</p>
          <p>What I am saying with higher speed is that we clearly and you must understand that we need every day to make an exercise to balance as to see or try to figure out, which is better for us, is organic growth or acquisition? This is part of our day by day business, our day by day job, so that's what we have been doing and we are continuing to do that, analyze.</p>
          <p>The return that we will be able to get from the organic growth, as a return that we will be able to get from any possible acquisition. To be clear, and better objective we are not considering to make any major movement or major acquisition, this is a possibility, but is not probable. What we are looking for is may be generalize some small acquisitions to speed up our pipeline of projects and to make more consistent our organic growth. This is our main strategy right now.</p>
          <p>What I can tell you that up to now, we have been analyzing several projects, several resources, several reserves, several new possibilities of investment and I feel that the organic growth seems to be more adequate for us to push ahead our investments. So I think the main question that everybody has in mind is what we are going to do with the money that we raised recently?</p>
          <p>First of all, I would like to say thank you very much for the shareholder support, and today we finalize the transaction last week, probably about more ahead of a very, very strong cash right now and he need to be responsible, he need to take care of it and he is doing a very good job to hold the money in cash. But the point is today we have all the options open for value, all the options. If there is some opportunity or something that we wanted to take advantage of the momentum, we can jump, immediately, immediately to speed up this organic growth or maybe just acquire some small, medium size operations that can strengthen our position in the market. So again, and we have been saying that and we are very-we are well disciplined and we are continuing to go very disciplined on this.</p>
          <p>The name of the game for us is return, profitability and good assets. That's what we are looking for. This is our obligation, this is our duty to be sure that everything that we are going to develop or everything that we are going to do respect with value creation, respect profitability, respect very good assets. We are not going to make any movement just to be big. We want to be big, but we want to be a great company. We want to have excellence in terms of operational standards and asset quality. So, very soon, maybe in one or two months we are going to finalize our studies, our internal studies and we are convey our clear strategies is to you all.</p>
          <p>I'm very optimist that we are in the right track. We have a lot of work to do internally and we are doing that. We need to be very focused in the investment because it's a huge investment and we are of course developing a very strong and very open and transparent relationship with our suppliers, and with our construction company that is working with us. We needed to extract from that the best thing synergies among all the process that we are developing here in Brazil, and outside of Brazil and Phil I think is going to give us a very good answer or is going to give us a very good delivery in those projects.</p>
          <p>Another point is that today, &#x2013; for me as a CEO is a point of concern is the relationship with the stakeholders. Of course, environmental discipline and concern about how to develop the new projects, respecting the environment and doing everything to minimize the interference or the effect-the environment, this is part of our concern and I'm very, very disciplined and this is one of my priorities.</p>
          <p>Another thing that is very important, the current environment that we are going through is the relationship with communities, with the government that is becoming every day much more sensitive worldwide. This is an unusual for all the big natural resource companies in the world and I can tell you, I think Vale's is very well positioned in this kind of environment.</p>
          <p>First, because we understand very well a complex environment. You know that Brazil to survive, is not-to survive in fact wasn't really a easy task. Today is much better. But even though we learnt a lot and we can view, we can manage tough or complex situations very well.</p>
          <p>I think an example was this New Caledonia, the border project. I think right now is smooth. The relationship with the community, with the government, with the workers there, the relationship in Indonesia is going very well. In Africa and other countries that we are present, we are developing a very strong relationship with the community, the government, et cetera. And here in Brazil, you know that we are a very important company and we-this is our home and we understand very well the environment in here, here we are doing well.</p>
          <p>So now I would like be open for question or any &#x2013; offered the Executive Director is here at your disposal to answer any questions. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Felipe Hirai from Merrill Lynch.</p>
          <p>Q &#x2013; Felipe Hirai&gt;: Hi, good morning everyone. I have two questions, the first one is regarding potential acquisition. So, we are seeing that there is major sell-off in the stock market currently and some of your competitors, they are using this sell-off as an opportunity to make acquisitions. So, how do you see this sell-off? Isn't it one of these opportunities Roger, that you mentioned that could arise and eventually could go out and make some acquisitions. And also if you could comment also on the-as of now your-after your upgrade to BBB+, how is the current situation of the credit market for you? And what's the potential impact on cost?</p>
          <p>And as just my second question is regarding iron ore prices, we saw some kind of a softness in the iron ore spot price over the last few weeks. So, if you comment a little bit on the main reasons why you think that happened? And if you see if there is any possibility that the iron ore prices could go down in 2009 rather than going up? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Felipe. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very well. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of iron ore price we don't have any-we don't see any room for price decrease. If there is a room, is for price increase. Due to the current situation of the market we don't need to see the market to be more-to be stronger, to give us the ability to deal with-to discuss with our clients a price increase. So for me the trend is upwards. It's not downwards. At least let's say a small price increase but the trend is upward.</p>
          <p>The first question that you made about the M&amp;A or acquisition successor, Felipe, we will be very disciplined. We don't want to acquire to-invest just to invest. As you know we had been negotiating some very important offers that we believe that could be good for us and fit very well to our strategy. All of those discussion is part of the past.</p>
          <p>So, as you know, outcome for us could be a very nice movement. But we will think about it. Great, good done-good deal for them. We analyze Extracta, Extracta right now is just announced they wanted to buy or to acquire Platinum company which is not in our strategic, let's say core. Of course there are other opportunities in the market that we analyzing. As you know maybe and probably the number of M&amp;As or the number of acquisitions maybe is going to rise a little bit, I think the market is very excited, the market is very strong. But with the capital increase that we just finished, I think we one objective, one goal I think we achieved, this integration. That is going to help us to reduce our cost of capital to-for our investments or any possible or not possible, probable movement towards an acquisition.</p>
          <p>The second one is to gain flexibility to be ready for a very possible number of opportunities that may appear in the market. So I think we are right now in a position that again is a very strong and very good position to be, with money and cash process to be developed and of course the market right now is going in our favor. Why is that? Because the number of buyers are reduced, they are reduced by the current present crash. So again these give strength our position to be a very important player in any market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Okay. If I can just clarify one point here, I thought that during your speech &#x2013; during the call you mentioned that acquisitions were possible, but not probable. But I have the impression that now you've said that acquisitions are probable. So could you just clarify to me that point please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>Excuse me, our next question comes from Mr. Roger Downey from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Good afternoon to those on the other side of the world. I'd like to focus on the market issues that we've been discussed. But I think it's one of the most important &#x2013; I think misunderstandings today. And perhaps Martins maybe, could you elaborate little bit more on the qualitative aspects of the market today? In other words, there maybe even some slack in low-grade material. But certainly not in high-grade material and just some more views on that.</p>
          <p>And maybe even if you could elaborate more the value and use. What sort of value and use does the high-grade products that you guys have, what sort of advantage do you get from that? And if that is &#x2013; would be a starting point in the forth coming negotiations. In other words would you be starting from a point where your value in the use, the differential, sustains a higher price in Asia?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on a more quantitative aspect to supply and demand of iron ore going forward. We &#x2013; you guys pointed out some difficulties in bringing on new projects. Projects in West Africa and your own as well I think in the press release, there was a comment that Caraj&#xE1;s brownfield expansions, we're not even talking about Hasuja yet. We're talking about brownfield expansion 230 could be delayed. So that's necessarily less tonnes in 2009, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You made a lot of questions Roger. The first one is about the qualitative aspects of there are iron ore markets, okay. So if you look at this highly in the spot market in China it's clear that this high price in the spot of market in China attracted a lot iron ore. A lot of &#x2013; I will say not iron ore but lot of iron units, okay. So a lot of iron ore was brought to the market for sure. But many parts of them are not can be called real good iron ore for iron making. So the only way to use this iron ore is to mix it with high quality iron ore, otherwise you have a very low productivity, you have a very high consumption of coke energy and results at the end of the day the cost of this iron ore can be higher.</p>
          <p>So it is very interesting to note that nowadays that the highest price possible &#x2013; the highest price for iron ore in this spot market is China is for Caraj&#xE1;s ore, so they're paying almost $40 above the normal iron ore for Caraj&#xE1;s in the spot market in China.</p>
          <p>So and we have some of our customers that they can be all reserved to them because we don't operate in the spot market and they take our ore and they resell in the spot. So this is a big demonstration of the valuing of Caraj&#xE1;s. And when you look going forward, the quality of the project that we developed not only in Australia but then even in Brazil, everywhere, all of them are not high quality ore, which means the hidden value of Caraj&#xE1;s is increasing.</p>
          <p>Our task going forward, now talking a little bit about the next price negotiation, is to bring this hidden value to our company to our shareholders. Historically, Australian ore was sold with a discount because of the logistics, they are closer to Asia. And Brazilian ore was sold with a discount because of the higher quality that was not charged. So it seems that now the Australians are looking for this freight advantage, and we are looking for the quality advantage of our ore. So that will probably in the next round of price negotiations, we will drive the players in that direction. And we are very confident that not only Caraj&#xE1;s ore but even Southern System ore, we have very high quality in the Southern System, that we can better price in such a market. So, as far as the quality of the market and also the transport price negotiations, I think it's clear that things will go in that way.</p>
          <p>As far as the Caraj&#xE1;s spent 130, is sure that we have some difficulty in developing &#x2013; to get to the permits and the approval. But on the other hand, we speed up all of the things that we have to speed up, so we procure all the equipment that we'll need for this project and we made a lot of changes in our project in order to get this additional 130 million tonnes available by end of 2009. So we are sure we had some difficulties in this permit, but we are doing all the measures to offset any delays that we got relating to that.</p>
          <p>Quantity wise, what we see is no big impact of this sort of prime situation in the market. For sure, there will be some adjustments and as you look China now, for two or three months, they will reduce, a lot of the blast furnaces were shut down during this period. So this period there will not be so high consumption of iron ore. But all the basic information of that we get, all the economical information we get from China are very positive and their projects are going on, their investments in infrastructure is going on, a lot of projects being developed all over the country. We have now 130 million tons of new steel production being constructed in China that we will enter in operation in the next 2 or 3 years and many other projects are on stream to be announced very soon.</p>
          <p>So, we do not see any big problem in China besides these adjustments because everybody has to convey it. Last year, we sold iron ore almost 40% below the spot price in China on a delivered basis. So this market was really very strong and now such accommodation is coming. But our price today is even below what the price it will be. We have some movements in this spot market in China, but only today freight rate to China went down $10. So I think any kind of decline in the spot price in China will be followed by the freight rates also, and at the end of today, we continue to have a space for further price increase on a FOB basis. I'm talking about the normal ore, not talking about the high quality ore that we have, that surely we will price better in the next pricing negotiation.</p>
          <p>So we are not concerned about the market and we are not concerned about the volumes that we are going to deliver, although we are facing a lot of difficulties these days, I think it was a stress at this point. A lot of bottlenecks in equipment, in supplier, in engineering, and everybody is struggling. All the big miners companies are struggling in these aspects and are facing difficulties. You can imagine the newcomers, okay because we have a long tradition with suppliers and we have a kind of preference when we negotiate with them. So, all of these new projects are facing a lot of difficulties, and I would say much bigger than ours.</p>
          <p>We can talk a little bit about one project in Brazil, that everything is there, and it's not delivering, okay. If you look to the figures, they are not delivering and they have the railway, they have the port, they have their mines, they have their sea and they are not delivering the volumes. So, that means the difficulties that the newcomer can face when going to the market for equipment, for engineering and for supply. So this is also affecting everybody in the industry, but much more &#x2013; in a more extensive way the newcomers. So we are continues to be on the bullish side in the iron ore market in the met coal market and in the manganese market because we believe that the steel industry will continue to grow.</p>
          <p>In the western world of today, if you look at the Americas only, we have near 40 million tons of steel that's been imported from Asia. We are sending near 200 million tons of iron ore to Asia and part of this come back to the Americas to supply local steel consumption. So there is a lot of opportunity also for increasing steel production in the Americas not only talking about Brazil, but also about States. We nowadays see some movement in the States to develop steel production on a blast furnace BOS base. So I think there is a lot of good news in the market and not talking about China that in our most pessimistic case, will continue to grow around 6 or 7% per year fostering investment in infrastructure and the steel consumption.</p>
          <p>So we continue to work very hard and our main problem nowadays is to deliver the projects that we have, to deliver the iron ore that the customers are buying and to control the cost; that are our main tasks nowadays. And we struggle everyday in these aspect. How to deliver our project sooner, how to deliver more to our customers and how to control our cost in such environments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Roger, I would like to add to that in terms of investment, invest, opening new mines, I think value was in the very beginning of the cycle, so before a lot of people. And we have been facing a lot of problems and headaches to divest all those or to delivery all those projects. And there have to date a lot of new projects in the market. Everybody's saying that they are going to delivery X billion tonnes by 2010, 2011, 2012, et cetera, et cetera. I should say that this is possible that all the projects will deliver everything that they are promising but I can tell you, is not probable that they are going to delivery everything that they have promised.</p>

          <p>Excuse me; our next question comes from Mr. Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen and congratulations on solid results. My question is just maybe taking things down to micro level within the company itself, quoting that on figure 8 of your presentation that you just delivered two major iron projects, Samarco III and Fazend&#xE3;o. Top line that should probably contribute about 22 million tons of iron ore to your second half results. I just wanted to understand when are we going to start seeing the contribution of those volumes? And based on first half trends or through the second quarter does look you're annualizing closer right now to 313 million tons that's versus your 325 guidance. So, I just wanted to understand if you really believe that these projects will kick-in in the second half and allow you to meet your guidance; that's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one is to talk about the Samarco pelletizing plant expansion. It's now in operation. But there was a delay in the project, not only in the pelletizing plant, but mainly in the concentration plant. And in some extent, this project is linked with the Fazend&#xE3;o project. Because Fazend&#xE3;o project was developed to supply run-off mining for the Samarco concentration plant. So, they are both linked. So if you are not getting the impact of this in our results at this point in time is because of the project and it is delayed. Now, the pelletizing plant is operating in almost full capacity. But we continue to have some difficulties to operate the concentration plant full capacity. So, we need both operating full capacity to have the real results. But I think that &#x2013; it's sure that in the second half, we are going to get to the impact of the Fazend&#xE3;o and Samarco project in our results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Referring to this year production, a lot going on. As we faced some problems in the logistics system as I told you in my speech, we reduced our production, because does not make sense to mine and to keep big inventories in the mine, if you are not able to shift. So the shipments we lost in the first half we are going also to lose in introduction, because we didn't mine this volume. We kept there and we only mine what we can ship. That is the idea, it is the kind of pipeline from the mine to the port. So if you dig, you ship from the railway to ship from the port. And you always avoid to produce more in the mine if you are not able to ship in the railway or to ship in the port.</p>
          <p>So the situation big volume now almost 5 million tons production because of this. But on the good side, I can tell you that if you can get a better performance in the logistic system, we can ship even more, because we have a big inventory in the mine it's near 20 million tons that are there.</p>
          <p>If you can get a better performance and it's really going on very well the performance in the logistics system is improving. So we have a good space to deliver more. And I think at the end of the day, what is more important is how you deliver, than how much you produce. Long-term things have to be the same, but in the short-term, it's more important to deliver than to produce. The best place to &#x2013; we have a saying in the mine industry, which means that the best place to where to keep inventory is in situ which is in the mining, in the mining itself. So you don't mine. If you don't can ship, you don't mine.</p>
          <p>&lt; Q &#x2013; Jorge Beristain&gt;: But Martins, I think we are running to-date at 330 million tons for the year only, July and August.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>July and August, you know because they are just, third quarter is the best quarter normally, because it's dry. And you have one day more. But considering the July number, we want a above 28 million ton shipment, domestic market and exports. So, we are running now above our targets, okay? In a monthly base, we are running more than our targets. But we needed to keep it, cannot take only one month as a reference. July was very good, August is going very well and probably will be very good also. So, we are now operating the logistics system is prepared to ship to now more than 350 million tons.</p>
          <p>So, if you don't have any kind of disturbance in the system, and the landless and think that normally happened, some equipment, this is the normal in the business, okay? We are in a very good position to increase our shipments. We have the iron ore and we have the logistic system in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And sorry, my second question, and you answered that actually was partially on the inventory situation, so it does sound like you have as you've said once you open up the logistics bottleneck have the ability to sell more. But my other question was how is this new production going to affect your unit cost per ton profile? I mean this has been the trend, we've now seen for several years every quarter year-on-year, quarter-on-quarter. This incessant increase in unit costs. At what point do you see this new production coming in at lower costs, and helping turn the tide and stabilizing your unit production costs? Could you sort of quantify what a Samarco &#x2013; or sorry, a Fazend&#xE3;o would be contributing in terms of unit costs versus your $25 average, so we can get an idea as you bleed more your new production into your overall mix what we can expect to see in costs for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fazend&#xE3;o is, because Fazend&#xE3;o is a runoff mine project, okay? We don't sell processed ore we sell what we get from the mining site. So, it's a very low cost operation, but cannot be considered as a reference for the whole thing. For instance, happily speaking Rukutu production for instance is running near 40% below the average cost of the southern system, sub-basis systems. Rukutu is a new mine. And in Carajas area, this new project that we are developing that expect to enter in operation by end of 2009. The cost of this project will be near 50% below the average cost.</p>
          <p>The requirement is when you produce &#x2013; in mining, when you produce more in the same mine, normally the margin of cost is higher. So in order to curb this cost structure, we really needed to bring in operation, huge amount of new mines that will drive the average cost down. So I think that absolutely will be a very important project in this regard. Serales which is another project in the Carajas area and they will greenfield the project, will be very important in this aspect because new mines can really drive cost down. If you're taking more from old mines, you don't have such impact. Normally when you take more from old mines your cost goes up and not down. So, that's the situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And again, Jorge, just to complement, it's important to bear in mind that margins are up, despite the recent cost pressures. And we managed to keep them under control. And reality is that we managed to increase margins even in this very challenging environment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning gentlemen. I have two questions, the first one is relating to &#x2013; regarding the organic growth. Is there any update on your 59 billion budget given what has happened with currency and with the sharp increases in steel prices? And is there any way that you can accelerate your growth rate and household, that would be my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Carlos, thank very much. No, we haven't reviewed it &#x2013; the figures for the 59 billion, as I've just mentioned. We are reviewing this element, but also the scope of the pipeline of projects with the idea of increasing the scope of what we present to the market now. So what you should expect as our next announcement as I've indicated in the next one or two months, is a reviewed CapEx figure that will encompass an update on the currency effect but also a major adjustment of the scope and production target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And my second question, Fabio is related to the prices for iron ore and coal. Iron ore, what was the reason that you couldn't implement all the price increase as per the latest negotiations in the second quarter? And then on coking coal, realized price came a little bit below what we were expecting, so maybe that is in relation to the product mix that you have, if can give us some information, I would really appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos this is normal delay in discussing with our clients the terms of all contracts and this is an important point that you made. We have the adjustment already in our screen, let's say, but it was not accounted for as we didn't sign the formal adjustment with our client. It is a matter of time and we hope to see them reflected sooner rather than later, consider that's $553 million for iron ore and some $80 million for coke.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have two part question. What is like &#x2013; what was the available liquidity at June '08 and second, are there any funding needs this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have concluded the operation at the offering and we had a very strong position by the end of June 2008, so we are very comfortable liquidity wise. We find that's suits correctly what you asked. So we have no intention to go to the market at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're free to go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And like how much of your 59 billion CapEx program you intend to fund, like what is the debt equity mix you are looking for, or is it entire internal accrual?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we have the bulk of our CapEx program will be financed as raw cash flow and as we commented before, we are reviewing the scope and volume of CapEx that we are going to present very soon to the market and considering what we are studying, we believe that the bulk of the funding will come from cash growth plus the recent excavation that we concluded. And as a reference we would like always to work with a low leverage in our balance sheet, this is a concept that we will adjust according to specific market circumstances.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Marcelo Brisac from Ita&#xFA; Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good afternoon. Just a quick clarification on nickel. I believe your guidance was for 8% growth in nickel production. However, if I look at the nickel sales in the first half of the year they're actually down 4%. I understand there is a difference between production and sales, because your excess sales third party nickel so that may account for the difference. So I guess it is two questions here. First one, why are you reducing third party sales? I mean okay, you have production, but why you are still not selling third party. Is it not worth doing that any more or why are you stopping that? And second, if you could give a guidance for your total nickel sales for 2008? I would really appreciate. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oliveira, will take that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the main reason about the numbers that you have mentioned because we have already started in Dalian is important utility in nickel. But we needed to build the inventories. And we are working related to the full production for the year. We are work absolutely in line with the budget.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And why are you reducing the third party in nickel sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that is one specific issue mainly in Canada that we are working in Sudbury, we needed to be well aligned with the demand of our customer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I can expect in the full year you still sell 325,000 tons of nickel which was your original guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again we are working absolutely in line with the budget.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But Marcelo, this is Roger, of course we are looking at the &#x2013; we are looking at the markets right now. And we are not going to force sales, for example in the fuel area. So, we are going to be very disciplined because there are some rational out there &#x2013; and there are some level that we needed to respect. So, we are not really going out there to beat all the records in terms of nickel sales. What we want to do &#x2013; to have is profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, in that case and as you said the best inventory is capture the brownfield. In that case you could eventually kind of miss your production target that we have delivered just slowing our production up to over-supply the market, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
