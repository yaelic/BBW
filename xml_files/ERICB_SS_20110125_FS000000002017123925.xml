          <p>Thank you, Operator. Hello everyone and welcome to our call today where we will comment on our fourth quarter results. With me here today I have Hans Vestberg, who is our President and CEO; Jan Frykhammar, Chief Financial Officer, and also John Wibergh, who is now heading up our Business Unit Networks. First of all, I must remind you that during the call today, we will be making forward looking statements. These statements are based on our current expectations and certain planning assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties. The actual results may therefore differ materially due to factors mentioned in today's press release and discussed in this call today. I also encourage you to read about the risks and uncertainties in the earnings report as well as in our annual report. With this sentiment, I would like to hand over to Hans Vestberg for comments on our performance and plans going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, &#xC5;se. I know that some of you have attended the press conference in the morning, so I will be a little bit briefer. But let me start with the Q4 end summary. The sales ended up at SEK 62.8 billion in the fourth quarter, meaning a growth of 7% if you exclude acquisitions and adjusted for currency, which is of course, given how we view the year. In retrospective, it was quite good. We had started 2010 with negative growth in the first and second quarter and basically we had flat in the third quarter and then we came back. The growth very much focused around mobile broadband. That's where we have seen the growth and you will see later on that our Networks segment was growing 14%.</p>
          <p>The net income up 4.2, SEK 4.4 billion, compared to only 3.7 last year in the fourth quarter. Three components: one Sony Ericsson of course, quite substantial improvements compared to one year ago. That also is that we have less restructuring, but also on the core Ericsson, we were almost improving SEK 1 billion on operating result on bottom line. So, all these contributed to a stronger fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>On the cash flow side, we &#x2013; on adjusted cash flow operation, cash flow SEK 16.2 billion in the quarter, which was good, a lot of good work, especially on collection. Here we of course always view our cash flow on a yearly basis and we can conclude that our target of having better than a 70% cash conversion was achieved. We achieved 112% cash conversion in 2010.</p>
          <p>A little bit more on details on net sales, you can see that this is one of the all-time high quarters for us. It's only on this graph through Q4 2008 that was higher. I would say that we were a little bit different on currency in that moment as well, but &#x2013; so this is a big quarter for us. Demand for mobile broadband important, but also that China came back on 2G investment, which is important. And of course the 2G expansions in China are also driven from users of data, EDGE and GPRS, et cetera and not only voice.</p>
          <p>If I take the profitability, earnings per share 1.34, 134 net of course an improvement, as well as an improvement of the Q4 and the full year net income. Same explanation as before, on the full year, improved gross margins, improved Sony Ericsson earnings and the core Ericsson improving and then also less restructuring in 2010 compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>The region split, this slide we always use, I can say that the big difference here is that North America is smaller in size, has been around 28%, 29% through the year, but in the fourth quarter ending up on 22%. Not saying that we're not growing North America, we still have 49% growth in the fourth quarter in North America. So, it's more the other regions that are starting to grow. And if you look at the next slide, we had four regions out of 10 now growing. We had &#x2013; during the year, had one region but also that we had all 10 regions sequentially growing, which is also an important measurement.</p>
          <p>If then take a deeper dive in North America, I can conclude that when you look at that bourse, we have established ourselves on a totally different sales level in North America. We're a main supplier to all the major operators. We are selling CDMA, HSPA, LTE, as well as having &#x2013; doing very important breakthroughs in services, and one of them of course being running Sprint's networks, but also others' service business. All in all, you can say that in the fourth quarter, we were awarded to be part of the network evolution strategy of Sprint, which also is important, but clearly, we have established us as the leader in the North American market with all these wins and also acquisitions.</p>
          <p>If you then look at India, India has had a bumpy ride year, starting with delays on 3G auctions, which halted the investments, and then the security concerns that have been ongoing, which also impacted us in the first half. In the second half, we have been starting gradually to increase our sales there, basically because of the 3G and also that the security clearance has been there so we could deliver. But still we are on the lower level and if you see here, we are, for full year, down 43% and year over year down 17%. Sequentially we're growing 34%, very much on the 3G expansions.</p>
          <p>China and Northeast Asia had a good fourth quarter, growing 28%. Still, this region was flat and I would say China was one important contributor on 2G, Japan on 3G and mobile broadband very important. And then, finally, we added LG-Ericsson in this sum as well.</p>
          <p>That was a quick snapshot on the regions and overall, and I will ask Johan Wibergh to comment on networks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Q4 was a good quarter for the Network segment. Growth came up to 14% and driven very much by mobile broadband. The main thing &#x2013; just to clarify, when we say mobile broadband, it includes such products as Access, or radio base products. It's the back core solutions such as microwave and other solutions and packet core and IT outlets . And this is both organic growth in the existing business that we've had, as well as the acquired Nortel assets.</p>
          <p>Voice business, the voice core, et cetera, continued to be slow, however as Hans already said then, 2G sales were strong in China during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Supply has been a challenge for us during 2010. and it started then to normalize in Q4 and production achieved very high volumes. So that was extremely good for us. However then, we are still not fully meeting the increased demand of certain mobile broadband products or they are now running with high &#x2013; long lead times due to strong order intake.</p>
          <p>Looking on margins then, and of course we had a positive volume effect on the total &#x2013; it was strong net sales in the quarter, but of course, it's offset then by more project business, the rollout projects, as such as 3G in India and also some of the modernization projects that are starting up. So I mean overall, vector growth, is really good and strong momentum and continued work then with margins going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Johan. On the global services, we ended the year by growing professional services with some 5% year over year in local currency. Managed shares of course continued to grow, even though a little bit slower pace with a tougher comparison. Important here I think is outlining 54 new contracts here in 2010, half of them renewers and half of them new contracts.</p>
          <p>Network roll-out is still in decline and this is the delay from I would say infrastructure sales. That means we are all lagging one to two quarters all the time when it comes to delivery of infrastructure until it gets installation. So it's very much related to our own product deliveries. But we can also conclude that the margin has hold up very well and actually improved on the whole Global Services in 2010, up at 13% which is a great achievement and Professional Services has held up their margins in that range.</p>
          <p>Multimedia, we have had during the year Multimedia challenged on volume, especially revenue management in the areas of Africa, Middle East and Southeast Asia. We saw a recovery on Multimedia in the fourth quarter, adding up to growth of 3% and that also made that the profitability went up quite considerably during a profitability of 16% on EBITA level in the fourth quarter. And the TV business still doing well.</p>
          <p>Our joint ventures reported earlier this week. We can say on Sony Ericsson there are now four consecutive quarters of profit. That's, of course, after very hard work and they have a good platform for the Android phones. And as the Ericsson all continue to merge together their products and of course, creating new products for the customers, but also delivering on the old legacy products. There we still have losses and we are continue our cost savings and the company's in transitions to get that portfolio out. All in all, our JV earnings improved quite considerably even though it was a reduction of loss. So, it was a considerable change.</p>
          <p>Jan, a little bit on the profitability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Hans and good afternoon to all of you. Let me then focus a bit my comments here on the fourth quarter. If we look at the gross margin, we got &#x2013; we have &#x2013; we delivered some 36.6% gross margin, 37% it says here on the slide. It's an improvement if we compare with last year Q4. The reasons for that improvement is really related to cost reductions which been with us and impacting margin in a positive way throughout the year, but it's also lower portion or share of services in the quarter.</p>
          <p>If we look at some of the sequential impacts, which I think is probably is the area where if we look at your various forecasts, where we have had perhaps the most deviations, this really related to a couple of things. First of all, you know we start to get the catch-up here now on hardware deliveries, which is impacting gross margin. We have had throughout the year a very good business mix when it comes to more of upgrades. Now we are entering into sales of more projects again. Also we have had some impacts with regards to the 3G roll-outs in India and the network modernization projects. So all in all, compared to last year in Q4 an improvement, compared to Q3 a decline for the reasons I've said.</p>
          <p>If we look at operating expense then, the increase compared to last year is mostly &#x2013; or mainly I will say related to our acquired assets. So it's Nortel CDMA. It's Nortel GSM. It's our share of what used to be called LG-Nortel, nowadays, LG-Ericsson. But it's also related more on the SG&amp;A side than related to integration costs for those assets as well as high level of activity around LTE trials. So most of it's acquisitions. Some of it's still related to LTE trials.</p>
          <p>Operating margin, the next slide, I mean we had an improvement year over year in Q4. We delivered some 13.4%. Last year it was 12.7%. Remember also we had some items around gains on divestitures of companies and so forth in Q4. So overall it is an improvement on bottom line. Of course the margin improvement year over year is being offset to a certain degree by operating expense. But still it is an improvement in the operating margins= Q over Q.</p>
          <p>On the net income, I think Hans mentioned all of that. We have seen improvements in the net income for the three reasons that he mentioned. If we go through restructuring charges then, there are a couple of things here that I think it's important to remember. First of all, of course we had charges in the quarter then of 1.7 billion. For the year, restructuring charges amounts to 6.8 billion. We have made cash outlays for restructuring activities of 1 billion in the quarter and 3.3 billion for the full year. That we will then take with us into next year, most of it, I would say, and we will have then a cash outlay of some 3.2 billion on the provisions we have on the balance sheets as we speak.</p>
          <p>Efficiency is something that we have high on the agenda of our company. We have had it for quite a few years, but it's also important of course to stay focused on efficiency. And if you look at our gross margin development as well as operating expense development, you will understand that it's important to continue to work on this in order to safeguard profitability. If we then look at 2011 with regards to restructuring charges, from next year &#x2013; or from this year I should say, we will then start to focus all our reporting, all our discussions and so forth on an income level where restructuring charges is included.</p>
          <p>So what I've done here is that I have given you an estimation of 2 billion for restructuring charges for 2011. It is the areas that is mentioned there, so obviously we have product development and administration. This is the last time I will give you this disclosure. It is for me to be &#x2013; to be clear &#x2013; I mean when you do your forecasting now coming into 2011 to make sure that we get the right margin levels here, from next quarter we will focus on the result including restructuring charges. Okay.</p>
          <p>Let's take the balance sheet ratios. It's a good development of days of sales outstanding. We have had a very good Q4, continued strong focus on collections. It is as well a little bit of advanced payments with regards to some of these new projects. So that's a good way of funding your business. Inventory days came down in the quarter, but still if you look at the decline that we had for instance between Q3 and Q4 in 2009, the decline is not as big. And this is because of higher activity in the business. It's not so much related to the catch-up of supply chains and so forth. Most of it is related to the higher activity level in the business.</p>
          <p>Then looking at the cash, if we look at Q4, next slide, we had a good operating cash flow, 15.2 billion. It came from two sources. One was from the result. Most of it came from result, but also from working capital. You can see there that we have made some investments, both in the traditional CapEx, nothing specific to mention there, but also some acquisitions of smaller companies in the quarter. We also have restructured our loan in the quarter and paid back part of it and prolonged part of it, entering into the better interest rate situation. So, all in all we have net cash of 51.3 billion when we go into 2011.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the full year picture and we just want to highlight here that we focus the cash flow discussions on full year. We have discussed that in Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4, we focus on full year cash flow here.</p>
          <p>Okay, Hans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Jan. Just quickly on the summary with 2010, you can say that there has been different challenges and opportunities here in 2010. On the good side of course are continuous wins on LTE, mobile broadband and in service arena. That's been important for us to create a strong platform. We also need to conclude that the first half of 2010 was tougher due to the economic environment and also the supply chain. But that all in all came together in the fourth quarter then.</p>
          <p>Efficiency, we worked on, we reported. Jan talked about it and we also started the year by doing a lot of changes to our organization in 2010 in order to really be a strong company and see that we leverage the whole full portfolio of Ericsson. Good, the last slide there on the market trend for 2011. I will not dwell on those. I will talk more about them in Barcelona, but as a change from 2010, I think we'd see even more trends around connected devices and affordable smartphones and we'll also see more around mobile Internet and cloud-based services and mobility and machine-to-machine coming in the trends. But that's the trends that we believe are important for the industry in 2011, but let's see how it turns out and we will elaborate more on them next time we talk.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And then we are happy to open the Q &amp; A session.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Please hold while we're queuing for questions. Rod Hall from JP Morgan is now on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Thank you for taking my question. I just got a couple quick ones, one I guess for Jan. Jan, you talk about restructuring the 2 billion for 2011I, but then &#x2013; it would be a couple of questions, I guess. One is by including it in the P &amp; L without breaking it out, are you telling us that you see that now as just a kind of normal course of business charge as opposed to something that is abnormal in your business? And should we expect restructuring to kind of recur every year now as we move forward?</p>
          <p>And my second question is regarding LTE. I wonder if, Hans or Jan, if you guys could comment on what you expect the profitability levels of that to be as it spins up more this year. Is it in line with group average margins or above or below? If you could help us on that, it would be helpful. And then Hans, I'd just generally like to hear your thoughts on how healthy the carrier spending environment is. It feels like it's a little bit better. It's the first time you guys have seen underlying revenue growth now in several quarters, and I'm just wondering how you think the health of the overall spending environment looks in 2011 here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Rod, it's Jan here. Let me start then with the question around restructuring. I think &#x2013; it is for sure so that we gradually during 2011 will start to look at these restructuring charges as part of a normal business procedure. And that is exactly the way we would like you to view these going forward. Whether the level of 2 billion is normal or not, I mean let's come back to that, but I think for now the 2 billion is what we would call normal for 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And we will, of course disclose restructuring -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and Jan -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>in our tables as usual, as you can see it, so, here it's very clear on that. The tables would show it.</p>
          <p>On the LTE, we don't comment on specific margins on the specific areas. But I would say that the most important is the type of projects we're doing, if it's coming into a new footprint in the market shares, of course a little more press. But given that we build now our technologies on the same platform, we should be able to do with them. We have now GSM, WCDMA and the LTE on the same radio based stations. Of course that's an important development as well, but we don't go into specific on LTE, et cetera. But of course the scale is important in all we're doing when it comes to the gross margins.</p>
          <p>On the carrier spending, yeah &#x2013; without being too upbeat on it, but of course if I take 2010 in retro-perspective, of course we see some operators being more sort of focused on the positive, the mobile broadband in the beginning of the year. But we also need to say that we have said all the time that mobile broadband have had the portfolio momentum. It's just that our 2G business has been declining more than we have been growing in mobile broadband. So this quarter we now see that the 2G is coming down more, and less than we're growing in 3G. And we have four regions growing out of ten. We have had one before, so that is the sort of the indications that we have for after 2010. And then we come back and say &#x2013; see what we want to see in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hans, do you see &#x2013; you've got four regions growing. Do you think that that number continues to grow through the years? Did you see evidence that some of the other regions are heading toward growth as we move through the first part of 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't give you any guidance because &#x2013; about the regions, but we saw a sequential growth on all ten of them. We have transformed the organization in order to be able to sell the full portfolio. We have changed the organization to be &#x2013; have stronger regions. And then of course my plan and the executive team that am around me, together with the regions, are of course focused on getting growth and selling the full portfolio. But that is our goal and our ambition. Let's see how it turns out in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Being the accountant here, so one important thing when we think about next year is obviously where we &#x2013; I mean, we end the year with a very strong or fairly strong Swedish kroner, both against dollar and euro and of course that is the starting point for next year's exchange rates. So, think about that as well when you model your 2011, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Janardan Menon from Liberum Capital is now on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question, just a question on your managed services business, where &#x2013; I agree that you had a big base from the Sprint contract and at the end of last year &#x2013; or the end of 2009. But the growth rates have come down quite a bit. So I was just wondering how you see the pipeline of new contracts going forward. And do you see yourself being able to get back to a sort of a double-digit margin growth in the medium term, within this year?</p>
          <p>A second quick question, if I might, is you've attributed the full and gross margins to a certain extent to network modernization projects. I was just wondering whether you're going to elaborate a bit on that. Does that include the RBS 6000 and how do you see those modernization projects evolve over the course of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start and then I will ask Johan Wibergh to talk about what is included in network modernization and what does it mean. On the managed services, yeah, we had smaller growth, or comparable at least, of 5%. Then we also need to understand that we had a tough comparison. We got Sprint into the base in there in 2009 and we have the currency impact with as well. We have no reason &#x2013; or don't feel that this is an important area.</p>
          <p>Operators are looking to efficiency in the networks. We believe firmly that we have the best offering in the industry. I think that's important. And then of course the higher base you get, or recurring business in managed services, the percentage is getting more and more challenging, but that we believe that the market has a good potential growing in managed services and we have a good position. That means that we should be able to follow that. But again, it's getting harder with the percentages given the volume. You want something on network modernization and tell about what is the context of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We started talking about that and because in Europe, there is a fairly big installed base of GSM and 3G base stations that is in need of modernization. I think all overall worldwide there are some 4 million base stations whereof 40% of those GSM base stations would benefit from being modernized. So I mean they &#x2013; especially then in Europe, it's GSM and 3G base stations that are in need of modernization. It's an important rate. Today, we are the market leader in Europe in radio, but we are number two on 3G base stations in Europe and there's an ongoing modernization rate. It's very much then about replacing the existing technology with new modern technology, such as higher performance and less power consumption.</p>
          <p>And of course we have been very successful. We have just announced that all of the orders that we have on have been successful and we have been taking market share in Europe. And that means initially, then the business model we have, which means then that we do investments in footprint and then come back then in profitable add-ons and that's of course what we are targeting here.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. A couple, actually here, first a housekeeping question. You have pointed out component shortages limited you again this quarter, not to the same extent but you couldn't ship everything that you wanted. What impact did it have on revenue? What products were you not able to ship? And was that demand moved over to a competitor, or are customers still waiting pending you getting those components and when you might think that might be.</p>
          <p>And then I have one on revenue mix affecting your margins in Q1. Given that India is growing, U.S. is a little bit lighter than normal, and the competitive environment in India, shouldn't we expect margins to remain suppressed maybe through the beginning, first half of this coming year 2011? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the supply, I can conclude &#x2013; and maybe Johan will want to add something &#x2013; but I can conclude that we've been talking in the first quarter about the component shortage that were impacting in second quarter together with a distribution challenge. Because the volume came up in the third quarter, we still had an impact. What we say right now that the component shortage and the distribution has normalized, but we also acknowledge that for certain product in our mobile broadband portfolio, when it comes to the product there, the demand has also come up. And that has made us having extended lead times, or longer lead times. So I think it's two different problems. So we have sort of normalized the components and the distribution, but we have extended lead time on certain products where we have higher demand. So, I think that is sort of the conclusion of it. I'm not sure if you want to add something, Johan, on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not production. Production is running on such a high level, so it's not really reasonable to discuss then about component shortages. As Hans said then, we have in some products, especially some of the newer products we introduced during the year, demand has been high.</p>
          <p>And when it comes to the question regarding if we have lost market share at the competition or not, it's too early yet to draw conclusions on market share for the full year. Our feeling is &#x2013; my gut feeling would rather be the opposite, that we have gained market share. But as I said, it's too early. Let's see what all everyone reports and how that comes out. But I feel really good about the new portfolio that we introduced during the last year, both in backhaul and on radio base station tests and been received extremely well by customers and we under rate a good order intake.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Johan. And on the business mix for Q1, we don't go into exact reasons on that, but let us reflect on the fourth quarter. Again, we had on a sequential decline, we had, I will say three reasons. One is the seasonality. We historically are coming down on gross margin in the fourth quarter because we are doing more product execution in the product sector. Now there was, Jan mentioned, higher level of hardware sales coming in the fourth quarter. And then of course we initiated the parts of the 3G in India and modernization in Europe. Those are sort of things that, some of them will of course continue into next year &#x2013; into this year. Some of them will not be there. So, I think that yes, we know we're going to have some pressure from this modernization and 3G in India. On the margins we &#x2013; long term it's absolutely right to get the footprint as Johan said. Then of course, we're working with all the mitigating factors we have, but there will be some impacts.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. Hopefully you can hear me okay. So, two questions, one is on your joint ventures. You know, it looks like you burned cash in both of them. You got a healthy cash position still in Sony Ericsson, but STE looks like it went to a negative cash balance or a net cash balance. What's your strategy for, really STE, in terms of providing financial assistance from the parent there going forward?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on India in general. It's obviously fallen pretty dramatically. It's only 5% of your sales now. Do you see that coming back to 10% or better of your sales throughout 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I start with India and then I start with ST Ericsson and then I hand over to Johan. On India of course, yes, we have established ourself on the lower level in India because of the spending. And of course the 3G started, I would say in the fourth quarter, during the fourth quarter, so that was one reason. And then in the first half of 2010, we actually were not able to deliver much due to many reasons, both delays and security.</p>
          <p>Our service business has all the time been good in India, a recurrent business in India, so that is more the infrastructure business. How that will pan out in 2011, we'll wait and see, but we can say that still we have consumer growth, both from subscribers and users of data in India. And that of course will finally conclude into investment. And we have maintained our market share on 3G as well on 2G, so let's see what's happening with our portion of India sales on the totality.</p>
          <p>On the joint ventures, I just want to say then that STE's in the transition, meaning that we're going for a new portfolio that's going to come out due in this year. So far, they have been on the legacy products coming from NXP, STE and Ericsson and that we continue to sell. So this year, we are now coming into that and they are modeling themselves to get to the volumes and the cost structure for that. But the most important is to see that this year that we have the design wins that we already have in order to create a very strong, ship-shape company for this industry. Johan, on the funding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; I mean, so if we look just at Sony Ericsson, I mean part of their cash drain &#x2013; if there is such a word &#x2013; in the quarter has actually been good, because they have repaid expensive loans. So, I think that's one important thing to remember. The other thing is then, if you look at ST Ericsson, as Hans said, they have obviously a challenging quarter in Q4 and if you look there in their report, they also talk a little bit about the outlook for Q1. And we have &#x2013; we are a firm believer and a supporter together with STE on the prospects of ST Ericsson being a leader in the &#x2013; in chipsets for smartphones and so forth. So therefore, parents have extended the support, financial support, for ST Ericsson during the quarter and we will continue to secure that the funding is in place to become a successful leader in this important marketplace.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have a sense of the magnitude of that? I guess, what, they drew down 150 million here. Should we expect maybe another up-pull from there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; I mean, so, let's &#x2013; I'm not going to give you an exact number on the financial support. I think the important thing for you to know for 2011 is that we absolutely support them. When it comes to the fourth quarter, I don't remember exactly how much that they have utilized of the parent company line. This is shared equally then, between STE, Microelectronics and us. But say it's close to &#x2013; it's between $150 to probably $200 million. We &#x2013; Investor relations can probably check the details. Or why don't you ask ST Ericsson IR?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a question on two of the regions if I could, first on the North America market, a lot going on in the US with LTE roll-outs that you're participating in and capacity upgrades. Even despite currency, it looks like a lot less of a sequential movement and it undergrew the rest of the company. So, was there anything going on in Q4 why that growth lagged? And then on China, could you just talk a little bit? It continues to be a market where 2G seems to be carrying the market. How sustainable do you think that is and by definition does that mean that the 3G network side has been a little more disappointing in China? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so let me take them one by one, getting some help from Jan here on currency. On North America on LTE, we can only announce what has been sort of announced. There are two operators that have announced their networks on 4G LTE and we are part of both of them and delivering to those networks. And that of course has been a sizeable volume during 2010. And then we can just rely on the market information as you will have about what we believe about 4G in 2011. So that, we will have to come back on that. We have had a good year with LTE worldwide and of course the North American customers has been very early on LTE and also driving volumes. The other question was around -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just curious, even excluding currency, it looks like maybe around 10% growth sequentially. Normally in a fourth quarter in North America, there's more growth than that. So just curious why you likely lagged the growth, despite all these developments in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we had sequential growth in North America on 9%. Of course we had had all through the year a little bit of spending coming up and down from some operator. There has been some holding back as well for decisions that has been taken in the quarter. So I wouldn't take too much into <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to add to that comment of Hans's. I mean I think when we look at seasonality between different quarters here, I mean North America and the business we mix, we have in North America this year, it varies completely. It's completely different compared to what we have had last year, right? So I mean &#x2013; and I also think that there has been a little bit more of network freezes earlier in Q4 than what we are used to and then &#x2013; that's for Christmas shopping and so forth. But seasonality in North America, it's something &#x2013; it's a completely new business mix for us so it's difficult to say anything about the trend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just China, 2G and 3G?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, China 2G. We saw that coming up. Of course, still the main part of the consumer base, the customer base, in China is on 2G and the growth of the voice and the data is continuing. That doesn't mean that 3G is not important and it's not happening there, but still a huge base of the Chinese subscribers are on 2G. So that's why we saw investment coming up here at the end of the year, but again driven to go on this about data capabilities of the 2G</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think 2G will still be the driver in 2011 rather than the 3G?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it &#x2013; we will see it continue because the consumer base is so big on 2G. It depends of course always on the operators and how fast they want to make sort of a transition to 3G. But that means that all subscribers need also handsets on 3G, et cetera. So I guess the question is it's more relevant probably to the operators there, but actually, you see from the logical point of view how many subscribers there is on 2G and how fast you can move that to 3G directly.</p>

          <p>Thank you. So there had been some debate at the end of last year on whether or not you're going to guide for this year and there is very clearly some expectations amongst investors to get some visibility on rates, with at least some ranges on top line, gross margin. You give some guidance on R &amp; D, it would be great. You have the same on OpEx. So my first question is what have you decided on that front? There is nothing really new in the release today. And my second question is whether there is a change of Chairman at Ericsson. Is that a discussion you're having with your Board at the moment? And how do you &#x2013; shall we expect in February some more guidance for 2011? Thank you.</p>

We continue with the target areas, we have on the focus areas, we have on those but have not decided to do any guidance on them.</p>
          <p>On the Chairman, I think that that's more to discuss with the nomination committee rather than me, and so they would probably come back when they have decided.</p>

          <p>Hans, thank you. Have the European and Asian customers expressed an increasing willingness to move faster to LTE, considering what's happening in the U.S.? And if you guys could, just share some of the feedback from your major customers on their 4G plans for 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will share this question with Johan, but my feeling is if I go back one year, my feeling is that the 3G is going further when it comes to investment. We see 21. We have 42 megabits per second right now in the networks. We want to get to 84 and I'm certain that Johan and his team will go 100. So we've seen actually more potential on the HSPA than we initially believed, at least I. Maybe I wasn't &#x2013; but that's true &#x2013; at the same time with the LTE coming earlier, so I would say we see both of those ends. And finally what's going to decide the speed of it is going to be the chipset and the devices on those technologies. But clearly, the discussion with operators in Europe and Asia is very much around mobile broadband, HSPA, or LTE. That's for sure.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Broadband regularly has a strong momentum worldwide and it's really pushing on. Even though there's a lot of discussion around LTE, I think it is important &#x2013; I mean it is happening in several countries out in the world. It is important to remember that it is still a new technology use. So, there are fewer devices. It is more costly. It's very good for North America, because typically for them, there are higher price levels on devices. It's a big country, unique spectrum bands, et cetera.</p>
          <p>If you look on the worldwide market and the total volume, even though then, as I said LTE is coming, the big growth worldwide on mobile broadband is happening on 3G. That's where you have the big momentum on devices, a huge amount of devices available on even on low cost levels, quite below $100 for Android smartphones. It's built out in so many countries out in the world and that's where you have the big momentum and traction. So LTE is important, but the main growth and the main driver in the business is this 3G expansion, the build-outs.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if we consider the lag between your business and the global GDP and how the economy has recovered, should we plan for all regions for Ericsson to grow year on year in 2011? Or should we think of that more skewed to the back half and into 2012 as a better year than 2011?</p>

          <p>As we said before, we will come back to where we see the regions. I mean we had four out of ten in the fourth quarter. And I would also say that we have had &#x2013; I cannot really say that it's very accurate to see the GDP versus our own business. It had been different in different type of downturns. We had a downturn in the beginning of 2000 that were not interfaced with the GDP. This time we came behind it. So I wouldn't draw any conclusion exact on that, but we will come back during 2011 and see how this region performs. I said before, our focus of course to see that all regions are performing and getting the full leverage also of the portfolio. That's our job as the executive team.</p>

          <p>Thanks. I just want to go back to gross margins again. And when I look at 2011 &#x2013; I'm not asking for guidance, but I see so many negative potential hits on gross margin, whether it's network modernization, the recovery you are seeing in all of your emerging markets and the fact that your provisions levels are just very low versus history, not to mention LTE. You're not doing much restructuring this year, only 2 billion of restructuring charges. So, what are the positives for gross margin from this level, from this 36.6% level in Q4 as we go to 2011? Is it the &#x2013; there could be a European recovery, the geographic mix could turn back? Could you give us some of the more positives that could upset that, please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the provision we have discussed so much. I think that that should reflect the best right now and should not be viewed as a negative or positive. Provisions is reflecting the business risk we have today and I discussed it on the press conference this morning, knock on wood, so far our new products has been going very well in the field and that's a very important metrics for us. And then of course challenging [oh] projects that should sort of be in the base them. We were of course talking about the areas where we have a challenge but it's still coming back to the normal course of business.</p>
          <p>And when we &#x2013; we have not said anything about Multimedia nor services in that context. We are continuing with that. We have an efficiency gain from 2010 that we take with us in the base in 2011. So, we will continue to do everything we can to see that we, as we said before, gradually improve our operating margins and that's our work and we will continue with that. But we just want to highlight the areas which are a little bit different but it's not different from how we operate. This is how we operate. We take the footprint and then we work with the footprint and that's a positive long-term for us. And then we just need to work with the challenge that comes with the short- and medium-term on that. But that we have done before and we have the company behind us of doing that and we'll continue to do so.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It was a good question, because it's good to be thinking in the positive terms from time to time as well. I think that &#x2013; I mean, first of all, when there is higher activity level in the business, it also means that we have more things to work on. And I'm then thinking obviously from a sourcing point of view, from a scale point of view with different businesses and so forth. So that's also important to remember. And remember that we'll have prepared our service delivery machine for better cost structures and so forth going forward. So I think that's an important one to remember as well.</p>
          <p>The other obviously important one is that we have had during the year a good business mix. I mean, the business mix may still continue to be good as a result of the traffic growth in mobile data. So we should just remember that as well.</p>

          <p>And just one to follow up on that, in terms of the gross margin pressure in Q4, which of them was the biggest driver? Was it network modernization or was it India 3G or emerging market opportunity? I'm just trying to understand what really swung things the other way after several quarters of fairly high gross margins versus history.</p>

          <p>I think the most &#x2013; the way we tried to write these comments is that we kind of used &#x2013; tried to use an 80/20 role there, so the things we talk about are the most relevant ones. Yes, we know that. And I think of those three things that we talk about there, I would say that the hardware share there is the most important explanations in the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>Alexandre Peterc from Exane is now on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just would like to understand the supply and demand situation in the industry and of Ericsson in particular. I'd just like to know how you cannot meet the demand for &#x2013; all demand for mobile broadband products. And why are the lead times so long in this particular business and how is this possible when it's generally viewed as a heavily overcapacity industry? Is this Ericsson-specific or industry-wide? Will this at some point give you any pricing power at all? If you could just provide a little bit of clarity, what is going on exactly in terms of supply and demand there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We never said they were extremely long. You said that. I think that we have extended lead times right now because of the demand has gone up quite quickly on certain products in mobile broadband. That happens time to time. We are ramping up as soon as &#x2013; but remember also we are changing the product portfolio at the same time. So that's an important parameter. But I said this is the quickest introduction of a new product that we have done in Ericsson history and so far we have been performing very well from a quality point of view. But we are ramping as soon as we can to see that, especially our customer, getting the product they want in time. So it's more about the timing issue right now to see that we catch up and can do it. But it's a positive thing to know that we have a high demand for certain products in mobile broadband, I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just briefly on the lower provisioning and that's obviously related to the end of the restructuring, would you also detail any other factors that are at play there, geography mix, client mix, the new product RBS 6000 as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll do that. It's Jan here. If I look at &#x2013; first of all, as you said, rightfully said, I mean the restructuring provisions will, during the course of next year, be used and thereby disappear from the balance sheet. And when we then look at the business provisions, I mean, we use obviously a risk matrix where we set aside provisions for projects and so forth. It has to do with the complexity of the project, i.e., the scope, where we do the type of project, what type of service levels we have agreed with the customer, if we have rolled out a project like this before and so forth.</p>
          <p>So, all of those aspects, we look at when we do the provisioning and there is also one important element in this and that is the related quality provisions on products. And we have had very successful introduction of the RBS 6000 and that is good. We have also worked with the quality improvements in our service delivery throughout the year, which is also an important factor when it comes to provisioning. And that goes for the quality of the managed service operation as well as the performance of our projects. So, all of those are important elements.</p>

          <p>Operator, we can take a last question from the audience.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our last question comes from Zahid Hussein from Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi there. Thanks for taking my question, just a couple on managed services, if I may. Where are you seeing the most intense competition, regionally that is? And also how should we think about dividend going forward in 2011? So, obviously you've taken out this year, probably be most of what we're thinking. Is that going to be some way you're going to start returning cash to shareholders? And finally are you going to see further industry consolidation in 2011 and will you be a part of that? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What's the first question? We'll try to keep up with you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Managed Services regional comment. Dividend going forward, industry consolidation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh. Oh, that's fine. So why don't you start with managed services then, Jan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Wow. Good. Thank you. As the former service said, I will do my best to answer that. You know, I think that the team in services have been really successful during 2010. Now we have a true global managed service footprint. We have full-scope managed service contract in most regions. I think we used to talk about the managed service business to be more synergy-driven in mature countries and more competence-driven in more emerging markets. To a certain degree I think that still exists. I think that I would say that this is a very important business model all over the world and that competition is also eager to win a portion of that business and it goes also for global. So I would say that the competition is really a global competition today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And on the dividend, I have nothing more. We have no more to add for that for 2011. The Board concluded and suggest to the annual shareholders meeting then SEK 2.25 per share, which is an increase of 12.5% compared to last year, given of course what we have seen in 2010 on the cash generation and also when they look at 2011. But &#x2013; Jan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think also on the dividend and the related cash position, it is so that having a strong balance sheet is important for us in winning new business. So, it is important from that point of view as well. It's also important when it comes to our rating. So both those factors makes us convinced that being cash-rich is a successful strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the industry consolidation, I think that's hard to predict. We are focused on executing our strategy to continue to be the leaders in this industry. That's the most important for us. Of course we have been benefiting very much on the last consolidation where we acquired Nortel. That has been a very important acquisition for us. So we will look in radio what's happening in the market, but I don't have any ideas about what can happen right now. I didn't have it before actually Nortel went bankrupt, neither. So, we will follow it as a leader in the market. We will see all changes in the landscape, how that impacts us.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Hans, Jan and Johan. Just a short note on the big industry event, the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, we are arranging a press conference targeting the media in the morning February 14, but analysts are of course also most welcome. And on the Tuesday then, February 15, Hans Vestberg will give a keynote as part of the GSMA program. The next IR event then from Ericsson is the first quarter report on April 27 and then we are happy to invite you to a management briefing in New York on May 12 then.</p>
          <p>So with that, we conclude today's earnings call and thank you all very much for listening in and asking questions. Have a good day. Bye bye.</p>
