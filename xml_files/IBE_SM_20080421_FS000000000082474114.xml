          <p>Good morning. Good morning, once again, and thank you for coming to our presentation this morning. Procedure will be as usual. We'll have the questions and answers right at the end. Without going into &#x2013; without further delay, I'd like to give the floor to our next &#x2013; sorry, first speaker.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My presentation is just to give you the highlights of the period for the first quarter of this year, 2008. In general, for the Group, the key driver was the introduction to this group of ScottishPower and the new Iberdrola Renovables, which have increased production by 43% and installed capacity by 37.4%, about 10,000 megawatts; 6,000 of ScottishPower and 4,500 of Iberdrola Renovables.</p>
          <p>Not only from an operating point of view has things changed for this company, but also from a financial perspectives, Renovables will now become about 19% weight yield and EBITDA of about 19%, and ScottishPower just over 25%.</p>
          <p>My apologies for that. This increase in size that we experienced towards the end of the year 2007 has gone hand in hand with our strengthening of our financial, our purchasing power, plus an increase in profits. As we will show you, the EPA &#x2013; the EPS for this first quarter is almost double the EPS we got in the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Operating highlights. We have an output increased by 43.2% vis-&#xE0;-vis the first quarter '07. And this increase in production was 2 million kilowatt-hour from Iberdrola Renovables, 7,000, I've got it from</p>
          <p>ScottishPower, and 2,600 in Latam due to the result of the largest operation of one of our plants in South America. As for distributed &#x2013; energy distributed is up 33%, most of this increase is thanks to ScottishPower, international ScottishPower internal group about 10,000 gigawatts/hour.</p>
          <p>More highlights of the period, from a Group point of view, this slide sends out two clear messages; one that we continue to have a highly diversified generation mix. This is a key driver for value creation within the utility business, electricity business. And secondly, about 40% of our production is emissions-free, either hydraulic energy, wind and nuclear.</p>
          <p>The breakdown per country; at present the electricity business in Spain accounts for less than half of the Group's business, and this trend will continue in the future. It is not likely that we'll be --continue to increase our capacity unless it's renewable.</p>
          <p>Now looking at the deregulated business in Spain and Latam; the first bit of news that I want to share with you is the decrease in output in hydroelectric by almost a third. This decrease in hydro production, are basically three. First of all, the drought, the first quarter &#x2013; I don't have the statistics with me, but it's probably the driest in history. So we &#x2013; production hasn't even reached 2,000 gigawatts per hour, which is less than 30% for year and a half. This drop in hydro has had an impact on Iberdrola Group, more so than in the rest of the industry and therefore is one of the reasons why our production has dropped.</p>
          <p>The second is the planned outages of our coal plants. The average availability was just only 23%. This is the result of plant outages, compulsory outages and investments in desulfurization plants and equipment. And the third reason was to optimize -- of gas contract portfolio.</p>
          <p>Production through our combined cycle is probably double what we attained for the year 2007. That is still half of what we could have achieved. So why is there a decrease in output here? Well, we found more attractive margins for the sale of gas in the national and international markets. In fact, we sold in other markets, 8,000 gigawatts/hours of gas, which would be equivalent to a production in a combined cycle of about 4,000 gigawatts. These sales have given us a clean &#x20AC;24 million margin in this first quarter.</p>
          <p>Another reason or driver for this period is the increase in the fuel prices. Coal; coal's average price is a $139 per ton which is 37% greater compared to first quarter '07. Brent, the average price is the $103 a barrel which is 15% more -- or rather it has increased gas prices by 15% vis-&#xE0;-vis first quarter '07. With these prices, there are many, many gas and coal plants in Spain that can hardly cover the variable costs with prices ranging 60 to &#x20AC;65 per megawatt.</p>
          <p>Pool prices have offset the increase in fuel prices and also the price of CO2 which is &#x20AC;23 a ton. Average for the pool is &#x20AC;75, but I think are about 60% greater than last year's.</p>
          <p>Another &#x2013; third factor of this, the regulated business, is development of forward markets. In the first quarter about 60% of the energy produced by Iberdrola was sold in forward markets. 50% to our retail branch and the other through the other branches. About 1,500 kilowatt-hour for a total of 2,358 megawatts -- kilowatts &#x2013; gigawatts/hour. I think the average was about 56, and the retails I think it was more like &#x20AC;55. And we also have &#x2013; and we've signed sales also for the rest of this year.</p>
          <p>With &#x2013; again with regards to the regulated business to &#x2013; just two comments here. Demand is still on the rise with a moderate increase. Domestically in the first quarter, the demand was 2.4%. This is not terribly representative figure because this is a leap year, and that added a 1% increase. And second because we had Easter holiday in March. In last year, it was in April. So by offsetting these two factors, the first quarter really has an increase in demand equivalent to just over 2.4%.</p>
          <p>Another key point is the publishing of the new remuneration framework, which still has a &#x2013; which still needs of regulatory framework that's already being applied in 2008. And this has represented an increase for Iberdrola about 5 &#x2013; by about 5%. And if we apply that to our figures by the year-end this might represent to our growth above 5.5%, or perhaps in closer to 6%.</p>
          <p>Vis-&#xE0;-vis Renovables, the green energy; two points that I would like to share with you. The first one is the first quarter results for this year. In Q1 2008, Iberdrola has achieved an EBITDA of &#x20AC;356.9 million, which doubles that obtained in the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>The drivers for this growth are two -- have three; the increase in our installed capacity, increase in production and average prices also are up. Increase in production was 67%, of which most of it is accounted for by the assets -- renewable assets of ScottishPower which have contributed 1,100 gigawatts/hour, and for Iberdrola Renovables in year 2007 our increase in output was just slightly greater than 8%.</p>
          <p>The second growth driver of EBITDA was a price. The average price recorded is, Q1 2008 is almost 12% greater, higher than Q1 2007, despite the dollars devaluation by 13% and in GBP evaluation of 8%. In Spain, our price rises are about 30%, vis-&#xE0;-vis less there for two reasons. On the one hand, we have the increased pool prices and an increase in our CO2 emissions, and also the loans prices that we found in the year 2007, where in Q1 '07 prices were actually below &#x20AC;40 gigawatt hour.</p>
          <p>The second point I would like to highlight here for this period and for &#x2013; I think Renovables is the construction, the rate of construction, as you know, the value of Iberdrola Renovables is not based on our short-term results. Renovables value is based on its growth, ability to grow. In the first quarter, we have installed 460 megawatts; 110 in Spain, 248 in United States and 112 in rest of the world. This 460 megawatt represents 23% of our target for 2008, which is 2,000 megawatts. In the first quarter, the new installed capacity generally &#x2013; is generally about 12% for the year. At present, our pace is about double what we have done in previous years. So instead of 12, we were really up to 23% in the full capacity.</p>
          <p>In addition to 31 March, 2008, we had in the pipeline was &#x2013; sorry, that's currently at a construction 1,367 megawatts; 454 in United States, 359 in the UK and a 171 in the rest of world. And we're shortly beginning construction in the second quarter of 640 megawatts, and additional 640 megawatts is our target for this year, which I believe was 2,065 gigawatts &#x2013; sorry, megawatts for this year. We are quite likely to attain &#x2013; achieve this target for the year.</p>
          <p>Now, putting into production new megawatts means that we have reduced our &#x2013; to reduce our total pipeline, so &#x2013; and therefore, may limit our growth in the future to overcome this problem. In the first quarter we've already added to our investment pipeline that we already had a 43,000 megawatts, we've added another 1,227 megawatts. So again, our growth &#x2013; our future growth is guaranteed, in fact greater than last year.</p>
          <p>Two more comments regarding Latam where there has been no &#x2013; nothing new to report. In Mexico one of the &#x2013; a good thing is that we have earned considerable increase in production. As I said about 2,500 gigawatts/hour thanks to the launch of the new plant. And we also have high prices in gas, which doesn't have an impact upon our customers &#x2013; or pass through, that is, our margin, however, in dollars is an increase &#x2013; well that's an increase of 7%, and this has not offset the devaluation of the US dollar, which has been 13%. So in March from Mexico, the business has been slightly negative, of course, from result point of view.</p>
          <p>As for Brazil, the demand for our distribution has grown by 8%. Energy prices have been very high, <mark type="inaudible" /> has had a gross margin, considerable gross margin, and we are now reviewing tariffs in Coelba, Cosern and Guatemala. The rates are being upgraded to the value of the assets that in the last few years we have been introducing to our system and also the value of the operating expenses.</p>
          <p>And lastly, the financial costs or asset remuneration, there has been a considerable decrease in cost of financing in Brazil. So we expect a decrease in rates, which will affect our margin. But we don't believe that will affect our net profit in these parts.</p>
          <p>And that's it. Without further delay, I'd like to give the floor now to Jos&#xE9; Luis del Valle, who will talk to you about the keys &#x2013; the highlights of ScottishPower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Jos&#xE9;. Good morning to all of you. ScottishPower continues to improve its financial operating results across all its branches and activities in generation through the increase in production of about 15.5%, reaching 6.9 terawatts/hour.</p>
          <p>In retail, tariff increases over 14% in electricity and 15% in gas, which took place in February. Networks; thanks to the increase in the value of the assets and the new investments and &#x2013; of the new projects, the new value of the assets are about 3,287 million pounds. And overall, the EBITDA of the company, which excluding the mark-to-market adjustment actually goes 10%, up to 327.2 million pounds.</p>
          <p>Let me give you more details on each of these points, to start with generation. Increased output up to 6.9 terawatts/hour was made it possible; thanks to the greater availability of our production plants and also the margins in the market are profitable with profitable spreads.</p>
          <p>All this was possible despite the fact that our CO2, that our coal plants have been affected by the scheduled shutdowns to conduct environmental investments, mostly in desulfurization assets. But that's been offset also by a greater availability and flexibility of the CC &#x2013; of our CCGT plants, our combined cycle gas plants, which have increased our availability to the market.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, and as you may well know ScottishPower has a pretty balanced situation between production and sales to retail customers. This balance gives the Group a natural hedge between generation and retail power. And therefore these operations also the management team of ScottishPower were capable, continue to decrease the procurement costs of gas and coal to the values at prices lower than current market prices.</p>
          <p>So to summarize for this first quarter in retail and the financial performance of the company have gone up. We have been optimizing our results in generation. And as a result, we've had a very good operating and financial results.</p>
          <p>In retail, there is good financial operating results. Clearly, seen from the results and I mentioned earlier, the increased in the gas rates and electricity rates, which was implemented in February, gas went up by 15%, electricity went up by 14% in order to reflect the increase in generation costs.</p>
          <p>We believe there is also a cost reduction target, reduction by &#x2013; of a 150 million per annum to the year 2010. As of this date, we have attained a cost reduction that annualized is over 30 million.</p>
          <p>In retail, we've also decreased complaints to Energywatch of about 69% year on year, and also domestic &#x2013; debtor days for domestic customers down 10%. So again, we continue with a very good performance and increased return, very much in line with our plant.</p>
          <p>Energy networks; again, we are meeting our target as well as our investment plans. And of course, all this means that we have a better return, more similar or superior to the cost of capital. We have invested about a &#x20AC;100 million for the first quarter, which is about 31% in new growth projects.</p>
          <p>As I said, the regulated asset value increased to 3,287 million pounds. And as I said, we're also managing to lower our costs, thanks to our greater purchasing power, since it now belongs to the Iberdrola Group that increases its purchasing power. And we continue to improve our network performance as you can see on the right hand side by chart, we're also reducing by about 15% the number of network interruptions, when you compare the first quarter of '07 with Q1 '08.</p>
          <p>Now, looking at the company. At the Group, we have implemented a new management model and which has enabled us to focus on synergies, obtaining those synergies and integrate the businesses within the Iberdrola Group.</p>
          <p>Synergies are being delivered based on our targets, and at corporate level they are &#x2013; is what we are obtaining most of these synergies where operations overlap with Iberdrola. These are the controllable costs down &#x2013; controllable costs write-down 7.1 million pounds, in other words 47.4% lower than in Q &#x2013; than Q1 '07.</p>
          <p>We've also achieving lower procurement costs, thanks to that increase in purchasing power that I mentioned. And we also have a future improvement in IT costs, thanks to the investment plan that we have introduced.</p>
          <p>So these synergies can clearly be seen. And if we'll take a look at the development of the staff, including the agencies and external parties compared to the same quarter of last year, this workforce has fallen by 8.2%. And as a result, the overall gross personnel costs, even the capitalized ones, is &#x2013; represent the fall of 10.5%, thanks to all of this. We are reducing by 11.5% in our expenses, as a result of the integration synergies and this has a positive impact on achieving this greater EBITDA, which, as I said at the beginning, has risen by 10% up to 327.2 million pounds in &#x2013; during the period, if we exclude the adjustment mark-to-market impact.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm just going to briefly talk about the situation of the authorization processes of our transaction with Energy East. Updating what, we already said, when we talked about the results for &#x2013; at the beginning of 2007 at that time, we said that we had obtained all of the all federal authorizations for that approval.</p>
          <p>Now, the competition, the Hart-Scott-Rodino, the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, the Exon-Florio authorizations and those of the Federal Energy Commission, the FERC, we have obtained all of these in a record time, I believe.</p>
          <p>We've also obtained authorizations from different states; the Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts. In Massachusetts we didn't need that authorization actually. What is left? What we still need in New York? New York, we said that the objective was to achieve this in the first semester, the first half of 2008. We believe that we still can obtain that authorization within this first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>And now, specifically talking about that situation in New York, we're trying to reach an agreed solution with the technical services of the commission, and we're &#x2013; we've tried to do this on a number of occasions, but it was not possible. So, we had to go to in arbitration situation on the regulation. So, in this proceeding on the 16th to the 20th of March, we expressed our different conditions, as the technical people did in the &#x2013; from the commission.</p>
          <p>On the 11th of April, we presented our reach, and now we have 10 days to respond and make the &#x2013; may have made the different response to what the commission's technical services have stated. We also should mention that the commission's technical services wanted to delay the process due to those speculations, those rumors on corporate on moves regarding Iberdrola. The judge said that it was not justified &#x2013; this delay was not justified, unless there was specific proof that an operation was imminent.</p>
          <p>Therefore, as we all know, that is not the case. Therefore, this situation has been resolved. So we are focusing now on the reach that we need to respond to what the commission has says at the end of the May according to the schedule, the administrative judge will have to make, a recommendation to the commission.</p>
          <p>This is not binding, but it is a very good indication of where things will &#x2013; that things will probably take not in terms of the technical services of the commission, but the commissioners themselves, the commission itself has to take a decision in this connection. There is no calendar set up. They don't have any time limit. But we expect that this will take place in June. But as we said, we don't have any guarantee, because they do not have a deadline. If the decision is favorable and may be conditions are reasonable as we expect, and we do get this authorization in June end, immediately, we will close the transaction.</p>
          <p>Thanks very much for your attention. And now, our Economic Financial Director will take the floor. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jos&#xE9; Luis. As usual, we're going to take a look now at the different aspects -- the most important aspects of the results of 2008 to then analyze in more detail the most relevant areas.</p>
          <p>The net profit has grown by almost a 163% up to &#x20AC;1.2 billion with good operational growth of 64% &#x2013; 64.7% EBITDA for Renovables, which is increase of 111%, and ScottishPower contributed 28.3% of the EBITDA to the group. We should also point out a positive impact given the improved efficiency with net operating expenses below the basic margin.</p>
          <p>Also past evolution of the operational results, we also have the benefit of the divestment of asset, the non-core assets in compliance with the Strategic Plan 2008 &#x2013; 2010. And in this divestment, we talk about the sale of 4% of our participation in Galp, which gave us some capital gain of almost &#x20AC;390 million. Therefore, the results of this first trimester, this first quarter showed strong growth in all areas reach above 60% on the operational level reaching this increase of 163% in terms of net profit.</p>
          <p>If we take a look now at the development of the profit and loss statement -- with the income statement, we see growth in all areas, they go from 5.5% in terms of operating position up to 69.5% in terms of net profit within EBITDA growing by 8.7%. This comparison shows once again the quality of the income statement &#x2013; Iberdrola's income statement.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at the different items. The revenues have grown by 132% up to &#x20AC;6.3 billion with important growth in all the businesses, given the rise in energy prices in 2008, greater activity and the change of the parameter given the entrance of ScottishPower. Sales in Renewable grew by 146%. Energy in Spain grew by 53.4%. ScottishPower contributed &#x20AC;2.2 billion. And in terms of the rest of the businesses in Latin America grew by 39% given the Tamazunchale plant and the gas prices and non-energy by 18.3% given the engineering part of the business.</p>
          <p>So within this environment of rising costs and the parameter our procurement has also risen by 260% up to &#x20AC;3.5 billion. By business procurement of energy grew by 120% given the different production mix and the lower hydro production. And cost by procurement has risen by &#x20AC;74 billion, ScottishPower had 1.4 billion, and Latin America grew by 68% given the greater production of Tamazunchale which entered into operation in 2007 and the rise in the cost of gas. The gross margin grew by 62.3% to &#x20AC;2.5 billion and the energy businesses spend reached 1.23 billion with a growth of 11.5%, both the liberalized with 16.1% and the regulated business with 4.4% show positive growth.</p>
          <p>As responsible for that growth, first of all, we have Renovables with a growth of 109% given the standardization of the back to &#x2013; back on track of the wind power and ScottishPower, that's contributing 25.6%, &#x20AC;653.6 billion. Latin America also grew with a rise of 1.4% to &#x20AC;270 million. Non-energy fell by 2.7% given the fall in the activity of the real estate which is offset by the growth in engineering.</p>
          <p>And to assess the net impact of the emissions rates on the profit and loss statement, we should look at the basic margin, which grows by 68.9%, almost 7 points greater than the growth of the &#x2013; in foreign gross margin. This is because the foreign gross margin that we reflect in our statement only accounts for a negative impact of the emissions rates that were used up which are &#x20AC;154 million. And the basic margins obtained by adding to that gross margin, the positive effect, that &#x20AC;107 billion arising from the fee rates &#x2013; the fee assigned rates and this &#x2013; so this allows for the net effect of these rates in the statement which is negative &#x20AC;47 million.</p>
          <p>And this quarter the net operational cost grew by 58.1% to &#x20AC;694 million and this &#x2013; which is growth by almost 11% below the basic margin. In Iberdrola we have a 7.7% growth to &#x20AC;420 million in a quarter where we've had the updating of the salary, of course, given the collective bargaining agreement in ScottishPower has or was 27% with &#x20AC;185 million.</p>
          <p>Renovables increased by 96% and expenses to &#x20AC;81 million as a result of the growth &#x2013; the expansion of its activity and the different parameter of consolidation due to the inclusion of PPM and the UK Renovables.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of levies that grew very sharply by the &#x20AC;84 million for the detraction &#x2013; for the subtraction, the CO2 rates crawled back. This was in provision of the application in 2008 of Royal Decree 11/2007, and the ministerial order from 16th of November on the subtraction of emission rates. This regulation has been appealed, as you know. We do consider, however, that this possible subtraction of rights is an obligation as a callback &#x2013; an additional callback, ScottishPower contributes &#x20AC;23 million to that levy.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated EBITDA grew by 64.7%, reaching &#x20AC;1.79 billion. Energy business in Spain is 630 million with a growth of 4.2%, which will be 18% if we excluded that 84 million that we mentioned, due to this rate subtraction that we talked about before. As we said during &#x2013; as we mentioned during this presentation, both, ScottishPower and Renovables are the main drivers behind the EBITDA growth of the group. And Renovables more than double its contribution to 337.9 million.</p>
          <p>Latin America moderates its growth by &#x2013; at 4.9% in a year, where as Jos&#xE9; Luis mentioned we are foreseeing tariff changes and the weakness of the dollar that's affecting business in Mexico. Energy is falls by 14.8% affected by the decreased activity in real estate. The informed EBITDA has different impacts which are offset by one another, both of these effects are due to ScottishPower and Renovables both in the United States and in the UK.</p>
          <p>The effect on the exchange rate is almost &#x20AC;58 million less than it would have been one year ago. And the effect of mark-to-market is 52 million more in net terms. So, the EBITDA, excluding those two terms, would be 1.79 billion with a growth of just over 65%.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of the group grew by 65.8%, reaching &#x20AC;1.318 billion, very much in line with the development in EBITDA. We have 61.2% growth with 52% accounted for by the partners in Iberdrola Renovables. This is due to the growth of D&amp;A in 63.7%, and D&amp;A from ScottishPower are &#x20AC;127 million and arrives from both the acquisition of the assets of the company as well as the D&amp;A of the overpricing of the assets, the PPA which accounts for &#x20AC;61 million of which Renovables contributes 21 million. The provision &#x2013; procurement goes to &#x20AC;7 million.</p>
          <p>The financial results of the group rose by 38.1% to &#x20AC;225.8 billion. This is a growth that is less than the average debt over the period which grew by more than 50%, close to &#x20AC;21 billion. Thanks to the positive impact from the hedging. As we mentioned, Iberdrola has hedged the exchange rate of the pound during 2008.</p>
          <p>The average cost of the debt is to 4.7 to 5.1% due to the incorporation of the pound &#x2013; the impact in pound and the tax equity investors and the interest rates &#x2013; interbank interest rates of the euro, our main currency.</p>
          <p>The income before tax rose by 150%. And the EBIT &#x2013; and the financial result, we have to add the impact of &#x20AC;536 million, which are non-recurring, deriving, first of all, from the capital gains of &#x20AC;386 million obtained through the sale 4% of our participation in Galp and the adjustment, when committed, to the participation package of BBVA; that was &#x20AC;112 million and the capital gain of almost &#x20AC;37 million through the sale of Veo television.</p>
          <p>The net profit grew by 163% up to &#x20AC;1.24 billion and this growth is greater than the profit before taxes, given the higher tax rate, which is around 25%. The main causes of this reduction are reduction in the tax &#x2013; state tax rate in Spain at around 30%; the exemptions from the regional taxes, the UK situation which is around 28%, and the application of the reinvestment and the divestment factors. The funds generated by operations continue to grow with a growth of 55% to &#x20AC;1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Also I'd like to point out that the cash flow, the EPS is &#x2013; had a growth of 90 &#x2013; almost 90%. Analyzing the results by business and looking at the liberalized business in Spain, including the retail and wholesale, we have a growth 84% of the pool and 2.5% in demand. Demand growth of 2.5% which offsets that lower production of 13.6%, this fall is due to a different mix in the production with 66% in water production and 28% in the conventional, given the environmental work done at our plants, which was not offset by the greater nuclear recharge in 2007 or the strong growth of 40% in the combined cycle output.</p>
          <p>They do have a lower use of the combined cycle due to the optimization process. As Luis San Pedro mentioned, the average cost of fuel grew to &#x20AC;47.3 per megawatt hour, so those are rising commodities on the international level and the &#x2013; also a rise in CO2 emissions cost.</p>
          <p>The rise in the fuel cost is reflected in the cost of fuel and CO2. All of this has translated into an increase in the gross margin at the liberalized market in Spain of 16.1% up to &#x20AC;637 million. As a result the growth in generation and the commercial areas of non-regulated gas have been over than the rise in the procurement cost of the business. In terms of basic margins, adding the emission rates, the growth reached 23.8%.</p>
          <p>EBITDA of liberalized electricity was been 237 million &#x2013; 376 million, that's 4.7% increase. And if we include those &#x20AC;32 million of the gas in the total EBITDA will be almost &#x20AC;409 million as your growth of also 4.7%. We should point out that the EBITDA of the business is also affected by the impact of those &#x20AC;84 million. Excluding the impact of EBITDA it would have grown by 26%, if it weren't for that affect.</p>
          <p>In terms of Renovable, we have a growth of 79.7% of the 4.89 gigawatts, and in terms of the installed capacity, which reaches 79.3% up to 8164 megawatts. The Renovable production in the first quarter of 2008 increased thanks to the operational efficiency of the business in May, despite the January and February low wind months, this, together with greater average prices of 11.7% ensure that the gross margin of the group grew by 109%. However we should remember that there has been a change in the parameter given the entrance of PPM and Renovables and the UK EBITDA excluding the impact of the mark-to-markets of &#x20AC;19 million &#x2013; negative euros could reach almost &#x20AC;337 million. This is due to the devaluation of the gas contracts in the market and has nothing to do with the wind business.</p>
          <p>The net operational cost has grown by 97%. And this growth is linked basically to the expansion cost, the international part of the business and the increase of expense in Spain only grew 10% in Spain.</p>
          <p>The gross margin of the regulated business in Spain grew by 4.4% to &#x20AC;387 million and this is a result of the &#x2013; positive effect of the increased individual remuneration of the regulation due to that Royal Decree. EBITDA has fallen by 1% as a result of two &#x2013; no recurring impacts in terms of personnel cost. The reversion of the forecast for the regulation for the first quarter 2007 and the application, as I mentioned, of the updates of the salaries due to the application of the collective bargaining agreement, this development will be analyzed throughout the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>The ScottishPower, in terms of gross margin, has been &#x2013; was &#x20AC;578 million. And in terms of basic margin &#x2013; adding goes to &#x20AC;62 million of the emissions rate, the participation gets to &#x20AC;640 million. And the level of EBITDA in the participation is &#x20AC;507 million which means 28.3% of the group's EBITDA.</p>
          <p>EBITDA of ScottishPower, &#x20AC;226 million, means the wholesale and retail business; and the &#x20AC;270 million to the other part of the business. And mark-to-market &#x2013; positive mark-to-market is &#x20AC;71 million. And the exchange rate in fact has taken about &#x20AC;43 million of EBITDA.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in Latin America has grown moderately at 4.9% to &#x20AC;210.3 million. In local currency EBITDA is 5.2% and 4.9 in foreign EBITDA given that the exchange rate in the two business areas, in Mexico and the other, is different and they offset one another.</p>
          <p>We should also point out that we have the strict control cost with &#x2013; that was actually 8.2 cost of operation &#x2013; net operational cost, so we can approve the EBITDA given the gross margin which rose by 1.4%. As I &#x2013; Jose Luis already mentioned, EBITDA in South America reaches &#x20AC;235.2 million showing a growth of 13.5% rising basically from the increase of 8% in demand, and is affected by their possible greater remuneration of distributors affecting us during 2008.</p>
          <p>And we will have &#x2013; in Coelba and Cosern we will have changing in fees. The change will &#x2013; is positive 6.9%. In terms of Guatemala and Mexico we have &#x20AC;75 million. And we should see a fall of 7.6% negative impact given the exchange rate and the negative effects given the deviations in margin and the non-recurration of tariff assess in Guatemala offset the positive affect of the growth in the Tamazunchale plant.</p>
          <p>In terms of non-energetic engineering fell by 14.8% to &#x20AC;105 million. As I explain in the next slide greater activity in real estate is not offset by the strong increase in the engineering and construction. Iberdrola real estate decreases its share given the fall in the real estate during the first quarter of 2007. The results has &#x20AC;37 million to &#x2013; the sale of the land for the last part of Chiloeches. Thanks to the diversified model and with a contribution to leasing and sale that can offset lower &#x2013; the low contributions from the other areas.</p>
          <p>And we will also maintain &#x2013; adjusted our very trade cost that allow real estate to continue to give positive results to the group given the market &#x2013; despite the market situation construction is still growing. The sales to third-parties grew by 83% and the pipeline of projects is now &#x20AC;3 billion, which guarantees strong activity over the next several years. Therefore, we have strong growth in the business, both in terms of gross margin which grew 43.4%, and EBITDA, with a growth of 36.8%.</p>
          <p>Now, I am going to quickly talk about some &#x2013; our financing. Because the market situation is interesting and after the acquisition of ScottishPower, the balance of the Company has been strengthened with total assets of 70 million &#x2013; &#x20AC;70.2 billion with 106% growth. This has been achieved by a greater flexibility of the financial structure of the Company. We've reduced the financial debt in the balance from 40 &#x2013; 31 &#x2013; from 42 to 31. We have also doubled the equity away from 20 to 40%. That increase in equity &#x2013; as a result, we have a very strong improvement in leverage of the Company which has been reduced from 55% to 40.9%, excluding the impact of the tariff insufficiency we can reach 39% equity increased by 172%, very much above the increase in the net adjusted debt.</p>
          <p>We have also firmed up the financial situation &#x2013; the solid financial situation of the Company, as of now to make investment in our strategic plan, maintaining the &#x2013; our financial strength. Iberdrola looks at a tariff deficit which will be 35% of the deficit estimated for the entire sector. This calculation looks at all of the emissions rate for this sector in accordance with Royal Decree 11/2007. The financial ratios have improved so the front &#x2013; on the net debt have improved from 23 to 27% and the cash flow over that debt have improved from 16 to &#x2013; over 20%.</p>
          <p>Our position of liquidity is also very good. We finished the first quarter with almost &#x20AC;11 billion in liquidity, which allows us to deal with the strategic plan 2008 with ease. And expectation that complying with all of the interests, we will be able to maintain a very positive position in terms of liquidity from now till the end of the year.</p>
          <p>And just to finish up this presentation, and focusing now on the perspectives of the entire year 2008. I would like to point out that the government forecast for the main &#x2013; the core business &#x2013; look at 2008 as a very strong growth year. A continued good trend after a very good first quarter; above average, Iberdrola Renovables will surpass the objectives established for 2008, and ScottishPower will contribute to the results. The results for 12 full months and in excess, in a year, we will a good performance, which is due to the synergies and cost savings. Iberdrola will also have good performance in 2008, better than 2007. And all of this will take us to a situation where our forecast will be strong growth for this year. Thanks very much.</p>
          <p>Now, we are going to go to the question-and-answer session.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, let's start the questions in this room, Raimundo from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Two questions, on Energy East, I would like to ask. In the event that the conditions faced by the commission were not acceptable, would Iberdrola give up this proposal? Do you have any other alternatives in mind? Considering the casual increase they had made last year? There have been statements or anything that the company that there were other potential targets in the US. Also with the speculation in the US on Natural Gas -- Gasa Prada I mean, not much comment there. That this is an operation or transaction that for many years did not make sense, but has there been a change in their viewpoint to make that merger perhaps more interesting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On Energy, if during our AGM I think our Chairman was very clear. I think he said that we will only close the Energy East transaction if the conditions &#x2013; and conditions aren't reasonable. This is the United States we are talking about, we're there to invest and to invest in infrastructure, in generation, distribution and transmission. So we will only close that deal if it meets those requirements. However, this is not the only transaction that we've been looking into in the United States. We have also looked into other alternatives before that one, some of which are still open and if Energy East transaction does not take place, again because those conditions are not met, only looking at the conditions under which we will be willing to invest, then we do have other alternatives in the US. Now, we have looked into and we could actually take on again in that case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>So ladies and gentlemen, this is the question-and-answer session now. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'd like to add something else too. I think we're open to investments when we see an opportunity to create value. As I said if the operational transaction does not dilute the Company stake and so on and provide divestitures or divestments that take place do not lead us to destroy value. That our project, as our Chairman has said, we have a high growth rate, we have our own resources, we have good opportunities ahead of us and that's our main focus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Virginia Sanz [Deutsche Bank].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[sic] (reading question) Virginia Sanz from Deutsche Bank. First, on your cost of debt, that 5.1% that we saw on the screen, is that sustainable for the year 2008? And also if this liquidity position of 4 billion at the year-end, does that include acquisition of Energy East or not? And then ScottishPower, I think I had a number of questions there. First, is there any way in which you can give us some sort of guidance on how we can estimate mark-to-market, which I see has considerable impact on your figures? I also think there is an Ofgem [The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets] investigation that's been opened? And lastly, amortization depreciation on the CO2 price allocation, is that just this year or that will have an impact in coming years as well?</p>
          <p>I think I'll leave that question to our CFO, at least the financial aspect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that 5.1 will actually decrease with increased debt in US dollars and throughout this first quarter and I hope that can be further decreased. With regard to those 4 billion, yes, indeed that does include the acquisition of Energy East. Now, what I wanted to highlight here, as you may have seen in the presentation the leverage levels of the company are improving, a lot better than we had planned. So what we're going to do is even to review our financing needs, review them down. That is in the next 18 to 25 months things are looking much better than we have planned. It's true that the pound, the British pound and the dollar do affect us and affect our bottom line, but have a very positive impact when it comes to &#x2013; from an investment point view, they are very good. So, we are also better off in that regard.</p>
          <p>I think Ignacio mentioned to you in addition to what Jose Luis, my own colleagues explained, we're going to have an Investor Day session in Glasgow, Scotland, my apologies -- Edinburgh, Glasgow, I am sorry, I don't know, but that will be 21st of May, to delve deeper into all these subjects. Just very briefly, on this Ofgem investigation and open discussions how that add to ScottishPower is for operations in the recession's markets in the UK. We believe that we have performed according to legal requirements. But I can give the floor perhaps to our Director of Operations, John Campbell. I'm sure he can give you more details. John, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to the operations and the balancing mechanism in Scotland and in the UK. I suppose we said we have an investigation by Ofgem. However, I am absolutely confident that ScottishPower's generation activities and the balancing mechanism in Scotland and indeed in the greater UK have been entirely appropriate. And we will work over the coming weeks with Ofgem to demonstrate that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vis-&#xE0;-vis mark-to-market, just like to have that, those higher value recorded in the first quarter by the results of the rising coal prices. We had some derivatives and not all of them were for hedging. So had to be valued at market price, the prices we get. And that of course has positive impact. In the future I hope our coal will not continue to increase in price and this factory will have less weight in our income statement. With regard to the PPA; the amortization, as a result of the upgrading of the value or the accounting value, our fair value that is are the value that have just have been incorporated to the group. Part of these efforts are not yet in operation. For example, our pipeline in Renovables &#x2013; referring to that list or future projects in generation, even in distribution not all these are yet operational, when they do we'll have to depreciate them. So, I think the amortization, the depreciation will rise slightly in the future. Yes Philip.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Securities. Just coming back on the EBITDA of ScottishPower; excluding the mark-to-market value, you have given your presentation two figures how we are going to re-conciliate the figure on the slide 17, where you're mentioning the clean EBITDA for ScottishPower of 327 and another figure which is more or less the same definition since to be clean of the mark-to-market value on slide 42, where you're mentioning &#x20AC;436 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>327 million is million pounds &#x2013; a pounds, whereas all the other numbers are in euros. However, to make a proper comparison to point out as financial performance that would have to do it in the currency that is not affected by exchange rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any other questions? Okay, well then let's move on to questions coming from the web.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew Walter from CreditSight. He is asking whether we're considering to issue bonds this year. And he said that &#x2013; he is a statement for us, 8 billion, I believe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the financial policy of the Company is quite conservative. So, although we don't really need that right now, we might issue &#x2013; we are going to have an issue some point this year. So, certainly, less than what we originally expected earlier this year, because I said things are good for us at present. What we are going to do is look into all markets where &#x2013; look in the markets where we find is any &#x2013; where there is opportunity to issue at a competitive and reasonable terms. So we'll follow the market very closely in the U.S., but right now we haven't take any decision in that regard like we're also looking at &#x2013; very closely looking at other markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Alberto Gandolfi from UBS. You've got three questions, the first one is. Can we comment on why generation prices in Spain are so removed from the UK despite of withdrawals? Secondly, how do you believe you can solve this cash deficit and what about the portfolio. The third question deregulation in July what you expect of this deregulation. And lastly, another similar question from a number of analysts is British &#x2013; Iberdrola's interest in British Energy and could you integrate this company with ScottishPower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with regard to the market prices in the UK and Spain. Well, in first place the markets are not the same. They don't have the same GAAPS. A stock market in Spain for one suppliers all the intelligent units but less compulsory in a price, <mark type="inaudible" /> John, and I think the prices in the UK, or activism, okay, on a balance mechanism which is lower debt. And the prices &#x2013; the market prices are also stated in the volatile agreements and contract in Spain. I think they are pretty much responding to the marginal prices of gas and coal in Spain. I'll pass, John, maybe you like to make a &#x2013; add a comment here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You came after UK market &#x2013; UK, and the UK power price isn't particular responded to the rising gas price and of course the UK has been subject to &#x2013; some tightening of the demand and supply of gaps and perhaps more so than the Mainland Europe and perhaps more so in Spain. UK like &#x2013; well, like color, countries in Europe also has been exposed to a rising international coal price based on &#x2013; driven by demand from Eastern Europe and some supply issues in Australia, South Africa. So we have seen in the UK market, we've seen the power price responding very strongly to these cost push drivers. And the spot price that was referred to in the UK, the downstream mechanism prices are much &#x2013; actually a flexibility market and is perhaps less driven by commodities and more driven by the requirements of the system operator demand and supply parallel any point.</p>
          <p>And same I think the very nature of the UK market in terms of the degree of competition in the UK has meant that prices have reacted very firmly and strongly to these larger global increases in the outcome price of gas and indeed of coal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to British Energy, Iberdrola and nuclear power plant as a major nuclear operator with very high standing repetition. We also have know how &#x2013; great know how of the UK market through ScottishPower. The UK government is now contemplating nuclear as a potential and key source and which needs to be supported. And obviously this fits strategically with Iberdrola and ScottishPower. Now, what we need to look at is to seeing that any transaction for the UK has to meet our strategic conditions, which I am sure they would, but also the financial and economic conditions then we require and that we get a reasonable return of the investments that would justify this CapEx. So we have to look into this to get this fixed strategically into our Company. But we'll have to see on whether it may or not have a financial fit in our company. That is an obligation that we have to look into. We have to look at all these opportunities. Looking always at the strategy, whether it fits strategically and find out whether economically it also makes sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there was another related question. Yes. That was concerning July &#x2013; deregulation in July and how you can solve the power deficit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think in July, obviously, this is its duration &#x2013; what the present July will take &#x2013; effect the high voltage tariffs but not a low voltage tariffs, and ordinary in high voltage, the G4. That deregulation signs July 1st, and there are still many consumers in this tariff. So I think they are calling for two, three months transitional period. Is that right, Michael? So that we can give customers the opportunity to contract with whatever parties, not the 2nd of July ourselves having to</p>
          <p>cut supply to our customers, that's a transitional period that has been set for us. And although I said two, three months to allow everyone to adapt to this new scenario.</p>
          <p>And for the deficit &#x2013; tariff deficit to March, the deficit is &#x20AC;1.3 billion. If we deduct the part that belongs to the Royal Decree 11/2007 that goes down by 292 million therefore leaving a deficit of 1.1 billion which we're currently financing. We're not taking on, we're financing it. We have to finance about 35% or &#x20AC;385 million. The idea here is that the Ministry of Industry negotiating with the Ministry of Economy to give greater guarantees vis-&#xE0;-vis the financing of this deficit with retail banking. And I think the condition is better now, it no longer depends &#x2013; debt service no longer depends on a percentage of the tariff, but rather what you &#x2013; within your revenues, there is a part that you allocate to the financing of this debt service. So we believe that the guarantees that have been set forth are greater than before. And I think there are some other improvements which I can't think of right now. Of course we also have exchange rates, having guaranteed through our calculations. I think both ministries that I mentioned earlier &#x2013; industry and economy are trying to improve the conditions to enable us to allocate the financing, to place it somewhere &#x2013; this financing and to decrease the cost of financing. Now we have a question from Alejandro Vigil from News Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations for your new appointment. The first one is can you explain how you calculate the call back. And what are your estimates to year-end? Secondly, prices for the year 2008, scenarios, and also again &#x2013; and also your position, if you can please clarify, your position vis-&#xE0;-vis all the speculation going on on Energy East I think he said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for the year 2007, as you know the Royal Decree set forth that all production in ordinary regime is somehow you have to call back. What is a call back? It says you have to pay a sum equivalent to or equal to the cost of the rise of a CO2, it's not &#x20AC;8 megawatt/hour. So the results for this year, except for this first quarter for Iberdrola is &#x20AC;84 million, of which about 60%, I mean, apply to -- 30 that do not issue CO2, nuclear, hydro and the remaining two plants that do, natural gas and coal.</p>
          <p>Our forecast to year end, well, as far as based on this allocation this will really depend on what works. It will matter be the value of the rights they have been allocated, and anyone that doesn't have an allocation, I think, it costs us &#x20AC;60 million in one quarter, so in four quarters, you can work it out. And then just stressing again and perhaps not have to go into the same subject again. I think that Chairman already mentioned this; in the AGM in the press conference about 27 times, I think. So to say this again; maybe I won't phrase it in the same words, as I said we have a project, we have a project to create value with strong growth in profits and in EPS by &#x2013; as professionals and as management and we need to analyze and look into different opportunities as they come available. But always within the financial parameters that we hold as true for us, with the Chairman summarizing in the three, growth in PPA, two; not diluting our position and make sure that one plus one equals two or more. And I think that's our position and we will repeat that as many times as we need to but that's the message from our Chairman; and of course, our financial soundness and solidity.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And finally from the webpage we have a question &#x2013; several questions. Six questions but several have &#x2013; four have already been answered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first is, if you could give details of the SPARC [ScottishPower Advanced Research Centre] in Spain during 2008. The second question is when do we think that the new distribution regulation, we will have all of those details? If you think that this regulation will be positive for Iberdrola or not, I think those two have been answered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the information that I have in front of me, the gas margin that we have is approximately around &#x20AC;16 per megawatt hour. But that's on gas we'll have to subtract the tools and maintenance and so forth. And in coal the margin over the cost &#x2013; variable cost as a fuel is around &#x20AC;13 per megawatt hour.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question was the distribution in a fiscal. We have a positive effect. When do you think will that regulation will be implemented?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think with the new remuneration system, what it's going to guarantee is a proper remuneration for the investment made. In other words what we are trying to do is that an investment plan &#x2013; four-year investment plan is recognized and four-year energy efficiency plan and that this investment would be remunerated properly. In terms of the figures of remuneration and the systems of remuneration applied to transport, I would be very happy if they apply the same to the distribution network.</p>
          <p>And now the questions from the telephone, I think we have three people on the telephone line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. The first question in Spanish is Mr. Jos&#xE9; Luis Tele Operator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sir, you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning I will have two questions. First of all, could you give me an assessment of the new attitude of the government in terms of nuclear energy and explain what do you expect for Begonia and the new &#x2013; the useful life of the nuclear power plants? Secondly, just very quickly, are you expecting deterioration in Energy East, if you remove your offer to just out of the negotiations there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of nuclear, Iberdrola would &#x2013; it has always done, is to follow the energy policy of the government. And if the government wants to build nuclear power plants that's what we would do. If they want to extend the life, the useful life of nuclear plants we would do that. In fact, we're investing in extending the life of nuclear plants in Gagunia. We're investing. We have been working over the last 20 years to extend the useful life to 60 years. I think the presence of that 16 similar plants have already been improved for 60 years. What this government will do? We don't know, but we will obey their orders. In terms of useful life, I believe that, at least, the nuclear power plants in operation I think that 40 years would be the minimum useful life. So I think, quite really United States, everyone believes that useful life for a nuclear power plants is 60 years.</p>
          <p>Regarding the question on Energy East, we believe that both the administrative judge, the arbitrators as well as the commissioners, the members of the commission are going to have a more reasonable attitude than the technical services have had. And that the operation will be approved without conditions or with very reasonable conditions, if that were not the case, because we didn't get the approval or because the conditions were not reasonable, well in that case, we would drop the operation. We don't foresee any penalization in that case, if we did drop out. Next question please.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning guys. Two questions, firstly on the structure of your hedging for coal and gas. Can you just outline how you hedge forwards and when you are likely to see the paying of the recent price moves? And then secondly, question on UK retail prices. Assuming the commodity price is stable if you were there at the moment, what sort of price rise will you need to have in your UK tariffs come the August round of negotiations? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About the hedging, it's a hedging are -- do you mean hedging in the UK or hedging for coal and gas in Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Both. Okay. Let's start then by the UK &#x2013; let's start by the UK and I'm going to pass to John Campbell to cover the hedge of coal and gas positions and also to Willy McDimier to talk about retail tariffs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting with gas, in the UK, we have tranches of long-term gas contracts which have been secured over the last 10, 12, 15 years, in some cases shorter. But those tranches of gas are the &#x2013; they are the underlying gas cover position we have. And obviously these contracts were put in place taking when gas prices were lower. And at the same time, we supplement that base of long-term gas with a rolling approach to purchasing gas for our retail and our generation needs. So when I say rolling, we buy progressively in the period of two or three years ahead. And we &#x2013; it's not completely mechanistic, it's not a case of a third every year. But it follows that basic shape, allowing us some freedom to follow our views on where prices are going. And that has resulted in &#x2013; the reality that we do have a rising weighted average cost of gas. But it is well below the current market and it is competitive we believe with our major retail competitors in the UK.</p>
          <p>And so &#x2013; and the situation of coal is kind of similar. We've purchased the coal that we need for our generating on a rolling basis. We don't go and buy everything we need four years ahead, but neither do we wait until the day or the month, the week ahead. It's a rolling basis which tends to smooth out some of the volatility we've seen. And also in the case of renewable we have a rising coal price globally. Then we have our cost of coal, which is of course below the current market and that coverage in gas and coal extends at least until, well it extends over the next three years through to 2010. Beyond 2010, we would see short positions starting to appear in our trade books, but we are well covered and I've been told that, period.</p>
          <p>I am sorry but one &#x2013; the same is also true of the emissions trading. Obviously, we receive fee allocations for our emissions, but those allocations don't match our generating expectations. So we have purchased ahead to cover ourselves and to hedge ourselves against the rising cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. Turning to the question on retail tariffs, everybody would be aware within the UK what kind of very competitive marketplace. The rising input costs coupled with the energy efficiency cost coupled with the few poverty measures that are coming forward will be putting pressure on where the end price the customers will be, but at this stage I wouldn't want to share with anybody as to what our plans are in the short-term. But we're watching the situation very closely and as always we've done at ScottishPower we will react at the right time and proper fashion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would add that in the Spanish case the need for hedging is very much different than in the UK market. Why? Because all of the plans are offering energy at the pool price and the pool price has the marginal price, which depends on the market price of brand and coal. So there is &#x2013; this is kind of self adjusting mechanism. So it reflects the pool price directly proportional to the market price of brand and coal. So the hedge is given by the market itself. The next question please.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Chris Moore from ABN. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning everybody. I have two questions please. My first question is about coal in Spain, you're investing in this authorization, could you talk a bit about the timeframe, the CapEx involved and what your implications are for your load factors in coal and gas in Spain this year and next? And my second question goes back to what you said for about British Energy; you said that it was a good strategic fit for you. Can you just say what you have to offer versus the crowded list of competitors now. I think EDF has a quite a big balance sheet to compare with yourselves, in bidding, I think that several other companies interested. What's your advantage in bidding for British Energy? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of nuclear in the United Kingdom, what we can confirm is what I mentioned before. Repeating what the Chairman said at the General Shareholders' meeting, Iberdrola has an extremely strong experience in nuclear, and has a magnificent reputation with the regulators of this industry also. It has its strength in the UK market, which is very good given its participation in ScottishPower.</p>
          <p>We don't believe that we are in an inferior situation with any of the other possible interested parties in taking part in the new investments in the nuclear business in the United Kingdom. Just the opposite actually, we believe that we are in a better position than they are in terms of presence in the market, and also in terms of our reputation. Now, the number of plants in operation, it could -it's a different story. But that's not really what makes the difference. What makes the difference is the knowledge and presence in the market and the reputation in this industry. And I don't believe that Iberdrola is behind any of our competitors in that connection.</p>
          <p>In terms of the desulfuring plants, El Laguardo, we forecast the entering into service in May or June of 2008 of this year. And the Lada 4, we're taking at the beginning of 2009. In terms of the investment about this &#x2013; this throughout the same around 65 or 70 million years, in each one of these power plant. We have one last question I believe.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Question from Mr. Sung Denny from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Hello, hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Sung Denny from JPMorgan. Just three questions about slide 53 on your liquidity. I wonder if you could give us a bit more detail on the roughly &#x20AC;10 billion of undrawn credit lines that you've got on that slide? And then secondly, you've slight sort of implied that you're going to be consuming about 7 billion of liquidity up to the end of the year. I just want to check that you've assumed, firstly &#x2013; well, firstly checked that you have assume that you are going to be going through with the Energy East acquisition in that calculation. And also I was wondering if you could, may be give us a sense of the volume of asset sales that you are planning toward, out to the end of this year. And may be a little bit more color on what those assets sales might be. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just to give you a very rough quick question on the 10 billion. There are 3 billion of three year lines that we signed last year and there is 7 billion extension of the bridge loan for the ScottishPower acquisition that we extended from November of 2008 to November of 2009. So this &#x2013; and in addition to that we have more than &#x20AC;1 billion in several credit line and one-to-one basis center banks. So clearly very, very comfortable. Obviously when we are talking about the investments we are including Energy East, as I mentioned. So this assumption includes the acquisition of energy -- of Energy East. So, if &#x2013; that is the case and with the exchange rates higher than what we have right now.</p>
          <p>And in terms of sales, said specific times, I mean we &#x2013; for the whole strategic part started doing the Galp transaction. We will analyze carefully, when it is the more appropriate moment to make some other divestments, if needed, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>There are no more questions. So thanks very much for your presence and for your attention here and into our next meeting. Thanks very much. Goodbye now.</p>
