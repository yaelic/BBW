          <p>Thank you, Holly.  Good morning and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners' conference call to discuss earnings for the first quarter 2008.  Mike Creel, Enterprise's President and CEO, will lead the call, followed by Randy Fowler, the company's Executive Vice President and CFO.  Also included on the call today from Enterprise is Dan Duncan, our Chairman and Founder, as well as other members of our senior management team.  Afterwards, we will open the call up for your questions.</p>
          <p>During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise's management.  Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, they can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.  Please refer to our latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during the call.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for joining us today as we discuss our first quarter results.  It was another record quarter in terms of operating and financial performance.  Our new assets, Independence Hub and Trail, the Meeker and Pioneer gas processing facilities, the Mid-America pipeline expansions in the Hobbs fractionator, as well as most of our other assets had an exceptional quarter.</p>
          <p>For the second consecutive quarter, our pipelines transported in excess of 2 million barrels per day of natural gas liquids, crude oil, and petrochemicals led by our Mid-American and Seminole pipelines which transported more than 1 million barrels per day of NGLs.  Our natural gas pipelines transported a record 9 trillion Btus per day, 6% more than last quarter's previous record throughput of 8.5 trillion Btus per day.  Also for the second quarter in a row, we fractionated more than 400,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids.  These strong operating results contributed to record gross operating margin of 522 million, record adjusted EBITDA of 505 million, and record distributable cash flow of 383 million.  Distributable cash flow, which increased 73% over the first quarter of 2007, provided 1.6 times coverage of the 50.75 cents per unit that we declared with respect to the first quarter this year.</p>
          <p>Each of our four business segments reported higher gross operating margin this quarter compared with the first quarter of last year.  Our NGL Pipelines and Services segment benefited from strong overall demand for natural gas liquids from the petrochemical and refining industries and from more normal winter weather in the Midwest and a corresponding increase in NGL prices.  This segment reported a 52% increase in gross operating margin in the first quarter of 2008 to $290 million.</p>
          <p>NGL demand for petrochemical production in the first quarter was strong with ethylene steam crackers producing at an annual rate of 54 billion pounds or an average operating rate of approximately 86% in the first quarter, despite the number of facilities being down for annual turnarounds.  This high operating rate coupled with natural gas price at about 47% of crude oil on a Btu basis resulted in ethane and propane continued to be the preferred feedstocks.</p>
          <p>According to the Hodson report, ethane feedstock consumption by the U.S. ethylene industry increased 10% to an average of 800,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2008 and that compares with 729,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of last year.  Ethylene production is currently running at about an annual rate of 56 billion pounds.</p>
          <p>Our Meeker cryogenic gas processing facility with an operation for the entire quarter extracting an average of 30,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids, while our Pioneer trial gas processing facility began operations in February 2008, and averaged 8,000 barrels per day of NGLs for the quarter while it was in the process of starting up.</p>
          <p>Repairs to Pioneer from a small fire in the March were completed late last week and at the end of the week it was producing around &#x2013; processing around 580 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and extracting as much as 20,000 barrels per day of NGLs.</p>
          <p>Together, Meeker and Pioneer generated approximately $33 million of gross operating margin in the first quarter.  This is after expensing the $5 million insurance deductible associated with the fire at Pioneer.</p>
          <p>As we said at our Analyst Meeting last month, we expect these two state-of-the-art facilities to generate significant gross operating margin and cash flows in 2008.</p>
          <p>NGL Pipeline volumes increased 14% or $223,000 barrels per day to 1.8 million barrels per day.  Mid-America and Seminole accounted for 190,000 barrels per day of this increase.  These pipelines benefited from an increase in NGL production from the Meeker and Pioneer facilities and greater demand on the North system for propane used for commercial and residential fuel.</p>
          <p>We just completed commissioning a new 68-mile 10-inch NGL pipeline that is now delivering ethane and propane from our Hobbs fractionator to an ethylene facility in Odessa, Texas.</p>
          <p>Our Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines and Services business reported a 43% increase in gross operating margin to $110 million for the first quarter of this year.  Most of our natural gas pipelines reported improved results from the first quarter of 2007.  Gross operating margin for the Texas Intrastate system was up $9 million, the San Juan system increased 4 million, our share of the Jonah Gas Gathering system was up almost $5 million, and the Acadian, Permian, and In <mark type="inaudible" /> systems were each up about 2 to $3 million.  Natural gas storage reported an increase of $5 million on new capacity and pipeline fees at Petal and our Wilson Storage facility also showed improvement as it began to return to service.</p>
          <p>In August of last year, we increased capacity at our Petal natural gas storage facility by 1.6 billion cubic feet by converting an existing NGL storage cavern to natural gas service.  This new capacity is fully subscribed and we expect to have another 5 Bcf of storage capacity available in June of this year as we near completion of converting an additional cavern at Petal.  Approximately, 3.2 billion cubic feet of this capacity is leased and arrangements are being finalized on the remaining capacity.</p>
          <p>We filed an application with FERC in January this year seeking authorization to develop two additional 5 Bcf storage caverns at Petal.  We plan to connect our Petal storage facility with three new major natural gas pipelines with an aggregate transportation capacity of 4.2 Bcf per day when they become operational.  The Southeast Supply Header this summer, the Gulf Crossing Southeast expansion pipeline in the second quarter 2008 and a Mid-Continent Express pipeline in March 2009.  This will provide access to Barnett and Woodford Shale supplies and the markets into Florida.</p>
          <p>Repairs are complete on the natural gas storage caverns at our Wilson facility, southwest of Houston, and we expect it to return to its full working capacity of 6.4 Bcf by mid 2008.  Plans are underway to develop another storage cavern at the Wilson facility that will add an additional 5 Bcf of capacity by the second quarter of 2010.  Over half of this capacity is under contract to CenterPoint.  This project involves the construction of a new 30-inch pipeline that will provide an additional 400 million cubic feet a day of capacity into Enterprise's pipelines.</p>
          <p>We have decided not to pursue the development of gas storage caverns at our Mont Belvieu facilities to natural gas service due to the expected increase in cost to develop those facilities.</p>
          <p>Our Offshore Pipelines and Services segment posted a 310% increase in gross operating margin this quarter, due primarily to the Independence Project, which accounted for 51 million of the $62 million improvement.  This segment also benefited from higher tariffs on our Ohio system and increased crude oil deliveries by our Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline.</p>
          <p>As you know, operations of Independence were suspended on April 8th due to a leak detected at the top flange of the flex joint that connects the pipeline to the platform.  Repairs are ongoing and it is our expectation that the platform and pipeline will resume operations by mid May.  Based on the volumes that were flowing through the pipeline and the platform before it was suspended, we estimate the impact to gross operating margin to be about $400,000 per day due to the loss of volumetric fees.  We will, however, continue to collect the monthly demand fee of $3.6 million from the producers.</p>
          <p>Our Petrochemical segment turned in another good quarter with an 8% increase in gross operating margins of $41 million.  Our butane isomerization business continues to perform well aided by near record volumes added value of NGL byproducts.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we successfully accessed the capital markets raising $1.1 billion of five and 10 year senior unsecured debt with an average coupon of 6.2%.  We believe these financings combined with cash flow retained for reinvestment, equity proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan, and increased year-over-year cash flows from our new investment helps to insulate us from potential disruptions in the capital market as we fund our $1.6 billion growth capital expenditure budget for 2008.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, we're very pleased with our results for the first quarter and the contributions our new assets have made.  The outlook for 2008 continues to look favorable for our services to both producers and consumers.  We have a steady stream of new assets that are expected to begin operations during the remainder of this year and 2009 and we're already planning additional growth projects for 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn the call over to Randy Fowler for a financial review for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Good morning.  As Mike mentioned earlier, Enterprise had another quarter of record performance supported by contributions from new capital projects that have been put in service in the last six months as well as solid performance from most of our other assets.</p>
          <p>And turning to the income statement, depreciation expense for the first quarter 2008 increased to $134 million from $119 million for the first quarter 2007.  This was primarily due to increased property, plant, and equipment in service during the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter 2007.  When comparing back to the $139 million of depreciation expense for the fourth quarter 2007, we did see a reduction.  This decrease is due to a change in the useful life of various assets, the largest being the Texas intrastate pipeline system.</p>
          <p>In terms of G&amp;A, G&amp;A increased to 21 million this quarter from 17 million in the first quarter of last year.  The increase was due primarily to the reclassification of some G&amp;A expense for certain salaries that were previously a component in calculating gross operating margin.  Now they are out of gross operating margin and actually included in G&amp;A expense.  Also, we saw part of the increase is due to the timing of the costs for the preparation and the production of the K-1s both for Enterprise Products and given the consolidation for Duncan Energy Partners as well.  This accounted for about $2 million of the increase</p>
          <p>G&amp;A expense, if you also note, was about $21 million for the fourth quarter 2007.  $80 million is probably a good annual run rate for 2008.</p>
          <p>Interest expense this quarter was $92 million.  This is up from 63 million for the first quarter of last year.  Average debt outstanding, including 100% of our hybrid securities was $7.2 billion for the first quarter of 2008 compared to 5.4 billion for the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Capitalized interest decreased about $2.5 million this quarter, compared to the first quarter 2007 due to a decrease in the amount of expenditures and construction work in progress as a result of the start up of projects such as Independence Hubs and Meeker and the Pioneer cryoplants.</p>
          <p>As Mike mentioned earlier, we did successfully complete accessing the capital markets in March by pricing $400 million of five-year senior notes at 5.65% coupon and $700 million of ten-year senior note for the coupon of 6.5%. We used the proceeds from this offering, which closed on April 3 to temporarily reduce the balance outstanding under our multi-year $1.75 billion credit facility.</p>
          <p>Looking at provision for income taxes, this decreased $5.1 million in the first quarter of 2008 versus the first quarter of 2007. Corporate tax accruals decreased for the Dixie and Seminole pipelines due to lower pre-tax income. And deferred tax accruals for the Texas margin tax decreased due to lower apportionment factor attributable to the State of Texas which lowered the estimated expense.</p>
          <p>We spent $600 million in growth capital during the first quarter and $25 million in sustaining capital expenditures for the quarter. The majority of the growth capital spent during the first quarter 2008 was attributable to the Sherman Extension pipeline, the Meeker II cryogenic plant, to finish the construction of the Pioneer plant that began service in February, and for the Shinsei oil pipeline that is on track for completion in 2009.</p>
          <p>We expect to invest about $1.6 billion in growth capital projects in 2008. Even though maintenance capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2008 were approximately $25 million, we still expect maintenance capital for the full year of 2008 to be approximately $200 million.</p>
          <p>At March 31, 2008 we had we had $7.5 billion of debt outstanding, including 100% of our $1.25 billion of hybrid securities and consolidating $188 million of debt attributable to Duncan Energy Partners. EPD had liquidity of $1.6 billion after adjusting for the proceeds of our $1.1 billion of senior note offerings. Our floating interest rate exposure was approximately 12% at the end of the quarter after adjusting for the proceeds from the note offering and terminating about $450 million of fixed to floating swaps. The average life of our debt was approximately 18 years and our average cost of debt is approximately 6.1%, and this includes 100% of the hybrid securities.</p>
          <p>As Mike mentioned earlier, our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was a record $505 million. This is comprised of the EBITDA that was reconciled in our press release of $491 million and adjusting it by adding $14 million for the difference between the actual cash distributions in the equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates.</p>
          <p>For the last 12 months, adjusted EBITDA for EPD and DEP consolidated was $1.62 billion. Our consolidated leverage ratio of debt to last 12 months EBITDA at March 31, 2008 was approximately 4.16 times. This is based on consolidated debt at Enterprise and Duncan Energy of the $7.5 billion and the Duncan $725 million for the average equity content ascribed at a hybrid debt security by the rating agencies.</p>
          <p>We have improved this ratio from 4.3 times at the end of 2007. We expect our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to return to its normal range of 3.5 to 4 times as we realize a full 12 months of cash flow from our new capital projects.</p>
          <p>Finally, we generated $383 million of distributable cash flow for the first quarter 2008 which provided 1.6 times coverage of our cash distribution for the quarter. We retained $126 million of distributable cash flow or about one-third of total distributable cash flow to reinvest back into growth of the partnership to investing in grow capital expenditures and also to reduce debt.</p>
          <p>Before I finish the call today, I would like to make a few comments about Duncan Energy Partners, a subsidiary of Enterprise. DEP reported net income today also of $6 million or $0.29 per unit for the first quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>The partnership reported the highest quarterly gross operating margin since its IPO in February of 2007, which was supported by increased natural gas volumes and sales margins on its Acadian natural gas pipeline in South Louisiana. DEP's NGL and Petrochemical Storage business also benefited from higher storage fees and volumes.</p>
          <p>Distributable cash flow was $8.9 million for the first quarter 2008, which provided 1.05 times coverage of the quarterly distribution. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.41 per unit with respect to the first quarter. DEP's commercial businesses continue to deliver solid results and we look forward to another successful year for this partnership.</p>
          <p>Now I think we are ready to take questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> One moment please for the first question.  Darren Horowitz, you may ask your question and please state your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys.  Darren Horowitz with Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Darren.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Randy, my first question is on Independence Hub.  Based on your prepared remarks, you had said that your expectation now is for mid-May which would peg the Hub being down for about 45 days.  As it relates to the demand charge, is there any clause that we should be aware of if it takes longer than that 45 days, like a force measure where the potential for that demand charge can be suspended?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Darren, It's James Lytal.  No.  There isn't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Darren, just kind of doing the math, that really comes out -- if it were as late as mid-May that would be 37 days.  But, we kind of think that maybe an outside date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Okay.  I appreciate it.  And, then, switching gears over to Pioneer, if I could; now that was processing about 550 MMcf a day before the plant went down due to the fire and I know that a lot of those volumes were diverted to your silica plant.  So, it's not really a matter of anything being lost, but more or less being deferred revenue.  Is there going to be any sort of impact there that we should expect in the second quarter surrounding Pioneer's as it relates to your overall operating margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think with respect to the overall operating margin comparing Pioneer being down for repairs versus being up in full cryo and the downstream effect on Mid-America, you maybe looking at 8 or $9 million.  But, if you are comparing, or trying to compare the second quarter with the first quarter, also bear in mind that plant didn't even come up until February the 1st.  So, it was only up for two quarters.  And, while it was in start-up mode, it only averaged 8,000 barrels a day for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  Okay.  And, then, my final question is on the NGL pipelines and services. At this point looking at where processing margins are, can you help us with little bit more clarity as to quantifying what percent of your gross operating margin is now exposed to commodity price or stock market volatility?  I would imagine it's probably pretty low given your hedges.  But, can you just refresh our memory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Darren, I tell you what?  For the quarter, I think we were looking at Meeker and Pioneer together we are about $33 million of gross operating margin for the quarter.  I mean, those are the -- really the two facilities where the majority of it is looking at key whole processing.  And, then, we got as far as for the remainder of this year at Pioneer and Meeker a good bit of that hedged.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  About 70, 75% of the margin hedged at those two facilities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Good morning.  It's Sharon Lui from Wachovia.  These question is relate to DEP.  Given that I guess you guys are not pursuing the conversion of the Mt. Belvieu storage to natural gas, I was wondering if there's any potential organic growth opportunities at DEP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as &#x2013; Gil, you want to handle as far as on the NGL storage side, what you are seeing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I mean, we are not totally given up on storing other products out there.  We are just saying that right now the natural gas doesn't fit for us because the capital cost has gotten out of hand for those kinds of projects.  We do see some smaller-type projects that would be storing new products like refined products out there that would allow us for some organic growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are also some projects on the Louisiana Intrastate Pipeline System that we are working on that should be beneficial.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Also, I guess looking at the potential drop-downs given the capital needs like EPD and DEP's higher cost of capital, where are your thoughts on potential drop-downs in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the benefit that we got from having issued the debt earlier in the year and from having the significant amount of retained cash flow and our balance sheet with these new assets coming on-line, we are actually in a position where we've got a lot of flexibility.  I think with respect to drop-downs, we evaluate those from time to time and if it makes sense at some point in the future we'll consider it.  But, we are not in a position where we have to do something.  I think that you are right with the DEP price seems to have been beaten up unfairly and we think it's undervalued, but hopefully that's a short lived phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Thank you, <mark type="inaudible" />.  Two real quick questions, in the press release talking about the equity NGL production where it increased by 31 million barrels per day, or thousand [31,000] barrels per day, it also goes on and says that 30,000 were from Meeker and 8,000 from Pioneer, which would seem to me that the legacy production fell by 10%, or 7,000 barrels a day.  I was wondering if that's correct and if so if it's permanent or if something caused that?  And if it's permanent, will -- is that the beginning of a slide down in that production or it's just a step down?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  The other question I have and this is more long-term relating to Meeker, I see that TransCanada is contemplating building I think they call it the Pathfinder Pipeline to take natural gas out of the Rockies starting from Meeker.  I'm just wondering if that creates any kind of opportunity for the company for expansion out there if they decide to go ahead with that project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the short answer is that any additional takeaway capacity for natural gas out of the Rocky Mountains encourages producers to produce more and that obviously gives rise to an opportunity for us to process the gas.  And it's hard to tell what the timing of that Pathfinder Project is and whether it in fact will be successful, but we certainly would like to be able to take advantage of it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Wachovia, good morning.  Couple of questions, in the NGL business you talked about strong petrochem demand and refinery demand.  And I guess given the fact that we are in an economic slowdown and there have been issues with refineries in the crack spread, can you just reconcile the results that you are seeing in your business with what perhaps others are seeing across the economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll let -- Jim Teague is going to field this one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's speak to the petrochemicals.  I think that given that they use about 56% of the NGLs produced, they are the big driver. I think what you've seen is with a gas to crude -- what did we say it was in the first quarter, 47%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>47%, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the weak dollar you are seeing a lot of exports out of petrochemicals that you would not expect under normal circumstances.  Those exports have been fairly robust and have been supportive of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then I think no one might answer this but I will ask this, but you saw you mentioned some declines in offshore with Viosca Knoll and Phoenix and Falcon, can you just comment on what's going on there and if that's a permanent decline or is there something else happening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At Viosca Knoll we have seen declines on existing fields, but I can tell you we are working on deals that would backstop pretty much the declines we've seen here recently.  So -- but a lot of those fields have been on for over 10 years and we are starting to see the declines at the end of the life of the fields.  But we are seeing additional drilling around Viosca Knoll.  At Phoenix, we are seeing some declines although I know the producers are going to do some work to get the volumes back up.  And Phoenix also is in an area where we see a lot of upside for the future because of some drilling that's going on in deeper waters to the south of Phoenix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Dan Duncan.  Let me give a little bit of color to answer that Jim Teague gave you.  You go back to the deal of natural gas liquids relative to crude oil and natural gas, the slowdown in the economy of petrochemicals I think is definitely going to happen.  The slowdown in an economy of refined products probably I think that's definitely going to slow down too.  The demand for natural gas liquids, because of its pricing based on relative to natural gas relative to crude oil, there will not be a slowdown that we see right now on natural gas liquids.  The amount of money that the petrochemicals can make off of natural gas liquids, mainly butanes and propane and ethane is a lot higher than they can make off of derivative of crude oil.  So when you are talking about the 86% capacity that petrochemical used in the first quarter, they used over 105% capacity on the natural gas liquids and they are using probably under 70% capacity of what we call the heavy crackers.  That's also the same on refined products, motor gasoline, and the products that you get from the refineries.  The amount of money that the refineries and petrochemicals can make off of natural gas liquids is a lot higher on utilizing the 100% of all natural gas liquids relative to using the same derivatives of crude oil.  So maybe when you put your numbers together, add those two factors to the deal.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah John, after you come in and adjust for the proceeds from the $1.1 billion in the notes offering between unrestricted cash and availability under the revolver, we are at about $1.6 billion at the end of the quarter.</p>

          <p>Okay, and then maybe Mr. Duncan could share his thoughts on distribution growth.  Given how strong the coverage was this quarter and given how much retained cash against your goal, I mean is it safe to assume that you'll accelerate distribution growth later in the coming quarters?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John in the press release we've got that our objective is currently to end the year at a run rate of $2.12 on an annualized basis.  We hate to get too ahead of ourselves.  We recognize the benefit of retaining some of this cash flow for reinvestment.  Limit our need to go after the equity markets, particularly in a market that is kind of uncertain as this one is.  But as we go through the year and look at what we expect to see in 2009, we'll evaluate what the appropriate level of distribution should be.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right.  It's just that you are obviously well on your way to meeting that target.  I mean that was the context I was asking on.</p>

          <p>Thank you, and our last question comes from <mark type="inaudible" />.  Your line is open.  Please state your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, <mark type="inaudible" />.  On the gathering side, how much do you guys make on average per MCF?  Then I got a question about processing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really depends on the area.  We've got gathering offshore, we've got gathering in the Rocky Mountains, we've got it in Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana to some extent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But do you have an average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's just not a general of rule of thumb that you can use across all of our systems.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is James Lytal.  That varies dependent on the service we provide.  A system like San Juan Basin where there is a lot of compression, we provide a very low pressure system.  It's one that's been performing well though a lot of the transportation is based on a percentage of the price.  So, with the higher price, we are getting higher fees and on a portion of it, we get a percentage of the liquids for processing.  But a system like that tends to have higher fees, because of all the services you provide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's kind of what I am getting at.  Like I mean how much do you benefit from higher prices on the gathering side?  I mean when you talk about you get a percentage of the price or a percentage of the liquids, I mean what sort of is your leverage on the gathering side to higher natural gas price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've talked about that in other calls, and one thing to bear in mind is that while we do benefit on the gathering side, we also have higher fuel costs and CTR costs for our plants.  Those two positions largely offset each other and that's why we have talked in the past about having this natural hedge with respect to natural gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and that's where -- as far as on the gathering side, we may be net long 40 to 45 million cubic feet a day, but as Mike said, when you look at the fuel for our pipelines and some of our plants, it runs about 40 million a day.  So at the margin we may be net long, but net long about 5 million a day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  How about on the processing side, what percentage of your contracts are service fees versus percentage of proceeds, equity ownership?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jim Teague.  I think Randy stated earlier that our processing plants in the Rockies are all keep-whole.  If you remember, we've built a lot of extraction flexibility in that to be able to manage and mitigate that risk, but that's all keep-whole.  It's about 1.3 BCF a day today.  Our plants in South Louisiana, they are by and large a hybrid.  It's got a keep-whole with a floor and a cap where we don't have any downside risk.  We give up part of the upside opportunity.  Other than -- and then we have some modest keep-whole contracts in South Texas.  The big exposure is in Meeker and Pioneer in the Rockies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have talked about the exposure there.  We knew going in when we were building those plants that we had keep-whole contracts and that's why we built those plants to be extremely flexible.  So, for the two plants, we can extract as much as 30- to 35,000 barrels a day of natural gas liquids, but we can also, if the economics aren't attractive, we can dial that down to something closer to 1,500 to 2,000 barrels per day per plant.  So, we have ways to mitigate that exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I guess that's it.  On the gathering side, where do you see the most growth I guess maybe on the processing side as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously we think it's in the Rockies, seeing as how we are spending quite a lot of money up there.  We were expanding the Jonah gathering system.  We will have that up to 2.3 BCF a day, <mark type="inaudible" />, by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2.4 going to 2.6.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, of course we bought the Piceance Creek Gathering System.  We're running about 550 a day on that right now has got a capacity of 1.5 billion and we're adding contracts as we speak.  Those are the two key ones.  I can't speak <mark type="inaudible" />.  Then in terms of the processing, we will soon have a 200 million a day conditioning plant that we're building to support our Exxon contract in place by the end of the year.  By the end of the year we'll have another 650 million a day train with our Meeker II. So, all in, we will have in the Rockies just over two BCF a day of processing capacity ordered by the gathering in the Piceance Creek in Jonah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Dan Duncan again.  Let me add also, the Sherman extension in one of our long haul pipelines, that will be completed I think in the fourth quarter of this year.  That's a $400 million plus or minus pipeline, and the expansion of our Petal storage that we led, probably a pipeline from our Petal storage, you have to tie-in more people.  We think long range, if you're talking about the expansion capabilities, it's the general projects that we have on our value chain of natural gas liquids.  But also, one of our goals that we've been going for the last 2 or 3 years is getting more and more into long haul pipelines.</p>
          <p>Our import/ export terminal, we've doubled it this year.  So we'll have a lot of products coming in as you bring on more gas in the Persian, Arabian Gulf area.  I think when they had the earthquakes in Tokyo two years ago, I think those nuclear plants will be back on in early 2009, that will put a lot more LNG back on the market over here.  In effect, I think we'll get a lot of natural gas liquids from the international market that would basically come into the United States at that time.  The natural gas liquids in the United States is <mark type="inaudible" /> with our deal.  If the rest of the world doesn't want the NGL with any company in the United States, and that's also true in natural gas.  So, we see a lot of growth into our long line of business plan, when we are talking International and all of the different facilities that we are in.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys.  It's <mark type="inaudible" /> from Zimmer Lucas Partners, excellent quarter.  My question was regarding the frac spread in the Rockies on your Meeker and Pioneer plants.  I was just wondering how that compares to the spread that you had locked in with your hedging, whether you outperformed that hedged number or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we locked in, and this would be adjusted for composition.  What we locked in looking forward in the second quarter, I guess it's okay &#x2013; is a composite margin of about 56.5 cents adjusted to the fact that you have got ethane at 60 or right at around 58% of the stream.  The market today will suggest that that's going for something close to $0.65 cents.  It narrows as you get toward the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think from our standpoint, we've always maintained a pretty conservative position.  The margins were very attractive when we locked them in, we're happy with them.  We've extended some of those hedges extending out into 2009.  So, we hate to be pigs and try to get that last nickel.  We'd much rather be conservative and make sure that we have a prudent financial structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and just to confirm, when you're doing that, you are locking in both the NGL price and the gas price on equivalent volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  We're locking in -- we're doing the margin, so we're buying the gas and selling the liquids.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just to get a picture of the operating expenses on Meeker and Pioneer, I guess on a per gallon or maybe makes more sense on a per MCF basis, how does that ramp up as you increase production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't think we're prepared to talk about margins at specific plants, but obviously the more throughput you've got, the lower per unit cost on the fixed cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

          <p>All right, thanks for joining us on the call today.  As you can tell, we've got a pretty exciting story.  We've talked to you for some time now about all the new assets that we had, that we are going into service.  We still have more to come, but certainly with the first quarter you can start to see the results in terms of cash flow.  We're pretty excited about the balance of 2008, and again we're very excited about projects that we have that will be going into service in 2009 and beyond.  So, we think we got a great story and with that Randy you want to wrap it up?</p>
