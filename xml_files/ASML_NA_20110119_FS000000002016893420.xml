          <p>Please be patient. The meeting will start as soon as the moderator enters the meeting. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the ASML 2010 Fourth Quarter and Annual Results Conference Call on January 19, 2011. Throughout today's introduction, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After ASML's introduction, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Craig DeYoung. Go ahead, please, sir.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, good morning, and thank you for attending our Full Year 2010 Results Conference Call. Before we begin the Q&amp;A session, Peter and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the fourth quarter and a view on the total year. As usual, Peter will start with the review of the financial performance with comments on the short-term outlook. And I will complete the introduction with some further details on our current position, as we look back on 2010 and look forward to 2011. So, please, Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eric, and welcome to everyone. Our fourth quarter and full year numbers provided us with several financial records, including record sales profits, cash flow and system bookings. And I would like to take a moment to highlight some of these, along with some other details and observations on the fourth quarter and on the full year.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter sales came in above our guidance and set a record at &#x20AC;1.5 billion. Sales versus the third quarter grew in favor of NAND memory and Foundry customers, as they began to add further wafer capacity in these sectors. The number of dry shipments, mostly KrF, represented well over 50% of the total. As a result of this, the system mix &#x2013; new system ASP dropped slightly from around &#x20AC;24 million in the third quarter to around &#x20AC;22.4 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our service and field option sales came in just over &#x20AC;200 million, driven in part by further adoption of several of our new holistic lithography products and continued demand for various other system performance enhancement products and service products.</p>
          <p>Q4 net bookings came in at a remarkably strong 117 systems, valued at &#x20AC;2.3 billion. And let me mention here, a slight change in the definition of our booked systems and backlog. Over the course of the last several quarters, we have been closing an increasing number of long-term contracts that involve not only the lithography systems, but other sales-related items such as system options and certain services that will create sales after the tool shifts.</p>
          <p>Through the third quarter of 2010, we did not include these additional items in our systems bookings. However, due to the growing size of these additional purchases and the growing importance of our holistic litho products, and in order to better represent future sales potential, we have started to do so in Q4 and will continue to do so in the future.</p>
          <p>In reviewing the impact of this new bookings' definition on the previous five quarters, we see a high single digit percentage as a positive difference. I would like to refer to slide 15 of our Q4 results presentations to see where the strength on our Q4 bookings came from.</p>
          <p>We see a significant increased demand from NAND manufacturers representing an increase of over 200% in booked value versus the third quarter. Foundry customers showed even greater strength with a 300% increase in the booked value Q4 versus Q3. And our IDM customers reduced their order values versus Q3 by approximately 50%. But notably is also that the DRAM sector that reduced their orders versus Q3 by 40%, likely a reaction to a current supply/demand imbalance in the DRAM devices.</p>
          <p>Strength in NAND, Foundry and IDM should be considered largely in support of new fab projects, as identified on slide 18 of our fourth quarter presentation. It's important to realize that customers often commit purchase orders for critical lithography systems for new and major fab projects as early as possible in order to ensure timely system deliveries against factory expansion plans. Notably, for the first time in many years, total memory backlog, which is DRAM and NAND, represents less than 50% of our total backlog.</p>
          <p>Our near-term demand outlook firmly indicates support for another strong year. Our existing backlog plus our normal annual service sales and our expected bookings in Q1, while of course less than Q4, justifies the expectations of net sales of about &#x20AC;5 billion in 2011. As a quick final comment on cash, as reported, we're building a strong gross cash balance and expect to grow our cash balance further in the coming quarters. Therefore, we announce the implementation of a share buyback program whereby we will purchase up to an equivalent of &#x20AC;1 billion of our own shares within a maximum period of 24 months.</p>
          <p>In addition, and thanks to also our strong financial position and operating cash flows, we intend to propose to the AGM a doubling of the current dividend of &#x20AC;0.20 per share to &#x20AC;0.40 per share for 2010. And this dividend increase reflects our confidence in our prospects for a sustained long-term profitability and growth.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Eric for more on our view of the coming year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. We look back on a year of sales growth and financial performance for ASML that confirms our earlier view that the semiconductor recovery cycle was in fact strong and sustained. I think it's good to recognize that we had a good understanding of our drivers a year ago and that we managed to this expectation.</p>
          <p>We now have a backlog of orders to be delivered in 2011, which with the expected bookings to be received in Q1, justifies expectations of further revenue growth in 2011 versus 2010. The fundamental question is whether these orders will remain if the end demand suddenly collapses or whether the current demand trend will continue into 2012. It is fairly common in the history of semiconductors to see two to three years of an up-cycle. This time we are encouraged by the following factors.</p>
          <p>First, the memory lithography capacity buildup in NAND and DRAM at this moment is fairly measured. And the backlog that we have, that we showed you, does not yet support the analysts' expected end product growth for 2011. Namely, the analysts are expecting 59% bit growth for DRAM and 84% bit growth for NAND.</p>
          <p>The second factor which is positive for the future of 2011 is that the Logic capacity buildup, which occurs currently at the foundries, is certainly ahead of pure semiconductor market unit demand. But as we noted in the past, it is needed in order to put strategic capacity in place for the new 40-nanometer nodes.</p>
          <p>We estimate that the overall capacity built will sustain about 14% Logic unit growth, versus an expected 8% unit demand growth expected by analysts for 2011. So 14% capacity built, versus 8% demand growth. So in essence, if the analysts are correct, the foundries are building ahead of their need by some six to nine months, which is real, but measurable.</p>
          <p>The third positive aspect about the trend is that all semiconductor segments are accelerating the technology transition with all transition being more lithography intensive. We mentioned two or three times about the numbers of lithography layers, in particular immersion, and of course this is continuing.</p>
          <p>DRAM vendors are targeting one new node per year now, like the NAND manufacturers from 18 months per year &#x2013; 18 months every generation, leading respectively to 30-nanometre and 20-nanometre ramps in 2011.</p>
          <p>Logic transitions to 40-nanometre in volume and 30-nanometre in prototyping, and processors ramping 20-nanometre in 2011 and 2012. So this is the third positive trend.</p>
          <p>The fourth positive trend is that none of these favorable litho forecast include assumptions of potential lower yield and process control difficulties that will likely accompany these technology transitions. This is therefore a potential upside for us if the industry takes a bit more time to reach the same level of yield maturity and stability that they have been accustomed to with less aggressive technologies.</p>
          <p>So these are all the positive trends that we see and all this capacity being built is also supported by a very rich leading edge technology content in the end products themself.</p>
          <p>The drive for affordability and power swiftness device are certainly not abating, but additionally there is a wide array of new Internet connected device like the tablets, e-readers, the high-end smartphone, connected TVs and also the solid-state hard disk drive, which are biasing the demand for high-volume, high-end, high-content semiconductor device. Assuming a continuation of this technology trend into 2012, we will have to support another huge technology transition as the new technology nodes by then will require EUV development to start in earnest with significant investment in lithography capability only to support not manufacturing, but only to support R&amp;D development and qualification.</p>
          <p>We will have shipped six NXE:3100, our second-generation extreme EUV system, by the end of 2011 with revenue recognition earliest in 2012.</p>
          <p>We have received as you know, nine orders to date for our third-generation EUV tool, the NXE:3300 and this system will start delivered &#x2013; being delivered in 2012. The industry still requires a numbers of month of course to confirm the EUV performance, the plans and the roadmaps, but it is encouraging to think, to envision this as another engine of growth for 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p>In addition, and in parallel to all this, we are continuously expanding our product differentiation in immersion, in particular, with our continuously evolving NXT performance and the addition of holistic lithography suite of products.</p>
          <p>We are also improving our KrF product lines with unit throughput and overlay performance, all this necessary for sustaining the new node specification and for maintaining our market share.</p>
          <p>With all this, Peter and I would be very pleased to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&amp;A session, but beforehand, I would like to ask that you kindly limit yourself to one question with one short follow-up, if necessary. This will allow us to get as many callers on as possible. And with that, operator, may we have your instructions and then the first question, please?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Mr. Gunnar Plagge. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. It's Nomura. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations to the results. Eric, you mentioned the drivers maybe for 2012 that could provide upside to estimates. I mean on the other hand, if you look at industry tool productivity, that should also substantially go up in 2011 and '12 with the new product cycle being launched. Could you maybe talk a little bit about what you expect on the overall installed base? What are the increases that we can expect in terms of tool productivity over the next two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, thank you. Everything we simulate, in other terms, we look at the demand forecast of semiconductors, then we calculate back how many machines that are necessary to do this, are always simulated with the latest and greatest performance of our machines, as well as installed based upgraded. So we're clearly &#x2013; what we always do not mention to you is that we're selling a lot of options, which are served at upgrading installed base. And they are, in fact, usually upside. But they are clearly used to calculate the numbers of machine necessary to build the given numbers of wafers and of dyes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you give us an indication about percentage changes in &#x2013; over the next two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so you could &#x2013; at this moment, I would say we would have a family of immersion tools in the field that runs at about 150 wafer per hour. And we are planning to convert this to a family of tools doing 175. And it's not going to happen immediately in 2011, it will go well into 2012 and even 2013. But of course, when we bring EUV back in, we are going to bring machines which goes towards 120 or 125 wafer per hour. So we will re-start from this type of level, although there would be less layers processed on EU.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And as a follow-up, you haven't given us a quantitative number for the Q1 orders, and clearly you've discussed before whether it actually makes sense to give guidance on orders. But could you give us some broad color, what you expect going into Q1? What are ranges maybe that you are seeing at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me answer that question. Clearly, Q4 was an extraordinary quarter in terms of our bookings, it was clear. And many of those bookings were focused on fulfilling the needs of our customers, looking at their fab expansion requirements for 2011. Now, clearly we were surprised, hence we gave the pre-warning on the orders early December, but it also creates a situation where we think Q1 will just be a bookings quarter which will enable us to, let's say, fill up 2011 from a, let's say, shipment point of view. And the rest of the year we'll really be looking at order momentum, which will be focused on 2012.</p>
          <p>Now &#x2013; and I can hear you thinking of the next question, which we will probably not allow because it will be question number three, but I'll give you the answer anyway. It's &#x2013; on 2012, really the way that we look at it, we don't see any negatives for the year 2012. We do see positives. We do see measured investments in NAND in 2011. We definitely see Logic. There's a lot of people think there is a lot of Logic budget there, but the speed with which this Logic ramp-up will take place in 2011 will be measured also and will be largely towards the second half of 2011 and will extend into 2012. That's number one.</p>
          <p>Number two, even Eric talked about it in his introduction, there is a technology trend that is continuing continuously, which will drive the need for technology upgrades at our customers. And last but not least, that is also driven by EUV. So in 2012 we will see the EUV introduction with very high priced tools, basically starting the new generation. So in short, Q1 we'll see a finalization of our shipment pattern, and our shipment expectation of &#x2013; for the year 2011. And the rest of the year we'll be in the eye of 2012 and like I said, we see a lot of positives.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Nick Gaudois. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, it's Nick Gaudois for UBS. Just wanted to kick off with where you just left things, Peter. I mean effectively, we're seeing a standoff between Intel and TSMC, GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Samsung, LSI on CapEx. And we're seeing capital intensity for Logic and foundries combined going up for first time in ages. Do you actually think where the transfer of cyclic risk away from memory potentially to that arena? And how much does this concern you potentially for 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, like I said earlier, what &#x2013; when we look at the shipment pattern for the projects that you just mentioned for those customers, that's going to be a second half 2011 phenomena, which will actually lead into 2012. Also, if you look at the spend pattern for the foundries, don't forget that everything that is a leading edge investments today and build-out of any capacity, which is sub-65 nanometers is only by a very, very few customers, only three. Yeah, so those customers are the logic industry, with the exception of the big microprocessor maker. So in that sense, to look at that number in the context of what happened 10 years ago, is a bit difficult. And at least we're not looking at it in that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But also, Nicolas, we discussed the statistics, this large CapEx investment by the Foundry is in fact to be relativized. We only think that it will create if you add 2010, 2011 just a 14% capacity growth. Remember that in this Logic business, when you go to a 40-nanometer or so, you go towards the very large numbers of critical layers. So you need a lot of machine to do not so many wafers. So this capital intensity in dollars doesn't mean that we create a lot of capacity. So our calculation is indeed that it &#x2013; this 14% unit growth is higher than what analysts talk about, 8%.</p>
          <p>But as you know, difference between 14 and 8 is a six months or nine months digestion time, which in the environment where things have a significant yield issues and timing capacity management difficulties, et cetera, is kind of not normal.</p>
          <p>So in other terms, yes, indeed there is on paper an over-investment but it is not material as such at this moment. And that it will be eaten up into 2012 by the ramp of these new products, which will happen even if the volume of the total macro economy is not there, the mix will be there to pick them up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. I appreciate your thoughts on that. And very quick clarification, you said for the NXE:3100, no revenue commission before 2012. Did I hear you correctly? So shipments this year, but all revenue recognition in 2012 basically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's what we expect. When it's sooner, it's sooner and that's great. And then we'll let you know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Odon de Laporte. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. This is Odon de Laporte with Cheuvreux. I have a question relating size guidance in Q1. I was wondering why you looked a bit cautious. I mean your guidance for Q1 is weaker than the actual sales in Q4. So could you clarify the reason behind this conservative statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's not that conservative and it's because of the following reason. We did &#x20AC;1.5 billion in sales in Q4. There is about &#x20AC;50 million &#x2013; &#x20AC;60 million in there on billable service, which was in the fourth quarter, was a bit of surprise to us that it was really customers making up their budget for that year, which included system refurbishments at customer sites, which we normally did here in Veldhoven, now we did at the customer site. Customer are trying to monetize some of their assets that they had. They used to sell those tools to us and then we would refurbish and we would resell. That's not what we do now. It's &#x2013; so basically, we do those refurbishment at their site and we can charge a nice and good price for it.</p>
          <p>We had system relocations. Customers are shifting around systems, because they need to make place for their new leading-edge tools. And we had a lot of fast installs. Customers want those tools to be working fast and they are willing to pay nice service sums to get those tools installed. So we had, you could say, kind of a windfall sales of &#x20AC;50 million, &#x20AC;60 million in Q4.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we had about &#x20AC;75 million worth of system sales that were actually a few evaluation tools that we shipped to customers in previous quarters, that we agreed with them they could use for a few months or one or two quarters and then they would buy them. And that's what &#x2013; that happened in Q4. So you could say that the shipment was in fact, if you peel that all off, it was about &#x20AC;130 million worth of business, &#x20AC;135 million, &#x20AC;130 million worth of business. It was a bit of a windfall business. And if you take that out and the guidance of 1.4 is not conservative, it's actually you could say equal, but even a bit up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Francois Meunier. Go ahead please and state your company name as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's Francois from Morgan Stanley. Thank you very much for taking my call. Just if you could give us a bit more details about what's going on with EUV. I'm sure you're working very hard to get it production-ready with your partners on this one. What are the key milestones basically for the next few quarters? And when will you communicate on this, if you can share this with us? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, of course, this is a very important question for the future. So we &#x2013; positive milestones is that we have shipped the next-generation tool, the 3100. Positive milestone is that the customer themself have been able to make an exposure that we've published at 27-nanometer. Positive milestone is this exposure looks good. The line roughness and the process parameters in fact looks very, very encouraging that the process issues, a lot of process issues are in fact going to be acceptable. In fact, it's pretty good that immediately after the machine is delivered that they can even show such a good line, rough line, mask capability and exposure. So all this is good.</p>
          <p>Next item is we do have indeed five more of those machines, and you can see them, touch them, et cetera. All of them are being qualified at this very moment, and they are reaching a level of overlay, which is now near the target spec. And this is again difficult because this is in vacuum, so this is &#x2013; we've passed another test at the level of the machine. So on the machine side, it now seems to be fairly much under control. The negative part is we're still late improving 60 wafer per hour.</p>
          <p>At this moment, we are nearer to 10 to 15 wafer per hour than we would be to 60. This is not yet a concerning level because the customers do not need 60 wafer per hour clearly to do R&amp;D, but it would be better if we were to prove as fast as possible that we could reach this. So the positive news there is that there is now a much more detailed action plan to resolve every problem of the stage of laser basically, to get it to the power necessary. So there are issues on the pre-laser, there are issues on the &#x2013; sorry, not issues, there are solutions on the pre-laser. There is solution on the droplet performance and stability. There are solutions about debris mitigation. There are solutions about catching some of rays, which are &#x2013; how you say &#x2013; negative influence power rays. So all this is well defined and there is work to be done. So I would estimate that we could probably open a bottle of champagne in the Q3 timeframe, by which we would say this is now pass the proving time, and going into just executing time.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because I have a different &#x2013; the point is I would say there are two or three &#x2013; oh no, say four conceptual things that have to be proven, but everything else is very difficult because it is not easy to make the machine. So making one machine is a complex task. But it is a task that you can &#x2013; that are deterministic. So all the deterministic task will take time and energy and cost. The one which are less deterministic is what we've done here to improve for instance, stability of the droplet. Is it going to improve it by 50%, by 75% or by 40% only? And these are things that you have to prove. So I would guess there is another six months of work on two or three things that have to be proven to know exactly where you are on the specification.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. It's Janardan from Liberum Capital. Two questions, one is, Eric, can I just have your views on M&amp;A? I mean, what kind of things would ASML be looking for? And what kind of timeframe can you give us for when all that could be implemented?</p>
          <p>The second question is actually, if you go back 7, 8 years when your order book was quite foundry intensive, and then it became more memory intensive in the later part of &#x2013; in subsequent years. But foundries had a propensity to cancel orders, once their capacity utilization levels fell much more so than IDMs or the memory companies did, and today your foundry orders have gone up quite sharply. Would you say that there is such a risk? I mean, if we come to the second half of the year, when some of these tools are due for delivery and if something happens in the demand cycle and the utilization levels fall, would you say that there's a bigger risk that some of these orders may not materialize? Or is that more contained because the competitive environment and the requirement for technology transition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, two good strategic questions. On the first part of merger and acquisitions, the first order of business is Lithography. Clearly, at this moment, you have noticed that we've reached nearly our target of &#x20AC;5 billion of sales, which we set ourself four or five years ago or so. And it is now time to set ourself another target for the future 2015.</p>
          <p>And at this very moment, we are still calculating exactly what that number could be because again, we've had now success of meeting our target. We would like to do this again. So in other terms, they way I say it is to say Lithography is still our fundamental market and we still think there is growth to it. I just will not be able to say today whether it's &#x20AC;6 billion, &#x20AC;7 billion, &#x20AC;8 billion, &#x20AC;10 billion, &#x20AC;9 billion or whatever. So but it's still the area privileged for ASML because there is growth opportunity. But it is, in parallel, we are always looking at potential expansion to a second leg, which is a leg which will create growth opportunities. And, yes, it has to be in the area that we're good at, which is equipment, precision, high R&amp;D, long lead time, et cetera. And we have been on a regular basis looking at different options and we're continuing. I think nothing has changed on this.</p>
          <p>The acquisition themself will not be large in the sense that we don't think we can buy a company that exists today, and we can easily create growth out of it. But we think we can probably buy a smaller entity, which has a leg in a technology or a leg into an application that our size and expertise could multiply by a factor. But again, it's not a short-term item at this moment, we're continuing to invest.</p>
          <p>Regarding the foundry behavior, well every segment would cancel orders if they didn't have needs for the machines. I mean we all know that. It's a fact of life. So I would not say the foundries worse and or better than others. So if there is business, we'll use it. If there is no business, they will ask us to delay deliveries and everybody will do this. What has changed from seven years ago is at the time, the industry was more, "I need a fab and I will find a customer later," or this is what year 2000 or year 2001 or 2002. As people got crazy about &#x2013; there is no limit to applications and we just need the fabs &#x2013; we don't know where it is, but we need the capacity.</p>
          <p>I think this you don't see anywhere at all in this industry. So here we've got the point about GLOBALFOUNDRIES, TSMC and Samsung Logic who are trying to set themself a space in this business. So they have to have a critical mass size, but I would say a smallest possible critical mass, so that they can have customer. So that's what they do today. None of them have come up and say, "We think the market is going to be triple what its historical trend is." In fact, when I was able to articulate 14% growth versus 8%, it's also based on mix and it's of course based on technology. And I know exactly each products, et cetera, and which technology, and they are all based on the, I would say, historical ramp of new products.</p>
          <p>And you add to this my famous 10% &#x2013; 14% versus 8% and this is the overspend, okay. So I didn't say that if there is a major catastrophe in the microeconomic environment, all those customers including DRAM and NAND would not come back to us and say, "Your nice backlog where contractually we had to keep it of course, but could you please delay deliveries?" This will always happen, could happen in any circumstances where the economy could push it. But at this moment again, I do not see a significant over investing compared to the end product needs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Satya Kumar from Credit Suisse. Eric, I was wondering if you could remind us what your capacity plans are for the year. In Q4, it looks like the system shipments were close to &#x20AC;1.3 billion. How do you expect that to ramp through 2011? And I have a follow-up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the capacity is now reaching towards &#x20AC;1.5 billion, &#x20AC;1.6 billion of system per year. So you add &#x20AC;150 million, &#x20AC;200 million service to it. So it would be &#x20AC;1.6 billion, &#x20AC;1.7 billion capacity shipment this &#x2013; in this order.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we will ramp through efficiency. So if you say you reached by hard work &#x20AC;1.7 billion, we could probably reach &#x20AC;1.9 billion to &#x20AC;2 billion by December by quarter just through efficiency.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a quick follow-up, in terms of the Q4 orders I noticed that the IDM orders were actually down sequentially, which looks a little bit odd relative to some of the large IDM CapEx announcements we heard last week. I was wondering if you could sort of help reconcile the apparent disconnect that some might think there is between CapEx guidance versus the orders and, specifically as well, if you could talk to market share trend at these IDMs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I don't know how you make conclusions. It's very difficult with the statistics we give you about trying to understand what the big IDM does versus the other smaller ones. Remember in the statistics we give you, we put in IDMs, we put there at least three companies and each of them have &#x2013; could have impact to each other. And secondly, one of the big IDM you talk about have already booked a lot with a very long lead time. So it's absolutely reasonable for them not to have overdone it further</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Citigroup, thank you. Two things, first of all, just on that &#x2013; on that last question. Can you talk about lead times? I sort of went back through my notes and we were talking last fall about lead times sort of shrinking to the maybe, three to six-month range by now. So I'm sort of wondering where lead times stand now. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I got that. Anytime you ask that question, Tim, I confuse the whole market so I'll do another one trial at it. There is a difference of, probably your question, which is the PO lead time, which is a sort of administrative decision about when you put legal requirement and when you want the machine and then there's a lead-time, which is a manufacturing lead-time. How much time does it really take to make machines. It &#x2013; with the new machines like NXT, we're getting into a lead-time of assembly and test, which is more in the three months timeframe as we go now. So we're getting our manufacturing systems under control with this type of activity on the assumption, of course, that you have all the spare parts available so that you can assemble the machine. If you, so if you're smart and you have been able to accumulate enough spare parts, you can do it three months of manufacturing lead-time.</p>
          <p>PO lead-time is &#x2013; absolutely depend on the structure of the company. You have some very large IDMs who know so much about their business and control it very well that they would put a PO lead-time of nine months and they will continue even nine months to a year, and it will continue like clockwork. And you have PO lead times more in the Memory business, particularly DRAM, where the PO lead-time could be less than a month.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if you talk about the integral lead-time, which includes the supply chain, that's what you might be &#x2013; if you're nine to 10 months.</p>

          <p>You could, okay. Second thing from me, of the shipments, of the more than $5 billion &#x2013; more than &#x20AC;5 billion that you will ship this year or revenue this year, can you segment how much of that is for technology?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is interesting because we used to have a clear understanding of that at the moment, we knew what was the critical size of a technology buy, so that you just do a conversion. But in there, you have technology and volume and it's all mix. I'm going to shoot &#x2013; I can't answer that question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mehdi Hosseini, Susquehanna International. Thanks for taking my question. Eric, if I were to look at your commentary on 2011, probably just to look at the &#x20AC;5 billion, that would give low double digit year-over-year growth. What I want to better understand is how much of it is driven by share gain and ASP changes, especially with more immersion ship? And also, how does the mix of litho, as it overall double your fees changing? And I have a follow-up question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x20AC;5 billion will be based on share loss, to be honest at this moment. We suppose that our competitor will be able to place a certain numbers of immersion machine at a certain numbers of customers, I would say, which would make it a natural place to be. And so we assume that the &#x20AC;5 billion include this possibility. So it's a share loss compared to 2010. In terms of volume and ASP, at this moment the &#x20AC;5 billion is based on a higher ASP than 2010, because in 2010 there was in foundry a certain numbers of 65-nanometre capacity built, which required less expensive machinery. We shipped this mainly in Q2 and Q3, 2010. And this is not planned in 2011 at this moment. So then therefore, you are in the &#x2013; at this moment, the plan for the &#x20AC;5 billion is a higher immersion mix than in 2010. In addition, the NXT will represent a higher share of the immersion. As you know, NXT was above 50% in Q4, but used to be 20% of immersion in Q2 and Q3 and lower. And I think it will be more like 70%-ish in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you say that because your competitor is going to get some business, your overall share is going to be impacted? Did I understand you correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the point we are making, we don't make a surprise of it. We are early with the NXT compared to our competition. And the competition will have a certain numbers of machines shipped into their traditional customers, in certain numbers of layers, which are not ours, which are less critical layers. And this is expected. So this is not something new, but it &#x2013; this year, in 2010 &#x2013; no, last year in 2010, the machine was not ready.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we basically had virtually nothing this year. There will be something in &#x2013; sorry, in the &#x2013; virtually nothing in 2010. There will be a few tools in 2011. We don't believe it's going to be anything significant in terms of -</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it is going from zero to something, sure, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, well we kind of left out the litho mix has overall doubled your fee, but I'm going to save my follow-up for this question. Are you worried that foundries are competing for the same customer, for the same order, for the same square inches of silicon? And then to that extent, how does the technology change &#x2013; the global foundry trying to implement a new architecture? And the failure, the probability of any success or failure would impact business for you. Are those kind of risk factors or are you not concerned at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, remember that when we do our forecast for you and we say what we think we're going to ship, it's based on this overall numbers of chips, or square meters of silicon of different processes. And then we say that's what we will ship. And then we compare to the POs from the customer and this is why we told you, you're correct, in the foundry world at this moment there is an over investment probably to your point, because most of these players are trying to go after the same accounts. But the amount of over-spent is only &#x2013; I make the difference between a 14% capacity growth to a 8% capacity growth.</p>
          <p>So in other terms, 14% minus 8% equals 6%. 6% is this capacity, which is double counted or whatever that is for quoting of our customers. So two things can happen. One, they all succeed and the industry may have to live with 6% too much capacity. So you start hearing this on the wall that is, the customers themself are so keen in having multiple sources for reasons of technology and for reasons of price that they may have to sustain two partners. And this may make the two partners less efficient than they used to be. And you could discuss with those people whether that means they will have less profitability or the prices will be higher because at the end, it's a higher service. This could happen and it could be that in fact, the industry goes towards a less efficient model in using capacity. And that less efficient model will allow them, in fact, to manage peaks, which today they don't.</p>
          <p>You &#x2013; in the newspaper, you see TSMC at this moment is at capacity on critical nodes. And it &#x2013; I think it is public in the newspapers that some of their customers are looking for other areas to have their chips made. And this is a bit of a scramble at this moment, which I'm sure the industry or foundry will have to address. So this famous 6% of the spend may in fact, be here to stay as a new feature.</p>
          <p>To your next question, last question is, are we going to be impacted if one of the key players have a higher market share than the other or succeed more than the other. No, I repeat, we are going to make machines for the square meters of silicon by the end products, by the NVIDIAs, by the TIs, by the STs. So we're not fundamentally impacted by who wins.</p>

          <p>Yes, it's Deutsche Bank. Hi, good afternoon. I had two questions. The first one was, you alluded to sort of pretty strong orders already from one of your larger microprocessor makers already early in 2010. So I was just wondering, were you implying that most of the sort of CapEx raise for 2011 was essentially reflected in your order book in 2010? That would be my first question.</p>
          <p>And then my second was on EUV, also just a clarification. I think you also mentioned the quite different throughput rates in terms of wafers per hour for EUV, which will be even at target, 60 is probably materially below the current sort of 150 to 200 range of most fab lines. So I'm just wondering, does that mean that EUV will really only be deployed in brand new fab extensions or lines or can they actually be used with the existing installed capacity? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Regarding the EUV, don't misunderstand me, the generation two, which is used for R&amp;D is targeted for 60 wafer per hours. Generation number three, which is the 3300 which is targeted for production is targeted at 125 wafer per hour, which is still lower than the 150 which is the current standard of immersion, but it is irrelevant. The question is that in the buildup of a new chip and I'm going to take I would guess an obvious example, in the 2x, the low 2x DRAM, you will need a certain numbers of EUV layers, probably four, five. These layers will be done by EUV because they probably the customer may not cost effectively, sorry &#x2013; the customer may not achieve the criticality of the designs.</p>
          <p>So no matter what the cost or the speed is of EUV, they may be forced to make a 20-nanometer DRAM using an EUV machine, no matter what the speed is the throughput. And then the next layers, layer six, seven, eight, nine, ten, et cetera will be done by immersion. And the next layer by KrF and probably some layers by i-line, and as such, okay. So that's how it would work. However, on some other segments, I'm going to take an example of NAND. In NAND, say sub 20-nanometer, if EUV is cheap &#x2013; meaning if EUV is at 125 wafer per hour, then they will all run into it and say this is good stuff and they will put probably four layers on EUV. And if EUV doesn't run at 125, but runs at lower than 60, they probably will not use EUV in NAND for the 1xi and they will go for EUV on probably 1x, like 15-nanometer or under. So in other terms, there are some areas of the world, which is cost effectively impacted by EUV and EUV gets in when it's cost effective.</p>
          <p>And then some part of the world, some layers where you have no choice. So in order to know how big EUV will be, we have to be sure that we achieve 125. If we achieve 125 per wafer, it's going to be enormous. If we achieve 120, it's going to be also enormous. But if we achieve 60, it will be small, smaller.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but 60 is still okay. So we're going to have to manage the introduction of this technology in different years and catch the different layers in this way.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yeah, Pacific Crest. Just wondering, you said the immersion mix should be merger this year and I'm wondering on a unit basis, how many immersion tools can you make per quarter and what you think that might be by the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, we can do per quarter between 33 and 36 immersion tool per quarter and by the end of the year, we could go about 40 because by then, we will have enough spare parts to do parallelization that we need to do. At this moment, we don't have enough spare part to just do more than one at a time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then, on the KrF side, 25 units in Q4. Do you expect that to trend roughly flat through 2011 or be higher or lower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this moment, we expect KrF to be lower, but this is now &#x2013; I would say an upside opportunity, but we haven't called any of that at this moment. Remember, the &#x2013; since the summer, the whole environment basically is pessimistic as to what I would call volume sales, 65-nano, the Chinese business, et cetera. So we haven't got significant requests by customers to be ready with this. So at this moment, we are, I would say, at the low level of the equation.</p>

          <p>The next question is coming from Mr. Andrew Gardiner. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Andrew Gardiner from Barclays Capital. I just wanted to see if you could answer, sort of, the capacity and lead time question maybe a slightly different way.</p>
          <p>Clearly, you've seen very strong orders in the fourth quarter, but outside the official order book, I'm just wondering what level of visibility some of your key customers are giving you and perhaps what that means for lead times, in particular, given that you've &#x2013; you have been capacity constrained for the last few quarters and we've seen bookings well ahead of shipments. Are some of these key customers coming to you even earlier than before in terms of providing visibility through 2011 and maybe even beyond that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the ultimate visibility is the order. And we announced basically that we're fully &#x2013; we booked 2011. We expect some more bookings in Q1, but basically &#x20AC;5 billion is clearly identified and virtually booked. So you can &#x2013; if you're cynical, you say, well that means they're worried about you and they put some orders and they plan to cancel or push out in case because they &#x2013; because well, because you &#x2013; these are all machines, which you need to reserve. But, fortunately for us, that's not the case for multiple reasons.</p>
          <p>The first reason is that, I think we hinted this at the beginning and Peter hinted it also, is the NAND and DRAM business, which usually we do this with a reserve and then to be sure. In fact, we at this moment, know that they are under-booking. They are under-booking compared to what analysts expect them to deliver in terms of RAMs or DRAMs and Flash. So if we expect something is not a cancellation or pull out &#x2013; push out of these machines, it's more the opposite. On &#x2013; just because they need the machines to do the chips.</p>
          <p>On the Logic side, we expect &#x2013; we told you that it was more if a building up of a fab with critical mass. So normally a line, a typical line in the Logic arena should have eight immersion tool or I don't remember, it depends on the technology. So imagine eight immersion tool, they will not go for six, because it's not the critical mass, it's not efficient. So they will go for a limited critical mass and all this is well understood by our engineers and being installed.</p>
          <p>And the third piece of data that I think is important to know is at this moment most of our &#x2013; all of our customers are negotiating specifications and slotting priorities per quarter. So it is a normal thing we do. And it means you have an order, and you say we're going to ship in July. Do you need this machine or that machine? Do you need this in first week or the second week or the third week? When do you have the pedestal prepared? When is the trucks coming? What sort of plane do we put it in? And all this is being discussed with blood and sweat in a very normal way, where you can imagine that this is not the purchasing guy discussing, it's the production guy building up his logistics to it. So we &#x2013; we're talking about real activities. We're not talking about paperwork. So for this reason, we have the highest visibility, I think, ever &#x2013; that this company have ever had.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Peter Testa, One Investments. I was wondering if you could help us on slide 18, the new fab litho opportunity, to understand what sort of view and assumptions you put into those spend figures in the different categories.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The &#x2013; of course it's &#x2013; without going into the detail because that would be revealing some of the &#x2013; our customer issues. But we're very much aware, these are probably announced projects. We are aware of the size of the project, whether it's a new build, whether it's a refurb, whether there is an existing facility. We are aware of what they're doing there, the product that they want to make, so we know the mix of leading edge stuff. Mature KrF, dry ArF, i-line. And based on that mix, we basically say then they need to support that particular output that they want because all those fabs have a requirement of so many thousand wafer starts per month. We can calculate the litho need and we know the prices of the tools, so then the end result is relatively easy. That's the way we do it, Peter.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
