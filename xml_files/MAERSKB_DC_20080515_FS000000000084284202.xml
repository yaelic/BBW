          <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the A.P. Moller &#x2013; Maersk Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to your host today, A.P. Moller &#x2013; Maersk Group's CEO, Nils S. Andersen. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to this teleconference in connection with the interim management statement which was released earlier today at 1 o'clock Danish time. My name is Nils Anderson, and I am the Group CEO of the company, and with me today also our Group's CFO, S&#xF8;ren Thorup S&#xF8;rensen, and together we will walk you through the presentation, and after the presentation, we will open up for Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>You will be able to find the full interim management statement and together with this presentation on our homepage maersk.com and I suppose you all found that. But before we start, just let me say that we are pleased the result. It shows, we believe, the strength of the group but it is just one quarter and we do appreciate that we have a challenging year ahead. And, in this spirit, please read the waiver on page 2. So, if you have all read it, let's keep the agenda and go directly to page 4.</p>
          <p>On page 4 which are the highlights; the net profit for Q1 increased to U.S. $1.1 billion, up from U.S. $390 million in the same period in 2007, and the improvement in result was mainly driven by result from our oil and gas activities, which was considerably above the first quarter 2007; of course, due to the higher oil prices and also progress in volumes. We also posted higher gains on sale of vessels, mainly gain &#x2013; or mainly driven by gain of more than 200 million from the transaction we made with H&#xF6;egh Autoliners where we sold our car carrier activities, gotten &#x2013; got a profit on that and in return obtained a 37.5% stake in H&#xF6;egh Autoliners, which going forward will be treated as an associated company in the Group.</p>
          <p>Also worth noting is that the Container Business traded above the result in 2007 first quarter. We recorded both higher volumes and higher rates, but needless to say, we were of course also impacted by significantly higher bunker cost and some non-recurring cost related to streamLINE initiatives. I will come back to the details around this in a minute.</p>
          <p>But, on the next slide, S&#xF8;ren will guide you through the key figures for the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>On this page, we have provided key financial information in U.S. dollars and as mentioned in the presentation of the Annual Report in March, reporting and commenting on the numbers in U.S. dollars is most relevant since approximately 70% of our business activities have U.S. dollar as the functional currency, but for your easy reference, we've also included the results in Danish krone in the appendix to the presentation.</p>
          <p>If we first look at the revenue line; the revenue for the first quarter increased by 31% compared to the same period last year. The increase was mainly due to significantly higher oil prices as well as higher freight rates and volumes in the Container Business. Looking at the profit before depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, this was 78% higher &#x2013; driven by increased oil prices and increased production in the oil and gas activities. Looking at depreciation and amortization, it increased by 7%, while sales gains increased from $89 million in first quarter of 2007 to $417 million in first quarter of 2008, driven by &#x2013; as Nils just mentioned &#x2013; the sale of the car carriers with a gain of $206 million, but also sale of 3 container vessels and 1 very large crude carrier in our tanker segment. Earnings before interest and tax, or EBIT, increased to $3 billion and net profit increased to $1,050 million. Looking at the operational cash flow, it increased by 35% to 2.1 billion and the investment cash flow was at the same level as the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Now, Nils will go through the development in the Container Business, so please turn page number 6.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>The net profit for the Container Business was negative with U.S. $47 million and that was after 58 million which are non-recurring of course cost regarding the streamLINE but also after gains on sale of ships of 141 million and this is the result of 47 compared to a negative result &#x2013; sorry, the loss of 47 million compared to a negative result of 198 million in the same period last year where we had gains of sales of ships of approximately 58 million so &#x2013; but when I try to clean it out then we can say the underlying profit of the Container Business was up with approximately U.S. $120 million. The average freight rates were, if we include the bunker adjustment factor, 13% above the same rate level for the same period in 2007. If we exclude the bunker adjustment factor, the increase was only 5%. We have had considerable rate increases compared to last year in the first three months on the most important freights from Asia to Europe and it is worth &#x2013; but it is worth noting that from the beginning of 2008 the tonnage supply on these freights have increased and that is putting some pressures on the rates.</p>
          <p>The total volumes for Maersk Line and Safmarine together increased by 4% to 1.7 million FFEs and we had &#x2013; continued to see growth from Asia to Europe with an increase of 7%, and we had, as expected because we reduced our coverage in the American market, the volumes on the Transpacific drop by 18% and apart from these two very important trade links, the routes on average in rest of the world had a growth of 11%.</p>
          <p>Bunker prices continued to increase further and on average they were 65% above the level in the first quarter in 2007 and the increase, of course, had a significant negative impact on the result of the container activities, although a number of initiatives to reduce fuel consumptions and increase fuel surcharges from customers have been taken, and we actually see better BAF collection than we have seen previously. We also see increasing cost levels, bunker cost, and lower dollar exchange rate were the main drivers for the 8% increase in total unit cost. As mentioned before, the total sales gain of U.S. $141 million was above the level of 58 million in the same &#x2013; in the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>On the &#x2013; you can say, in addition to the positive improvement in results, we are pleased that we have managed to now get the new organization in place. That does not mean of course that everybody have left yet but we have reduced a number of positions in the new organization, by approximately 3,000 people which corresponds to around 15%. Going forward, of course, now the focus will be on customer satisfaction, increased capacity utilization, and in general cost efficiency. Also, as mentioned before, we expensed U.S. $58 million in the first quarter out of the expected 250 million that we have said &#x2013; or estimated that the total cost, one-off cost would be. We expect the majority of the remaining 190 million to be paid out during second quarter of 2008 but the affected persons will leave up till the year.</p>
          <p>So please turn to page 7 where we cover APM Terminals. This is the first time we cover APM Terminals in details on a separate basis or separated out from the Container Business. It's reflecting the standpoint that the Container Business now is a very important standalone business. It is no longer reporting into the Container Business but to me directly, and we think this is very important for us to focus on it as an individual business going forward and, therefore, in the future we'll also separate the figures out.</p>
          <p>Turnover in APM terminals increased by 27% in U.S. dollars compared to the same period in 2007; 5% of this is due to the weakened U.S. dollar's exchange rate and is contrary to actual container shipping. A lot of the expenses for terminals are actually paid and in yet income paid in non-U.S. dollar currencies.</p>
          <p>The activities, when we weighed by ownership share and measured by number of crane lifts, increased by 10%. We had a drop of approximately 2% in North America and a growth in the rest of the world of approximately 13%. The increase in the average rate &#x2013; which you get when you take the 27% discount, the 5% of U.S. dollar effect and the 10% growth in number of lifts &#x2013; the remaining rate increases are driven by some tariff increases but also to a large extent by change in geographical mix, and there is also an effect &#x2013; it's a bit hard to calculate &#x2013; which comes from the fact that we have seen &#x2013; in some cost center terminals we've seen declines and here Maersk Line is actually paying for the full activity of that terminal. Net profit was above that of the corresponding period in 2007.</p>
          <p>So, please turn to page 8 and S&#xF8;ren will take you on from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>On this slide, we give the highlights for the segment called Tankers, offshore and other shipping. During the first quarter, Maersk contractors took delivery of 350-foot jack-up rig, so-called M&#xC6;RSK RESILIENT, which will work on a contract offshore Dubai and the conversion of the jack-up rig M&#xC6;RSK INSPIRER to a combined drilling and production platform was also completed and the rig started on its contract.</p>
          <p>Additional 3 rigs and 1 FPSO are expected to be delivered during 2008; however, due to the heated offshore market, some delays must be expected. Also in this segment, our sale of car carrier activities to H&#xF6;egh Autoliners resulted in a sales gain in the first quarter of $206 million. From March 2008, APM owns 37.5% of H&#xF6;egh Autoliners and the company is consequently included as an associate company in the accounts.</p>
          <p>If we look at Maersk contractors' operational activities, all the drilling rigs and production units were employed during the first quarter of 2008 and that was not the case in the corresponding period 2007 and the average rate level was higher. The net result was, therefore, somewhat above that of the same period last year.</p>
          <p>For Maersk Supply Service, the rate level was somewhat above that for the first quarter of 2007 and the result before sales gains was also somewhat above. If we include sales gains, the result was at the same level.</p>
          <p>Maersk Tankers has experienced a weak winter market. New tonnage entering the market and the mild winter resulted in generally lower rates for tankers compared to the same period last year. The net result was below that of the same period last year, both before and after sales gains.</p>
          <p>If we look at Svitzer, the revenue was significantly above that of the same period 2007 due to the acquisition of Adsteam effective from 15th of March last year. The result for Svitzer for the period was slightly below that of the corresponding period 2007, mainly due to increased financial expenses. For the total segment, the result was somewhat above that for the corresponding period last year.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide regarding the oil and gas activities. The Group's share of oil and gas production was in first quarter about 20% above that of the corresponding period 2007, positively affected by higher production in Qatar and negatively affected by lower production in Denmark and Great Britain. The average Brent dollar price for the period was at $97 per barrel, 67% above the price for this first quarter 2007 as also illustrated on the slide. The period's depreciation and amortization was the same level as in the first quarter of 2007. Taxes increased to 1.6 billion which was significantly above the same period last year, but the net profit also is significantly above last year.</p>
          <p>Just to mention the Qatar field where we have the significant development program of more than $6 billion, that is proceeding according to the plans. As we mentioned in the Annual Report 2007, production from the Janice field in Great Britain is closed and the field is expected to start producing during the second quarter of 2008. As also noted in our interim management statement, our sensitivity has changed so I will ask you to turn to page number 10.</p>
          <p>In the Annual Report for 2007, we illustrated our sensitivity to changes in oil prices, and as a rule of thumb, the short-term net effect on the A.P. Moller &#x2013; Maersk Group of an oil price increase of $10 would be an increase in cost of around $40 million, everything else being equal and before the effect of hedges. However, since then, a number of factors have changed our short-term oil price sensitivity. While our crude oil production is expected to be around the same level as in 2007, reduced bunker consumption from slow steaming, higher bunker adjustment factor collection, and a widening crack have led to, everything else being equal and before the effect of hedge contracts, that the result for 2008 now would be neutral or slightly positively affected by the increase in oil prices.</p>
          <p>So, after this, Nils will now present the outlook for 2008 and please turn to the next page.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you can see in the headline, our expectations for 2008 remains unchanged. We do expect to have &#x2013; achieve revenue to the tune of U.S. $60 billion against a figure of 51 billion last year, and we do maintain our expectations for net result in the area of 3.6 to U.S. $4 billion against the figure of last year at 3.4 billion. The estimate does include one-off cost, as I said previously, of around $250 million related to streamLINE, and we do expect to have total gains -obviously included the ones that we already had here under Ultra liners &#x2013; to be below the 2007 level. It's &#x2013; we have stated also in the Annual Report, as you may recall, we stated that there is a possibility that we will sell shares in a non-strategic asset; it is still being contemplated and if such a sale is completed in 2008, it may improve the result with a figure in the order of 800 million which would not be included in the figures of 3.6 to 4 billion. But of course, it is early in the year. The increased bunker prices will continue to be a significant challenge, even if it is at the moment offset by higher oil prices and higher oil production and the general economic environment that we go into on a global level continues to be very, very uncertain. Which means that we expect for 2008 that the container market will grow below last year.</p>
          <p>But please turn to page 12 and where I will just take you through the status of our main focus areas for 2008 and the status of those. We started disclosing these in the teleconference in March, but we feel this is what will actually drive progress in the company during the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Restoring Maersk Line profitability continues to be our top priority and as I said earlier, although we feel that the first quarter is positive because the result was better than last year, there is no question we're still not where we want to be. But we are now through the streamline process at least in terms of define the organization in making arrangements, who is staying, who is leaving, so we now will have more resources to focus on actually delivering on our customer promises and winning in the market. And we feel that our latest improvement in customer satisfaction, figures actually reflect the progress in this area as well.</p>
          <p>APM Terminals, which is an investment area for us, we're working very hard to secure the success of course for the current business portfolio, improving earnings, ensuring that that the 30 new projects are getting well underway and then focuses very hard on getting increased third-party volumes, especially in the U.S. But generally, it is a key priority for the terminals business to get more third-party business in, and we feel that we're getting more and more acceptance in the market for this.</p>
          <p>We have taken delivery of the first two rigs in Q1 in contractors. Both have started operations on the longer-term contracts and so far so good. It is fair to note here that the oil and gas sector is very, very heated at the movement and it is quite a challenge to get rigs and other equipment out on time. So there is a good chance of unfortunate risk that there maybe some deliveries for those rigs which we haven't take possession of yet.</p>
          <p>The field development which is point four, the fuel development in Qatar is progressing as planned. And just coming back to what I said before, in the heated environment, this we feel is quite an achievement. And on a more anecdotal level, I can say that we have just completed the longest well in the world, which was more than 40,000 feet, which is beating a 20 year-old record and also this well was a new world record for the longest horizontal well, 9,000 feet longer than the previous one.</p>
          <p>So again on an anecdotal level, something to celebrate. The last point which we have been focusing on and will focus on during the year, safety and environment. The whole organization is working very hard on safety matters. We feel we are making good progress.</p>
          <p>As some of you will have noted, we have also taken upon ourselves to play a leading role in the discussion around Maritime emissions, and have played we think an important role in the position of IMO in the recent initiative to reduce fuel or reduce sulfur emissions in coastal areas, which we are quite proud of.</p>
          <p>So this was the last in our short presentation for this interim statement. Thank you for listening, and we will now hand you over to the operator for the Q&amp;A session. Thank you for listening.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question comes from Tim Marshall from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, I just had three questions if that's okay. First one is to do with the oil exploration, I think the production growth in Qatar is stellar, but I'm wondering if you could just talk us through some of the progress in the exploration and particularly I know there's been a lot in the press about the Santos Basin in Brazil which is an area where you have some exposure. The second question was on the unit costs where including the fuel it was up 8%, firstly am I right to assume that ex fuel it was actually down around 6% and if you can talk us through what the costs are doing outside of fuel and how much of that is benefiting from the streamline. And then thirdly, I was just interested in your comments on the mix effect within APM Terminals, you were suggesting something about the hubs, I would suspect that the mix benefit is coming because there is more growth outside the hubs and is that due to Maersk Lines cost identification in terms of doing less hubbing through the sort of five or six key hub ports that you have? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, there is not a lot I can say about the oil exploration that is not public, for good reasons. If we find something, it's quite crucial. But we are &#x2013; we do expect to drill some wells in Angola this year, which is a total new &#x2013; new area for us, we gotten a couple of plots down there that we can drill and the plan is to do the first wells this year. In Brazil, as you refer to, we've also gotten a number of plots, we are not &#x2013; we are not quite sure on when we will start drilling yet, but it's definitely not going to be before 2009, and this is also a new area for us, although we via Maersk Contractors have worked there before, and we are in &#x2013; going in, in partnership with established players in the market. And that's unfortunately all I can say at the moment. We of course &#x2013; we have just published a find in the Danish North Sea and the normal drilling activities in the known areas is progressing according to plan, we're quite pleased with that.</p>
          <p>And then you asked about the unit cost in Maersk Line. I cannot give you the exact percentage simply because I haven't calculated it excluding fuel, but it is correct, it should be correct that excluding fuel the cost should be down, and that is you can say even before we have actually started cutting the number of people in Maersk Line, but there has been a cost drive, which was initiated in the budget process last year, which is progressing well. On APM Terminals, it's not necessarily that we're using less hubs as Maersk Line. We do believe that the hubs, or the way we use them is the most efficient way to do it, but you have seen a drop in business in the U.S., and in the U.S. we have a number of the terminals operating as cost centers, and that's &#x2013; that's the main reason for this mix change.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="audio gap" /> (28:32-29:58)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was question number one; secondly I would like to get a comment on the outcome of the Trans-Pacific negotiations. Will the freight rates be lifted so that Maersk Line will be profitable on the Trans-Pacific this year? Also I would like if you for the first time will announce status for hit hold utilization in general and specific perhaps on the Westbound going from <mark type="inaudible" />. Third a question on A.P. Moller Terminals, any comments on third-party volume development and can you confirm a new contract for Pier 400 in Los Angeles and finally I would also you said heated environment when we talk about the semi SOPs and the rigs, is that also the issue for the five remaining LNG carriers from Samsung yards and could you perhaps indicate what your expected return on invested capital is on this major LNG investments backed in &#x2013; that you won't have to done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, there were some quite a lot of questions but I will try to run through them, the &#x2013; on the first one we really don't have a lot of comments which are on the individual fields in the U.K., we don't disclose these figures and if we had an expectation for significant developments in the U.K. we would rather disclose it in the quarterly statement than here so there is not a lot we can say and on the Trans-Pacific negotiations I can say that we are seeing good acceptance of the Maersk Line bunker adjustment factor, so that means that we are recovering more in the adjustment factor than we have done previously and we are also seeing improved rates. Obviously not to the tune we would have liked, but the results on the Trans-Pacific should improve for us as a Group and hopefully for the industry, which is also necessary since the industry has been losing money on the Trans-Pacific for years and so it &#x2013; so rate improvements are really a must have.</p>
          <p>On specifically, hit hold figures for &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> going West, I can't give you that to you at the moment and I also don't think if something that we want to get into all these details here but in general, our utilization is more or less in line with last year, it all might be or slightly below last year, given the additional tonnage we've gotten in and the backhaul is better so roundtrip utilization is better.</p>
          <p>On APM Terminals, I can confirm that we are a &#x2013; we are seeing progress on third-party business, we are seeing &#x2013; we are getting a very positive reception from our customers, the customers &#x2013; third-party customers they worked with us are very satisfied so we feel confident that we can deliver on increased figures for that but we don't want to confirm any particular individual business gains in Pier 400. In terms of the heated environment, this is mainly in the rig &#x2013; in the rig area and you can say specialized oil installations like FPSOs and stuff like that and we don't expect any significant delays on the &#x2013; from Samsung on delivering our LNG ships and you asked for the &#x2013; for the internal rate, a return on that, and we don't really give that figure out for individual investments, but thank you for asking.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello gentlemen. I wonder if you can explain to me a little bit about what's going on in the different container trades. You said you could have followed the 18% over last year in volumes in transpacific but I'm wondering how much of that's something if you like planned for? How much that's unexpected? How much it reflects weakness in the U.S. economy and how much has secure reduced exposure to that market? And also I'm interested in how strongly you think you are going &#x2013; how strong you think the Asia/Europe trade is going to be for the rest of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, we believe off course that the 18% decline we have seen on the Pacific is planned, if I am not remembering incorrectly, we took 30% of our capacity out of the transpacific, we have done some vessel sharing agreements so that should be in line with &#x2013; with what we expected. In terms of the &#x2013; of the European or Asia/Europe trade, we definitely don't expect to see growth like last year but we still continue to see nice growth rates coming out of Asia to Europe.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I want to follow-up on a couple of things that have already been covered. First on the transpacific, you said you had some rate increases, is it &#x2013; are they enough to get that trade at least back in to break-even?</p>
          <p>And secondly on the Asia-Europe trades, you just said the volumes are increasing, but as I understand it, lines haven't been able to get any freight rate increases so far this year. So are things on that trade sort of, perhaps weakening faster than you might have expected a few weeks or months ago and is that going to have an impact on your full year outcome?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the transpacific &#x2013; thank you, Janet, on the transpacific for us it's a little bit early to say whether we will get back on break-even level on the transpacific but we are seeing rate increases and we are seeing better VAT collection; having said that, if the bunkers continue to grow up, it will be very hard to reach break-even because obviously we don't get full coverage.</p>
          <p>And on the Europe or Asia-Europe trade, we actually see &#x2013; see rates that are nicely above last year in the first quarter, but as you know here we don't do annual negotiations, so it is more on a flexible basis. So we will see where &#x2013; where we are in for the year, but there are of course some uncertainty, but our rates are better then last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I realize they are better year-on-year in the first quarter, but then last year the rates went up very dramatically during the year and this year...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...I gather they are not going up, so whereas &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> has hoped to raise rates on April 1, so I just wondered whether that is going to effect your &#x2013; is sort of perhaps weakening more than you might have expected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we &#x2013; we actually we believe that we can continue to have an acceptable rate level, but to predict for the full year I think in this is just not possible due to the nature of the trade, but our rates in the first quarter of 2008 was actually &#x2013; were also above the rate level of fourth quarter last year. So we are not &#x2013; we are not unhappy with the trend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But Janet, as we pointed out in our statement, you can see that the tonnage supply in 2008 has increased on the trades and it's been putting some pressure on the rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, now that is what I was following up on. I just one other question, obviously you had APO results out yesterday, which seemed to at least produce a very strong result, you're not &#x2013; can you say a little bit more about where you are still &#x2013; where the real black holes are, I mean for example are you still having problems on invoicing and errors in billing and that sort of thing or can you elaborate a little bit more about &#x2013; about your performance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we can &#x2013; we are not seeing problems on invoicing, I mean the occasional problem may occur, but I think we are up to global standard on that for sure, we are seeing very good figures from feedback from the customers, so we feel we are out of that problem area, we have carried through a major restructuring in the first quarter, I think it's hard to avoid that having a certain negative effect on the business but our job now is really getting focused on the markets, delivering on what we promised to the customers and then we feel confident that our figures will improve going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you be back in good Maersk Line or the container division be back in the black for the full year rate?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we had anything to add to the statement on that Janet, we would have done it.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Menno Sanderse from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey good afternoon gentlemen. I will take them one by one if that's all right with you. Obviously a fantastic growth in share of production about 20% in the first quarter, but you mentioned in your statements and also in the annual reports that, you expect the APO amount of share of production for the full year to be roughly the same as in '07, where do you see the rapid slowdown taking place, because in the first quarter, you were 20% higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's, we are seeing a decline in production in the mature areas, which are Denmark and the U.K. and then we have had a very good ramp up in Qatar, which is now up to a higher level, and that took place in the first quarter. So, that is the &#x2013; that is the reason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the year-on-year comparison you should see there was a &#x2013; there was a ramp up happening in Qatar also in 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, it's an easier comp and therefore the year-on-year comparisons will become a little bit difficult than the 20%....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Secondly, on obviously the comments, sorry to labor this point, but on Asia to Europe, obviously the company knew their new tonnage was coming into the market in the beginning of the year and the last time you spoke in the market on the 13th of March, have any of the fundamentals on that trade changed in your view since the 13th of March?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we I think it's a &#x2013; it's a trade that changes by the minute almost and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And but &#x2013; but we don't see &#x2013; we are keeping our forecast for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly at the same level as we said in March. So, we don't believe that there is a any reason for changing our expectations for the full year based on what goes on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. So, I understand that the line that you &#x2013; that the company put in the statement, it's really because you haven't really no visibility there that you put a line or this line in your statement rather than you have things dramatically different than the company saw them on the 13th of March?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. And &#x2013; and then two smaller ones. The operating cash flow increased nicely by 35%, but not as nicely as the EBITDA and the net profit. Is that something to do with the phasing of working capital or is there something else in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in looking at that &#x2013; there are more elements of something like the timing of the tax payments that is one point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another point is that when the bunker prices go up so dramatically, the amount of money tied up in the bunker fuel on both the vessels, which of course is part of working capital is also going up and then there is the development in receivables. So, these are the elements that is impacting the difference between the growth in EBITDA and the operating cash flow, but due to the fact that taxes are so high in the oil and gas segment, you have to adjust for the taxes to do that comparison.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. So, for the full year we should expect a growth in that cash flow more in line with the EBITDA taking into account some working capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then we would probably have given some guidance on it if we were ready to say that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the issue is simply...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That the cost inflation or the inflation in bunker prices leads to higher prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which leads to higher outstanding and freight and secondly that we have obviously higher cost for the bunker and fuel tanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, that's understood. That's clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if the oil price or the bunker price starts coming down or stagnates where it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then the comparisons will be easier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Easier. Understood. Okay, thanks, and then finally on streamLINE obviously, the organizations in place, the cost have been taken in the second quarter. So in the second quarter, should we start to see a substantial contribution from these savings already? Or would you say that only in Q4 are we at a run rate of a 100% of the savings that the company expects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well actually people will leave during the year, we finished the announcements in I believe it was the first week of May, the last names and agreements went out. So it will happen during the year, but the figure should start or the money should start coming in slowly in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then one final one, just to clarify the oil plant sensitivity. These &#x2013; I think it's the one but last slide, that comment, is that taking into account the movement in the crack spread already but it is pre-hedging, pre-hedging as said on this slide. But it takes into account...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Into account and change in crack, but it's pre-hedging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, excellent. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mark McVicar from Dresdner Kleinwort.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions on the Container business. Obviously in the first quarter, volume growth 4%, utilization flat, therefore that was about your capacity growth. Is that the right sort of number to be using as your capacity growth for the year? Or do you have an acceleration or deceleration in capacity growth through the balance of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question. We took delivery of eight, net eight vessels in the first quarter. I think the growth will be more or less equal during the year. So we'll get probably around 30 vessels during the year, more or less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's also getting time charters giving a certain flexibility on the development over the year. So you should be little careful in just exchanging this and expanding it throughout the year. It gives flexibility both capacity up and down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay but kind of 4 to 5% is not a bad place to be at the moment sort of things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not a bad place to be. The nominal capacity increase will be higher, but we are slow steaming which takes some capacity out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. And my other question was obviously, you haven't and I guess you are not going to give us a number for the streamline cost saving, the absolute number you have to take out of the business, but if can ask it in other way &#x2013; how are you internally going to measure the benefits that coming out of streamLINE?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are going to measure it when we see the budget for next year, and we do expect a significant costs saving on personnel and other costs related to the number of employees we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And do you think personnel is going to be the majority of the saving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that would be the majority of the saving, yes. But don't forget that there is also an impact coming hopefully from better rates and less disturbances in delivery, and so on, just fixing the business I would say will fixing the business, but fixing the underlying operations delivering what we said, no mistakes in invoicing and stuff like that, that in itself will of course also reduce costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just coming back to utilization, I know you don't especially disclose it in detail. Where do you think you could actually run Maersk Line in terms of head-haul utilization? What, could it be run at 90, 95?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that is another good question, which we can't give you a real figure for now, but we think we can do better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Peter Rothausen from Kaupthing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Peter Rothausen from Kaupthing, a couple of question, I will take it one by one. In respect of the oil division we have seen a large increase in the taxation, does this reflect that the entitlement of Qatar is more or less flat so that the high taxation from the contract that you are having is reflected in the tax rate. Or can you explain maybe the link between the production figures and the taxation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on this statement there is no need to go into that level of detail. But I think it's fair to say that a significant part of the growth in earnings that we have in the oil division is being taken up in taxation and of course that's driven by the mix of production in Qatar, in Denmark, in the U.K. and Algeria which all have different tax rates. So, it's probably a little complicated with the amount of disclosure we have on a quarter to provide that level of detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But would it be fair to say that the entitlements here versus 2007 is unchanged and due to the cap profitability you have on that contract that you are being hurt on the tax rate this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the figures as far as I can read them don't show an increasing tax rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more decreasing?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the second question. In terms of Maersk Line going back to the utilization, just to clarify you said around 4% closing in capacity during the first quarter, but more or less is coming in and you also said that you will see higher nominal growth for the year. Is that in the range of the 4 to 5 or is it probably closer to the 10% closing...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've not said anything about higher growth for the year and the figure of 4% was actually coming from the person asking the question, not from me. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So numbers from Maersk Line are published recently suggests that you have a &#x2013; that you will have a capacity close of more than 10% this year. Maybe if you can comment on those figures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We normally don't give a lot of comments on other people's projections on how our capacity is going to develop over the year. I think it's fairly easy to see the number of new buildings that are coming in over the year. Of course, the flexibility, we as a liner company have, is to use staggering of our time charters when they expire. So either if we have too much capacity, not to renew a time charter, and if we need more capacity to go out in the time charter market to get some other vessels. So, giving that sort of predictions here, that's far too early in the year.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have a couple of questions; the first one is on the EBITDA. I understood that you said that the increase in EBITDA from &#x2013; for the first quarter last year was solely due to high oil prices and high oil productions. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that is also impacted by, if you look into Maersk Line, higher volumes and higher rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sales gains on vessels. So, that's &#x2013; that's included in that number. <mark type="inaudible" /> (51.22) So, there is a general increase in the EBITDA in Maersk Line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. Have you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think, that was, if you look into the slide number 5 that was discussed there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm afraid I haven't got the slide...technical reasons, I'm sorry about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is, are there any hedge done on oil prices within Maersk Line for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't do oil hedges within Maersk Line; we do oil hedges on group level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But effecting Maersk Line's result.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it will not be coming into the Maersk Line results, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last question, you grew 7% on the Asia, Europe and I understand that the market was up 11%. So, is that because you have been growing less &#x2013; your capacity has been growing slower than the market? Or are you are losing market share? Or are there is any explanation for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; our capacity is definitely moving slower than the market is. We moved quite sizable amounts of capacity to the Asia-Europe freight last year, and at the beginning of this year our competition, various competitors have opened new routes and so there is quite a lot of additional tonnage coming into the market. So yes, we are &#x2013; our growth in tonnage has been less than total market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Mike Beckett from Containerization, Inc. (53.09).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon gentlemen. The looking at APM Terminals, you say that net profit was above that for the corresponding period 2007, will you be revealing what that &#x2013; that profit was in later accounts? That is my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question really with the acute shortage of equipment in the U.S. we are hearing of report of six weeks to book containers et cetera. Is there any intention of Maersk Line to resume or increase capacity on the basis that you have actually cut 30%? That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; if a profitable market is there, then we will look at going in. It's true that there is a lack of capacity, or lack of equipment in the U.S. It is partly because of changes in the trade pattern because the U.S. now starts to export more. So you will find a lack of equipment in a number of U.S. states and we will of course look at that because we are interested in getting obviously the back haul trade better utilized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Dan Togo from Handelsbanken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good afternoon. A couple of questions as well. Could you please explain or give some indication of how you see the net profit in the Q1 for the Group &#x2013; or the profits for the group, is it in line with what you had seen at the start of the year or is it slightly better or slightly worse? And also, on, especially on the Asia-EU trade, could you elaborate a bit on how much of your capacity is slow steaming as it is right now. And finally in your guidance and expectations for the full-year is it still the same line of vessels that you have for sale; meaning have you changed in anyway your expectations for capital gains and sales gains in the full-year guidance? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan. The profit, which we're seeing is in line with what we expected when we came out with our Annual Report. In terms of vessels for sale we have not changed anything at the moment. We don't really see a lot of new trends we didn't expect two months ago and basically all our vessels on long haul are slow steaming to a certain extent. So all the Asia-Europe vessels would be running at a reduced speed, which is by the way still quite fast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Lars Heindorff from ABG Sundal Collier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, afternoon gentlemen. Couple of questions as well, the depreciation in the oil and gas division, you've stated it's in line with the same period last year. Last year we saw that the depreciation increased significantly from the first half to the second half. Could you give us an indication about whether you expect depreciation to increase significant during the course of year, whether it is going stay flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on that one I think it's fair to say that the depreciation per barrel is quite different between the different countries and especially in the U.K. where what we have there is based on the acquisition from 2005. So, I think it's not strange to see that relatively unchanged even though the production is going up, because the relative depreciation per barrel is lower in Qatar than it is in the U.K.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And regarding the oil price sensitivity, could you give us an indication post hedging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And lastly...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then we would have done it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lastly, with the development that we now see in some of these trades &#x2013; slightly deteriorating rates in Asia-Europe and as you've stated an improvement in the Pacific. If you look a bit further ahead, I mean, could there be any plans of moving capacity back to the trade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would not exclude that we would move capacity back to the Pacific and the Atlantic routes, if we see that there is, more profits to be made. But the trans-Pacific has been unprofitable for the carriers for years and years. And as I said in my speech at the Trans-Pacific Maritime Conference in Los Angeles at the beginning of the year: unless, the carriers are allowed to make profits, there is no need for us to add capacity to the trade. And I think that statement stands unchanged. And the trade is still relatively unprofitable; it's not growing significantly given the situation in the U.S. What may affect it positively is an increased backhaul business overtime. But the business is still very, very badly balanced. So, going back to last year you would be like having one-third of the containers going out &#x2013; going back with cargo in them. So, you need quite a lot of growth, because &#x2013; before you really significantly change the economics of the trade. But we will do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers and give them good service, but of course it requires us making a profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ok, and then a lot of the &#x2013; you've made a lot of vessel-sharing agreements recently, particularly, on Asia-Europe. So that &#x2013; does that sort of tie you up in terms of flexibility compared to &#x2013; to earlier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say that. The vessel-sharing agreements were made, by the way, was made first on the Trans-Pacific because of the poor profitability, less on Asia-Europe, and we don't feel that they restrict our capability to change if we want to &#x2013; but of course we have to respect the agreements also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Steven Brooker from Enskilda Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, gentlemen. Just a question on supply and demand, you've been talking about this slow steaming for sometime and the whole industry has been talking about slow steaming. How much capacity has been taking out? Is it that you're adding one vessel more in a string and are you adding 8 to 10% more &#x2013; is the reduction 8 to 10% on an overall industry basis or what is going on because what we can see of course is the 16 to 17% more capacity set to be delivered this year, and let's just for the sake of argument say that demand would be 7 or 8%, this should then suggest that the freight rates could come under pressure but everybody is talking about slow steaming, how has it affected your network?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very, very difficult to answer in general. If you have a market which is, you could say, operating close to the capacity limit, you add a vessel. If you have a market where you have &#x2013; where there is excess capacity, you may just reduce the frequency of sailing, so it's &#x2013; so it's very different,. Also it depends on how much you actually reduce your speed. In some cases, slow steaming will be taking just one knot off and then it's only 5% so it's a very different and I think when everybody talks about slow steaming, then it's really an indication of a strong necessity to save fuel. It's not that it's any specific number that we all go for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and your bunker adjustment factor &#x2013; your recovery factor, I think that &#x2013; that the full year report when you gave guidance for 2008, you talked about a recovery factor of 50%, has that changed significantly or because you are changing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that figure has come up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the last question is on &#x2013; in U.S. Coast Inland but also and on your terminals, this Vessel Sharing agreement you made on the Trans-Pacific will that overtime increase your utilization in your ports? Are you moving &#x2013; will MSC and the other liner move their capacity away from other terminals into your terminals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As a general principle, when we make vessel sharing agreements, that is not linked to anybody having an obligation to use APM Terminals. Even today, the line apart from its contracted obligations, you can say the so called cost center, have no obligation to use APM Terminals so there is no link there whatsoever. In some cases we will lose business and in some cases we will gain business. So that is up to APM Terminals to be the best offer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the final question in inland distribution in the U.S. you cut down on your delivery points and also on your tariff significantly in 2006 coming into 2007, have you started to grow that business? Are you seeing better volume intake than what you saw last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're seeing significantly better profitability in the U.S. business, and we may reopen certain points, but that is a day to day work, there is no drive to reopen you can say a major number of points. So, it's &#x2013; if it's convenient then we will do it, or if it's profitable then we'll do it, but there is no change in direction as such.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing, it's fair to say that the outlook for the U.S. economy is somewhat uncertain as we speak. So -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we'll take the last two questions now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The next question comes then from Brian B&#xF8;rsting from LD Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. A couple of question please. The first one regarding oil and gas. Do you expect any quarter in '08 to see decline in production? I know that you see declining production in Denmark, and also in the U.K., but Qatar was the other way, so any quarter of decline in production? Same quarter, and this is regarding oil and gas in Algeria, is there any news regarding the tax matter?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, regarding Maersk Line, have you experienced any changes to the volume growth demand? During the first quarter, have you seen a slowdown during the quarter? And fourthly, the spread between the nominal and effective capacity growth, all-in-all with congestion, repositioning of ships and slow steaming, what is your expectations of capacity taking out compared to the nominal capacity increase in '08, is it 3, 4, 5%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. I can't &#x2013; I mean I can't give you the math of whether we will see any quarter with declining figures. It can absolutely not be excluded when we reach the agreed level in Qatar, then the decline in other area will pull ourselves down in total, but that's &#x2013; we have done what we could give you to do, give a fair forecast for the year. So whether there is some math to be done, I don't know but that's &#x2013; that's not to be excluded that we can have a declining quarter.</p>
          <p>On Algeria, there no news on taxation, we pay, of course, the tax that we have to pay, we think it's too high and we'll see whether it is possible to get a better deal, but no news at the moment.</p>
          <p>Then on Maersk Line's slowdown during the quarter, it's even talking about a quarter is a lot. And the quarter in shipping is extremely volatile because you have changes in the Chinese New Year, which means that the whole &#x2013; the months within a quarter and especially in the first quarter, it can change completely, so there is no trend &#x2013; no slow down trends to be seen.</p>
          <p>In terms of slow steaming, I have nothing to add to what I have just said. It's hard to give a figure on how much capacity is being taken out and it's of course also capacity that can come in if the bunker prices go back down, or rates go up significantly. But, it's &#x2013; there will be a capacity impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a last follow up regarding Qatar, you've seen an impressive rise in your production taken in Qatar from 28% in '06 to 41% in '07. Could you try and give us something to put our estimates up to &#x2013; are we going to see a decline in production taken in Qatar in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't see any reason to comment in detail on the specific sharing agreements per country. I think when you look at the 2007 annual accounts, we provided quite detailed disclosure on how the production is allocated between the different production areas so...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question comes from Anders Wennberg from RAM One.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, I am Anders Wennberg from RAM. A couple of questions if I may. First, you talked about the correct gear spread in your report to find those oil price minus bunkers. I tried to calculate that, is it correct that it's slightly above 20 for the quarter? And then it's &#x2013; that is currently about 33, implying that if the current level would continue, the quarter itself would improve by more than $100 million per quarter. If we can start with that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Looking at the current crack, you're not too far off. It goes up and down every single day and of course the liquidity in those two markets for crude oil and bunkers oil is different, but you're not too far off on the current level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question is regarding the hedges of oil. In the report &#x2013; annual report you write that for every $10 the oil price moves you lose $90 million on the hedges, where in the P&amp;L are these hedge losses booked and how long is the hedging period and going forward would that imply that the result would actually have been better in the first quarter if you had not hedged?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have some hedges that were put in place sometime back and the cost and losses of those hedges are taken above EBITDA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have &#x2013; I think we have to stop here and so this was the last question and I would like to thank you all for dialing in, and thank you for many good questions. We appreciate that we did not give 100% good answers to all the good questions, but we appreciate you being engaged and following the company. So thank you very much for that. And we look forward to being back in August with the half year result which will be not only an interim statement but will be full result. So look forward to getting back in contact with you. Thank you very much and have a good day.</p>
