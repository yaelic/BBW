          <p>Good morning to everybody. A warm welcome to all investors and analysts. You are listening to SingTel's earnings conference call for the quarter and full year ended 31 March 2011. My name is Yang Fong and let me introduce management on the call. Ms Chua Sock Koong, Group CEO.</p>

          <p>Hello.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ms Jeann Low, Group CFO. They are assisted by members of the management team from both in Australia and Singapore. Before we start taking questions, I would like to invite Sock Koong to share some highlights from this set of results. Sock Koong, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Yang Fong. This morning we reported our results for the quarter and the full-year ended 31 March 2011 and in a resilient quarter, if you look at our numbers, revenues were up 4%. Both Singapore and Australia operations registered growth. Net profit was down 2% to S$992 million. But if you actually exclude the impact of Bharti Africa, then underlying net profit would have risen 1%.</p>
          <p>In Singapore, our revenues were stable and the strong growth in Mobile was partly offset by lower fibre rollout revenues. And revenue growth would have been 3% if we exclude fibre rollout. EBITDA declined 5% mainly as a result of mio TV content and service costs.</p>
          <p>In Australia, revenues were up 4% and that's driven by continued growth in Mobile. EBITDA was up a much stronger 7%, with contributions from all business segments and reflecting prudent cost management.</p>
          <p>The Group and Associates continued to register strong customer growth. We now have 403 million mobile customers. Earnings from the Regional Mobile Associates, however, declined 12%, impacted by regional currency weakness, Bharti's fair value losses on its foreign currency liability compared to gains last year, and losses from Bharti Africa. If we are to exclude Bharti Africa, earnings from the Regional Mobile Associates would be lower by 8%.</p>
          <p>I also want to highlight that the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of S$0.09 and special dividend of S$0.10 per share, including the interim dividend of S$0.068 that was paid in January of this year, total cash distribution is a record S$0.258 per share or a yield of 8%. Total, ordinary dividends increased 11% and that represented 66% of underlying net profit.</p>
          <p>With the proposed cash distribution of S$4.1 billion this year, our cumulative payout in the last 10 years will amount to S$26 billion or 76% of earnings over the same period. So I think this payout is a demonstration of our strong track record of cash return and also our commitment to achieve optimum capital structure.</p>
          <p>We will review on a three-year basis our cash needs for operations and growth as well as for strategic initiatives, with a view to returning surplus cash to shareholders.</p>
          <p>So I think with that, let me hand back to, Yang Fong.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks for that. Just one question for Paul on subscriber acquisition costs. You're obviously seasonally a bit lower this quarter but about flat on the same quarter the year before. I was just wondering if you could talk to how you're looking at the FY12 year from subscriber acquisition costs and perhaps if you could talk to the key drivers around mix, customer preferences, handset costs, and also if the A$ is having an impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might &#x2013; thanks, Andrew. Obviously we are not able to give forecasts of future trends, but what I can do is ask, Murray, to talk about some of the drivers that are visible in our numbers today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, as you've seen historically over the last two years in particular, our subscriber acquisition costs have been around the A$200 to A$250 mark. That's a consequence of higher smartphone mix and that's driven obviously strong customer growth. Our postpaid customer base is up 14% year on year. Our postpaid ARPU ex wireless broadband continue to demonstrate growth, so we're driving higher value customers as a consequence. As we go forward, where there's opportunity for us to secure higher value customers, we'll continue to do so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the A$, is that having an impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The A$, on the depreciation of the A$, where we do have manufacturers supplying from overseas facilities, there is a positive impact, but we look to hedge those positions on a regular basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, does that answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That does, thank you, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Operator, can we move to the next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Laurent, JP Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Laurent, JP Morgan. Maybe a couple of questions for Paul, just on the Optus guidance, it looks to me like you've a reasonably conservative guidance, just on the back of what you've just done in the last 12 months, low single digit revenue and EBITDA growth. I was wondering if you make any specific sort of MTR assumption in that guidance.</p>
          <p>And more generally, what's sort of underpinning the guidance, what are the key drivers? Do you factor in any specific impact from Telstra's resurgence in the broadband and mobile market? Just an interest in the thinking behind it, and just on the 47,000 net loss in prepaid, can you just give us a little bit more information on what this International Calls 4 Less plans where and why have you seen this increase in churn in that particular sort of category of the customer base? And how many customers are actually on these plans today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Laurent. Actually I'll take the first and then I'll maybe ask Mike Smith to talk on the second. Just looking at the market outlook, to give you a bit of background as to what we see today, what we see is increasing competitiveness. We take a perverse pleasure out of the fact that we have forced significant restructuring by both our major competitors in the mobile market.</p>
          <p>Certainly, the impact of the largest player deciding to take $1 billion off their bottom line, which is now visible in the industry in terms of greater allowances in plan, greater sign-on bonuses, more aggressive subsidies and loyalty. That's all visible and we clearly believe that whilst we're holding our own in terms of our performance &#x2013; and you can see that in our numbers &#x2013; nonetheless it's going to have an impact on industry growth rates overall.</p>
          <p>One of the things we've yet to see, for example, is Telstra's own revenue results. We are keen to understand ourselves what has been the impact of caps on their own revenue line as they come inside their own bases, what's the quality and ARPUs associated with their fairly impressive wireless broadband reported numbers. So we need to see all these things in order to get a better understanding of the trends.</p>
          <p>But I think fundamentally when you see a major competitor eroding their own earnings that substantively, it's bound to have an impact on industry growth rates. And so when we look forward, we are very committed to protecting our revenue share and our scale position, and clearly in our guidance we're reflecting what we believe will be a very competitive market over the next 12 months. That's really the background for why we are where we are. I'll pass over to Mike to talk a bit about a bit more of a profile of the International Calls 4 Less customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Laurent. A couple of things &#x2013; firstly, in prepaid, I think overall the industry is a little bit softer. We've seen increasingly in low-end postpaid a competitiveness to those plans and people moving over to those chasing handset and good rate plans.</p>
          <p>Specifically to the question in relation to International Calls 4 Less, this segment emerged in the Australian market about 18 months to two years ago and was a shift of what historically had been a calling card business where people went to a ragtrade shop, a newsagent, and purchased a calling card to make calls on fixed or mobile services. That whole category shifted into a direct SIM card moving forward, and it was very cheap international low-cost routed calls across a SIM card.</p>
          <p>One of the things that's very typical about the base is, similar to calling cards, there was a high propensity to churn that service at the back-end. In respect to the question as to how many of them in the base, in our base, less now than there was before, although we didn't &#x2013; we don't disclose specific information about the size of the different products inside of our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Laurent, have we answered your questions for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just one clarification just in terms of MTR assumption. I mean I know it would kick in anyway from 1 January 2012, but so you're assuming a constant sort of MTR rate for FY12?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're arguing very much for maintenance and for consistency. The points we make &#x2013; and we'll make these very publicly and very aggressively are that if you look at the characteristics of the Australian market, A, it has fundamentally different economic structure to that of north-west Europe, where there's much greater population density and much greater ability to get a return on capital.</p>
          <p>Second of all, if you look at the volume of data traffic and the amount of capital investment required in Australia, both in 3G and then in 4G, to provide services to customers, that obviously drives a pretty aggressive dynamic on investment here.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, if you look at the fact that unlike many markets overseas we've not seen a real change in fixed line market share in terms of landlines, and it's still the case that the majority of traffic that terminates off fixed landlines comes from one player, and there is no legislative mechanism to force that player to hand back any windfall they get in lower termination rates &#x2013; we just witnessed that over the last three years.</p>
          <p>Those three points are really substantive and important points as to why the mobile termination rate in Australia should be held at or about the same level. And that's the advocacy you'll hear us make very publicly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks very much I just got a few things. Firstly, congratulations on the dividend and the result. Just on the dividend policy, first of all, the comment states that only every three years you will look to review your cash needs and the other initiatives, I'm just wondering why it's such an explicit statement of the dividend policy given your cash should be strong every year, I would imagine.</p>
          <p>Secondly, Allen, just on the OpenNet business, you have about probably S$0.5 billion in revenue so far. Just wondering how much more are you expecting from the construction revenues? And secondly, when can we expect a meaningful contribution from the access revenues, because the take-up rates have been pretty low? And if the take-up rate remains pretty low, will that impact your ability to reduce your stake in the business by 2013, 2014?</p>
          <p>And lastly, Paul, just a strong question on your satellite business, I see the revenues every three months seems to be going up to A$70 million, A$75 million. You've got the NBN deal. You are looking to launch new satellite as well. Just wondering, I mean can you expect or can you imagine this business turning into like a A$100 million quarterly revenue business in a few years' time, because the margins would be quite strong in this, I imagine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin, I think you might have too many questions at one go. So just on the dividend question first, I would get Jeann to probably help you answer that. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:29).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I had been &#x2013; Okay, I think, let me just talk through our approach to cash management. I think we are very committed to optimum balance sheet. When we &#x2013; we have increased our ordinary dividend payout from 55% to 70%. What we are paying in terms of ordinary dividend is 66% of underlying earnings. If you look at our investments over the last few years, over the last three years, we had not made any significant acquisitions.</p>
          <p>As a result, we have achieved built-up surplus cash, which is why at the review that was concluded recently the board has agreed to a special dividend of S$0.10 per share. That would of course go to shareholders for approval at our coming AGM. The idea of course is to help us get to optimum balance sheet. What the dividend payout ratio that we have in place &#x2013; that provides enough financial flexibility for us to fund our ongoing CapEx requirements, the growth initiatives, M&amp;A opportunities, and that is why we have structured our dividend payout as such.</p>
          <p>But of course if after a period of time we don't make any investments, we would look at building capital management initiatives, which is why we said three years. That's to allow us to sort of clean up the position if cash gets built up over a period of time. We think that three years is probably a reasonable period of time where you may have enough surplus cash built up and no acquisitions or if capital expenditure has been somewhat contained. So this review of cash &#x2013; the regular dividend, et cetera, will go on, but a review for special dividends is something that we're doing once every three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin, can I ask you to repeat your question on the next...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin, has that answered your question on your dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that's fine thanks. The question for Allen was with OpenNet we've had a large contribution from the construction revenue so far. When can we expect or what's management's view on when can we start seeing access revenue come through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically Sachin, basically we are talking about excess revenues that we get as a result of being a retail service provider. We already started selling from October in competition with three to four others. I think right now that revenue is captured under our Data &amp; Internet revenue streams in our MD&amp;A. We don't disclose our fibre revenue at this stage separately because it's still a small part of our overall Data &amp; Internet revenue.</p>
          <p>If it gets bigger we will at some point start to disclose it. Basically we think that right now data has already been disclosed by IDA, there are approximately 18,000 to 20,000 fibre customers in Singapore that was at the end of February 2011. We know based on what we connected, what is our market share. I think it's reasonable based on our calculation to assume that's in line with the market share that we have for DSL currently. Does that answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Allen, that's fine, but I'm just trying to gauge if the take-up rate remains low &#x2013; we're not seeing a massive pick up so far &#x2013; will that impact your ability to reduce the stake in this asset?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you are probably confusing OpenNet where we have 30% stake and there are no intentions &#x2013; there are no plans currently for us to vary the shareholding. But there is a separate AssetCo which would hold the assets, the passive infrastructure, the COs and the ducts et cetera. That AssetCo is set up as a business trust and that is part of the whole NBN arrangement with the regulator. And there are requirements for us to sell that down by 2014. We should hold no more than 25% at that time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, we've got one last question I think from Sachin which is just briefly on the satellite business. So Murray, you might just comment briefly on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Sachin, I think your question is the growth in our satellite business. Firstly we don't comment and provide guidance on individual business revenues or profitability. But I think you've seen strong growth in the business over the last 12 month period. You've also seen a significant &#x2013; two significant contracts; particularly the provision of digital free-to-air services as the Australian Government switches over from analogue to digital servicing regional Australia; and more recently the provision of an interim NBN solution to the last 7% of the Australian population for broadband services over a five year period. The other point we would make is the announcement of the Optus 10 satellite launch. It will not only provide additional capacity and provide greater resilience in the form of backup capacity for the revenue streams we already provide to our customer base.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, please, go ahead. Yes, thank you, thanks, Richard. Thanks for waiting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fine. Just a question actually for Sock Koong and Paul actually. Just looking at the financials now over the last five or six years, just from an Optus point of view. Mobile revenues have gone from A$3.8 billion up to A$6 billion. EBITDA is flat, but the actual CapEx number has nearly more than doubled over that six year period. So given that management is remunerated on a ROIC model, when can we start to expect to see some ROIC start to stabilize if not turn within that Optus mobile business? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is in terms of looking at the wholesale numbers in the accounts, it looks as though probably 50% to 60% of all new net growth has come from wholesale subscribers in this financial year. I'm just wondering if you could sort of talk through what the impacts of that have been on the financials because it's a bit difficult to extrapolate. And then the last question just on CapEx for Optus. It is just over A$1 billion versus the guidance of A$1.2 billion. Can you just talk through where those savings came from and whether we can extrapolate those going forward?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so Richard I'm not quite sure which year you're using as baseline but certainly if you go back...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>'05.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you go back to that distance, that's the time when we were losing market share. If you compare our acquisition rate to our acquisition rate more recently, and our revenue performance &#x2013; our revenue acquisition performance, you would see a dramatic difference in profile. What we have done successfully over the last three years in particular is start to regain revenue market share while we dramatically accelerate our rate of acquisition and the quality of the acquisitions that we provide.</p>
          <p>So I think it more appropriate when you're looking at the businesses to look at it across the different metrics to say, for the sort of EBITDA margin we're getting, for the investment we're making in acquisition costs, are we driving good outcomes. I mean in that sense, the fact that both for the quarter and the full-year we put in 7.5% absolute dollar EBITDA growth reflects the fact that the investment is generating a good return and a good pay off for us. And when we look at our return on invested capital, taking into account the depreciation of capital that we've already invested and retired, we're quite satisfied that the performance we're turning in is generating a good return for us. I think that's been visible overall &#x2013; in the overall Optus performance.</p>
          <p>If you want to go into more detail on a baseline year, happy to go through that with you, probably one-on-one might be a more proper way. But I think the fundamentals really are the contrast between a company that is today driving revenue market share expansions, whereas the one that five years ago was actually losing share.</p>
          <p>If I could come to your second point on the wholesale, I might ask Murray to talk a little bit about the wholesale numbers. I think if I understood your question correctly you're trying to understand what's the effective contribution of wholesale to the growth we're showing in the numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you're referencing off the MD&amp;A and the KPI we include there in respect of a percentage of the customer base that's on wholesale. The first point I'd make is that those numbers, or those percentages we disclose there are rounded percentages. So in relation to contribution to our overall customer base you can't give the specific numbers or the consequence of that rounding. We do at a general point, our wholesale business is quite a key element of our mobile business that allows us to grow in particular market segments where the Optus brand doesn't naturally go to. Having said that, in relation to the contribution to customer growth, the wholesale contribution as an overall proportion of the overall customer growth is not inconsistent with what we've seen in prior quarters.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Richard you were asking a question on guidance on CapEx &#x2013; the A$1.2 billion versus our last year A$1 billion. Is that correct?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just to try and find out where you though the savings came from and whether we can extrapolate that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, this is Jeann. Can I just add onto Richard's first question on the return on invested capital and Optus performance? I think when we look at return on invested capital, we look at the net returns. We look at return before the interest expense and then obviously looked at the invested capital at Optus.</p>
          <p>So just looking operation of EBITDA itself &#x2013; just looking at EBITDA number itself &#x2013; although Paul has highlighted that even on the mobile business we've grown 7.5%, and if you look at overall Optus, it's actually grown 8.4%. If you look at the net profit after tax for Optus, it's actually improved by 15%. So Richard, I'm not sure where you get your numbers, but I just want to put it on record that the numbers &#x2013; the performance for Optus on a year on year basis for the two years is actually quite strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on your CapEx question, you've seen us historically invest around A$1 billion and that was confirmed &#x2013; and you saw that in FY11. Our guidance was respect of A$1.2 billion of CapEx investment next year recognizes some phasing elements as we continue to invest in our mobile network both with coverage and quality or depth and capacity in our network. We do see that investment increasing to around the A$1.2 billion for next financial year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thanks for the call and congrats on the results. I have three questions on Singapore. Just looking at the &#x2013; the first one is on pre-paid ARPUs, quite a healthy increase Q-on-Q and year-on-year. Is that being driven by wireless data or it's more of the improving yields on voice and SMS?</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding national telephone revenues. Fixed mobile substitution is happening, but the drop this quarter seems to be quite steep. Should we expect similar drops going forward or is there some one-off event that happened in the quarter? And last question is more on the strategy with the iPad2. Previously iPad 1, yourselves and other operators didn't subsidize or put in any major plans. What has changed with the iPad2 and why are you now willing to provide a partial subsidy on it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me take the three questions one-by-one, starting with the prepaid ARPU, what's driving that growth. Basically what's driving the growth is two things. Number one is, we launched 3G on prepaid mobile for the first time in the third quarter of the last financial year and that has helped us garner higher value customers and shifted some usage from just pure voice to a little bit of data as well.</p>
          <p>The second important thing that we've done that has resulted in prepaid ARPU increases, we've also shifted our sales focus a little bit more away from foreign manual laborers to also foreign workers in the service sector &#x2013; those who are coming in, for example, as service workers in the integrated resorts, in the hospitals, etc. So these tend to be slightly higher ARPU customers and we are targeting our sales channels towards them. So I hope that answers the first question.</p>
          <p>I'll go into the second one which was the 5% I think drop in national tel revenue. The main reason for that, actually if you look at national tel the strange phenomenon would be that actually our &#x2013; between last year and now we've actually increased the number of DEL lines. And &#x2013; but the usage that we're seeing has declined quite significantly primarily because of fixed-to-mobile substitution. So that's the main reason in accounting for the 5% drop.</p>
          <p>The third important point is a very interesting question, why the interest now in SingTel to sell iPad</p>
          <p>2. I think SingTel has been embarking on a strategy to transform ourselves into a multimedia company. And one of the things that we do as a multimedia company is make our content available across multiple devices. Whatever we have on mio TV, we put on mobile devices as well, of which a tablet is a very important portable entertainment device.</p>
          <p>The second important thing that we do with multimedia is to develop applications that we can be distinctive in and these applications are always in the ultra-local sphere, and that's why we have our music product where iTunes doesn't have the ability to sell music in Singapore, but we have AMPed, which is our music product. We have DeLite which is our electronic magazine product which is also ideally suited to tablet.</p>
          <p>So when you take those applications and content into consideration it gives us a good opportunity to up-sell our applications and our content where we can also sell the hardware. So that's the reason why we were so aggressive with Apple to allow us to sell the iPad2 in our shops, and from Saturday we'll be able to do that. But basically it gives us a hardware platform which do not just sell our data plans, but to up-sell our applications and content. So I hope that that gives you the strategy of why we're so interested to sell the iPad 2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Allen. Just one follow-up on the national telephone revenue, do you think that 5% decline will persist for the coming quarters or it will...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think so. I can't give you an absolute number.</p>
          <p>We continue to see that DEL is a good cash cow for us so we will try and slow down the decline as much as we can. I think historically it's probably around that range so I think you can look at the trending and make some judgment on your own.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the call. I have three questions. First is to Allen. During SingTel conference in Bangalore, Allen had mentioned about moving away from Apple towards more Android phones, and secondly implementing airlines kind of model in terms of business class and economy class. My question is, are you happy with the adoption of Android phones in Singapore till now and how far are we from airlines kind of model and would you need LTE to implement that kind of model, and if you can say some details on what are your plans for LTE, that would be great.</p>
          <p>Second question is for Australia, Optus &#x2013; that we have seen a substantial decline in the cost, especially the out payment and lease cost in 4Q. I understand this could be due to Aussie dollar <mark type="ph" /> appreciation (30:08), but my question is why did you feel this decline specifically in the fourth quarter and we didn't see this decline in 3Q and 2Q? So is it just some kind of accounting over there?</p>
          <p>And the last question is on the free cash flow for the group. When you say S$4 billion free cash flow, does it include deduction for of about S$600 million for the regional investment you have made in Bharti and Globe? I mean I'm just trying to understand what is the free cash flow which we are generating for the dividend, basically shareholders, I'm just trying to get <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:42), thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the free cash flow &#x2013; I'll do that very quickly, this is Jeann. Free cash flow is operating cash flow less our capital expenditure. So, it doesn't adjust for the Bharti upstake that is under investing activities. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I move back to the first question on Singapore which had two parts. Let me address the first part moving towards Android. I think as a network operator and as a service provider, we like to see a diversity of choice on the hardware platform for our customers. So obviously we know that there are a couple of major operating system standards out there of which Android is one, Apple is the other. You've got BlackBerry, now we've got Windows Mobile 7. We've been trying to push all of them. I think at the end of the day we've had success in pushing Android and we do have a number of significant ultra-local applications that run on Android as well.</p>
          <p>We don't disclose publicly the spread across our network except to say that, you know, today more than 50% of our mobile postpaid base is already on a smartphone of some sort. So I think if you look at the advertising that you can, that you see us do a significant proportion of our advertising on the weekends on our retail offers, do focus on alternative operating systems other than just Apple. And we do in those advertisements, do highlight some of the applications and services that you can get from us, music, mobile TV &#x2013; on some of these platforms.</p>
          <p>The second question was on the business part, mobile data service. That one is still in the works. We are still on target to deliver that towards calendar Q4 this year, early part of that, and basically the rationale for that is based on our surveys of the public in terms of their mobile data usage. I think we're getting significant insights from that survey to indicate that it's not just a question of speed that they're looking for. It's also a question of consistency of data, especially now that they're accessing the internet on their smartphones or on their tablets or other mobile devices, and the internet today is full of nothing but videos, that's driving internet usage.</p>
          <p>So we are moving towards a business class service that would be more suited for people who want a consistent experience with videos on the internet, as well as for our enterprise customers who want a better mobile data service, and LTE will help us to achieve that because LTE gives us another spectrum at 2.6 gig, which we can then use to enable us to deliver a better mobile data service. LTE is on schedule. We will launch it together with our infrastructure provider also early part of this Q4 calendar year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow-up, when you say at 2.6 gigahertz, is it the same standard to be used for all the operators in Singapore or we should be expecting different operators using different LTE spectrum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I think we look at the spectrums that the different operators occupy and whether it's FDD or TDD, you will find that actually at 2.6 we are the only people that can have something that fits the LTE range of handsets and infrastructure. There's also 1800 frequency in Singapore which can be used for LTE and I believe some of our competitors may be well using that. So I think you have to see what happens. I don't think everybody's going to be at 2.6.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So which means that handsets have to come equipped with both 1800 and 2.6 at the same time for LTE?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think if you look at LTE, the first handsets are all 700 meg because I think that is something that's driven out of the U.S. And then the next batch of equipment to come out, 2.6 and then the third batch is coming out at 1800 because of some usage in Europe and I understand in Australia as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll take that. Murray King from Optus. On the out payment question I'd just refer you to page 53 of the MD&amp;A, first in relation to tracking expenses in general. You're right, they're only up 2%, but if you look at the commentary, interconnect cost which is the domestic interconnect cost are up 9% year on year and this is a result of the overall mobile service revenue growth. If you then look at out payment and other costs, they are down in part because the Australian dollar, in part because of better negotiation of rates, but I'd also refer you to the commentary where it was a one-off reversal of an out payment provision no longer required in this particular quarter resulting in the overall outpayment growth being reduced to 2%. If you take that one off adjustment out, the overall &#x2013; or traffic expenses increased by 7.5%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the call. Three questions from me. Firstly in the domestic business, SAC trends seems to keep trending downwards. Would you be able to provide some color on what is driving this? Is it mostly on delays from smartphone take-up at this stage or are you seeing a change with regards to the composition of the handsets?</p>
          <p>Secondly it seems that regional opportunities are quite limited at this point for acquisitions. Wondering if management would actually consider looking outside of Asia or if it would prefer to see capital being redeployed to shareholders instead?</p>
          <p>Lastly, again on regional investments, there's been a lot of talk that San Miguel is looking to expand in the Philippines. There's also a lot of chatter that SingTel may be looking to exit Telkomsel. Wondering what the commitment is to holding these assets, and would you be willing to monetize if there's a party who offers you a material premium, or would you consider these stakes as strategic? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me answer the SAC decline question for Singapore first. There are three things driving that. Number one is the removal of port-in offers compared to the same time last year. Remember the same time last year was the first quarter of the early stage of our competitors getting Apple iPhone. Now everybody's got it the competition's a bit more stabilized and so we don't see the need to have a port-in offer. That's the $100 offer that we used to have. So we've taken that out.</p>
          <p>The second is of course the impact of the strength of the Singapore dollar versus U.S. dollar, a lot of our equipment are paid for in U.S. dollars so that has dropped significantly in Singapore dollar terms.</p>
          <p>And then the third is basically just the mix between smartphones and dongles or mobile data customers. So I think that also mobile data we don't subsidize that significantly so that has led to a decline in the overall SAC subscriber acquisition costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, certainly within the Asia region, opportunities for new acquisitions are rather restricted. But whether we are looking outside the Asia region, that really depends on the opportunities available. Obviously if opportunity comes by and it makes sense for us, then, obviously we will consider. In regards to San Miguel, yes there is a lot of chatter in the market about them coming in because they've &#x2013; their investment in four companies with frequencies in 700 meg, 1800 meg, as well as the 900 meg. This is just chatter in the market, we are not able to comment on San Miguel's plans. Regards to Telkomsel, I think we are long term investor in Indonesia. We are upbeat about opportunities in the general market largely also because of the expected growth in the data market. So as of now we are still very much involved in Telkomsel and we look at this as a very strategic investment for us.</p>

          <p>Hello. Thank you. I have a couple of questions. Just wondering if you could give us a bit more color around what's happening in the Philippines with regards to PLDT and their offer to the number three player? I understand Globe has asked the government to intervene, or the regulator. Could you just talk us through what your thoughts are there? I would have thought consolidation of the market may be positive, but just what Globe's concerns are if they're thinking PLDT will be too concentrated in their share of the market?</p>
          <p>I just have a follow-up also on the wholesale question asked earlier for Optus. I've sort of been under the impression that a lot of the wholesale customers were prepaid. From the numbers that you've released today, it doesn't necessarily look the case. Are you able to give us a sense of the wholesale customers you're adding, roughly how many are postpaid?</p>
          <p>And just lastly, I'm sorry if I missed this earlier, but I just need to clarify again the commentary around the dividend policy with being reviewed every three years. Is that overall capital management or is it just dividend policy that that was referring to? That's all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect of the first question, the PLDT acquisition of Digitel, that's expected to complete by June. Globe is not opposed to the deal per se, but wants to make sure that the government intervenes as necessary to ensure a level playing field where there is fair and healthy competition for the benefit of consumer market. Globe has recently written to the NTC to express its preliminary views about the transaction, in particular it has noted that if the transaction goes ahead PLDT will be controlling approximately 70% of the mobile market and a disproportionate share of the frequency spectrum. The impact on competition is therefore real and the NTC should intervene and closely examine the deal. Existing spectrum <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:01) because with the new deal where PLDT acquires Digitel they will have about 35 megahertz of previous spectrum as opposed to Globe having 10 Meg, as we know, spectrum is critical for the mobile market.</p>

          <p>Okay. On the &#x2013; you asked a question about the statement we've made on the capital management or the, you know, reviewing on a three-year basis our cash needs for operations and growth initiatives. You know, that's as explicit as we can be. Basically we are telling our shareholders that we'll do a review on at least a three year basis.

          <p>Hi, it's Paul here. I'm going to ask Murray just to come back on the wholesale issue again, Alice, and we'll just try and clarify how we disclose our wholesale and make sure that people get a good sense as to what we're actually putting in the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Alice, I think what a number of the analysts are doing is taking on the face of our MD&amp;A. The fact that we're disclosing whole percentages for our &#x2013; wholesale basis percentage of our overall base, and if you look at December '10 we said 10% of the base, and as at March '11 we said 11% of base. If you just use those whole percentage numbers you end up with indication of the wholesale space increased by about 100,000. I can assure you there's a rounding element to that, so as you can understand you can either round down or round up, and the differential as a consequence of rounding can be as low as 0.2%. We don't actually disclose our total wholesale base. In relation to your question about the pre to post split, again we don't provide disclosures on that, but as you can see in the retail market we have wholesale service providers that provide both postpaid services, prepaid services and wireless broadband services.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I've got a question for Allen. How does the profitability of the fiber products in Singapore compare to the DSL products so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you need to look at it overall from end to end. The DSL product runs off our copper network, and we have to invest in the copper. In the case of fiber, I think we don't &#x2013; we pay a rent for the fiber service, just like any other ISP, while we don't have to make the capital investment on the fiber that is done by the government. So, I think, if you look at it from a pure OpEx perspective you probably have to pay or you have a lower EBITDA margin, but if you look at on a return of capital invested basis, and bear in mind that with fiber you've got a lot of ability to up-sell other services that are less capital intensive. You can look it from an ROI basis that the potential for us to get a higher return from fiber is a lot more than from DSL. So that's the perspective we take on fiber. For us fiber is the future, it fits in well with our strategic growth, and also from a return on capital perspective, you know, we will continue to push it to make sure we get a better return than we do on DSL.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. And just a follow-up question, just on the mobiles market in Singapore, can you maybe just talk a bit what you're seeing in terms of the competitive environment? Are you seeing sort of a pull back from StarHub and maybe just a bit more aggression from M1 there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the mobile market sort of ebbs and flows in terms of competitive intensity. I would say the prepaid market is probably the most aggressive right now, and that's primarily because of, you know, it's a lot of foreign people coming into Singapore, and that's an area of growth. So I think that's an area where you can see a lot of price competition. And I would agree with you that M1 is probably the most aggressive there because of per minute pricing and the free IDD that they put there.</p>
          <p>I think the postpaid market is now moving very much more towards value. You can see that when all the operators start to say that 80%, or in excess of 80% in some case, of new adds and re-contracts are onto smartphones, it's a question less of how much you're subsidizing the smartphone, but more a question of the quality of your mobile data network &#x2013; and I spoke about that a little bit earlier &#x2013; and the sort of applications and content that you can put there. So it's less a price game, and it's more value, a branding game, and ability to create a bit of excitement in the case of consumer customers. And in the case of business customers, the ability to help them manage getting email and some of the business applications onto the smart devices. So I think in that case I don't think M1 has got the ability to compete as aggressively from the branding, from the applications or content perspective, with ourselves and with StarHub.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions if you wouldn't mind. You know one of the real drags on SingTel in the past couple of years has been the Associates performance and you seem to be suggesting that you think that's improving. You're talking about strengthening operating performance, improving productivity and so on. I just wonder how confident you are about that, particularly you've given, you know despite that, only an expectation of flat dividends. I know there's a lag effect there, but shouldn't there be &#x2013; if the operating performance is improving shouldn't there be an expectation of improving dividends particularly when you factor in perhaps some currency expectation as well?</p>
          <p>And secondly a question for Paul O'Sullivan, Paul you've touched on that question of capital spending in mobile, I think in relation to a mobile termination question, there's a wide industry expectation of traffic levels doubling every year for the next five years with what's going on; very difficult thing to manage the capacity against that kind of traffic growth on a geographic basis, so I just wonder how you are set for that? Whether there's some risks there and how you see that Optus is able to expand the capacity as needed over the next three to five years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the guidance for the Associates dividend, and that we are highlighting that it is stable. I think yes there is a bit of a lag effect, but I think if you look at our Associates dividend policy, you know, with Globe they have a policy of about 75% to 90% of their previous year's net profit, preceding year net profit, in terms of payouts. So for FY 2010 they have said that they would payout about 84% of the FY 2010 income. For AIS &#x2013; I think AIS has already announced in November last year that they have a revised dividend policy to pay dividend of at least 100% of net profits, and that dividend will be paid twice a year. And of course for Telkomsel, they don't have a fixed dividend policy, but historically they pay somewhere between 70% to 80%.</p>
          <p>Bharti only just pay a maiden dividend of INR$1 per share, and of course you know the way we look at Bharti is that whatever dividends that may be available from the Indian operation will be re-invested towards funding growth, particularly with the leverage that they have taken up on Africa. So that's the story line around the dividend policy.</p>
          <p>In terms of talking about growth for the Associates, yes, the Associates markets they have given us significant growth in the past and clearly we've increased penetration and with increased competition, there is some slowing down of the growth and it's not been helped by the currency factor, but we continue to believe that the investments that we have in those countries have got growth potential, continue to have growth potential particularly in the major markets of Indonesia and Africa &#x2013; Indonesia and India where you know 3G and mobile broadband is currently being rolled out.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So Ian I will pick up on your question, it's Paul here, on the traffic in Australia, and we absolutely share your view that there will be very aggressive growth in mobile data. On a positive side, it reflects a very strong value proposition that smartphones, tablets and that mobile internet provides.</p>
          <p>One of the key issues that I'd point out to everybody is that in contrast to our smaller competitor in the industry, we have been investing very aggressively over the last few years because we had an expectation of strong growth, albeit what we're seeing is probably at the upper end of what we would have expected. And that's left us in better position in terms of moving forward and taking advantage of the growth.</p>
          <p>I'd point to three areas in particular. The first one is our acquisition of spectrum. In the metro areas, we've more than doubled our spectrum holdings last year by buying Qualcomm's spare 2100 spectrum, but we were also the first carrier to lodge applications for over 1000 apparatus or local licenses in regional Australia and we were successful in acquiring those.</p>
          <p>We've only rolled out that additional spectrum so far to less than 20% of the network. It's a program that's still underway and as it rolls out it will give us significant extra radio capacity in all of the sales where we deploy it.</p>
          <p>The second big area of focus for us has been backhaul and we've upgraded a lot of our sites from an average three years ago of about one E1 per site to today having over 80% of our metro network in fibre. There's an ongoing program to upgrade our capacity. That gives us significant extra capacity on backhaul and allows us to be ready to take advantage of strong growth.</p>
          <p>The third area is metro build and what's interesting for someone like me who's been in mobile for over a decade is that we had by and large stopped any major build in metro up till about three years ago. But anticipating the growth and demand the greater usage of devices for data, we have recommenced the metro build. In fact, the first wave of our new metro sites has come on stream over the last six to nine months, but there are further waves coming on over the next one or two.</p>
          <p>There's a big contrast between the strategy I described and that of some of the other players, one in particular in the industry. I would say it's still going to be an area which requires a lot of focus and represents a lot of challenge for the industry, but there's no doubt that our very strong investment, over $2 billion in mobile over the last four years, has given us a good platform from which to start.</p>
