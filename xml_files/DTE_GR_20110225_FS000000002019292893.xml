          <p>Good afternoon and good morning to our investors from overseas. Welcome to the DT Q4 and full year 2010 conference call. I know it is a busy results day today and we'll try to keep our remarks as short and precise as possible and to limit our call to one hour only.</p>
          <p>With that, let me hand over to our Group CEO, Ren&#xE9; Obermann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stephan. Good afternoon, everybody. Given the busy season, I'll also try to keep my remarks short and sweet. You'll be able to find all the details in the slide deck and the IR back up for today's call.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we delivered on what we promised nevertheless there is still way to go as we all know. With &#x20AC;19.5 billion, we achieved our adjusted EBITDA target for the year. And please bear in mind that this includes the special Hungarian wonderful revenue tax of approximately &#x20AC;100 million, which was unexpected.</p>
          <p>More importantly, with &#x20AC;6.5 billion, we overachieved our free cash flow target. Through the PTC settlement, we finally secured undisputed full control and ownership of our important Polish asset at a very attractive condition.</p>
          <p>Operationally, we made good progress, especially in Germany, where we achieved a stable adjusted EBITDA with a margin in excess of 38%. In terms of our growth area, we achieved mobile data revenues of &#x20AC;4.4 billion in 2010, which represented a growth rate of almost 30%. We stabilized the cash flow in the European segments despite austerity measures adopted by several countries and the ongoing difficult economies.</p>
          <p>We saw a continued improvement at systems solutions with external revenue growth of 5.4% and an increase to adjusted EBIT margin. In the U.S. in a challenging environment, we changed the management and we came up with a new strategy for the years to come. We continue to improve our data proposition with the rollout of HSPA+ and new smartphones that resulted in strong data ARPU improvements, but nevertheless contract churn still is unacceptably high in the U.S. and revenue growth in the U.S. dollars was still negative for the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of our cost-cutting program, Save 4 Service, results were better than anticipated with &#x20AC;2.5 billion of gross savings in 2010 and a strong underlying net cost base reduction in Germany and Europe of &#x20AC;1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Finally, in terms of shareholder remuneration, we confirm our annual shareholder remuneration of &#x20AC;3.4 billion per annum from 2010 to 2012. In 2010, we already completed a share buyback of &#x20AC;400 million, so that the management and supervisory boards will propose a dividend of &#x20AC;0.70 per share to the Annual General Meeting.</p>
          <p>Let's now have a closer look at our financial results for 2010 and let me make the following observations to begin with. For the full year, excluding the impact of the U.K., which is the basis of our consolidation going forward, revenues slightly increased by 0.4%. The adjusted EBITDA decline of 3.4% includes the &#x20AC;100 million special revenue tax in Hungary, as well as severe regulatory effects in Europe, as well as in Germany through the NTR cuts for instance.</p>
          <p>Despite the decrease in adjusted EBITDA, the adjusted net profit and adjusted EPS grew by around 5% year-on-year in 2010. The reported net profit in Q4 was additionally impacted by the PTC settlement, restructuring expenses and impairments. These three effects together had a combined impact of lowering the reported Q4 net profit by &#x20AC;1.3 billion. I will come back to the Q4 results later.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, for the sake of transparency we have provided you with reported figures for the fourth quarter and the full year as well. Our strategy: fix, transform and innovate, remains firmly on track. Let me just highlight a few developments. In terms of improving the performance of our mobile-centric efforts, blended data ARPU in the U.S. grew by more than a quarter versus last year to $12.80 in Q4.</p>
          <p>In terms of leveraging one company in integrated efforts, we have now completed with the merger of fixed and mobile operations in Germany, in Croatia and in Slovakia. With regard to building networks and processes for the gigabit society. We launched 4G respectively HSPA+ in 200 million POPS in the United States. For a substantial portion of these POPS, namely 140 million, we will even double the speed by mid-year 2011.</p>
          <p>In terms of Connected Life across all screens, we have witnessed a drastic increase in smartphone sales in 2010 with a significant pickup in the sale of android phones. And finally with regards to Connected Work with unique ICT solutions, Systems Solutions won further big deals in 2010 including EON.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at our key growth areas where we expect to almost double our revenues by 2015. As already highlighted at the beginning, mobile data revenues grew by &#x20AC;1 billion or almost 30% to &#x20AC;4.4 billion in 2010. This is an even faster growth rate than for the nine-month result, only plus 26%, and it demonstrates the promise of mobile data as a key growth driver for the industry and particularly for Deutsche Telekom.</p>
          <p>Connected Home revenues grew solidly by 5% to &#x20AC;5.5 billion. We are therefore, well on our way toward the &#x20AC;7 billion ambition level for 2015. Revenues in Online Consumer Services grew by 13% to about &#x20AC;1 billion. This is another key area where we hope to drive further innovations and growth. And external revenues in T-Systems grew by 5.4% to &#x20AC;6.4 billion. This means we're also well on track there toward the &#x20AC;8 billion ambition level for 2015.</p>
          <p>Let's look into the guidance for 2011. We expect an adjusted EBITDA of around &#x20AC;19.1 billion, which should be in line with the current consensus level. We also expect a stable to slightly growing free cash flow versus the higher than expected 2010 level of &#x20AC;6.5 billion. That target does not include &#x20AC;0.4 billion cash payment for the PTC settlement paid in Q1 2011.</p>
          <p>In terms of operations, our number one priority is to execute on the challenger strategy in the United States, that we outlined at our T-Mobile Investor Day in January and to return to growth in revenues and adjusted EBITDA in the U.S.</p>
          <p>In Germany, we intend to maintain our market leadership and stabilize adjusted EBITDA despite the MTR, Mobile Termination Rate, cuts and the related revenue declines.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we aim to stabilize cash flows and maintain our market leading positions. At System Solutions, we expect to continue to the revenue growth, hence to further improve our efficiency. In terms of Save 4 Service, we will further execute on our efficiency programs.</p>
          <p>Phase II of Save 4 Service entails growth savings of &#x20AC;4.2 billion from 2010 to 2012, including &#x20AC;1.8 billion of net savings in Germany and Europe. We also launched an additional efficiency program in the U.S. called Reinvent with the target of additional gross savings of $1 billion by 2013.</p>
          <p>With respect to shareholder remuneration, we continue to expect an annual remuneration to Deutsche Telekom shareholders including share buybacks of around &#x20AC;3.4 billion for 2011 and 2012. That's our expectation, of course, these things always depend on the respective decisions by the supervisory board and the general annual meeting.</p>
          <p>Let's have a closer look at Q4 developments in revenues and adjusted EBITDA. With the 2009 figures restated without the U.K. for better comparability, we increased revenues by 0.4% while adjusted EBITDA decreased by 7.2% due to Europe and group headquarters and shared services or GHS.</p>
          <p>Both revenue and adjusted EBITDA benefited from favorable foreign exchange movements in 2010. On the other hand, both revenue and adjusted EBITDA were impacted this year by the special revenue tax in Hungary of approximately &#x20AC;100 million, which explains 60% of the year-on-year adjusted EBITDA decline of the Europe segment and regulatory effects.</p>
          <p>At GHS, compared to the third quarter, the EBITDA loss increased by another &#x20AC;130 million, of which approximately &#x20AC;100 million came from real estate alone. So let me be very clear that we are not fully satisfied with GHS and will have to work on measures to improve efficiency, which is why we have initiated a shave headquarters program at DTE.</p>
          <p>After this overview of group results and strategy, let's now turn to the divisions, starting with the U.S. Here the picture was clearly mixed in Q4. Service revenues continued to stabilize and were actually stable year-on-year in Q4 that was so far good news. This was supported by the continued strong growth in data ARPU, but was also due to the inclusion of handset insurance revenues. Beginning in Q4, handset insurance revenues are included in contract service revenues, as T-Mobile USA began directly providing handset insurance, which had previously been provided by a third party.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA was almost stable year-on-year, supported by lower subscriber acquisition and retention costs in Q4. In terms of net adds, while prepaid customers grew by almost 300,000 in Q4, supported by MVNO growth, the development of contract customers was disappointing with minus 318,000. The decline in contract customers was due to lower gross adds combined with continued high contract churn. Gross adds declined partially due to the optimization of credit standards, which led to a shift towards prepaid customers.</p>
          <p>Compared to Q3, an additional factor contributing to the decline in Q4 were also lower machine-to-machine methods. As you know, these are included in contract customers in the U.S. With regards to contract churn, which was 2.5% in Q4. The same as in Q4 2009, we're confident that the measures adopted by the new management in the U.S. including a new churn organization and a new head for this organization, will lead to improvements in 2011.</p>
          <p>We're focused on executing this challenger strategy, rather than repeating all the messages from our recent T-Mobile USA Investor Day, I would like to highlight a recent 4G speed test that confirms the superiority of our network in the U.S. Specifically, MSNBC recently tested the download speed of some of the available 4G smartphones in the U.S. Our new Samsung Galaxy S 4G smartphone, which is exclusive to T-Mobile USA and went on sale on February 23rd clearly dominated the field with average peak download speeds of close to 8-megabits per second and best peak speeds in excess of 10-megabits per second.</p>
          <p>So with that, I would like to hand over to Tim, who will lead you through the results of our other divisions as well as some further details of our group financials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ren&#xE9;. Hello everybody. Overall, we're quite pleased with the financial results for the German division. Both revenues and adjusted EBITDA grew in the fourth quarter with the EBITDA performance supported by a 1.7 reduction in adjusted OpEx. Accordingly, the margin improved by 0.3 percentage points year-on-year to almost 37% in Q4.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to the details starting with fixed. As already indicated in Q3, revenue trends have significantly improved in the fourth quarter. The resulting year-over-year revenue decline of 3% for the full year is a further improvement over the prior year and shows that we are well on our way towards stabilizing German revenues as a whole by 2012.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA increased by 1.1% to almost &#x20AC;1.5 billion in Q4, despite the usually higher fourth quarter commercial efforts, driven by adjusted OpEx savings of 3.8%. Our broadband net-add share in Q4 was impacted by very aggressive unbundlers who gained market share at the expense of cable. We are not happy with the resulting 30.1 share in Q4, but we remained overall very competitive, as can be seen by the significant reduction in line losses, which improved at a 20% CAGR over the last two years and were below &#x20AC;1.6 million in 2010.</p>
          <p>With our double play price cut in Q4, but at the same time increasing standard download speeds to up to 60-megabits per second, we have improved our competitiveness in the marketplace going forward.</p>
          <p>Importantly, solid IPTV growth continued with over 500,000 additional marketed Entertain customers in 2010, and an Entertain customer base of close to 1.6 million packages sold, higher than the guided number of 1.5 million. Of the 1.6 million packages sold, 1.2 million were already connected.</p>
          <p>In German mobile, we continued our market out performance despite the impact of the MTR cuts. Adjusted for the impact of the MTR cuts, service revenues grew by 5% year-on-year only in the fourth quarter. A solid growth in service revenues was driven by data revenue growth of 28%. Despite the loss of iPhone exclusivity, we continued very strong iPhone sales with almost 350,000 iPhones sold in the fourth quarter. In addition, we sold almost 50,000 Windows 7 Smartphones. Also adjusted for the impact of the MTR cuts, the EBITDA grew by 1.1% to over &#x20AC;900 million. With an adjusted EBITDA margin of 41.7% we are ahead of all competitors here in Germany.</p>
          <p>Turning to the European segment, despite a difficult market economic environment, impressive growth in strategic products continued. The number of TV customers grew by 2.4 million, and ARPU stabilization in businesses is coming with our Connected Life across all Screens strategy. At the same time, the Smartphone share more than doubled to 34% of new and retained customers in Q4, which laid the foundation for even stronger mobile data revenue growth.</p>
          <p>In addition, broadband customers grew by 12% in 2010 to 4.6 million with the number of mobile contract customers increasing by more than 1 million or 4% to over 26 million. Financially, we were able to keep the cash contribution of the Europe segment almost stable, despite the EBITDA decline due to CapEx discipline.</p>
          <p>Let's have a closer look to the financial development in the integrated operations of the European segment. The OTE group maintained a relatively stable margin of 34%, overall in Q4 despite continuing revenue pressures. In Greece, we gained traction in broadband net adds from new tariff and the IPTV customers more than tripled to 50,000. We are pleased with the continued strong performance of our operations in Croatia, which managed to improve the margin to 41%. IPTV customers improved by 26% to 297,000.</p>
          <p>The performance of Magyar Telekom in Hungary was severely impacted by the special tax on revenue, which impacted both revenues and EBITDA by &#x20AC;90 million in the fourth quarter. Excluding this tax, adjusted EBITDA would have been essentially stable year-on-year, and the margin would have increased to 38%. Operationally, the number of TV customers grew by 19% to 750,000.</p>
          <p>Thanks to our investments into network superiority and our smartphone push we are continuously outperforming our peers in the Hungarian market.</p>
          <p>Finally, Slovakia had a revenue and adjusted EBITDA development similar to the previous quarters. We could compensate the decline in mobile revenues partially by growth in fixed network revenues.</p>
          <p>Turning to the mobile-centric assets. In Poland we had a very good year. We increased revenues by almost 5% and adjusted EBITDA margin by 2.5 percentage points to almost 38% in 2010.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we increased our contract customer base by 140,000 and thereby improved the quality of our customer base for the future.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we solved the long-standing ownership dispute, introduced a new CEO and signed a letter of intent for a networking sharing deal with Orange. This means that we've set the base to even improve our current position in the Polish market and target market leadership in near-term.</p>
          <p>In the Netherlands, we're increasingly reaping the fruits of the integration of Orange. We've fully achieved the already increased saving targets given at our Investors Day, which resulted in an improvement of over two percentage points in our EBITDA margin despite very strong iPhone sales. We clearly outperformed our competitors in terms of service revenues and contract customer growth. Mobile data continue to grow very strongly with the growth rate of 40% in 2010.</p>
          <p>In the Czech Republic, we kept a very high margin level of 48%, while at the same time still growing our contract customer base by more than 4%, and keeping our contract churn at a very low 0.5%. At the same time we invested heavily into our network, almost doubling the number of 3G sites versus 2009. This together with the integration of our fixed line operation will enable us to offer even better converged products and tariffs going into 2011.</p>
          <p>Finally, in Austria revenue suffered severely from regulation, but we were able to keep our service revenue market share continuously above 30%. Operationally, we were the first operator to launch LTE services as of October, and the first Mobile TV offer as of November.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we showed the lowest contract churn rate ever with 0.8%, and even increased the number of iPhone sales by 12% year-on-year, despite the fact that the iPhone was launched by Telekom Austria as well.</p>
          <p>In the context of the Europe segment, let me also update you on the OTE synergies. As of Q4, the measures with an annual potential of &#x20AC;250 million are already implemented. This means that the total run rate from the acquisition case has been achieved two years earlier than planned. The savings are split into 60% CapEx and 40% OpEx savings.</p>
          <p>Turning to System Solutions, healthy revenue growth continued in fourth quarter with revenues growing by 3.8% in terms of total revenues and close to 6% in terms of external revenues. At the same time, System Solutions continued to improve its profitability driven by efficiency. The adjusted EBIT margin improved from 2.6% in 2009 to 3.7% in 2010, while adjusted EBITDA improved by 2.7% to &#x20AC;948 million corresponding to a margin of 10.5%. This development reflects the strong execution of the efficiency program with a Save 4 Service contribution of &#x20AC;0.6 billion in 2010.</p>
          <p>After this overview of the divisions, let's turn to free cash flow for the group. With &#x20AC;6.5 billion, we overachieved our original guidance by 5%. It's a strong result that highlights the success of our central free cash flow steering and the good conditions we gained in our procurement department. In terms of working capital management, we achieved a significant improvement in our payables and we introduced a group wide payment policy. We demonstrated CapEx discipline with cash CapEx reduced by &#x20AC;650 million year-on-year, to &#x20AC;8.6 billion excluding the spectrum without jeopardizing the necessary investments in the infrastructure in our businesses.</p>
          <p>Turning to our cost-cutting program, Save 4 Service, we achieved cost savings of &#x20AC;2.4 billion, at the corporate level or almost 60% of the total targeted 4.2 billion which we have in our program for 2010 to 2012, strong savings coming now from all major divisions. This resulted in a net cost base reduction for the group of &#x20AC;1 billion. Strong underlying net savings in Germany and Europe partially offset by reinvest predominantly in the U.S.</p>
          <p>As promised at our Investors Day last year, I would like to update you on the work we are doing at Deutsche Telekom with regard to return on capital employed and the respective developments. After introducing ROCE as the key steering logic last year, we're working on all key measures to drive improvements.</p>
          <p>Management incentivization, including line management, with ROCE has been introduced starting from this year: reducing the OpEx base through our Save 4 Service program, which has become part of our group culture remains a core focus and it's already running ahead of our targets; central free cash flows steering including the optimization of our working capital throughout the next years; More proactive portfolio steering including fixing underperforming assets as proven by our U.K. joint venture or currently the initiatives around the U.S. operation; and last but not least, continued discipline with regard to mergers and acquisitions as demonstrated in the last two years.</p>
          <p>But let me be very clear, we are not satisfied with the ROCE development in 2010. Although the underlying ROCE slightly improved to 4.5%, the personnel restructuring measures as well as the impact of the formation of the U.K. joint-venture and the solution in Poland weighted on the ROCE and resulted in a reported ROCE of 3.5%.</p>
          <p>All three effects represent deliberate management decisions for the longer-term benefit of the company and the longer-term ROCE development, but with a short-term negative trade-off on the ROCE in 2010. Despite all the moving parts of the ROCE, we remain committed to improving our ROCE at Deutsche Telekom over the next few years.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude by reviewing our balance sheet, our key balance sheet ratios remain solid and well within our comfort zone ratios. Compared to a year ago, the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA increased to 2.2 times, but is down from the peak of 2.3 times as of Q2.</p>
          <p>Gearing remained stable at one time, while the equity ratio actually improved by almost 1 percentage point to 33.7. Our credit ratings remain stable, with also a stable outlook from all agencies.</p>
          <p>With this, Ren&#xE9; Obermann and I are now ready for your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Mr. Peter Nielsen from Cheuvreux. May we have your questions please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Two questions, please. First one relates to the U.S, at the recent Investor Day, you gave a target for a slight increase in service revenues in 2011. Now adjusted for the insourcing of insurance revenues the current trend is obviously in the opposite direction. Was the guidance for 2011 slightly increased always based on the added insurance revenues included in service revenues?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on GHS, obviously, we are seeing a somewhat larger loss in Q4, could you elaborate a little bit on where this is coming from, and whether this is the level we should anticipate going forward? Thank you.</p>
          <p>And also if I may just add a third question, the CapEx guidance for 2011 seems to have come down sort to the level with 2010, which is obviously below what you indicated earlier for this year, where this is just coming from, is it related to a slower build out of fiber in Germany? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, Peter, what makes us confident that we can grow revenues and EBITDA in 2011, it's actually &#x2013; we have good momentum with regard to smartphone uptake, smartphone penetration in our base have increased considerably. And data ARPU is increasing and has increased as you saw quarter-over-quarter &#x2013; very stable. So we do expect this momentum of data service revenues to continue, and we will push very hard for bringing smartphones and tablets into the market. So our offering is much more compelling now, especially in terms of network. We have an improved coverage now of our 4G network with 21-megabit per second up to 200 million POPS, and this year we will even grow it to 42-megabit per second, and we'll reach by mid of the year about 140 million POPS. So that's a very significant improvement in the network performance, and we believe that we can monetize that.</p>
          <p>Insourcing of handset insurance supports it, it is not the only factor, but it does support the revenue as well. As we said the margins will be relatively flat, because the focus really has to be on customer retention and customer growth. And therefore, we're not promising the growth, but we think we can grow revenues again.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Peter, your question with regards to the GHS cost. In the fourth quarter, our EBITDA for GHS went down by 130 million. And I think this drop can be easily explained as 100 million less from real estate sales. And the rest is maybe additional year-end payments in the CTIO and the PI. So in this transforming area, where we are growing costs to foster growth. If we look to the full-year on the GHS, there is a deviation of around 500 million and off of my mind, 250 million is described due to lower release of provisions, compared to last year. 110 million, something around that one is costs from the group wide realignment of management structure. 18 million is coming from higher personnel costs, this is staff inflow around, let's say, the Vivento services and then 16 million is due to exchange within the cross charging within the group wide technology division.</p>
          <p>So overall, this is an increase, yes. And we are not satisfied with that and we have reacted on it with a program which we call shave the headquarters, so revitalizing our sales and service initiatives includes as well the headquarters and we will come up with tangible assets within the course of this year to further control, let's say, the costs here at the headquarters.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there, it's Ulrich at Jefferies actually. Two questions maybe, one sort of following up on Peter's question on GHS. If I simply look at the quarter, the fourth quarter on a year-on-year basis, at the Vivento costs, what was the Vivento EBITDA, was it material, or part of the sort of increase in the cost. Normally, I would associate that with some sort of increased transfers out. But the transfers out sort of increased from 2.3 to only 2.8 million. So I was wondering why is the cost in Vivento going up so much year-on-year in the fourth quarter? Have you maybe spent money that will help you in the first or second quarter this year? Is this sort of some costs that you have taken upfront?</p>
          <p>Second question, on the press conference earlier this morning, I think Mr. Obermann that he hopes to be able to be more precise about options in the U.S in coming months. And also during the call just now, I think you mentioned sort of the U.K. and the U.S. in the same breath. So I was wondering what sort of options are we talking about here? Are you talking simply about the operational improvements here, or are you talking really about some more structural sort of options? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me begin with the last part of the question, do not please interpret too much into this. I just said that we are looking through the variety of options with regards to ranging from network sharing to spectrum leasing to even network sharing and we're just looking at various options organic and inorganic options. So do not interpret anything else than what I just said. And you know I would think that in the next couple of months we should come to some good solutions there. As I said, we have a number of options, not just one. And therefore we will find the best solution and we will come back to you in due course. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to come back to the question on GHS for the fourth quarter, we had &#x2013; the deviation is $180 million is due to lower release of provision. $80 million caused by group wide realignment of management structures, $30 million is lower income from sale of real estate, and $80 million is due to lower ex-charging with group wide technology. So is there anything which is fostering or supporting growth for next year? I would say not in these numbers, but nevertheless we have built up our resources around the CTI organization throughout the year. And we have -- definitely revenue and even in EBITDA planning for this growth initiatives.</p>
          <p>There was another question which I think we haven't answered at the beginning with regards to the CapEx. And the question do we fall behind competition with regards to the spending on the CapEx? Overall, if you look to the benchmarks, you would see that Deutsche Telekom is -- has a less higher CapEx to sales or even CapEx to EBITDA ratios than most of our competitors. And it was always our belief that fast mobile broadband or fast fixed band networks are the best guarantee for fostering let's say profitability over time. Last year, we have spent less, but not with regard to our rollout strategy. There is more benefit, which we had from the cash flow scheme within the group, which he had from a better management of our payables and which we had from a more efficient procurement. We know that the conditions of our procurement department are better than in the industry. And therefore, it is more of an efficiently question than rather a strategic impact on our investments. So I would definitely say no, there was no negative impact on our competitive positioning here.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Yeah, German importment related question. We have seen some recent price actions from cable, now heavily promoting 100-Mbit speeds. And my question is in this context, first of all, what is the average speed that your customer takes right now? I guess it has increased recently with the strong pickup of your VDSL offers and how has the speed changed over the last 24 months? And do you expect to reach the level of your VDSL speed around 50-Mbit any time soon as the average speed that the customer requires. That means will then fiber be very important for you at that point in time? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Thomas. Average speed has increased significantly over the last two years. I think we are coming from a few megabits to I think what now would be an average of 16 or so, if I'm not mistaken. If you take the average between DSL and VDSL and we also offer in a large number of households ADSL2+. And that is being accepted more and more or being pushed more and more, whatever you want. Over the next couple of years, the VDSL and the fiber part will become much more important and therefore we have started to roll out fiber, although in small numbers still, and we have to go very selectively at the moment with the rollout of fiber, but we do it complementary to VDSL and we will continue to push for it in the next couple of years, because over time it will become much more important.</p>
          <p>For the time being, I think we are fine with VDSL we have it in 11 million households. But there is a certain number of households, several million households where we either &#x2013; where we neither VDSL nor fiber, but where cable is and these households are potentially endangered, and therefore we'll have to focus our build out on these households and we'll make sure that we fight against cable.</p>
          <p>Bear in mind, it's not just about a nominal speed. Speed is important but it's not all about speed. It's also about the entire service suite; it's what we offer. It's the content as well as the interactive platform as well as converged services from wireless to how to utilize the Entertain service remotely, on-site installation, security packages and so forth.</p>
          <p>And if you take all the factors into account, by the way supported by the numbers so far, we think we're very competitive and so far the numbers show it and underpin it. If you look at the market share from cable it is still fairly weak comparing it to other countries, but we are not na&#xEF;ve. We realize that speed over the next years will become increasingly important and therefore Tim and I are now working very hard to find the best possible way to how to build out fiber and how to remain competitive.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. A couple of questions. Just coming back on some of the comments you made about the U.S. And so I think one of the things I read was a fairly clear ruling out of an acquisition of Sprint. But I'm just wondering whether you would consider partnerships with Sprint or you're effectively saying that there is no possibility to do anything at all with that operator?</p>
          <p>And the second question was again really about the U.S. We saw the gross adds have come down in Q4 which I think, to some extent, was driven by tougher credit controls on your part. So I'm just kind of wondering to what extent that will contribute to churn over the next 12 months and when we should start to see the benefits of that come through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Matthew. I wish I could answer your specific question with regards to any un-organic move and here in particular with regards to Sprint and I'm afraid I can't. Let me just reassure you that we're looking at all potential options, which seem to make sense to us and therefore, I can't go into specific speculations. I'm sorry.</p>
          <p>What happened in Q4? I mean, the contract net adds were disappointing clearly. The delta to the previous quarter was 258,000, but bear in mind, and I'm not at all saying that it's not a problem. It is a problem, but bear in mind that 158,000 came from machine-to-machine. So basically less machine-to-machine connectivity in Q4 than in Q3 and the rest was indeed as you pointed out mostly due to increased credit standards, which resulted in a shift to prepaid. Now are we happy with 300,000 prepaid and 300,000 contract loss and prepaid growth? No, the relationship will be much better, but this is part of the reason. Part of it is really that nearly 300,000 prepaid net-adds came in and that was a significant up from the number in Q3. When we show you we'll keep working on this. The management team is focused, but we need, I guess, we need even more time to get this fixed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe Matthew, specifically on the credit standards, which indeed were raised by the colleagues of T-Mobile U.S. late Q3 and also in Q4. That obviously had some impact on the contract cost adds. But the moves were NPV positive based on the recent customer behavior trends. And so that was also the reason why we made the moves in the third and fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>Mr. Hannes Wittig from J.P. Morgan. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. It's really two follow up questions. The first one is going back to the U.S. guidance for slight growth in 2011. I understood you that you said the insurance revenues are T&amp;S contributing. But they will contribute about 1.5 percentage point. So would it be fair to say that if the other bit is also growing that you would expect growth to be more than 2%, or is it really only the insurance revenues that will get it in growth territory?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, you've talked a bit about fiber, very specifically in 2011, in, let's say the 8.5 billion or so that you will spend on CapEx how much of that will be on fiber in Germany? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hannes, hi. U.S. guidance for 2011, look we cannot split really where the regions that we expect growth to come from. But the insurance side definitely is contributing to it. We also believe that the mobile Internet growth is a very healthy trend. And bear in mind that so far only part of our base is penetrated with smartphone devices and now tablets will even make it a bigger trend. And as you know as we are great believers in the big tablet boom. And so we're well poised to participate there with a range of android based devices. So I think the trend overall is healthy. We're facing severe competition with regards to our contract customers. But overall the market trend is healthy and we believe in wireless internet as the biggest driver of our future growth.</p>
          <p>And how much of the CapEx will be on fiber? Tim said it's a few hundred million this year, which is basically on the access network. But there is more to it, because it's not just the access part, but also the production and the service management part. So it's a few percent only, you could say, but it's a few hundred million.</p>
          <p>Just a last word. The number can go up. If the regulatory opportunity or the regulatory environment improves a little bit, for instance, if the regulator accepts that regionally the market conditions are such that there's no more need to regulate Deutsche Telekom, because we're no longer the market dominant player. That's number one thing.</p>
          <p>Second, symmetric regulatory conditions which give us the same and equal chances to the other players such as cable and the like. Third, mutually open access, so we can also utilize the infrastructure of third parties and so forth. So there is a number of asymmetries in the regulatory environment, which I consider very unfair and useless with regards to the overall objectives to get fiber built out and we keep fighting for better conditions and better terms.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Yeah just firstly on LTE in Germany. I guess, it's been going for a month or two now. I just wondered if you could talk a bit about your strategy for LTE in Germany? How do you grow the market without substituting your fixed-line business, particularly given that it's being built in areas where DSL speeds are quite slow.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in the last month you seem to have announced a new plan to try to un-bundle cable by interconnecting with the wiring in the multiple dwelling units. I kind of wonder if you could sort of elaborate on this plan? For example, do you have any targets for the number of TV homes you would like to have connected by the end of next year?</p>
          <p>Finally France Tel was saying that they want to rationalize their portfolio. I wondered if you were interested in any of their assets: Austria, Poland would be examples that spring to mind. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Justin, strategy for growing markets without substituting fixed. I'm not sure this should be our strategy. I think, we should let the customer choose, but this would be a high-class problem. First and foremost, we're deploying LTE where DSL or VDSL is currently, under the current market conditions unfeasible to provide. So, we use LTE primarily for offering customers a faster Internet access and then we combine that with PSTN voice and that becomes a nice bundle for our customers. So they can use whatever wireless, voice communication either at home through their Decks telephones or through the GSM and they can use LTE for accessing the Internet and then all together we bundle for what &#x20AC;39 also. That's a good product. So and if at some stage customers will choose LTE rather than fixed line, that's fine as long as they stay with us.</p>
          <p>Unbundling cable plans, targets for number of TV homes connected: let me just check what we have, what we communicate here. There are approximately 45,000 companies in the housing industry in Germany. And TV only products include 25 to 30 channels with individual -- via individual contracts with those housing associations since 15th of February. But the TV only product has nothing to do with Entertain, bear that mind please. It's level-4 technology's co-ax and we connect level-4 with existing fiber. And the TV only signal would include Sky, which is optional available now. But there are no specific targets, nothing we have communicated and it's very early days. We just started two weeks ago.</p>
          <p>So now interest in assets in Austria and Poland, cooperation? I think we've clearly communicated that we are willing to partner with France Telecom in Poland on the network side. And we would like to build a great future network together with our French partners, which makes a lot of sense. As we co-operate in other areas such as products standardization, Wi-Fi roaming to address our business community and so forth. So we are on very good terms with our French partners.</p>
          <p>And I should say, Tim just reminds of, no multibillion dollar acquisitions planned. We keep disciplined and we do not acquire anybody of our same business in Poland or Austria.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much. I wondered if you could elaborate a little bit on what you see from here being the outlook for ROCE and update us perhaps on what you &#x2013; or remind us what you said at the Investor Day, but also given it's come down in 2010, where do you think the path is from here and how do you kind of continue to try to push up the underlying number and grow the headline up to catch up?</p>
          <p>And also if I could just come back to an earlier point, which in answer to a previous question you mentioned that you thought that the options for network share/spectrum resolution in the States would be clear in the next couple of months. I wondered if you meant couple them into in that instance or if you meant it to mean slightly looser definition and if you could qualify that comment as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Simon. It's Tim. We already planned to give you all and more details on the ROCE logic. But due to the time pressure we have on this investor call, I think we should take the discussions more in the bilateral or on the road shows, because there is a lot more to talk about.</p>
          <p>The first thing is ROCE is now implemented as within the Corporate Governance codes of Germany as one of our mid-term targets, not only for the top management, but as well for all the other levels within the organization. And we have a much better understanding about let's say, what is influencing the ROCE. The ROCE in our definition is including all assets and it's including as well all OpEx related factors. And therefore, it is a beast. To say very honest, because there is more adjusted to something. And the big asset base, which we have and just to mention, 26% of our asset base are intangibles, 70% are goodwills. So this big asset pieces are not really sensitive on that one. And we have a better understanding about the regions about the platforms nowadays. How we could influence the ROCE. And to give you adjust to sensitivities. 10 basis points are ROCE on an EBITDA perspective means 170 million more EBITDAR or 10 basis points ROCE on the net operating asset side means a shift of 3 billion &#x2013; 3.3 billion even with regards to the asset base. So it's a beast, which is not easy to move. What we learned on top of that is, that we should not only focus on EBITDA, we should, as well focus on the special effects, which we have in that business.`</p>
          <p>To give you a number, we had one billion of cost for the early retirement programs and the transformation of our workforce within Germany. And this is even 100% impacting the return on capital employed. So we even have to focus on these areas, which are not included in the EBITDA at that point in time. So I cannot give you all the details at that point of time. I only could say that, we are working on all areas, management incentives, on the OpEx tierings on the responsibility of OpEx but as well on assets, on the CapEx allocation, on the working capital improvement, on the portfolio steering, our initiatives around the U.S. are definitely as well towards ROCE improvement. And as well not in ending with higher goodwills or higher intangibles on the longer-term, which is as well affecting our ROCE negative. And what I could say is, the management is still very much committed to improve the ROCE over the next years until 2012 by 150 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And let me comment on the timeframe on potentially inorganic or partnering solutions in the U.S. There is no immediate time pressure on the spectrum side, because we do have with our spectrum position currently, we are okay for potentially even another two to three years. That's not the problem. But I still would expect and I would be disappointed if in the course of the year, we don't find a good longer-term solution. So we're working on this, but we're not under immediate time pressure. And since we have a number of options. We need to take a little time to move the right one down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. I got a question about your 2011 guidance for essentially stable EBITDA year-on-year. Essentially in Q4 of this year, if we takeout the impact of the U.S. dollar movement, three quarters of the Hungarian tax and also the impact of the loss of the '02 wholesale contract. We get to an EBITDA trend year-on-year of minus 8%. I'm interested in what you see as changing so dramatically next year to allow you to post flat year-on-year EBITDA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Karen, it's Tim. Look, first, we should not compare 19.5 with 19.1, because the 19.5 is including the first quarter in &#x2013; of the UK operation in 2010. And for 2011, we have all business without the U.K. So we have to compare 19.3 with 19.1.</p>
          <p>So with that, we are 1% rounded say in the number for last year with our guidance. Why are we so optimistic, first, in Germany, we aim at least for a stable EBITDA. And this despite the MTR, impact which has a lot to do with the run rate, which we have o the business and which we have on the Save 4 Service initiatives where we foresee further net savings coming in during the course of the year.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we see an improvement in the macroeconomic environment at least from most of the countries. I would like to stress Poland, I'd like to stress the Czech Republic and I would like to stress as well the Hungarian environment. Nevertheless, we hate that extra tax which was pushed into our business but the overall consumption climate has stabilized or even improved. The biggest concern, by the way, which we have in the footprint is Romania and Greece. So there are less countries than there were just one year ago. So we believe that we could benefit from this macroeconomic trend in these areas and improve in these areas our EBITDA. Don't forget that we have a big Save 4 Service initiative as well in this area, which is hopefully then as well contributing to that one.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., we have let out that we want to return to revenue, which is helping us as well on the EBITDA side. We do not want to sacrifice on the margin here and therefore there is as well a positive expectation, which could offset the negative impact you have mentioned. So that said, we believe that with our internal plan and then with the numbers we have seen and the run rates we have, we believe that we could achieve the 19.1 on the EBITDA side.</p>
          <p>To let you know, our underlying US dollar, euro exchange rate is &#x2013; at last year's level is 1.33. So there is no speculation or no let's say bets on another dollar exchange rate here in our numbers. It is definitely coming from the operational measures, which we have.</p>
          <p>On the free cash flow guidance, we are much more confident. We had 6.5 billion by the last year and honestly we had 6.2, mentioned to the market, and now we say from the highest starting point 6.5. We believe that we could increase the free cash flow for this year, which is so relevant for the <mark type="inaudible" /> and the three-year planning and the reason for that confidence is that we have already some tailwind from the fourth quarter, which we are taking into the first quarter and as well as the CapEx there, we are, we believe this is a business we're even more optimistic around on that number.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions please. First with regard to the German broadband market. We're seeing that in Q4 market share has dipped a little bit and that seems to be a conscious decision from you guys, because you think the market is a bit irrational in certain segments. My question is what kind of expectations do you have for 2011? Do you believe that the market or some segments of the market will remain and be tough? And that could lead market share, but you're relaxed with that? Or do you believe that the competitive environment will improve? And then the general framework or the general question here is, can that affect your stable EBITDA guidance for Germany in 2011?</p>
          <p>The second question has to do with the free cash flow. Tim, you just highlighted that the free cash would be stable? Could you maybe give us a little bit of details in terms of the elements in the free cash flow? Obviously we have the EBITDA, what about CapEx, working capital, restructuring, taxes, etcetera? That would be very helpful. Thank you.</p>

          <p>The first part, market share, the objective really is to keep our market share of existing customer base, we're in the vicinity of 45, 46% at this point of time in broadband, not to give up that market share, but to defend that market share. It's unrealistic to assume that we can constantly do more than 40% or that we would like to keep the existing share for as long as possible. It's going to get harder against the cable guys. But as I said earlier on, if we have the right mix in our propositions from value added services to access speeds and a good price position with some premium but not excessive premium. Then I think it should be doable. So a combination of different factors including good marketing, brand management and so forth will help. And that's the objective for broadband. Wireless, we want to defend our market share. And Wireless we also want to defend our leadership very clearly against Vodafone.</p>

          <p>Mathieu, some answers on the free cash flow map for 2011 assuming that we have an EBITDA of 19.1%. And we believe that the CapEx, which we're going to see and spend something in the vicinity of last year, something around 8.5, 8.6 billion. We assume on interest rate as well on last year's level of 2.5 billion. Then we have taxes around one billion. And which will lead us to sum of 7.2. Restructuring related payments around the vicinity of 1.5 billion. And then we anticipate as well some inflow from the disposal of used equipment 0.3 billion and we have a dividend from the U.K. in the vicinity of 0.4 billion. And then we have our working program, working capital management program up and running and now you need to do the full math on the guidance of 200 million 0.2 and internally we have a slightly higher number on the management of the tables and the inventories and as well as on the receivables but in the math, you need another 200 million from the working capital management, which will give you then let's say, an understanding of how we're going to achieve let's say a slightly increasing free cash flow.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. A question on Germany. If you come back to this market for 2011 in mobile, we had a very sharp MTR reduction and I guess so far the comments from E-Plus have been fairly supportive but do you expect any reaction on the retail side or on the other hand do you expect retail prices to remain significantly higher than MTR? And so, if you could elaborate a little bit more on the trends of what you're seeing on the mobile data side and growth prospects for the 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frederik, the MTR reductions were, as we all know, significant and cable was part of that so that means &#x2013; if we assume no volume elasticity, the revenue impact in 2011 is quite significant, it's between 200 million and 300 million. That's the revenue impact. The EBITDA impact is significantly lower than that, can be mitigated and it's all factored then into our assumptions for 2011, part of it is driven by the revolver, a little bit more conservative for 2011 in the projections than for 2010. So we hopefully see that we have made the right assumptions.</p>
          <p>Growth prospects for mobile data. We're very &#x2013; I'm probably the most optimistic person with regard to mobile Internet in this entire corporation. 4.4 billion was last year's revenue in 2010. I think the 10 billion revenues from wireless Internet services, which we have published for 2015, are conservative and very easy to reach. If I am honest, I think there's more opportunity than that. We just need to make the right decisions and invest into the capacity, because capacity is going to be the biggest constraint in the next couple of years in every market and therefore who is best positioned with this mobile network and the best range of devices and some additional services will make the race. And therefore I think the growth prospects are significant and our assumptions are doable, reachable and without any problems.</p>

          <p>Hi there. You mentioned the dividends from Everything, Everywhere. Looking at the result, is there a chance that Everything, Everywhere may repay shareholder loans or lever up more to increase returns to Deutsche Tel and France Tel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jonathan, Everything, Everywhere we are definitely in the preparation for a non-recourse funding of the Everything, Everywhere investment together with our French friends. And this will help us to pay out an extra dividend towards the mother companies. Today, the company is unlevered as you know, there are only some smaller company debts on it. But we are definitely preparing something on it. And we will go into the market during the course of this year.</p>
