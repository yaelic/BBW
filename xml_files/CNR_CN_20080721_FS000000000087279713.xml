          <p>Welcome to the CN Second Quarter 2008 Financial Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Robert Noorigian, Vice-President, Investor Relations. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Noorigian.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The way I would like to start is just by reminding you of the comments that have already been made regarding the forward-looking statements. With me today is Hunter Harrison, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Claude Mongeau, Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer, and James Foote, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing.</p>
          <p>After our presentation, we will take questions from you that are listening by phone, and could you please identify yourself when asking the questions and in order to be fair can you limit the number of questions that you are asking to a reasonable two.</p>
          <p>With that it's my pleasure to introduce CN's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Hunter Harrison.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robert. Thanks everyone for joining us to discuss the results of the effective quarter, which overall I was very pleased with given the challenging environment we are facing out there with the economy, and Canadian dollar and the impact of foreign exchange, housing starts, but probably most importantly the real volatility we're seeing with fuel.</p>
          <p>Let me just make a few highlights before Jim and Claude get into more of the details. Our revenues were up 4%, if you adjust for exchange they were up 8%. Operating ratio came in at 66.3% which shows a reported year-over-year deterioration of 6 points, but I would point out to you just a couple of items, mostly the fuel lag which accounts for about 4 points there. The diluted EPS came in at $0.95, which includes a 5% income tax recovery.</p>
          <p>I think probably the most important thing in the quarter was that, from an operating standpoint, we had outstanding performance. Just about any metric you can look at across the board exceeded previous records, whether it's the train productivity with the train size, the load factor, whether it was our locomotive productivity and miles per day, whether it was car miles per day, productivity in yards. Our car inventory, I think, on a quarter-over-quarter basis of rolling stock was down about 6%, and as we go into the third quarter those numbers are moving up even higher.</p>
          <p>We have several initiatives that are coming together in the third quarter that will affect productivity even further. I think we will see our car miles per day in the second half go up to a world record level of over 200. We're going to have the final touches on the new yard at Memphis sometime before the third quarter is over, and those two things will serve us well as we go forward. So, from an operating standpoint, excellent performance. And so with that brief overview let me recognize Claude to bring down the financials even further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hunter. Overall, it was indeed a good quarter, especially given the challenges that we face. Our operations bounced back from what was a tough winter with very solid operating metrics and you mentioned the key ones. Basically if you look at our results, those operating metrics helped us offset the headwinds from a weak economy, very high fuel prices and the appreciating Canadian dollar. We turned in $0.90 versus $0.95 last year of EPS, if I exclude the gains on deferred taxes of basically $0.05 during this quarter and $0.06 last year. This is only a 5% reduction in EPS in what was a sluggish volume environment with a number of sectors facing recessionary conditions. This is pretty good especially when you consider that the appreciating Canadian dollar alone cost us roughly $0.05 or 5% of the EPS, and the lag impact on our fuel surcharge cost us from $0.07 to $0.08 or basically 7% or 8% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>So, if it wasn't for these two items alone, our EPS would have been growing on a year-over-year basis in the mid single-digits. But at the end of the day we have to take the good and the bad, and our results came in the following. Our revenues performed well with a 4% increase as reported, or as Jim will explain 8% on a year-over-year basis FX adjusted.</p>
          <p>On the expense side the story is obviously fueled with record prices, an increase of nearly 70% driving our overall expense increase of 14% as reported, or 19% FX adjusted, as I'll explain a little bit further in a minute.</p>
          <p>As a result our operating ratio came in just above 66%, this is a 6 point increase largely driven by the impact of fuel, which as Hunter said explain about a four percentage points increase. Below the line our other income came in good with 9 million. This was helped by realized foreign exchange gain of roughly 7 or $8 million. So the large part of our other income is the foreign exchange gain on a realized basis.</p>
          <p>Our taxable income was lower because of the impact of the $23 million gain from reduced deferred income tax, this is provincial jurisdiction in Canada that have announced future income tax reduction.</p>
          <p>At 27% tax rate on a book basis, this is obviously lower than our guidance that I provided you before which still stands around 30 to 31% on a book basis, the effective tax rate. So all-in-all, a pretty good result.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to the expense. Overall as I said an increase of 19% FX-adjusted, however if I exclude fuel the increase is closer to 6%.</p>
          <p>Let me talk about fuel first. During the quarter we paid roughly $124 per barrel for oil. That compares with $65 last year. The crack margin were not &#x2013; we're basically on the same story paying, let's see, roughly $25 per barrel versus 15 last year. So you are talking about a 70% increase in the price of fuel. This was offset by slightly lower volume and productivity gain for a total increase of 68% adjusted for exchange. Casualty and the other expense category saw a significant increase. Here we were benefiting in 2007 from a significant reduction in our legal claims due to the actuarial study that we do in the second quarter. We do two actuarial studies, one in the second quarter and one in the fourth quarter, and as you recall last year we had significant legal claim pickup in both quarters. The year-over-year increase is about 45 million due to those legal claims. So you could see that we were able to offset this with a few other areas where expenses increased offset by goods performance in the area of accident costs.</p>
          <p>The other expense category were well behaved, labor and fringe benefits, basically our pension expense reduction helped offset wages and a slightly higher head count. The reduction of roughly $38 million is explained by lower stock-based compensation with our stock price coming down from the high that it was in Q2 of last year.</p>
          <p>Purchased services, well behaved also, an increase of around 11%, $20 million largely because of the third-party expense that we had to accommodate for the growth of CN's worldwide activities. We also had higher repair and maintenance costs during the quarter. Equipment rents, up only 2%. Basically very good velocity.  As Hunter pointed out our velocity increased by roughly 10% during the second quarter, but this was offset by lower car hire offline income as many of our cars, particularly in the forest products area are not &#x2013; are no longer attracting offline income on the other railroads.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization, up roughly 7% exchange-adjusted as a result of our CapEx spending, but also the impact of our new depreciation rates with the study we completed in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>If I turn to free cash flow, we generated year-to-date $225 million, that's $174 million better than last year. Lower income was reduced by much significantly reduced outflows for working capital. The story here however is the $360 million outflow that we had last year that paid for the 2006 tax installment. If I exclude that item, our free cash flow on a year-over-year basis is actually down on the order of $190 million.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we used our cash to buy back $345 million worth of shares for 6 million shares exactly. That brings our total program to 31 million shares or $1.6 billion from July-to-July. And I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors earlier today approved a new program starting this July until next year for 25 million shares. If you look at it, this is about 5% of our float. It represents at current prices something on the order of $1.3 billion of cash outflow, which if you adjust for the fact that we plan to acquire and pay for the purchase of the EJ&amp;E of $300 million, keeps our current share buyback at around the same level of this year, that is 1.6 billion minus $300 million for the acquisition, will bring it down to 1.3 billion, or 25 million shares.</p>
          <p>Now that should bring us in line with our broad guidance in terms of use of cash. We expect our adjusted debt to capital to move from the 42.2% that it is now to somewhere in the range of 45 or 46% with this buyback program, and for our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA coverage ratio to move from the 2.1 times that it is now to the 2.25 times or thereabout in a year from now. This is in line with our guidance and it's consistent with our approach for use of cash.</p>
          <p>Let me say just a few words to wrap up with a perspective on what's ahead of us. It's clear that we are facing a near term environment that's very challenging. But the good news is some of the headwinds that we have been facing in the first six months, we are hoping will taper a little bit in the balance of the year. A good example is the fuel surcharge. During the first half, the fuel surcharge lag alone cost us in the range of $0.11. The foreign exchange impact is another element which during the first six months cost us roughly $0.11. As you look out to the balance of the year, if fuel prices does indeed stabilize around $135, which is the assumption we are using at this point, the fuel surcharge lag should be a lot less in the next half. In fact it should be basically only a penny or two. Similarly for exchange, last year the Canadian dollar was at or around parity for the second half of the year. Our assumption of a dollar that stays around parity means that we should not have a headwind on this front.</p>
          <p>We are expecting the economy to &#x2013; not (sic) to go through a tough period and to start to recover in the second half. Now that is the tough one to call. There are obviously signs out there of consumer confidence continuing to deteriorate, of housing starts having difficulty and the real estate prices continuing their way down. But we do believe that this fiscal stimulus in the U.S. that the convergence of growth on a global basis should provide enough of a support base for the economy to avoid a deeper recession and for it to start recovering in the balance of the year. If it does, we would expect North American GDP growth in or around 1%, and that should allow us to come in for the full year in terms of EPS around the guidance that we've provided you before which is mid single digit range for the full year.</p>
          <p>Now there is a lot of uncertainty, there is a lot of volatility, but we're focused on generating the efficiency and on capturing the market share gains that are available to us, and that is our near term outlook for performance. Longer term, the good news is this economy at some point will rebound. And when it does, we are well-positioned. We have a great franchise, we have a low cost model and our ability in a high fuel price environment to gain market share from trucks is proving itself. That is the condition we believe are going to be there for railroads in general and for CN in particular because we do have a significant portion of our business that is susceptible and sensitive to the rate of economic growth.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you, Claude. I'd like to go through the second quarter results beginning on an exchange-adjusted basis. In the second quarter our total revenue grew by 8%. The pricing environment remains positive. Our same-store prices on a per unit basis increased over 4.5%. With crude prices almost doubling since last year, higher fuel surcharge recoveries also added 5% to revenue growth. Offsetting the gain from price in fuel was lower volume. RTMs were down 2%, carloads were down 1%. I'm actually pretty pleased with these volume numbers. When you consider that our second quarter lumber and panel carloadings were down 42% from two years ago, and auto carloads were down 25% since last year. To have volumes close to flat shows the strength of our diverse franchise.</p>
          <p>Let's break these revenue numbers apart by commodity group. The first line, petroleum and chemicals, up 13%. Petroleum related markets continue to be solid. The diluent volumes into the Western Canadian oil sand region continue to grow. Sulfur shipments, both dry for offshore markets and molten to the U.S., are high due to global demand. Biodiesel shipments from the U.S. Midwest are up as production increases, and partially offsetting those gains were lower shipments of plastic pellets.</p>
          <p>On the chemical side, chemical shipments increased from a new waste product opportunity, but were lower for industrial chemicals tied to the panel and auto productions businesses.</p>
          <p>Take a look at metals and minerals which was up 12%. In the metals segment there was strength across almost all finished metals products and scrap. Not only are we benefiting from good demand but we are also gaining market share as new distribution patterns evolve as steel companies continue to consolidate.</p>
          <p>On the minerals side, again a good quarter there, a big driver there is sand associated with oil and gas development and moving both to the U.S. Southwest as well as into Western Canada, and new volumes of aggregates into the Edmonton area associated with the Upgrader development projects ongoing there. Iron ore, carloads there were also up, revenues are up there as iron ore shipments remain strong.</p>
          <p>On the Forest Products side, again down 8%, lumber and panels continue to have the difficulties that we've talked about from quarter-to-quarter now, associated with lower demand and lower housing starts. Pulp and paper, the board, wrapping paper and log show positive results this quarter, but that was offset again by the closure of a significant paper mill in Eastern Canada, which occurred in August of last year.</p>
          <p>Automotive side down 8%, reduced shipments there, both finished vehicle and parts, to some degree associated with the strike of a supplier by one of our larger customers, as well as lower motor vehicle sales, which progressively got worse as the quarter went on.</p>
          <p>On the coal side of the business there in the U.S. we were up there in carloads 2%, again as the new mine that we've talked about in the Illinois Basin has come online, most of that gain being offset by another mine there in the Illinois Basin, which is having problems with production. And then on the Canadian side of our coal franchise, increased volumes there, pet coke from the Alberta oil sands project were offset by lower volumes due to some mining issues in Canada.</p>
          <p>Grain and fertilizers in the U.S., U.S. corn, soybean and related products were up on the strength of shipments to export from processors and of increased ethanol shipments. And in Canada we were down lower volumes of wheat for export primarily due to lower available stocks to move.</p>
          <p>On the fertilizer side, good strength continues there, shipments of both liquid and dry fertilizers were up on demand. And in Intermodal, up 15%, on the overseas side of the business very strong shipments to the West Coast, Vancouver as well as very good volumes coming in through Prince Rupert, offset as slower volume on the East Coast principally driven there by trade with Europe's ship manufacturers were down. And on the domestic side, very good numbers on the domestic side. There is our Intermodal services there, especially the products associated with our Canadian retail offerings, as well as transporter shipments have grown. Other revenues just worthy of mention up quite significantly there, up 28% in the quarter reflecting our non-rail transportation services which we've talked about on prior calls.</p>
          <p>The outlook in terms of the commodities, again using Mr. Noorigian's slide chart here to show what's showing a negative and a positive trend. Petroleum and chemicals, the outlook there is pretty good with shipments associated with oil sands projects continuing to grow as well as these alternative fuel opportunities. In the metals and minerals, again good solid outlook there, very few &#x2013; imports of steel products are down moving into the U.S. So, our opportunity there continues to grow as well as these market share gains which come really from truck as the industry has consolidated and the mergers have occurred, shipping patterns which favor rail versus short haul truck continue to evolve. On the lumber, all I can tell you is the comps get better. The lumber loads really if you look on a quarter-to-quarter basis, about, I would say, began to bottom out in the fourth quarter. And instead of these big numbers that we've been looking at in terms of decline, kind of ballpark lumber declines maybe 5% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Coal, new mine developments both in Canada and in the Illinois Basin will continue. The outlook there is very strong. On the grain and fertilizer side, the Canadian crop should be up about 10% from last year, which was a smaller crop which we are seeing lower stocks available to move right now. And well, I qualify that a little bit, obviously, the crop is going to be good, we are going to have a small carry-in. But we'll have to take a look at that and growing conditions both in Canada and now in the U.S. once the flooding in the Midwest has stopped. And I think the crop outlook there is being revised upward kind of hourly as growing conditions in that regions have improved quite significantly, but we'll have to wait and see for the next USDA projection.</p>
          <p>Rupert Intermodal, I think everyone saw our press release during the quarter where COSCO has brought in their second vessel call now. We are continuing to look for growth from our existing customers as well as new customers. On-track there to meet the numbers that we've talked about for '08, and I'm very optimistic for ''09. And while U.S., in the auto sector in the U.S. we have to continue to watch what's going on with auto production there, but our import traffics through both the east coast and west coast is doing very good.</p>
          <p>So, the outlook, I'm very confident, with the pricing environment continues to perform in the range we've talked about in the 4 to 5%, then we've talked about maybe moving closer to the 5%, the high end of that range, that seems to be taking place. Our volume growth under the circumstances with the two declines in the business units being there. We should see a pick up with some of these other initiatives in the other business segments in the second half. And overall my sense is the economy, clearly getting away from U.S. housing and autos right now, is doing there pretty well. So, we're still continuing to focus on delivering the top-line growth results that we've talked about. Hunter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jim Foote for the presentations. Given what Claude and Jim have just talked to us about, in spite of some of the headwinds, I'm very, very encouraged about the second half year, in spite of what appears to be a less than robust economy. We are clearly, clearly making some market share gains vis-&#xE0;-vis <mark type="inaudible" />. We are seeing some more organic growth where our customers gain market share, and we are picking up market share ourselves, given the fuel prices we're seeing and issues dealing with the environment.</p>
          <p>And I think those trends will certainly continue. Let me just mention briefly a couple of the strategic initiatives that are starting to come together. Jim mentioned a couple of them. We've got the second ship calling on Prince Rupert now. I think the first one was July the 8 I believe. The service is working very well there, that puts us up to five trains a week. We're probably at 65 or so, Jim, percent of capacity there, at Rupert we are probably a signature away from filling up the rest of that capacity. We started moving some of our first aggregate shipments into what has been characterized as up crater alley in Alberta.</p>
          <p>We were very, very excited about the Canpotex announcement to add about 11 million tons of capacity to the West Coast. I think that most of that capacity, I hope and think, will go to Prince Rupert. It's a significant investment on their part of about $0.5 billion, and gives them the ability to about double their capacity. So, I'm sure we're going to participate in that growth, and to what degree we'll be determined as we go forward. And there is a chance that we will be even handling some of the potash and the material through Prince Rupert with CN WorldWide domestic operations, and we're very, very helpful there.</p>
          <p>The last thing that I would mention to you is that I should give you an update on the EJ&amp;E transaction. We are waiting any day now anxiously for the draft report on the environmental impact study from the STD. My personal view is that the pendulum is starting to swing a little bit. We've got some more people to endorse the transaction. There appears to be a more balanced approach. In Chicago I'd think people are starting to understand some of the 'not in my back yard' mentality, and I'm very, very, well let me put it this way, I am cautiously optimistic that we will have this transaction completed by year end. And so with those comments we would be happy to take questions from the group out here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question will be from Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see, I wanted to get your sense, you had mentioned, Hunter, on the Memphis yard opening relatively soon. I wanted to see if you could give us a sense of where we would see the impact from that and perhaps how long it would take to see a meaningful impact on that whether it's on the volume side or whether it's something on the expense side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the Memphis initiative is more on the expense side and it affects more of the U.S. network, and that was the plan with Memphis and with the EJ&amp;E [Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway Company] purchase transaction hopefully subject to its approval. Memphis and Chicago, probably Kirk Yard have begun the two and the only two switching locales of any significance in the U.S. So it will have &#x2013; some of it is already kicked in because we reduced the new yard to the degree, it is completed but the full blown all of the classification tracks will not be completed for a couple of more months. So it will have an impact on the expenses. It will have, mostly in the U.S., although we'll have some impact on the work that's required at Mac Yard and some work that's required in Winnipeg, and a downstream effect it will also have some impacts on the potential rationalization up in another half yard in Canada.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So to really see the impact from that, do you need to have EJ&amp;E in place as well or they are essentially independent and you could see a different factor...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, they're certainly not linear, it's, Memphis does one thing for us and does the X, the EJ&amp;E transaction will do Y, but the best combination is X plus Y. But, if we don't get the EJ&amp;E, Memphis will do a lot more, if we get the EJ&amp;E, Memphis will do what it's going to do and a little bit more given the synergies between the two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay, and then the second question, Claude, on the comp and benefit side, you had a pretty significant reduction in the stock based comp expense, I think you said it was 38 or 36 million year-over-year, something like that. What do you expect in your guidance for the mid-single digits earnings growth for the year? When you look at that in second half, I know it may be a little bit hard to predict, but are you assuming that stock based comp is down pretty significantly in second half or you assume it's kind of a neutral impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, we don't forecast our stock price, but we're expecting it to come down as the &#x2013; to come up as the economy rebound. And so we are properly provided for and can accommodate the normal increase in our stock price from here. It's already up from where it was at the end of Q2.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Good afternoon. Just a question on your guidance and your operating ratio and maybe you can talk about is 66% sustainable at $135 oil, or your expectations are that's going to decline for the rest of the year and then maybe you can talk a little bit about the what was the actual impact of weather and the flood for the first half of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well in terms of the operating ratio, the fact that we're operating at a higher fuel price is having an impact on the operating ratio. It's just the math of the fuel surcharge, recovering the fuel expense, so we have a block of business that's effectively 100% or so operating ratio. So last year, we had lower fuel prices and we also had the benefit of the casualty and other legal claim credit, those things are of the past. Going forward, we see our operating ratio in or around a level that we've achieved for the second quarter of 2008 and with volume coming back and good pricing going forward we will have ability to expand margin from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the flooding, we were about &#x2013; we were much more fortunate than some of our other rails. We had some flooding in Iowa and we certainly had some damage and some delayed operations and some outages, but they were not what you'd call real significant and so we bounced back and our operating people did a good job of getting back into service and the impact to customer is minimized and it was not near the impact that the other or some of other are already experiencing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot. And then just a question on the intermodal, you talked about some of the initiatives you've got going on in Eastern Canada right now to improve volumes there. And I think in the &#x2013; while you were making your presentation you also mentioned that the intermodals were down, intermodal volumes were down in Eastern Canada offset by what we saw in Prince Rupert. Maybe you can talk a little bit about or give some order of magnitude with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I believe &#x2013; I was making a reference to the fact that the Halifax port operations there principally do trade on an international basis from Europe and obviously with the euro where it is right now that trade is suffering. So our volumes through Halifax on a year-over-year basis are down probably about 15%, even though our total carloads or loads in that business group would have been up about 6%, 3% on the overseas and another 10 or so percent on domestic. So that's &#x2013; it is a smaller segment of our overseas franchise, but still the numbers, the decline there is pretty big.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said before I'm very happy to fill up this capacity either with my existing customers, COSCO [China Ocean Shipping Company] and Hanjin that are extremely pleased with the service we are providing to them or within other customer. And right now we are on or ahead of the numbers that we had projected. There was a little slower startup of this service than I had hoped for. But it's really gaining traction and a lot of our customer shippers are clearly pleased with what we are doing. So I am hoping that soon we will get either another customer or further commitment from the existing shippers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good afternoon. Hunter, when you think about the network, if we look at the volumes for the last two, two and a half years, they've been falling and so obviously in a network business, when you've got falling volumes that's a challenge on the margin front. But, if we saw volumes rebound should we think about the margins coming back in the same way, sort of the incremental margin on the extra volume. Is that really powerful to the model here or have you been replacing it such that it's kind of going to come back in at sort of average margins, if you will?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's powerful to the margins. If you look right now as we speak, not for the whole quarter, but our grain volumes are down in Western Canada. Now when grain volumes are down or bulk volumes are down, that in itself just lowers the overall metrics of the productivity of the model. So we are positioned and postured. That's why I am so encouraged, is that with these various initiatives coming on, just volume itself at the same productivity levels raises productivity just the mere numbers there. And so, if we look out in the future a little bit, and if and when, how things start to pick up a little bit, if and when the economy has bottomed out or bottomed up, we get little pick up in the economy and may be fuel comes down a little bit and maybe there is a little bit of weakening of the Canadian dollar, you can see some powerful things taking place. I mean we had a hell of a run here through 2006, set a world record 2006 and you can make a case that '07 was relatively flat, first half was kind of flat, looks like we are going to be better the second half and year over. But, I think you are going to see, I can't tell you when, I am not that smart, 12 months, 18 months or something, this company move away from the plateau and take another run again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if I turn to EJ&amp;E, just two quick questions. If, you said the pendulum is swinging back in your favor, if that is not the case in fact, do you ever walk from it or is it just too critical that this is going to work, you guys are going to stick it out? And then on EJ&amp;E as well, do you &#x2013; are any of the Prince Rupert potential customers, you think they are waiting on that to see how that works or is that not really a part of the thought process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think they are waiting. I mean to Jim's point, the service has not been an issue of what we have advertised and we've been doing it in spite of the fact that we still have the challenges at Chicago. And I think what we've said earlier is clear, would we ever walk, absolutely. I mean if we're good business people. We had fell in love with this deal. We can run this railroad without the EJ&amp;E. We can run it a lot more efficiently with it, but if it gets to the point where the mitigation cost or the timing of the issue is going to drag out for so long and the mitigation cost make it not another business deal, we are very good at turning our back and walk another way and figure another way to skin the cat.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the second half, it looks like, based on the guidance you have about a $0.20 recovery year-over-year over last year's second half numbers. How, if you had to do an attribution and also how would you break that out in terms of factoring FX, fuel you mentioned a couple of cents, I think Claude, and as well as volume and price, and what sort of pricing renewals are you seeing right now? So, I'm just trying to get a sense of the various buckets as you look out into the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, I think you put your finger on the two key issues there. We had headwinds in the first half that were quite significant, fuel surcharge lag was basically a little bit more than a dime and the same for exchange. So, that's a $0.20 headwind in the first half, which according to our assumption at the moment we won't be facing in the second half. So that's number one.</p>
          <p>Number two, we're expecting volume to pickup with a stronger economy where &#x2013; and some of our tougher business segments that lapsed, and we're expecting continued good pricing environment as Jim mentioned. You put it all together in a fluid network and you have the makings for the earnings of the company to rebound and allow us to come in on target with mid-single digits.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we haven't changed, we're &#x2013; we have our work cut out obviously with 225 for the first half to come in on target, but we're not changing our free cash flow guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you seeing any basing in your volumes at all, or in other words in the various sort of major segments, are you seeing any sort of stabilization at all in the sort of the consumer driven or merchandizing of the ex of auto and lumber, are you seeing some stabilization there and maybe perhaps even some softening in the bulk side. Has there been any sort of shift that you can see at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, ex-U.S. housing and auto, the various business segments are still very strong.  In fact like I said in the metals and minerals area just as an example, we're working hard to meet the growing demand of the consumers of steel in the U.S.; it's very strong. Some one-time issues associated with coal, which are going to, that already are fixed and the volumes there are back. Grain, especially in Canada, we had a crop last year, which was about 10% below average, so the available stocks of grain to move are just not there and when the crop comes in it will move. Fertilizer outlook is very good. So I am very optimistic about the other business segments that &#x2013; except the two that we talked about that are going to do very well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Claude, a couple of things, one just for clarification.  When we look at the mid-digits earnings growth, are you including 0.90 or $0.95 as the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, $0.90. The deferred income tax is in our reported GAAP results, but given that we've excluded last year to $280 million of deferred income tax gains give you an apples-to-apples basis; we're working on the basis of $0.90.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you haven't backed off, you just said, of the free cash flow for the year, but it's been two quarters in a row now where working capitals worked against you. Is there something that's going to reverse here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I mean a lot of our working capital issued this quarter is because of the payable that I talked about, the tax installment of last year. We do have our work cut out to finish the year on target with free cash flow, but I am reasonably comfortable we'll be working on all cylinders. Income has got to come back and grow on a year-over-year basis, working capital has got to improve and we got to stick with the budget in terms of capital expenditure. If we do all that, we should be on target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and, Jim, you had said that you are back on track in terms of &#x2013; even ahead of schedule at Prince Rupert.  I believe the guidance was 100 million in revenue for the year or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, for the year. So I mean clearly we were a little bit behind in the first half of the year and now a little bit ahead, and so it kind of nets out to the number that we've talked about in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it feels like then you're on a run rate of above 100 right now if this was the beginning of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again right, yeah, considering the fact that it's a few months later than I had hoped, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on the head count side, it seems like the head count was up a little bit.  I'm not sure of the number, I think it might have been --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A 2% increase.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, how do we think about that going forward with volumes down?  Is the idea that volumes are going to pick up?  So, you're getting in front of that at some point or is it just one quarter and don't make too much of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think that, Ed, I think we've found some more initiatives with contracting in rather than contracting out. But I can guarantee you the only way we're going to do it is the net effect is, the net bottom-line is better off. But I do think, as we've looked at some initiatives and looked at some things and prices out there, we think that we can do some things and bring them in and do it cheaper and more effectively. So the head count number is not significant, but could certainly go up in spite of volumes. Now that would all be on the maintenance side effectively. But you should be sensitive to that as you see it going forward.</p>

          <p>Just on -- back on Prince Rupert just to ask that question a little differently, if you were at 100 million run rate with 300 million capacity, the new with COSCO Hong Kong coming on, where are we in that sort of 300 million utilization there?</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>65, perfect. And now, when you're looking forward I guess you're going to be breaking ground on Phase II next year. Any thoughts on the marketing there and how you're going to be approaching the marketing on the Phase II project?</p>

          <p>It's &#x2013; I don't think we are going to be &#x2013; I don't think breaking ground next year is in the works. Clearly the expansion, the increase of capacity in Prince Rupert is something we are working on and we are pretty confident that once we get to this kind of a run rate that we talked about, that we would be able to take the necessary steps in order to add additional volumes through there.  Whether that's reconfiguring with additional capital expenditure on the existing footprint, whether that is a capital expansion into Phase II or another terminal, all of those options are being studied, but the first goal here is to fill up the terminal that we have. We are on track to do that and we are actively working on being in a position to put more volume through there when we get this Phase sold out.</p>

Just wondering, how much of a commitment is going to be on CN's part in this green &#x2013; obviously this is going to be a greenfield project for Prince Rupert up there.  If it goes ahead up there, how much are you being asked for in terms of contributing to the terminal?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Jim, just a question on the other revenue line, very impressive growth there in sort of second quarter in a row. I was wondering if you could get into a little bit more detail on what parts of the business or the network, where you're seeing that growth.  Are these sort of levels sustainable? And is there anything unusual this quarter given sort of 24% year-over-year growth?  Any real estate sales or anything to boost that?  And are these all sustainable going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, whether or not they are sustainable for the long-term at 28%, I am not sure, but they are certainly sustainable in aggressive growth run rate. The big contributor in this quarter is our trucking operations in the U.S. and trans-border. We have talked about for a long time the fact that we were very effective and had a very successful retail intermodal product offering in Canada where we did the trucking, the pickup and delivery for our customers here and then moved the box on the rail. That traditional business model in the U.S. is much more of a wholesale model. And so we are working very aggressively to roll out that model as a Canadian model in the U.S. So we're doing more trucking down there and so you are seeing the revenue pickup associated with the truck moves at origin and destination in that line item as well as the increase in the domestic revenues in intermodal that we talked about. And that clearly is something that we can aggressively grow. It's a very light assets operated business that we use owner operators to do and we're going to continue to do that. Our revenues in our bulk operation, our vessel operation, our iron ore dock operation are up as the volumes there have been very strong. But the big non-rail transportation increase is associated with the trucking.</p>

And then, Claude, in terms of the guidance, when you go back and you look at your mindset three months ago before fuel ran up versus today, obviously it brought your fuel assumptions up, but the guidance is unchanged.

          <p>Well, I think first and foremost the strength of our Q2 results despite the headwinds. I think the railroad is running very fluidly and we're hopeful that the volume will start to pickup in the second half if the economy holds.  And as I said before, if you leave the headwinds behind and you have an operating model and good volume helping you, that should help us start to show some earnings increase in the third and fourth quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one final question on the pension expense.  Can you &#x2013; could you quantify -- I may have missed it if you said it -- what was the year-over-year positive swing in the quarter for pension expense and what's your expectation for the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; you know what, we do disclose this in our notes when we issue them. It's around 15 million to 17 million, the decline in the second quarter.  And it's pretty much linear until year end when we fix our assumption for the following year. So up until the end of 2008, you should assume that it's in that range.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the 36 to $38 million number that you mentioned earlier, that was excluded pension expense?  That was just incentive stock base comp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it was just stock base on a year-over-year basis, yes.</p>

          <p>Hi, Randy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the alternate plan for GM is going to close. You talked about Halifax being down sort of 15% year-to-date. Forest products business is under some pressure. Have you guys thought about or are there opportunities to consolidate operations in the</p>
          <p>East and drive some costs out of the system? Or is the situation where you just tough it out and see how things play?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Randy, we've already done that. And we try to keep up as we go along. I mean if you looked at one of the things we had the Operating Vice Presidents do in the field is adjust expenses relative to revenues on their individual territories and RTMs and GTMs. And they have &#x2013; and it's very difficult to do. But that's the challenge that we've been able to meet.</p>
          <p>For example, we have recently taken a pair of trains off between Halifax and Montreal. Toronto was a result of the downturn of the 15 to 18% in the business there at Halifax. So a pair of trains there is significant. And the challenge is to still move the containers, provide the service with one less train with reduced volumes. There's initiatives at backyard, there's initiatives all over Eastern Canada as it relates now.</p>
          <p>In the South right now, we've got something different. We got &#x2013; as we speak today the last 30 days in predominantly the U.S. region, Southern region, their volumes are up 7%. So these things move. I mean, we used to save coal within the U.S. and now coal is booming in Southern Illinois again, so.</p>
          <p>But they have &#x2013; they're able to make those adjustments. They've already reduced at the GM and Ford facilities, made reductions. And we're thinking about, as we go forward, this whole network of ours relative to finished automobiles might be a totally different model than it has been in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And &#x2013; because one of the other things, too, you guys have always been the standard in terms of labor productivity, and I guess GTMs per employee was down 3% quarter-over-quarter. I guess the question then becomes is, if the GTMs start to grow, can you hold the employment line? In other words, what percentage of GTM growth could we get, like 15, 20% before we'd have to start adding people?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on a net-net basis, we could grow 15, 16, 18% GTMs. It would &#x2013; maybe we'd have to do something in some areas, but in other areas we would have the capacity already on existing trains under the precision model to be able to absorb and deal with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then final question, I wonder if you'd care to comment on the <mark type="inaudible" /> decision. You got a fair amount of chemical business in the Southern United States. Do you see any implications of the decision on your book of business, or is there enough competition down there that simply it shouldn't apply?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the short form method of challenging rates there is not something I'm really concerned with here. We have a pretty simplistic form of customer complaint resolution up here with the FOA that we're very comfortable with dealing with. So I don't see any impact on us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, good afternoon. Just wanted to delve into the Canpotex contract for a second. Can you talk about what, if any, you move now? I thought going up Port of Vancouver, it was mostly the other Canadian rail. And then what kind of level of volumes can this contract potentially eventually encompass?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me make a couple of comments and then Jim can fill in the gaps here. Right now, we effectively haul no Canpotex business. It's the export wing, and we don't share any, very little if any of that business right now. So all of this is incremental gains and potential for us.</p>
          <p>At this point in time, they indicated they're going to make this investment of 0.5 billion or so and they're going to add capacity of 11 million tons. Now to my knowledge, they have not said how that's going to be divided up between potentially Prince Rupert and some Brownfield improvements in Vancouver. I know what my druthers are. But I know that Jim and company have offered them an array of opportunities. We'll put a facility in. We'll run the facility at Prince Rupert. We'll do anything reasonable that they ask that we can do well at. And so it's something that we're very excited about and it's just all upside for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just lastly on the casualty line. Obviously last year you benefited from a review. Should we look at the 80 million level as kind of a run rate down from 109?  I know first quarter is usually a bit higher because of the weather and seasonality, but is this the kind of the level you'd look at going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think our &#x2013; I mean there is obviously a lot of volatility in that expense category. But what we reported in the second quarter is of good an indication on a go-forward basis as you can find.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then &#x2013; actually I'm sorry, I do have one other question, which is on the yield side that Jim had mentioned before about 4.5%. Jim, can you talk a bit maybe about pushback with surcharges where they are, on getting that.  Obviously you're happy getting the top-end of your target range. When do you anticipate that moving kind of down toward inflation plus levels, or do you anticipate the next few years staying at this level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I anticipate the demand for rail transportation to continue to be extremely strong. And therefore I expect the prices to reflect them. And my hope is that the outlook for next year will even continue on this trend, where we've gone from three or four now to four to five for a couple of years and kind of continue to gradually move in that direction. I see no reason why that &#x2013; it should turn around.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. So next year we'll look for 5 to 6. Thanks for the time, Jim and guys. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Just wondering, to what extent are you seeing a shift in the north / south trans-border traffic flow as a result of the weaker dollar? I think you quantified a little of that earlier. But is there an opportunity as the scheduled railroad which is known to be taking share modally from truck to actually now more tactically focus on some of the northbound trucking flows given some idle capacity on your network as a result of declining carloads?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are aggressively pursuing traffic that is shifted from the U.S. into Canada, and our network in some areas lines up beautifully to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And again just leveraging on an earlier question, you talked about pricing gains in the 4 to 5% trending towards the higher end of that range. What gives you comfort there? Is it the service offering? Is it the value creation that you're able to demonstrate to your customers? And if we're a couple of innings into this, how is that sustainable over time? Where are the opportunities either by traffic category or end market industry that you see offering the greatest opportunity, let's say on a two to three-year basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the &#x2013; across the board, the price increases at average by these business commodity groups has not been significantly different. And so I don't look at any one group and say that I can extract greater value there than I can somewhere else. And so it's an average. I think there are certainly dynamics at work, especially associated with the high cost of diesel for us to continue to take market share away from the truck.</p>
          <p>And that's my principle objective, whether that's changing trade patterns between the U.S. into Canada, whether that's me going to the customer and saying I can offer a complete transportation solution, rail and Intermodal which I'm doing, and say adding 6,000 carloads of forest products revenues to the rail system that before I didn't handle. And so it's a complete array of initiatives that we are implementing to do this and we do it all the time and it's showing in the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question, I guess shifting focus to the capital plan, could you just give us an update on your capital spending intentions for 2008? And to the extent you do have some externally driven impact on traffic flow, some of it's cyclical, economic driven, some of it arguably maybe automotive side specifically comes to mind being more structural. Are you prioritizing or are you shifting any of your capital plan on their accelerating projects or perhaps potentially deferring somehow into 2009? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually we are &#x2013; we typically look at these things on a cycle of one year and we do adjust on an ongoing basis. But typically, it's not like we're being surprised by these big shifts. So our capital plan for this year is around $1.5 billion. We are adjusting on the opportunities, prioritizing to make sure we spend in the right area, and we'll be taking a look at next year's capital envelope in the fall to determine whether we stay at that level or increasing a little bit if the economy rebounds.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to speak a little bit about the opportunity to gain share from trucks. I think Jim, you mentioned metals and minerals specifically. I'm just curious if that's the only place where you're seeing gains so far, and maybe you could just comment to what extent you're seeing customers treat current energy prices as a new quote "normal" and start making meaningful adjustments to their supply chain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's opportunities across the board. Whether they be metals &#x2013; metals and minerals is obviously one that's occurred as the customers get consolidated and going through mergers and acquisitions. Forest products is creating a great opportunity for us.</p>
          <p>But there are all sorts of products that move on the highway today that do also move in railcars, whether &#x2013; and that doesn't have to be in trucks. But traditional boxcar type commodities that are on the highway that we're also pursuing. And fuel prices, driver issues, all of these things are certainly a favorable. Environmental green concerns clearly are out there. Everybody's looking to reduce their carbon footprint maybe in certain jurisdictions, even get a credit for doing it now.</p>
          <p>So those economics are going to continue to drive traffic to the railroad at the expense of truck, and we're going to pick it up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and from the perspectives of your own operations, are we at a point in terms of current fuel prices where it make sense for you to start adjusting train speeds in certain corridors to try and curtail your own fuel usage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going faster, not slower. I'm serious, because of the opportunity with the asset turns and incremental increases from going 50 to 60, given your train size, are not the way to go. I mean that's kind of a going out of business sale.</p>
          <p>I think as we go forward what's going to happen, depending on when the economy turns, if we see &#x2013; and I'm not wishing for this &#x2013; but if we see inflation continue to climb, if we see interest rates going up as a result of the inflation, to fight inflation, you're going to see precision scheduled railroading that creates way more value than it creates today because people are going to looking at your carrying costs, your inventory costs. And they're going to want things to move quick and fast. And that creates a better product that we have from a value standpoint.</p>
          <p>And I'm a firm believer, the marketplace gives you the price. You just decide whether you're going to want to play or not. And if you start to try to slow down to conserve fuel, my experience has been that your other asset, that your locomotives and your cars and the other things, start to cost you way more than what the fuel savings do.</p>
          <p>So we've kind of been there, done that, and we think that's the model. I will mention this: we are adding and have added a lot of distributed power, where we're running a locomotive at the head of the train and one back say two-thirds away and maybe we'll go to the rear end, which gives us the leverage to move a lot larger trains safely and control better in-train dynamics at the same time pretty significantly improves fuel usage.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, everybody. I just had a question on Hunter's comment regarding the operating metrics indicating that you wanted to improve the average car velocity per day from I think 179 or thereabouts up to around 200 in the third quarter. That's just about 12% I think. I was wondering if you could maybe give a little detail on how you're going to accomplish that and whether or not that will result in the opportunity to downsize the car fleet and/or the locomotive fleet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, all of the above. One of the initiatives now which relative to the last question is increasing our train speed in a very effective way by better controlling delays, better dispatching, things that we have recognized, better evening the flow over days of the week and so forth. So &#x2013; and there are several other things going on.</p>
          <p>I mean right now, we have seen car types that we have thought we were, quote, "short of," where we see behavior of some of our customers of holding cars, loading cars in and holding them for a week or two at a time. Which means to me that car type, they're using us as a warehouse. And so de-merge is going up on those kind of accounts will start to change that behavior. So we'll be able to handle more business with the cars moving more effectively. And all of those initiatives have already started.</p>
          <p>Our run rate today &#x2013; we have had days over the last two or three weeks that we've been as high as 190 car miles per car day. And one big adjustment here or there can push us to that. Right now &#x2013; to show you the impact, and I know it's a different &#x2013; not apples-to-apples &#x2013; but Intermodal cars right now do 500 miles a day plus.</p>
          <p>So the potential about the various car types is significant. And so we start to do better by doing it with less cars, it's got impact on locomotives, it's got impact on demerge, and I don't want the demerge, I want the car, I want the asset, and get it to turn. But if I'm being used as a warehouse, I want to be paid for it.</p>

          <p>That's very helpful. I had a question for Jim on the development of the oilsands project in Alberta, it sounds like things are going very well there. But have you seen an acceleration of activity with the increase in oil prices?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that they could accelerate and build any faster than they're doing. I mean it's between Fort McMurray and the Edmonton area, it's $70 billion worth of project. So they're humping away out there as fast as they can.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In full bore already? And then just maybe one last one for Claude. If for whatever reason you're unable to get the EJ&amp;E approved because the <mark type="inaudible" /> crowd carries the day. Would you take that incremental 300 million and shift that back into your share repurchase program? Would that be the plan?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I tell you we're going to get that deal before year end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not even going to consider that option. Okay. And then maybe just lastly a general question, maybe for Jim. There's been a lot written about a lack of containers for export activity out of the U.S. for the weak dollar. And given all of the incremental containers coming in over Prince Rupert, is there any way to sort of capitalize on all these empty boxes that would otherwise go back by loading in U.S. exports?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Since this initiative started at Prince Rupert, we've always been involved in the backhaul potential. And that backhaul potential to date is about where we had expected based upon the imports coming in. That's why we built facilities to stuff grain in Western Canada and the U.S., and a facility that's just lumber and forest products. In Prince George, we are actively working with the steamship companies to make that product available and it's working very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What percentage of the boxes heading back are loaded with revenue freight?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>50 to 60%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That much? Okay that may be close to the max of what the steamship operators can handle anyway.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given the difference in density of the product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Now they're coming from &#x2013; these boxes are coming all over, and to-date, there's a very small number of boxes coming through. But you got to put this in perspective. As I said, of the volumes coming in, it's what's going back, 60%.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions. One, we saw some press reports roughly a month ago about a private investor looking to build a brand new railroad in Eastern Canada that would hook into Canadian National's Montreal to Halifax line. I wanted to know if you had any insight there, any commentary, if there would be any capital requirements from Canadian National, timing, just any color would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>He hasn't talked to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's easy enough. And then on Prince Rupert, I want to make sure that I had my numbers straight. You are on track to 100 million worth of annualized revenue this year. Capacity for the port is at 300 million annualized revenue number. And based on the two ships that are currently calling there, you're at 65% capacity, is that accurate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about &#x2013; again, those are good ballpark numbers, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that &#x2013; if then, if I tie in your earlier comment, if you bring a third ship on line by the end of the year, that means you've reached capacity and based on the answer to one of your earlier questions, the only capacity enhancements that you on your radar screen right now are really the shipped around assets, there's no wholesale new facilities that we need to get built, is that accurate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question would be &#x2013; the question is not will we expand the capacity of Prince Rupert, but how will we expand the capacity of Prince Rupert. And that, as I said, could be through expanding the current footprint in various ways or adding to it or building a new terminal, all of those which are under consideration.</p>
