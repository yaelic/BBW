      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Steve and good morning, everyone. And welcome to Southern Copper's fourth quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Participating in today's conference is Mr. Oscar Gonz&#xE1;lez Rocha, Southern Copper's CEO. Today's conference call will begin with an updated view of metal market. We will then talk about Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating costs, financial results and capital spending. After that, we will open the session for questions.</p>
          <p>During the year 2010, we saw a significant recovery in the prices of all of our products. We believe the fundamental drivers for these better prices has been twofold, the stronger physical consumption of the emerging economy and the recovery of consumption at this lower rate though from the mix on the developed economy. In addition to these two factors, there is the influence of financial investments that is putting some pressure on several metal prices.</p>
          <p>Focusing on copper, we maintain our positive outlook for this metal in 2011. On the demand side, it is expected a worldwide demand growth in the range of 4% to 5% for the year that will not be met by new copper production estimated to grow between 1% and 2%. Considering current market trends, most analysts believe the market is heading towards a 400,000 to 600,000 ton deficit in 2011. That should bring support for high market price.</p>
          <p>However, even though we believe there are very strong market fundamentals for copper, we also think that the investor community is overlooking the following current developments. Current inventory levels do not reflect the market's size or type as prices may suggest. As of February 2, that's yesterday, the combined inventories of the London Metal Exchange, COMEX and Shanghai warehouses were at 594,500 tons, metric tons, that's about 55,700 tons higher or 10% more than the 538,800 tons that we have at the end of September, that is as of September 30, 2010.</p>
          <p>The second element is that there is a strong price volatility in metal markets, particularly in copper. As an example, during December, copper prices varied over $0.54 between its peaks and valleys and for the last 3 months, the difference between peaks and valleys has averaged $0.37 so there is a very strong volatility as well as inventories that are growing.</p>
          <p>At current price levels, we believe that there is a strong incentive for scrap copper production and substitution, which will put downward pressure on prices in the future. We believe the market is currently anticipating a very strong copper strategy, that these have to be verified by reality. In other words, higher physical consumption has to come from the main consumers such as China, Europe, and the U.S. We do believe that we are in an excellent moment for copper prices <mark type="inaudible" /> this part, and we also think that the copper market price may be overreacting to an expectation.</p>
          <p>Considering the current market circumstances and the indicated volatility, the company decided to take some price protection through the use of swaps and zero-cost collars. We will come back to this point later on during the conference call.</p>
          <p>Let me focus on molybdenum now, as you know, Southern Copper's main backdrop. In the year 2010, this metal represented 13% of company sales and we are currently seeing a soft recovery in molybdenum consumption. For the year 2011, we're expecting a relatively balanced market for this metal.</p>
          <p>Going into our production and starting by copper, let me first say that the company decided to change the name of the Cananea operating unit. Now it is called Buenavista del Cobre. This change is to better reflect the start-up of a new era for this asset. So from now on we will call this operation Buenavista instead of Cananea.</p>
          <p>Focusing on copper production, the company &#x2013; copper mine production in the fourth quarter increased by 3.5% to 130,553 tons. That's compared to 126,087 tons for the fourth quarter of 2009. This increase was mainly the result of 15,700 tons of SXEW copper production coming from our Buenavista mine.</p>
          <p>The Toquepala mine production also increased to 37,446 tons, that's compared to 35,166 tons in the fourth quarter of last year, of 2009, due to higher ore grades and recoveries. These increases in production were partially offset by lower production at the Cuajone and Caridad operations, which reduced their production by 24% and 6% respectively due to lower ore grade.</p>
          <p>Speaking about the repairs of the Buenavista unit, as we have previously reported to the market, the company has aggressively initiated a reconstruction and ramp up of Buenavista. Through December 31, 2010, we have spent $70.9 million on repairs. Of those, $35 million were capitalized, and $35.9 million were charged to operating costs during 2010.</p>
          <p>For 2011, we expect to spend $43.1 million to complete the repairs of this operation while maintaining the estimated cost of the repairs at approximately $114 million. An undetermined portion of these total expenditures should be recovered from insurance.</p>
          <p>As we previously disclosed to the market, the SXEW production of Buenavista reached full capacity, and it is &#x2013; that happened in the fourth quarter of 2010. At the beginning of this year, the company partially started the concentrator plant. Currently, Buenavista is running at 70% of capacity, and we expect to reach full capacity by the end of this quarter.</p>
          <p>For 2011, we expect to increase the company production level by 26%, producing 630,000 tons of copper. Of that, approximately 3% will be from third-party copper.</p>
          <p>For molybdenum production, as indicated in our press release in 2010, we reached a new molybdenum production record of 20,500 pounds, 10% higher than the 18,687 pounds produced in 2009. The fourth quarter molybdenum production increased also by 4%.</p>
          <p>During the year 2011, we will have a reduction of molybdenum production due to a temporary reduction in our Peruvian operations ore grade. This ore grade shrink will be partially offset by higher production expected from our Mexican unit of La Caridad. Our 2011 guide for molybdenum production is 17,000 tons for the year.</p>
          <p>According to our financial results and the physical unit sales, focusing on Southern Copper financial performance, the fourth quarter of 2010 sales were $1.5 billion, 32% higher than the $1.1 billion we had in the fourth quarter of 2009. The full year 2010 sales were $5.1 billion, 38% higher than the $3.7 billion of 2009. These increases were mainly the result of higher metal prices as well as higher molybdenum sales volumes. When compared to the fourth quarter of '09, copper sales volume increased by 9%. Molybdenum volume sold also increased by 3%, while silver volume decreased by 26% and zinc volume sold decreased by 9%.</p>
          <p>As we reported to the market, the company entered into copper hedge contracts to reduce price volatility and protect sales value. Swaps contracts are currently hedging approximately 28% of 2011 copper production at an average price of $4.00 per pound equally spread through the year. The company has also hedged approximately 31% of 2011 copper production, using zero-cost collars with an average floor price of $3.02 per pound at an average cap price of $4.84 per pound. For 2012, approximately 2% of this year's copper production is price protected through zero-cost collars with an average floor price of $3.50 per pound at an average cap price of $5.01 per pound.</p>
          <p>Our operating costs. Copper operating costs and expenses have increased 7% or $40 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. We did have some cost inflation during this past quarter, particularly in fuel, power and labor. However and most important, additional cost was related to the ramping up of our low cost operation of Buenavista at a total cost of $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>As a result of the mentioned sales and operating cost variances, EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $927 million or 62% of sales. This figure was 51% higher than the $616 million of EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2009. Southern Copper operating cash costs, including the benefit of by-product credit was 23.2 cents per pound in the fourth quarter of 2010. These cash costs was $0.09 lower than 32.5 cents per pound cash cost for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $0.06 lower than the 28.7 cents of cash costs we had in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The company fourth quarter 2010 operating cash cost per pound before by-product credit was $1.53 per pound, $0.17 higher than the operating cash cost of $1.36 per pound for the fourth quarter of 2009. The cash cost increment of $0.17 before credit is mainly attributable to the recurred cost of Buenavista and cost inflation, net of the favorable effects of higher production.</p>
          <p>Regarding by-products, we had a total credit increment of $0.26. Of those, molybdenum credit explains $0.29 in the fourth quarter when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 due to high price and volume produced.</p>
          <p>As a result of the better market prices and efficiency gains, net income attributable to Southern Copper shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $492 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.58. This figure compares with net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $363 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.43. So we had a 36% increase in earnings per share and net earnings quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>Going into our expansion in capital projects, on January 27th of 2011 the Board of Directors reviewed it's five-year capital program, approving the capital budget for the period 2011, 2015. We expect as part of this program to spend $1.7 billion in 2011, of which $900 million will be invested in Mexico, and $800 million in Peru.</p>
          <p>At the end of 2010, we have to spend $70 million in the mine and plant rehabilitation of the Buenavista property, as I already mentioned. And we expect to spend $43.1 million for this purpose in 2011.</p>
          <p>Regarding the SXEW III project in our Buenavista operations, it is moving forward. A review of the basic engineering was concluded in December of 2010. We have started the detailed engineering in January, and when completed we will begin the acquisition of major equipment and construction of the plant and the infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Quebalix III project, we have almost completed the acquisition of the project and equipment, and we'll begin construction of the crusher building and the conveying and spreading systems for leachable ore. The Quebalix, it's an equipment that is used for predicting the ore that is processed at the SXEW plant.</p>
          <p>The Pilares project which is close to the La Caridad mine is being evaluated as well. As of December of last year, 13,700 meters or drilling has been performed, access roads developed and metallurgical testing and preliminary mine planning has begun.</p>
          <p>The social programs for the Buenavista community are also underway. The local hospital has been reconstructed, two new water wells as well as a street paving program for communities have been completed, and the town library has been provided with modern technology to improve reference search capabilities.</p>
          <p>We're glad to report that these initiatives have received a warm welcome from the local community. For 2011, the company plans to invest $12 million for the benefit of local communities.</p>
          <p>In reference to the Toquepala concentrator expansion, we are awaiting an increase in the project's milling capacity to improve the estimated additional copper production to 120,000 tons per year. As a result of this review, the environmental impact assessment is expected to be presented during the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Tia Maria, we're glad to report very positive news about the project. During the third quarter, additional information for the project, including the use of sea water, was submitted to the Peruvian government. And on December 1, the Ministry of Energy and Mines of Peru approved a new communications plan to obtain the consent of the environmental impact assessment from the local community.</p>
          <p>The communication plan already completed by the company considered the following activities: Media advertising regarding the project in local newspapers as well as local TV and radio programs, the opening of three information offices in the communities that will be mostly impacted by this project, and four informative meetings with local community members.</p>
          <p>On February 1, the company filed a report with the Peruvian government indicating the full completion of this program. Now we have to wait until March 2 for any observations from local community members or other stakeholders. If everything goes well, we expect to receive the environmental impact assessment approval by the end of April, and construction works are scheduled to begin in the second quarter of this year, and copper production by the fourth quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>On July 22, 2010 the company received a non-binding proposal from its parent company, Americas Mining Corporation, offering to take an all-stock business combination of Southern Copper and AMC, the parent company of Asarco. As proposed, all stockholders of Southern Copper would receive 1.237 common shares of AMC in exchange for each share of Southern Copper. As part of this process, the stock of Americas Mining Corporation, AMC, will be registered and list on the New York and Mexico and Lima Stock Exchanges. Once completed, the Southern Copper shares will be deleted from the exchange.</p>
          <p>On August 10, 2010, the company formed a special committee of independent directors to evaluate AMC's proposal. The special committee has engaged independent legal, financial and mining advisors to assist in this transaction and help in the evaluation of the proposal. There is no specific deadline for this process.</p>
          <p>Regarding dividends, as you know it is the company's policy to review at each Board Meeting, the capital investment plan, cash resources, and expected future cash flow generation from operations in order to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as disclosed to the market on January 27, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized a dividend of $0.58 per share. This dividend will be paid on March 1, 2011 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2011.</p>
          <p>With this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us today. And we would like to open up the floor for questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Renato Antunes from Barclays Capital. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Raul. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. My question is related to your hedging strategy. Can you give us a bit more color? I just wanted to understand the rationale and if there is any targeted or maximum levels that you intend to achieve for hedging your 2011 production? I mean is it fair for us to assume that as long as prices remain at current levels, is it fair to assume that you will keep increasing the hedges that you have already? That's all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Renato, I can copy you now. Could you start again please? I'm sorry about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. No worries. My question relates to your hedges. I just wanted to get a bit more color on the rationale and hear from you if there is any targeted or maximum levels that you intend to achieve for hedging in 2011? Is it fair for us to assume that as long as copper prices remain at current levels of $4.50 per pound, Is it fair to assume that you will keep increasing your hedges? That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the rationale is, as I explained, when we mentioned about the marketing, we think that there is very strong volatility and the market is anticipating significant scarcity in copper. Regarding the volume levels, we already reported what we have. We have nothing else to mention about that due to the kind of strategies the company is following regarding the hedges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And if you allow me to ask a second question, just related to your costs, you obviously had a very positive performance through this quarter. You just mentioned the $0.32 per pound of copper cash cost including byproducts. I just wanted to get a sense of how are your views going forward? I mean we'll probably continue to see pressures from fuel and labor. On the other hand, Buenavista should offset these lower costs. I mean how do you expect cash costs to hold over 2011? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, it's &#x2013; hold on a second please &#x2013; well, for 2011, we have a forecast of cash cost of $0.45 per pound. Now let me explain you how this is composed. Our cash costs before &#x2013; so with no consideration of byproduct credits at all, it's expected to be at $1.50. That would include some cost inflation that we'll have on labor, on fuel, and currency, local currency depreciation.</p>
          <p>When you subtract to that our forecast for byproducts, the number reduces to $0.45. And again, let me explain to you what happened here. As I mentioned, we have reduced the outlook of production for molybdenum from this year's about over 20,000 tons to 17,000 tons for 2011. So we have a reduction of about 15% in our production of molybdenum. That will be pretty much compensated by price increases in petro and molybdenum and also in some other byproducts.</p>
          <p>So the total dollar amount of credits will be estimated to be approximately the same. But we will divide these credits by about 26% more pounds of copper and that's why we have a reduction in our &#x2013; I am sorry, an increase in our cash cost when compared to the fourth quarter that goes from &#x2013; goes to $0.45 a hectare.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Hirai, Felipe from Merril Lynch. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Raul, could you just repeat again the numbers for the cash cost? So from what I've got here it's $1.50 before the byproduct credit and $0.45 after the byproduct credit, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's correct. It's $1.50 before byproduct credit, $0.45 after byproduct credit. The reason it's &#x2013; that on a per pound basis, we will have less credit to share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then can you just give us some guidance of how much you expect to produce of copper and then moly in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. For copper, it will be 630,000 tons; for molybdenum, 17,000 tons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This already includes the ramp up of Buenavista, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one last question, Raul, could you just comment a little bit on Asarco, if you could give us a little bit more color on what is going on, and when do you expect that to &#x2013; the committee to decide on the recommendation of the deal with Asarco? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this question has to be posed to Grupo Mexico's personnel, Felipe. But what we can say about what is happening or what is going on in the process is that the committee has already hired their advisors. And they have been working visiting our operations and doing their own studies regarding the transaction. And even though there is no timeframe for &#x2013; and there is no timeframe for them to complete their work, so that's all that we can report at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, Raul. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Victoria Santaella from Santander. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Raul. This is Victoria. Can you comment a little bit on the risk of royalties in Peru especially now there is a lot of noise coming from the ground for the elections and for the rest of the year? And also if you can tell us a little bit about demand, how are you seeing it right now? How is this to place your orders given the pricing scenario in the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me talk on the first, on any royalty talks. We are &#x2013; in Peru we are running on an election period right now. So as part of the talks, several candidates have mentioned that they are &#x2013; they may consider changing the royalties regime that the mining companies are having now. Nothing specific has been said about that. And we have to wait until the campaign ends.</p>
          <p>Let me mention also that on the other hand, the mining society has indicated that about $41 billion in projects are ready to go in the next 10 years. So the next Peruvian President will have to weigh the effect of this positive investment vis-&#xE0;-vis charging more to mining companies. So at the end of the day if you see the current administration that is finishing, they had also a talk about for instance windfall profit taxes for mining companies during the campaign. Once there were in office, they thought about it and promoted or decided to promote investments rather than charging more taxes to mining companies. So all in all I think that whatever you heard now will be rethought later on when the winner of the elections are in the &#x2013; current in government.</p>
          <p>I'm sorry, could you refresh me on your second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The second one is if you can give us some color from your marketing department, how easy is to place orders now that the copper prices are in peak levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, but -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sales volumes, how are they doing with extremely high price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have frame contracts for most of our production. And as such we are delivering through the year our copper shipments. Regarding whatever is sold at market, at open market, usually we don't disclose this information to the market, Victoria and the reason for that is the commercial strategy that the company follows. I'm sorry that I can't answer on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning, gentlemen. Just on &#x2013; there's a couple of references in the press release about the Toquepala concentrator expansion and it sounds like there is a bit more upside there in terms of the &#x2013; your review of the 125,000-ton expansion. Could you just give us a little bit of color on; one, where that &#x2013; how much upside there is to that? And secondly, if we look at the CapEx guidance for this &#x2013; for 2011, it's higher than we've previously seen, but the 2010 number has come in a bit lower than expected. Is this basically delayed CapEx from 2010 slipping into 2011? And what kind of inflationary cost pressure are you seeing on the CapEx program? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First on the Toquepala concentrator expansion, basically the company is &#x2013; basically the project, because we have to &#x2013; need to find some options that may help to reduce the CapEx cost per ton of additional production and increase the final production that this investment may have. So in that sense, we want to &#x2013; we're doing now our review, an extensive review of the project and see if we can have an expansion that is sustainable in terms of what I said. I mean we're looking basically at the economics of this and technical possibilities.</p>
          <p>On the total capital budget, yes, we, as you mentioned Rene, we didn't spend as much as we wanted to in 2010 and it was basically due to the slowdown in the Tia Maria project. Tia Maria has been not expending additional or not commencing additional expenditures in 2010 for most of the year. Now we want to catch up on that and we also have a much more clear landscape regarding our Mexican investments in Buenavista now that the operation is back approaching to full capacity by the end of this quarter. So when you see these two elements, we already see a much more promising possibility for growing in Buenavista than what we had, say, at the beginning of 2010. And also we believe that the stead that we have achieved on the Tia Maria project is important and it's a matter of time that we have the goal for this investment to move forward.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Are you looking at additional grinding capacity at the concentrator, is it a primary &#x2013; is it grinding capacity before the material enters the concentrator? Is that what you're looking at or -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Really it is a change in the engineering and then we are doing a different location for the plant that the &#x2013; at the beginning and that is going to improve the production because we are going to do everything by gravity. And not only the production, the cost of production will be reduced too, and that is the reason that we are thinking that instead of 100,000, can be 120,000 or 125,000. But mainly it's a change in the engineering that we foresee when we were looking with the engineering companies how we can improve that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Actually it's Dave Radclyffe here from BMO. My question is sort of following on from the last one in terms of changes to the CapEx profile and maybe how your thoughts might have changed in terms of developing the current profile and maybe just expand on maybe some upside to the current projects in terms of the expansion potential? But, also could you maybe just update us on your thoughts on some of the previously, the longer-term projects, such as El Arco and Los Chancas?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Regarding El Arco, we have been &#x2013; we are moving forward with all the program for this project. It is not part of our current development program in the sense that we're expecting to have production on it between 2011 and 2015; it's expected to be after that in terms of production.</p>
          <p>We have been &#x2013; we are allocating in 2011 money for buying land and doing more studies regarding El Arco. And we think it's a very promising deposit, very interesting, but at this point, as I said, it's &#x2013; we're still working on preparing this investment for the future. It is part of our long-term outlook for the company, but it's after 2015 that we're expecting production from them.</p>
          <p>In the case of Los Chancas, we are expecting to have the feasibility study for Los Chancas by the end of the first half of this year. With that we will have more clarity regarding the investment side and an appropriate timing for the project.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I have two questions. First, regarding dividends, I wish to clarify for us if the assumption that all cash you generate after CapEx will still be distributed as dividend? And my second question is also regarding cash cost. How the ramp up of Cananea and now Buenavista would impact the average cash cost in terms of &#x2013; the cash cost as it is and also including the byproducts? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding dividends, Rodrigo, I'm sorry, but it's a matter that &#x2013; it's a Board decision and as I explained when we discussed dividend, the put dividend for this quarter, each quarter meeting the Board review the company cash position, the market circumstances, any future payments of loans or capital expenditure that the company have committed and on that basis, approves a dividend. What they will do in the future it's hard to say. However, our practice has been to pay a dividend of at least 50% of our net earnings and as you know we have gone much higher than that in different circumstances, particularly when prices are high as they are today.</p>
          <p>And your next question was about the CapEx for the Buenavista expansion, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, actually how the cash cost would evolve now that we have a major &#x2013; we have Buenavista running at full capacity from the second quarter onwards, how that affects the average cash cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Buenavista has a very competitive cash cost. In the past, was close to $0.18/80 per pound. We expect to be lower when we start operating it at full capacity. I mean, let me see for a sec, the past two years ago. So we have &#x2013; we are assuming some cost inflation that will influence this operation. But we believe that it will remain as a very competitive operation as well.</p>
          <p>In terms of by product, it doesn't have much. We want to add to the Buenavista property a molybdenum line that should produce about 2,000 metric tons of molybdenum per year &#x2013; that's one, that's part of our capital project for Buenavista, and that will certainly help to reduce cash cost for the future of this operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And when should the molybdenum plans be operational, how?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Raul. Thanks for taking my question. I had actually a couple, the first pertaining to capital expenditures and the second pertaining to hedges. On the capital expenditure front I think you guys had previously indicated $1 billion in CapEx anticipated for 2012. But in light of the revision to the 2011 number, is that $1 billion number for 2012 still good?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Actually it has increased also to $1.7 billion for 2012. For the next five years this is, including 2011, this is what we have forecast: this year and next year $1.7 billion; for 2013, that number should decrease to $950 million; for 2014, $700 million and for 2015, $560 million. With that we will finish the current program of additional or expansion of production investments. And &#x2013; well this is basically contemplating what we're doing now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So would you &#x2013; what would you expect a sustaining CapEx number to be once all these projects are completed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. Excellent. And then my second question concerned hedging. I think you had previously indicated in the third quarter call that you had hedged about 58% of the fourth quarter production. So I was curious what the realized price for copper sales in the fourth quarter might have been or was after taking into account the hedges you had in place relative to the, I think it was $3.92 that we averaged on the LME.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Total effect on hedges were $0.13 per pound of copper on the realized price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just following-on actually from the previous question on the hedging loss. Is that booked against net revenue &#x2013; net realized revenues? Or where do you include the hedging losses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Hedging kind of raised by 5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just following up on the earlier question on CapEx. Given that you've just gone through your CapEx budget for the next five years, what kind of cost inflation are you seeing in terms of the &#x2013; on the CapEx side as opposed to the OpEx side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually, Rene, not that much because- I mean, other than certain things that you may state that will go up, such as tires that are quite dependent on fuel prices. But several of the companies that provide this major equipment did expand their operations between 2005 and 2007. So when we get into the economic crisis of 2008, they were &#x2013; they were having significant store capacity. And we're still producing that new capacity that they build up. So I think that in that sense we're not seeing the kind of capital inflation that we saw, say, in 2005 or 2006 at this point.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. I'm sorry if I missed the explanation. But what are the reason behind the reduction in the &#x2013; in the moly production for this year? I mean, from 20 something to 17.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Rodrigo. How are you? Basically the Peruvian operations, particularly the Toquepala mine, is having a temporary decrease in oil grade and that's affecting the molybdenum recovery as well as the grade for molybdenum. We have a partial recovery of &#x2013; of the Cuajone production for moly, but it's not enough to reduce what we're seeing on the Toquepala side. So as I said, only in the Peruvian operations are decreasing their contribution to our molybdenum production for the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. My question relates to the decrease in tons smelted and rod production, which I presume is at La Caridad, or at least the rod is. Is this decrease in smelting and rod production due to the labor problems you had at La Caridad or was it demand driven with respect to rod?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for your question, Mr. Richmond. Let me mention in general in terms of our metallurgical facilities we have a 14% decrease in annual production at Ilo during the fourth quarter due to technical problems of the smelters, acid and oxygen tanks. These facilities operating right now are a good capacity, about 95% of it. And we are solving these problems through the second quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>In the case of La Caridad, in the fourth quarter &#x2013; actually at the end of the third quarter, but it went into the fourth quarter, we had some disruptions due to blockage to access roads and other interferences caused by a group of terminated employees and outside agitators. Mexican authorities reestablished the order and secured access roads to our complex in Mexico. And activities at our Mexican metallurgical facilities were normalized shortly after that. So it was a one-time thing that happened in the fourth quarter in the case of the Mexican operations. And in the case of the Peruvian ones, some technical problems that have been pretty much solved already, even though we will have to direct some repairs regarding our metallurgical facilities in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, this is not related at all with our sale where we have already sold all the copper that we will produce in 2011. We have our contracts <mark type="inaudible" /> so there is no relationship between the commercial side of our operations and the disruptions in smelting that I just mentioned.</p>
