          <p>Hello, good morning everyone and welcome to this presentation of Syngenta's 2008 Results. I'm joined here today by John Ramsay, our CFO; John Atkin, COO of Crop Protection; and Davor Pisk COO of Seeds. Also with us here this morning is Robert Berendes, Head of Business Development, and finally, I welcome this opportunity to introduce to you to Sandro Aruffo, who joined us as Head of R&amp;D, this last October.</p>
          <p>We'll all be happy to answer your questions after the presentation and for those of you following the webcast you can of course submit yours by e-mail or by telephone. 2008 was a remarkable year for agriculture and a record year for Syngenta. Our sales rose by 21% at constant exchange rates with rapid growth across product lines in all regions. In crop protection, we saw broad-based increase in usage intensity and our performance in this business demonstrates the enormous benefits that our products bring to growers.</p>
          <p>In Seeds, field crops expanded globally and we made considerable advances in both conventional and genetically modified seeds. Now, this strong top-line growth was accompanied by further improvement in profitability leading to growth in earnings per share of 42%. In continuation of our progressive dividend policy and as a further sign of our confidence in the prospects for our business, we're proposing a substantial dividend increase to CHF6 per share.</p>
          <p>For Syngenta 2008 was a year in which we built on indeed accelerated the progress of these past five years. Over this period, we've recorded compound average sales growth of 12% and earnings per share growth of 37%.</p>
          <p>Let me highlight now some of the key drivers behind this performance. The successful launch of a multitude of new products has played a major role in the expansion of our crop protection market share. We've doubled the size of our seeds business through both internal growth and acquisitions. We've grown across geographies and across all crops. And all this has been underpinned by rigorous attention to costs making us one of the most, if not the most cost efficient producer in the whole industry. Like everyone else, we are faced with more uncertain economic environment today. But, these achievements of these past years put us in a strong position to tackle these challenges.</p>
          <p>In geographical terms our growth has been most marked in the emerging markets which now account for 37% of our sales. We built-up leading positions in Latin America, Eastern Europe and the emerging markets of Asia-Pacific and this expansion has not been at the expense of profitability, as we have adapted our cost structure as well as our product range to ensure that our offer is competitive everywhere. We've also been very attentive to the risks attached to business in these emerging markets and we've developed advanced local risk management strategies which have served as well during previous economic crises.</p>
          <p>It's well understood that the commodity crop volatility of the last few months has been a function of financial market instability, which to some extend has obscured the underlying supply demand drivers. It is true that in 2008, global stocks-to-use ratios were partially replenished, but they still remain below historical levels. And let us also be clear about the reasons behind that replenishment, which by the way was largely due to one crop, wheat. Last year, 11 million additional hectares of the four major grains were harvested globally, reflecting a level of acreage increase which is unsustainable going forward. And yields in most regions were at or near record levels, thanks largely to the increased application of technology.</p>
          <p>We estimate that around one-third of the total production increase of last year was directly linked to crop protection and Seeds and that translates into some 30 million tons of grain. This was a step change in technology use and for growers around the world it paid off handsomely. In the emerging markets, a productivity drive is underway with the dual aim of increasing self sufficiency and improving access to export markets. While the pace of this drive may temporarily slow, it is clearly set to continue underpinned by the fundamental drivers of population growth and changes in diet. Before Davor and John Atkin tell you how our businesses are positioned in the current environment, let me first hand you over to John Ramsay for a review of our financial performance. John?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike. Good morning. I will start with the financial highlights of what was an exceptional year for our business resulting in a record financial performance. Sales reached $11.6 billion which represents a 21% increase at constant exchange rates. This drove EBITDA up to $2.5 billion, a 22% increase. Earnings per share rose 42% to $16.26 driven by higher operating income and lower tax rate. This is an increase of 47% excluding the receipt from Delta &amp; Pine Land in 2007.</p>
          <p>In addition our strong business performance and capital efficiency led to a 31% return on invested capital. The business generated free cash flow of $761 million after significant investments in future growth and several strategic acquisitions. Further, we were able to return significant cash to our shareholders, returning over $1 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchase.</p>
          <p>Turning now to sales performance. Reported sales of $11.6 billion represents a 26% increase over 2007. A weak U.S. dollar in the first half of the year resulted in a full year favorable currency impact of $447 million. Sales growth of 21% to constant exchange rates was driven by volume, with strong growth in both crop protection and Seeds and price increases totaling $544 million across the business.</p>
          <p>Turning now to crop protection. Sales at $9.2 billion were 22% higher with strong growth across all product lines and regions. Volume growth of 16% was driven by a significant increase in usage intensity as growers globally invested in their crops to maximize yield. Price increases contributed 6% in the full year or 4% excluding glyphosate, a very positive result.</p>
          <p>Going into 2009, northern hemisphere season, we continue to target price increases of mid single-digits.</p>
          <p>EBITDA at $2.5 billion was driven by volume growth with a margin increase of 160 basis points to 26.6%. Higher raw material costs of $68 million and growth investments of $170 million were more than offset by the price increases already mentioned.</p>
          <p>In Seeds, sales at $2.4 billion rose 16%. Growth was broad-based with our diversified portfolio allowing us to capitalize on global acreage shifts. Volume rose 12% with acquisitions contributing 5%. EBITDA increased to $135 million with the margin improving to 5.5%.</p>
          <p>For 2009, we are targeting an EBITDA margin of between 8 and 9% depending on exchange rates, and remain on track to achieve the 15% target in 2011. Growth in EBITDA was driven by volume and improvement in gross margin and currency. We continue to increase investments in R&amp;D and marketing during the year and made investments in key growth projects of $58 million.</p>
          <p>Returning to the Group as a whole, operating income of over $2 billion was primarily driven by business performance. A further $110 million was delivered from our operational efficiency program, which is on track to deliver the $290 million of cumulative savings by 2011. Raw material costs excluding glyphosate rose by 68 million. Increased R&amp;D and marketing expenditure amounted to $259 million as we continued to invest in significant growth opportunities. The strong performance of our business in 2008 led to an improvement in the operating margin of 150 basis points to 17.8%.</p>
          <p>Net income at $1.54 billion rose 38% or 43% excluding the non-recurring income in 2007. The increase was driven primarily by the $405 million increase in operating income, partially offset by an increase in financial expenses of 127 million. Financial expenses were higher in 2008 due to the losses on unhedged foreign currency receivables in the fourth quarter when there were exceptional and across the board devaluations of emerging market currencies. In 2007 in contrast, net financial expenses were favorably impacted by currency gains.</p>
          <p>The favorable resolution of several statutory tax audits resulted in a tax rate for the period of 19%. I expect that we will be able to maintain a tax rate in the low to mid 20s over the medium-term.</p>
          <p>Whereas in 2008, currency movements benefited operating income by about $150 million, in 2009 due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar currency is likely to have an adverse effect. Let me explain Syngenta's currency exposure.</p>
          <p>The bar diagram on the slide shows some of our key net foreign currency exposures as they affect operating income. For reference alongside each currency, you can see the percentage devaluation of that currency against the dollar from mid-year to the end of 2008. For example, we have a net short exposure to sterling as our costs outweigh our sales in the UK, and sterling weakened by 37% versus the dollar over the period.</p>
          <p>In 2008, a weak dollar in the first half benefited the translation of our foreign currency income and a substantially stronger dollar in the fourth quarter reduced the dollar value of foreign currency expenses. As we enter 2009, the first half effect is reversed, with a now stronger U.S. dollar reducing the dollar translation of our foreign earnings.</p>
          <p>Our core currencies in developed markets are, however, largely hedged, but our business has grown significantly in emerging markets, where in many cases the financial crisis has created an environment where the cost of hedging has been economically unattractive, or in some cases not possible, particularly in the case of some East European countries. Overall, I expect the net impact from currency and operating income in 2009 to be up to $150 million.</p>
          <p>One positive economic aspect of a stronger dollar is that some of our grower customers in emerging markets who are exporters benefit from the strengthening dollar, and this is for example helping grower profitability in Latin America at the moment.</p>
          <p>Turning now to free cash flow which once again was strong at $761 million after acquisitions. Free cash flow was mainly driven by higher EBITDA. Capital expenditure at $444 million was higher than last year reflecting the initial investment in our capacity expansion program. For 2009, you should expect capital expenditure and tangible assets to increase to $750 million as we continue to invest in our capital expansion plans. We maintained our rigorous focus on working capital and reduced average trade working capital as a percentage of sales to 37% from 39% in 2007.</p>
          <p>Our rigorous approach is exemplified in emerging markets and you can see our success in receivables collection on the graph on the left of this slide. Our best-in-class risk management programs, including customer credit profiling and pioneering business models, provide us with a competitive advantage in these markets. We will continue to leverage the experience and track record of managing risk in Latin America across other countries, with a particular focus on Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>And where necessary in 2009, we will apply even more stringent criteria to our sales in markets with higher economic or sovereign risk. The strength of our cash generation is augmented by our high credit quality and ready access to debt capital markets. During 2008, we made further enhancements to our medium-term debt profile with the successful issue of two domestic bonds, providing headroom for our normal funding requirements and improving the maturity profile of our debt while keeping our financing costs stable.</p>
          <p>In March, we announced the successful issue of a CHF500 million bond with five-year maturity followed by a second issue of CHF375 million in November. As you can see from the chart, our first step maturity does not occur until mid 2011. In addition to the mid-term debt shown here, we have in place an undrawn $1.2 billion backup facility to our short-term commercial paper program, which we have already started to issue in 2009.</p>
          <p>Here you can see how we have utilized our strong cash flow since 2005. Our aim is unchanged, maintaining balanced capital efficiency through investment to meet the requirements of a growing business, making selective acquisitions, and at the same time returning cash to shareholders. As I mentioned before in 2008 we increased our level of investment in the business with higher capital expenditure and several targeted acquisitions. We have over recent years returned substantial levels of cash to our shareholders, with over $3.7 billion returned since 2004. Both interest cover and gearing are well within the thresholds for our current credit rating.</p>
          <p>For 2009, I expect the company once again to be highly cash generative. We are not proposing a 2009 share repurchase program, preferring to preserve cash to capitalize on opportunities that may occur in the current economic environment. We will focus our cash on increased capital expenditure, funding of our ongoing business, making targeted acquisitions, and returning cash to shareholders, which for this year will be in the form of the increased dividend payment announced today.</p>
          <p>To conclude, our business is in great shape and the fundamentals of our agricultural sector remain strong as Davor and John will show you. In the short-term, the economic environment is uncertain and we are taking decisive steps now to maintain our strong financial performance.</p>
          <p>In emerging markets, we aim to maintain our leadership position whilst preserving the quality of our business. We will continue to apply tight risk management and further expand our established programs. In these markets where currencies have depreciated sharply, we will be increasing prices to compensate. Across the business, we will continue to focus on prioritizing expenditure and managing costs and in particular in 2009, capitalizing on the increased investments that we made in 2008. And overall, we will remain prudent in our use of cash.</p>
          <p>In summary, notwithstanding the volatility and uncertainty in the world around this, I believe Syngenta is well placed to continue to outperform financially in 2009 and beyond. Thank you.</p>
          <p>May I now hand over to Davor, who will take you through a review of our Seeds business. Davor?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much John. Good morning. In 2008 Seeds saw strong growth in all product lines, demonstrating the breadth of our business and our ability to apply leading technologies across crops. Sales of corn and soybean were up 13%, outside the U.S. strong acreage expanded and we were able to strengthen our position particularly in the emerging markets. In Europe we enhanced our offer with a broadening of the portfolio across maturities. In the U.S. our soybean business benefited both from higher acreage and from an increase in market share.</p>
          <p>Diverse Field Crops registered the strongest rate of growth with sales up 23%. The main drivers were sunflower in Europe and the launch of glyphosate-tolerant sugar beet in the U.S. Our Vegetables business has been recording steady growth for many years and this has continued in 2008, supplemented by the consolidation of Zeraim Gedera. Again the emerging markets played an important role and we saw double digit in sweet corn sales globally. Flowers growth reflected the consolidation of Fischer acquired in 2007 with underlying sales slightly lower.</p>
          <p>Let me now take you through the performance of our key businesses, starting with U.S. corn. In the U.S. market where trait penetration continues to increase, we successfully launched AGRISURE 3000GT our proprietary triple stack. While we only had limited quantities available, we achieved our target of planting 600,000 acres and the harvest showed that our traits delivered excellent value for growers. In 2009 we intend to more than triple acreage for AGRISURE 3000GT and from 2010 we expect to be ahead of the schedule that we showed you last July.</p>
          <p>This further underpins our confidence in our ability to achieve our 2011 Seeds margin target. Beyond 2010 we expect multistack to play an increasingly important role and I shall be telling you more about the opportunities here in a moment. Over the next three years the rate of trait penetration in our elite germplasm will also rise, progressively enhancing the attractiveness of our offer. We have been building our portfolio of elite germplasm since 2004 when we started to optimize the germplasm pools acquired with Garst and Golden Harvest.</p>
          <p>This slide shows you our increasing competitiveness across maturity groups. Our best performing hybrids, when measured against the comparable offer from our leading competitors, showed an average yield benefit of 2.6 bushels per acre and outperformed the competition in up to 55% of trials. We still have a way to go. But the progress to-date does show that our portfolio is starting to prove its worth in the market.</p>
          <p>Our pipeline includes input traits which will bring new benefits to growth and output traits which offer advantages to the end users of crops. We are also targeting agronomic traits that enable the plant to adapt to its environment and to utilize resources more efficiently. These include drought tolerance where we are currently testing optimum combinations of native traits in-field trials in Latin America. We are also starting to combine the traits with our triple-stack seed.</p>
          <p>Our input trait research is focusing on second generation technology which will address issues of insect spectrum and resistance. The first of these is AGRISURE VIPTERA, the name we have given to our novel insect control trait, VIP broad lep.</p>
          <p>The slide clearly shows that with VIPTERA we will achieve excellent control across a broad spectrum of chewing pests. This level of control will be noticeably ahead of the nearest competitor and will far surpass the other major competitor in the market. By dealing with pests that until now have been poorly controlled, it will offer growers a significant opportunity to improve productivity.</p>
          <p>The reason for this breakthrough in performance is a gene with a distinct motive action that is structurally and functionally different from the genes in other technologies. It means reduced resistance risk and opens up a potential opportunity for refuge reduction in the south of the U.S.</p>
          <p>VIPTERA will be combined with our other trait technologies to form our first multi-stack offer. We received EPA approval in December 2008 and U.S.DA approval is expected later year. VIPTERA is going to be a must have trait for growers and we have already signed a licensing agreement with DuPont Pioneer. We also see significant potential for VIPTERA in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to output traits and an update on amylase, our unique enzyme bred into corn which improves the efficiency of corn ethanol production. There are around 180 ethanol plants in the U.S. today and an ongoing recognition of the role this industry plays in the development of renewable energy sources.</p>
          <p>Last year we successfully completed a six-month full-scale trial at a large commercial plant. We have just commenced a second commercial trial and the reaction of the plant owner has been extremely positive. On the basis of these trials, the benefit to the ethanol producer is estimated at 8 to $0.15 per gallon, or 5 to 10% based on the current ethanol price. This is a massive advantage for ethanol producers currently operating at low levels of profitability.</p>
          <p>In addition, amylase improves the environmental footprint of ethanol plants. The trials have shown that amylase reduces water and energy use contributing to a 10% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. U.S.DA deregulation of the product is ongoing and when complete will allow us to sell seed to growers, who will supply grain to ethanol plants through a closed loop system.</p>
          <p>Moving now to soybean in the U.S., where we have a fully traited offer and where the quality of our germplasm is currently the key differentiator. We have a complete portfolio and the chart shows you that we achieved significant yield advantages versus the average across all maturities. In 2008, we again gained market share and many of our customers reported their best yields ever.</p>
          <p>Our pipeline contains a number of exciting projects which will lead to further yield enhancement. We have obtained options for second generation herbicide tolerant, which will allow us to share in the added value created by combining glyphosate tolerants with superior yield. Longer term, we're developing our own HPPD tolerants which will offer a solution to glyphosate-resistance and will give growers greater flexibility in their use of Crop Protection products, including CALLISTO our leading corn herbicide.</p>
          <p>We are also developing a number of other important traits which represent a combination of native trait and GM solutions. We believe that combinations of native and GM traits will become increasingly important in addressing complex pest problems, and meeting growers' demand for performance.</p>
          <p>Our corn and soybean business has grown rapidly in Latin America over the last five years. In Brazil we launched our Bt11 corn in 2008 and received approval for GA21 which we plan to launch in a double stack product. In soybean we saw the continued success of V-Max, a fast growing glyphosate-tolerant variety, which allows growers more time to plant two crops in a season. As a result, our soybean market share tripled to 6.5%. As John Atkin will show you, we have a strong position in Crop Protection in Latin America and in order to leverage this we're implementing full commercial integration between our Crop Protection and Seeds businesses in Brazil.</p>
          <p>In Argentina where we already sell both B11 and GA21, we gained share in corn. The acquisition of SPS will further strengthen our presence and gives us a platform for the launch of our soybean technology. Growth in Diverse Field Crops reflects expanding markets and also the introduction of technology across crops and across borders.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. the introduction of glyphosate-tolerant sugar beet has resulted in a dramatic increase in our market share from 19% to 34% in one year. In Eastern Europe, sunflower plays a major role with growers capitalizing on good, local growing conditions to meet global demand for healthy oils. We have a share of over 40% of the high value market, where a shift from open pollination to advanced breeding is giving growers a new opportunity to enhance the value of their crop.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, we're increasing our presence in the oilseed rape market through the introduction of higher value hybrids, and we have introduced hybrid barley into Germany. In vegetables, Zeraim Gedera, acquired in 2007, grew strongly, enhancing our presence in high value segments, particularly in the Mediterranean region.</p>
          <p>Syngenta is the world leader in sweet corn, a market growing by 8% a year with the opening up of new markets in China and Eastern Europe. In the U.S., we are the only company to offer the benefits of the Bt11 trait to sweet corn growers.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we announced a capacity expansion program in the U.S. to enable us to meet expanding global demand. Vegetables still play a key role in emerging market diets, and our business in these countries is growing rapidly. We're now the number one in Latin America and are also expanding our presence in the huge Chinese market through the introduction of a direct grower sales model.</p>
          <p>And now a word on flowers, which we have combined with professional products to form a lawn and garden business, delivering plant health solutions for professional growers and consumers. Our major markets are the U.S. and Europe, and total sales for the business were around $850 million last year.</p>
          <p>In the professional segments, our customers are chiefly ornamental growers and golf course managers. We offer them a leading range of chemical controls based on our Crop Protection chemistry. We are the world leader in turf, and our products have played a key role at many major sporting venues. In the consumer area, the focus is on partnerships with major distributors, such as Central Garden &amp; Pet in the U.S., and Compo and Westland in Europe. Meanwhile, our flowers offer has been substantially enhanced through last year's acquisitions of Goldsmith Seeds and of the chrysanthemum and aster business of Yoder Brothers in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to increase investments in Seeds R&amp;D, in order to maintain the momentum of innovation across crops. Our ability to compete in this technology-driven market has already been demonstrated by the accelerated timeframe over which we have brought new traits to market; eight years for our rootworm traits, compared with an industry benchmark of 12 to 14 years.</p>
          <p>We are increasing our investment in native traits, which we believe will add to the potency of future solutions. We are leveraging technology on a global basis, as shown by the trait in germplasm launches in Latin America and the success of glyphosate-tolerant sugar beet in the U.S. And finally, we have a unique advantage underpinning our investments, the linkage with our chemicals portfolio, which allows us to look for holistic solutions in areas such as drought and herbicide tolerance.</p>
          <p>Before I hand you over to John Atkin to talk about Crop Protection, let me summarize where Seeds stands today. In the U.S. market, we've shown our ability to deliver our corn pipeline, and we're already benefiting from the strength of our soybean offer. We're leveraging our corn and soybean investment globally in the form of both germplasm and traits. We're gaining share across the emerging markets in a variety of crops. And finally, we have a unique advantage in our linkage with Crop Protection, through R&amp;D, through marketing as in Brazil, and through our access to Syngenta's compelling Seed Care offer, which is one of the things John Atkin is eager to talk to you about. John?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well thank you, Davor, and hello everybody. 2008 was a great year for Syngenta Crop Protection. In December, we achieved 22 consecutive quarters of growth and registered our fourth straight year of global market share gain, as you can see on the slide. This performance is founded on a strategy that has been systematically implemented worldwide. Product portfolio is at the heart of it, expansion through accelerating new product introduction, a focus on mixture products, coupled with acquiring rights to excellent technology from the outside.</p>
          <p>No business is more local than agriculture and we have tailored models in territories based on Syngenta ways of working, but adapted to the needs of local customers in ways that differentiate us from our competitors. All this is underpinned by operational efficiency, particularly low cost production.</p>
          <p>Sales by product line, starting with selective herbicides. Growth was led by CALLISTO and by AXIAL, with sales up 85% driven by Europe and North America. Soybean herbicides also grew strongly, with the need for glyphosate-resistant programs in the United States.</p>
          <p>Nonselective herbicides were up by more than 40%, with exceptional volume and price growth in TOUCHDOWN. Fungicides, now our largest product line, were led by the AMISTAR range, which reached $1 billion. AMISTAR is now known for its ability to increase yields even when disease pressure is low. There was also strong demand for REVUS following new launches. Insecticides growth was driven by terrific performance from ACTARA and KARATE notably. Also, we had the first DURIVO launch on rice in Indonesia and this was an outstanding success.</p>
          <p>In Seed Care, our sales up by one-third, as CRUISER continued its leadership in this fast-growing market. Now, Professional Products did not benefit from the favorable agricultural environment, but achieved nevertheless 8% growth, driven by Fafard's growing media and a good performance by HERITAGE on turf.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we achieved strong growth on all crops. Now important though they are, the major traded commodity crops of corn, soybeans, and wheat account for only half our sales. Fruit and vegetables together represent some 30%, and this limits our exposure to the price volatility of major arable crops. Our strong position across crops is enabled by our broad portfolio and local teams focusing on specific crop needs of customers in each country. We will be stepping up this crop focus. With our Seeds business, we are looking intensively at combined crop strategies to further maximize productivity.</p>
          <p>Now the northern hemisphere season gets going in March and the 2009 season in Brazil starts in September, this makes it tricky for us here in February to judge how our markets are going to develop. But I will try to give you our assessment of current conditions.</p>
          <p>Starting with Europe. Wheat prices are lower, but strong farm balance sheets, low dependence on bank finance, and the positive returns from investment in technology in 2008, provide a good starting point. In East Europe we see a continuation of the productivity drive, although the pace of growth in 2009 will be a little slower. And there are currency and sovereign risks which we need to manage.</p>
          <p>In North America, it's a similar story on farm balance sheets after a year of good yields and credit is generally available. There is though, uncertainty as to what growers will plant. The relative profitability of corn and soybeans is the exam question, and it's a tough one to answer with volatility and commodity prices to be weighed against production costs, particularly of fertilizer and energy which are now declining.</p>
          <p>Moving to emerging markets, 2008 was a record year in Brazil and Argentina for Syngenta. Expanding soybean production was a major driver. The soybean price is now lower than six months ago, but so are exchange rates against the dollar and that is good for farmer profitability. There are, however, some credit issues and we are using our proven risk management expertise to deal with these. The drought in Argentina may impact grower finances, but it will reduce soybean production, and that should help prices. Much depends though on soybean planting in September and that will be driven by crop prices and exchange rates prevailing at the time. In Asia Pacific, rice is the dominant crop and the region is relatively shielded from volatility in other commodities. Credit is not really an issue, and this is a region where growth in food demand is strongest.</p>
          <p>Well, that's how we see things at present. Now, let me tell you why we believe our business can continue to outperform. First, a new opportunity. This industry is founded on pest control. You have weeds, then herbicides are essential. Diseases require fungicides, and bugs have to be destroyed. Syngenta has gone one step further. The breadth of our portfolio allows us to offer programs of treatments to protect against all problems in the most convenient way, and to do so with minimum impact on the environment, this is Crop Care. And now something really neat, crop enhancement. We've demonstrated that many of our products can raise yields even in the absences of pests. For example, AMISTAR gives bigger and greener leaves. CRUISER stimulates root growth for a vigorous plant that withstands stress. Others are in development including INVINSA.</p>
          <p>Pest control, Crop Care, and crop enhancement together enable the grower to get the most out of his plant genetics. We call this plant performance. This is not as recognized as biotechnology, but is an equally important breakthrough in the drive for higher yields to produce more from existing land.</p>
          <p>So, here are some compelling examples of plant performance in action. The data is simply presented, what the farmer pays including his application cost, what he gets in average yield increases, and what his net profit is based on recent commodity prices. The first two are from the U.S. and the others from Europe. The message is a simple one. Our technology provides excellent returns for farmers and is consequently great value for money. His net return in these examples ranges from 140% to 800%. And this explains why farmers use our products even at lower commodity prices. And also why modest price increases are both justifiable and affordable. We and our distributor partners are communicating this strongly in 2009.</p>
          <p>And now some broader product examples, non-selective herbicides which were up by more than 40% last year are a must have in our strategy. And one that we've moved from basic weed control, which remains important, to sophisticated programs of weed management in genetically modified crops. This is an $8 billion market, which has almost doubled in the last five years. While 2008 has been an exceptional year for glyphosate with product shortages and price increases, volume will continue to grow as GM acreage expands.</p>
          <p>Moreover, nonselectives allow farmers to control weeds without tilling the ground, thus building soil structure and preserving moisture and organic matter. This is minimum tillage and sustainability. Market share increase has been enabled by our uniqueness, particularly glyphosate programs and combinations that control resistant weeds and require fewer applications. Last year, it was significantly enhanced through the launch of HELIX for corn. Now, it also includes GRAMOXONE. Much has been said and written about this product, let me just underline its critical role in producing more food, particularly in tropical countries. It is the only product with rapid burn down activity, which allows growers to quickly remove weeds and crop residues. They can then plant the next crop without delay and thereby increase productivity.</p>
          <p>Turning to Seed Care, where our business has grown by a compound average 20%, and we have increased our share to 36%. We expect the market to continue strong growth over the next five years. A technology shift is underway and we are the driving force behind it. CRUISER is an outstanding product and has contributed much of our growth and it still has further to go. We are now preparing the launch of AVICTA for corn.</p>
          <p>Our pipeline will be further strengthened by the agreement with Dow AgroSciences announced last December.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the technology and service package we offer seed companies is a major differentiating factor versus competitors. We expect CRUISER to continue its strong growth. Illustrated here are soybeans in Brazil where it has unique vigor effect resulting in healthy germination, bigger and stronger plants, and higher yields, and you can see all that illustrated on the slide. The benefit which we have patented occurs even without pests. It's popular with growers and accounts for most of the purchasing decisions in Brazil. We expect it to be the major driver behind continued expansion of global sales.</p>
          <p>AVICTA is a nematicide seed treatment already widely adopted in cotton. Last year, our large plot trials on corn in the U.S. showed an average yield advantage of close to 9 bushels per acre. We obtained a registration in November enabling us to carry out broad acre testing this year, with the commercial launch for 2010. Nematodes are an unsolved problem in corn and our observations suggest they have widespread impact on yields. You can see the damage they can cause in the photograph. We've also submitted for registration on corn and soybeans in Brazil and we will market AVICTA in combination with insect and fungicide treatments. Sales potential is over $200 million.</p>
          <p>And now a major Seed Care breakthrough in sugar cane. Today, sugar cane planting is labor and equipment intensive involving 30 to 40 centimeter long cuttings. Plene is a novel approach to grow cane from smaller segments, less than 4 centimeters in length, coated in seed treatment to maximize early plant development. This is illustrated bottom left on the slide. Plene reduces tonnage planted and makes the entire process much quicker. The cost saving to the grower will be around $350 per hectare, some 15%. The efficiency gain enables plantations to be renewed at the optimum time and this increases average yields. Planting machinery is being developed under a contract we have with John Deere and we estimate potential sales in excess of $300 million.</p>
          <p>Now to our pipeline which shows a peak sales potential of over $2 billion. In 2008, the fungicide 520 advanced significantly and we now expect to launch in 2010. It is mainly active against foliar diseases on cereals and is a new chemical class. Just after that we will have our new wheat seed treatment 524, which has shown terrific performance in trials. Development of the insecticide Cyazypyr project name, Galaxy, being developed jointly with DuPont, is progressing well and we plan a launch now in 2012. Several of our early pipeline products are also progressing well and we have moved two fungicides into early development and are seeing rapid advances in insecticides.</p>
          <p>Let me now update you on INVINSA. We are developing INVINSA in cooperation with Rohm and Haas, it will be the first product to combat heat and drought stress during the growing season. The task or formulation development is a complex one, to turn a gas into a chemical spray. Over the last year, we've run fast track development of novel formulations to enable the product to be applied effectively. Given the complexity of this, launch will not take place before 2010.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we carried out more than 400 trials on multiple crops and are beginning to see that INVINSA's scope may go beyond corn and soybeans, to cotton, wheat and rice. Overall, INVINSA has the potential to increase farmers' yields by up to 15% where stress is a factor.</p>
          <p>I'll now summarize how technology will continue to drive our performance. Our new products AVICTA, AXIAL, DURIVO, and REVUS with sales of around 260 million in 2008, have five year peak sales potential of over $1 billion. We are underway with our capacity expansion program for AMISTAR and ACTARA/CRUISER and this underpins a peak sales target of 3.5 billion. For the later stage pipeline products, we are forecasting 1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me now conclude on why we think Syngenta will continue to outperform in Crop Protection. The value of Crop Protection in increasing land productivity has won recognition over the last couple of years, and it continues to underpin a global drive to increase food production. There is a new opportunity in plant performance based on the additional benefits of our products to improve plant vigor and yield even in the absence of pests and diseases.</p>
          <p>We have delivered and will continue to target an average 0.5% global market share gain annually. The strength of our portfolio has supported our initiative to raise prices, and we target 4 to 6% increase in 2009. And in markets where currencies are depreciating sharply, we'll aim to do more than that. Our performance over the last five years also demonstrates our marketing and selling skills and our ability to manage risk.</p>
          <p>With that, thank you, and let me hand you back to Mike Mack.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. In my introduction, I talked about the fundamental drivers for our industry. And before concluding with our outlook, I would like to illustrate those drivers for you.</p>
          <p>Over the last 50 years or so, there has been a gradual expansion in acreage and as I mentioned a significant uptick in 2008. However, yield has expanded at a much faster rate as farmers have incorporated more technology. It's widely recognized that the situation today is very different to 50 years ago. Urbanization has eroded the stock of arable land and new challenges have emerged such as water availability and climate change.</p>
          <p>If we want to farm sustainably and preserve the environment, the scope for further acreage increase is now very limited. And yet demand for food and feed will continue to grow. Even in the short-term, when the full economic impact of the environment may be unclear, one thing is certain world population will continue to increase by around 1% a year. These two factors combined, demand growth and land scarcity, mean that the role of technology is becoming ever more important. That is precisely why we are seeking out innovative and integrated technology solutions across our business.</p>
          <p>Our strategic goals start with innovation and our focus on plant performance. We are now capitalizing on our investment in Seeds, which is also resulting in enhanced demand for growers. We shall continue to expand in the emerging market business while at the same time managing risk. We are creating new businesses such as lawn and garden and our continued focus on cost efficiency will further sustain our growth investments. In our presentation today, we've shown you some of the areas in which we've outperformed the market and how we are well-positioned to do so in the future, by virtue of our global presence and broad offer adapted to the needs of different markets.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we target continued earnings growth despite the currency headwind and while taking all appropriate risk management measures. Our performance in Crop Protection will be underpinned by the continued expansion of new products and by the technology shift to seed care. In Seeds, the margin will expand in line with our target as our portfolio is upgraded.</p>
          <p>I've already described the demand drivers which give us confidence in the medium-term outlook. The capacity expansions we announced this past July will put us in an even stronger position to drive the growth of key products. And we will continue to invest through our business most notably in the area of research and development. Our planned R&amp;D spend this year in the order of $1 billion will be unique in the breadth of technology it encompasses and the power of its integrated approach.</p>
          <p>Using our technology enables growers to do more with less and that is what will drive our future success. That concludes our presentation today and now we will all be happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Patrick Rafaisz Bank Vontobel. I have three questions actually, first you said you use price increases to compensate for devaluations in emerging markets. Can you give us a bit of a feel how much that would be? You said you target mid single digits for northern hemisphere.</p>
          <p>Then for Vegetables and Flowers and Seeds can you give us the organic growth rates excluding the acquisitions you've made in these segments? And then lastly regarding the outlook, excluding the headwinds from the foreign currency impact what would your growth targets be here for EPS? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, well John, if you could comment on the price increases in the emerging markets and perhaps Davor some sense for the Veg and the Flowers absent the acquisitions. I'll start with the question about the earnings outlook. What we have done really is we have factored in some of the currency caution and some of the unprecedented uncertainty in the market. I wouldn't speculate as to the precise impact of that, but given the fact that we completely achieved and overachieved our 2008 guidance for last year, record year for the company, for us to be able to now target an increase in earnings per share in 2009, gives us a lot of confidence about the momentum of the company. So, with that John, on the price increase in the emerging markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Well, it depends market by market, of course. I can tell you that we've already implemented really significant price increases in places like Australia, South Korea, Russia, and they're all designed to compensate for the reduction in the value of the local currency and wherever we can to give us a real increase. But it's tailor made market by market.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the growth rates excluding acquisitions, if we combine Vegetable and Flowers, we are looking at a positive growth rate of about 3%, Vegetables stronger growth than Flowers, obviously Flowers has been impacted a little bit more by the general consumer downturn that we've seen.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let us make sure clear on the price targets. In terms of the mid single-digits, this is largely a northern hemisphere target now, so the increases in emerging markets are excluded, whatever that comes out to be in terms of budget it's excluded from our target of mid single-digits for the northern hemisphere now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. We've got a question from Michael Eastwood at Morgan Stanley. Good morning Michael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wonder I could risk a couple, just staying on the price increases for a second. Can you give us an idea of the global price increases that you have already passed, in the sense of through the quarterly price increases last year, those that you feel are if not quite in the bag, but as much as they can be? And what percentage of those relate to glyphosate?</p>
          <p>Then the second question is, I think you had about $3.5 billion of inventory at the year end which looks relatively, or as -- you're relatively high compared to the previous year. How much of that cash do you think you can harvest through 2009? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, John, if you could catch the second question, John Atkin, the amount of the momentum from the price increase that we had in 2008 and how that carries into 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, about -- if we look at our target for 2009 in the mid single-digits, about half of that will come from price increases that we've already implemented, in other words, exit rates from 2008. And on top of that, we've announced prices in a number of places, Japan for example, United States, and France of course where we do a lot of business in the fourth quarter, which are holding up well. Our confidence is therefore high, and we'll do everything we can to achieve those price increases.</p>
          <p>Glyphosate, of course, it was an exceptional year in 2008. We do not expect that price increases in glyphosate will continue at that level, but we do again have some benefit from the exit rates of 2008 which come into 2009. And we also have prepared ourselves where we need to for some price declines. Perhaps the most useful thing I can tell you about that is we expect to maintain our margins on glyphosate and to grow our volume.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the point on inventories in terms of comparing the year end 2007 with the year end 2008 are higher, the reality is as we came out of 2007 we were carrying far too little inventory for the market growth. And in fact had we had higher inventory and higher levels of supply chain service in the inventory, we'd have sold quite a substantial amount more in 2008. So we now, in addition to that, we also carrying higher raw material costs which inflates the inventory, which is carried over from the higher oil price in the first part of 2008. But, that now gives us a level of inventory at the end of 2008, which I think is appropriate for the market demand in 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Thomas Gilbert from UBS. I've got three questions. Could you reveal the name of the ethanol producer you are conducting the commercial trials with for amylase?</p>
          <p>And the second question, obviously you've given us a share for U.S. soybean Seeds, branded seed share of 13.5%. Let's assume 75 million acres means 10 million of acres to be planted. How much of that is going to be first and how much is going to be second generation herbicide tolerant, how do you see that split develop in '09 and if you can give a bit of a perspective, that will be helpful?</p>
          <p>And then the third question coming back to the emerging markets that you mentioned in your outlook, obviously there is Asia, there is small farms in Brazil, large farms in Brazil and Eastern Europe. Could you rank the risk from your perspective? How you sit you always said you felt very comfortable with the changes made at the beginning of the decade, moving away from small farms in Brazil to larger farms. Are those shielded, Teflon coated business into 2009? Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, well, I'll ask John Ramsay to comment on giving some sense for how we look at the different countries and Davor, how are we coming with the evolution of the glyphosate-tolerant soybean portfolio. But we have here with us Robert Berendes, Head of Business Development. Robert's looking after our corn amylase progression which is going quite nicely. I'll ask Robert to comment on the trial partners that we have.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, the trial that Davor was talking about that we did last year was a half year full scale commercial trial with ethanol producer, WPE. It's a refinery in Kansas in the U.S. and they had terrific results, they basically switched to the corn amylase system 100% and they continue to run that in going forward. So, it's a fantastic trial.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and John on the layering of the risk, different countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just give a little bit of color, there is different aspects here. Top of our minds at the moment is Eastern Europe, because Brazil is largely over. So Eastern Europe is not so much about the credit risk associated with the customers per se, in actual fact we are extremely pleased with our choice of customers and the partnerships we've developed particularly in Russia, but also the rest of Eastern Europe. Consequently, we are getting paid for 2008 sales. This is all about country risk. The dynamics around currency rates and sovereign risk is a question in our minds.</p>
          <p>As far as Brazil is concerned, we've been extremely successful in segmenting the market for many years. And in fact, the real stress test for that has been in 2008, where we've segmented -- and a lot of small farmers there have struggled at the marginal end of the profitability, and we've had to cut them out from our sales and factors in the 2008 year. In terms of the big farms in Brazil, we find very little risk opposite the programs we've got in place to support them, and we don't see much risk in Asia.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have options in terms of our second generation glyphosate-tolerant soybeans from different technology suppliers.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there, can you hear me now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, a few questions on the Seeds portfolio please. First of all in Q4, your Seeds business declined 10%, especially the corn and soy part. Now all the statements you've put out have been very, very positive about that business. Can you talk me through which areas in particular were weak in Q4, particularly as you've gained market share in South American corn and soy?</p>
          <p>Second question with regard to the pipeline, amylase, all your competitors now seem to have pulled out of that market for economic reasons with ethanol prices coming down. Is it simply that you are first to market, or is it that you're continuing with that despite the economics being against it at the moment?</p>
          <p>On the VIP broad lep product, you do some data against your competitors, can you say whether you've included the smart stacks in that, or whether it's just versus existing products in the market?</p>
          <p>And then final question on Seeds. R&amp;D, according to your projections, likely to go up substantially again in 2009, does that mean that margins are expected to be weak in Seeds again this year, or are you expecting now some growth in Seed margins this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, that's a wrap. Seeds questions -- Davor, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll try and do justice to all of them. Q4, Rhian the issue is, if you recall in '07, we had an early selling program linked to technology license, so we had a distorted year-on-year comparison in Q4 '08 compared to Q4 '07, and that really explains the variance there. In terms of amylase, I'm not exactly sure which competitors you're talking about, but certainly we're still very committed to this market and we have a long-term perspective on it. But also, increasingly with the current economic conditions, anything that plants can do to improve their profitability and reduce their cost is going to be of enormous significance to them. So, we actually see that this technology is even more important in today's environment than it has been previously.</p>
          <p>In terms of the VIPTERA trials, obviously we're doing comparisons with products that we're able to access and to do. So, they are based upon what is commercially available in the market at the moment from leading competitors.</p>
          <p>And the final question was margins in '09. No, we are committed to seeing a progression in the Seeds EBITDA margin in '09 in line with our longer term target of 15% by 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just like to add one final comment about corn ethanol. Of course, the plants are still running. They are not making a great deal of profit right now, as Davor said, any technology that would help improve their profitability would be welcome, but the U.S. mandates are still firmly in place, and all indications that I've read or understand is that government is still fully committed to the technology called corn to ethanol, as is Syngenta.</p>
          <p>We have a mail &#x2013; the R&amp;D commitment, is that likely to go up, was the final question from Rhian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes it is, and we will see continued investment growth in Seeds in '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's not the same year-on-year slug that it has been the past couple of years, so we wouldn't expect a big jump in that in 2009, though continued investments are in the plan, and part of the earnings guidance that we've given over the next three years in Seeds.</p>
          <p>We have a mail here from Richard Logan, Goldman Sachs. Please can you comment on whether Syngenta would be interested in Dow Chemical's AgroSciences business, are there anti-trust issues, incremental strengths of an acquisition?</p>
          <p>The first part of that question is, Syngenta would of course be interested in anything that would bring compelling shareholder value. This -- we're in the space of Crop Protection, Seeds, and seed treatment, that's what we're all about. Anti-trust issues I wouldn't guess, that's of course for the regulators to take a look at, if that opportunity would come to pass.</p>
          <p>Incremental strengths of an acquisition, I think John shared with you during his presentation, we've got a very strong portfolio, strongest in the business, and we think we've got good momentum. At the same time we've got a great platform and we've got a lot of reach, and portfolio expansion has always been part of the strategy of Crop Protection, one we've been executing quite successfully.</p>
          <p>So, I saw a question right here in the front row, and then we will come to Andrew Stott on the line from Merrill Lynch. Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Rim Bennani from Exane BNP Paribas. I have actually three -- four questions. The first one is, actually other players in the nutrient space fertilizer are quoting almost zero transactions, maybe one here and there in North America. I know as well for you that the peak season has not started yet, but are you seeing distributors taking volumes in January, or are they in a wait-and-see position? That's for the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on credit in Brazil and Latin America more generally. But, if I remember correctly, in Brazil you have 40, 50% cash terms, 20, 30 credits and the rest -- sorry, 20, 30% barter and the rest is credit. Are you likely, when you're quoting a tightening cash management, to tighten those terms, or to leave it like that, given the already solid customer base you have?</p>
          <p>The third question is on pricing. If I understood correctly, you're expecting prices to at least compensate for currency and raw materials, so there is no fear there over margin -- potential margin expansion in Crop Protection given the savings, or you think savings plus prices will compensate for raw material, how are you seeing the pricing evolution?</p>
          <p>And the last question is just a small financial question on taxes. What should we expect for taxes in '09, you've quoted mid-term low 20s, low to mid 20s, what's the 2009 outlook? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. John, first you can talk a little bit to the early order pattern and how we see distributors position, and then John Ramsay, three questions on first Brazil, and how we see that tradeoff between credit and barter and the margin progression, cost versus the price increases we targeted, and of course the tax question. So, first to John, early orders and distributors, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me be clear, there's none of the slowdown, abnormal slowdown that you referred to in our business. As we've said, we've got some really good and encouraging signs in Northern Europe and things are moving normally. Of course, you have the normal factors -- how will the weather be, and that's obviously why we are a little cautious. It's only February, but it's started fine and there's no change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, in the order that you asked them. Credit in Brazil, I think we have about 30% on barter, we have about 25% on cash, if you take the 2008 year. In addition to that we have some other programs as well, with lower volumes. The important point here is that it's not necessarily forcing people onto these schemes, in fact, customers want to be on these schemes in many cases, particularly when they've had &#x2013; we've got schemes which can protect their dollar value, if they've been invoiced in dollars, et cetera. They actually want to get onto these schemes, because they actually help them.</p>
          <p>So far as the smaller farmers are concerned then, or the marginal farmers, and we monitor profitability quite closely, yes then we are going to be requiring many more of them to be taking on cash sales or not selling.</p>
          <p>In terms of margin expansion in Crop Protection, the short answer is I would expect further margin expansion in Crop Protection. There is a number of dynamics there, but the short answer is I do not see currency in 2009 preventing that. So we expect margin expansion. Tax in 2009, I think it's in the low to mid 20s for 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>And let's turn then to Andrew Stott, Merrill Lynch. Good morning, Andrew.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mike. Yeah, three questions, all quite short. First one is for John Atkin. Can you just remind me how we're to think of corn versus soybean in terms of the -- approximately the revenue per acre?</p>
          <p>Secondly for Seeds, for Davor, it's back to an earlier question really, but what was the underlying Q4 growth for Seeds, so ex-acquisitions you had the two small acquisitions in there, and ex the effect of the Q4 '07 presale?</p>
          <p>And then finally for John Ramsay, can you comment on CapEx, I think I heard you say $750 million, is that the total spend for '09 relative to the billion dollars you've mentioned previously? And also, any comment on buyback? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, what don't we start with you on the two financial questions including the buyback and then John, some comment about how growers might be seeing the profitability each of corn and soybean in the U.S., and turn to the question about the fourth quarter, Davor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on -- first on, Andrew, on CapEx. Yes, the 750 million is an estimate of the 2009 spend on tangible fixed assets. It has come down from previous numbers a little bit because of currency, a little bit because we've been able to do things a bit cheaper, and the programs within the program are largely intact, and particularly our capital expansion program.</p>
          <p>In terms of buyback, as I said in my presentation, we are not proposing a 2009 buyback, as we've always said, the primary mechanism for returning cash to shareholders is the dividend. We've increased the dividend by 25% and in these times, we think it's prudent not to be targeting a buyback in 2009. Our whole strategy of cash return to shareholders hasn't changed, but with more cash we feel we might be able to use it selectively, with more opportunities that might arise in these particular testing economic conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John -- farmers, how are they looking at corn and soybean revenue right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the question was also about us, and how we'd -- I'll answer both anyway. The farmers are looking at it with fairly calculating eyes, and trying to decide how they can make the most money, but they are a bit confused. And there is no absolute clarity about this.</p>
          <p>Common wisdom suggests that once they get going with corn if the weather is good, then they will keep planting it. So, I think we've just got to keep watching the USDA forecast, because it will change.</p>
          <p>As far as we're concerned, two or three years ago, I would have said corn is a lot better for us than soybeans. And it still is a little better for us. But, there are two other factors to bring into account. First, our programs in soybeans, because of glyphosate-resistant weeds are very strong and getting stronger. We've got a big soybean Seed Care business, seed treatment business, which is growing and is very valuable to us. And of course, if there are fewer corn acres then we can expect the price of commodities to be higher, and that encourages investment in corn fungicide. So, making a straight calculation between the two, I don't think is very helpful. There is a small advantage in favor of corn for us.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think in terms of the Q4 comparisons, Andrew. The two acquisitions we announced in '08, that affected the '08 annual results. If you look at Vegetables, Zeraim Gedera was actually closed before Q4 in 2007. So, there's no distortion there from the Zeraim acquisition, and the Goldsmith acquisition has a very small impact, really, in the overall Seeds numbers. So, I come back to the earlier response, which is that essentially it's due to the distortion on the Q4 selling in '07 with our corn business.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we got a phone call here from Jean De Vottaville at Nomura Securities. Good morning Jean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hi, good morning, thank you very much. I have actually three questions. The first one is just to go back in the Q4 and about Latin America particularly, very strong performance, I think 47% at constant exchange rates. Seems surprising to me, given the fact that credit risk is increasing, acreage were down in Brazil, Argentina is facing a drought, and lot of your competitors are talking about the fact that they are sacrificing some business. So really I would appreciate some color on your performance in this region, particularly is there any pre-sell program that has transferred some of the business in H1 '09 into Q4 '08 that we should be aware? Is there any benefit from the inventory buildup here, we know that again inventory has been increasing significantly? In which part of the market are you gaining share, basically?</p>
          <p>The second question is on -- going back on the comments and the discussion about credit tightening in 2009. Can you quantify the size of it? I think your answer to a question saying that some of the smaller farms with some profitability headwind, you will probably tighten credit terms here. Can you quantify the size of that business for you, looking at your 2008 revenues? And if you could just give some sales impact you have in mind related to that credit tightening?</p>
          <p>And the last question I have is on the raw materials impact, obviously petro-chemical prices went down substantially, but also you have very high level of inventories getting into the year, are you expecting any benefit already in 2009 from lower raw material prices, or because you bought a lot of the raw materials inventories in '08, there is still an inflation that we should take into account in our modeling? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, maybe we can start with John Ramsay commenting on inventory and the impact of oil on our cost of goods sold in 2009, and whether we got a benefit. And then to move into how big a piece of our business is that piece that's going to be a further tension, then comment on the credit in Brazil, before we then turn it back to John Atkin to give some sense for the programs themselves and the pre-sell. John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So far as the inventory's concerned -- let me just reiterate the point. In terms of the major reason for the higher inventory at the end of 2008 is because, basically at the beginning of 2007, we did not have the level of inventory with the degree of forward cover that's required for the size of the markets, and the growth that was in the market. At the end of 2008, we feel reasonably comfortable that that is appropriate level of inventory, in terms of the forecast that we can see. There is an element of that inventory which is carrying costs into 2009, which is always the case.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of Syngenta's supply chain, you are typically speaking above six months of cost impact in the market coming through to our income statement, as it goes through supplier's manufacturing, into our raw materials, into our finished goods. So, what we have in 2008 inventory is some costs associated with the earlier part of 2008 when we did have higher costs.</p>
          <p>So, what you could expect is somewhere in the region of about 150 million higher raw material costs in 2009 as a consequence of that carryover. On the other side, of course, going into 2010 then we'll find the costs coming down quite significantly. Did you want me to answer the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question on how big of our sales mix are those smaller growers for whom credit is a particularly -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, over the last four years, since we've really been putting the effort into our programs in Brazil, we've also been focusing on the customer selection, and put tremendous effort in moving away from marginal farms. And we track the profitability by region according to crop price and exchange rates, and the actual agronomics of each region very closely. So, when we've got movements in those, we're able to move out of the small farmers quite quickly. I think it's very difficult for me to give an absolute figure, but I'll give you an estimate of somewhere around 50 to $75 million, maybe slightly more than that, that we would have sold in prior years had it not been for the risk of the profitability of those customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the credit in Brazil, do you want to reframe that then, Andrew? I'm sorry, Jean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean. Yes, basically the question on Brazil is more about explaining the performance in the fourth quarter. 47% performance seems very strong compared to the comments from your competitors of drought in Argentina, the credit risk in Brazil, and the lower acreage in Brazil. I just would like to understand what is driving that? And the question associated to that, any pre-sale --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Where you're gaining share, what's the explanation, basically?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Outperformance in Crop Protection in fourth quarter, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me just make a couple of points. First of all, we measure consumption in Brazil. So, we don't sell into, and build inventory, without that being reflected in consumption. We measure what the distributor sells on to farmers. That's our measure of consumption. And December isn't a pre-sale or the end of the year, it's getting into the season, so this isn't pre-sale. We have gained share and this is, as John Ramsay has alluded to, the attractions of our risk management model, the attractions of our product. We have the highest rated fungicide for soybeans ,which is called PRIORI XTRA. It's an absolute blockbuster down there and it has gained share significantly.</p>
          <p>Now having said all that, of course, we are a little cautious about Latin America and we are cautious because of the drought, and we are cautious because we want to make sure that we have implementation of the best credit and risk management system we can, John Ramsay's referred to those points. And we are cautious because September, which is the next planting season, is a long way away. Evidently, we won't see growth rates of that sort persisting into the first part of the year, but what you saw last year was real gain and real consumption.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I thought we had one here in the room before then turning to Andrew Benson on the phone, did we? Okay Andrew Benson, from Citigroup, good morning Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah hi. It was really, I just, perhaps a bit more explanation on the Seeds side on the fourth quarter, why that was so weak? The volume growth, can you try and -- have you tried to make any assessment as to whether the distribution chain has filled up as well, whether there is much stock effect? Much as you can rationalize the volume growth, it still &#x2013; it's obviously very high relative to history, and relative to any period I've ever known, and there is always the issue of stock. And if there is, what you can do about that? And can you just put some more light on the issues in January, what are those factors that create confidence?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, I think the second part of your question about channel stocking, I presume is a Crop Protection question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. John maybe you can talk to whether we see any channel stocking, and what is it exactly that gives us encouraging signs about the northern hemisphere?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in fact the stocks, broadly speaking, were slightly down on where they were a year ago, if we look across the globe, particularly in the northern hemisphere. So, there is no issue with that. Confidence is pretty high, the technology -- and I would like to underline this point, the returns farmers got from technology in 2008 were outstanding. And this is a terrific story. And I believe that a lot of them have understood that very well. And consequently, going in to 2009, that is very much still in the headlines.</p>
          <p>So yeah, it's started fine. We have to look at Latin America differently, of course, and we've already spent some time doing it, because of the drought and because of the currency and because of the credit issues. But elsewhere it started well, including by the way in Japan, which had a very good start.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are these -- the starting one, is that positive feedback from farmers that were impressed by yield, or is there more quantified data points that provide that optimism?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, short of telling you what our January sales were, I don't think we're about to do, it's both sentiment and it is what we see going out of the door. It is -- reasons for cautious optimism.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to give a little bit more background on what happened in '07, we had some licenses that were due to expire, and therefore we had some inventory that we sold out in Q4 '07 which normally would go out in Q1 '08. So, that distorted the comparison between Q4 '07 and Q1 '08 but also Q4 '08 and Q4 '07. And that's really the underlying story there.</p>
          <p>There is really nothing more that I can add. Underlying the business is -- the underlying performance of the business, is still consistent with the growth rates that we have seen for Seeds in 2008, I think you've seen our second half performance as a whole in '08, put in a very strong performance in Seeds. So, I don't think you should get too focused on the Q4 results.</p>

          <p>Yeah, we're very excited about VIPTERA because it really as I mentioned earlier does have a novel mode of action very different from anything that's out there in the market at the present time. So, we think it's going to bring some real benefits.</p>
          <p>Of course, in the south of the U.S., the pest complex is quite different from the pest complex in the rest of the U.S. with the focus very much on lepidopteran pests, above the ground pests, which VIPTERA does an excellent job of controlling. And we believe that our combination of our Bt11 and VIPTERA will give very complementary control of these pests, and we should be in a position obviously subject to regulatory approvals to be successful in getting refuge reduction granted, but obviously that's depended on the regulators.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, what you're hearing Virginie is, Brazil southern part of the U.S. is where these key above the ground pests are going to have the most amount of efficacy with our new product. John, the nonproprietary, at this point we've principally transitioned our entire portfolio of traits to the proprietary stacks that we have. So it would be 2008, it would be a real small number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's going to be very, very small, because we're not actually selling too much in after corn soya in the quarter, and our intention is to have transitioned out during 2009. So, it's a very small number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the, of course, the opportunity for us is to drive up that triple stack which takes us from proprietary singles, proprietary doubles and indeed a proprietary triple-stack, from a number that this coming year is 30% to something that looks more like 90% by 2011. So, that's what we are all about.</p>
          <p>Did we have one here in the room right behind the second row, right here? And then we will come to Ronald Koehler at MainFirst Bank. Good morning.</p>

          <p>Good morning Bernd Pomrehn NZB Neue Z&#xFC;rcher Bank. You already provided quite a lot of guidance for 2009, thanks a lot for that. Do you also have a guidance for restructuring costs in 2009? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, the restructuring program. We are on track for the $290 million of savings as John indicated by 2011 but for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be about similar level probably slightly less, I think than 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and good morning Ronald Koehler with MainFirst Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually I have also several questions. First question once again back to Dow agriculture science (sic) [Dow AgroSciences] . Could you confirm that you would look at the business, it's really put the whole 4.5 billion, so to say, on the block so. So, that is also though you are not looking at pieces or parts of the business, you would also consider the whole deal? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding the currency effects and receivables in the financial income, could you quantify how much negative was that effect in 2008 in million euros?</p>
          <p>And the third question is regarding emerging market pricing, you have obviously a U.S. dollar pricing terms in Brazil, are you moving something like a euro pricing level in Eastern Europe and is that possible in your view can you implement something like that relatively short-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, John if you could take the second two questions on the euro exposure and then the emerging market pricing. I will answer the first one. Of course, whether or not -- I have no idea whether Dow AgroSciences is going to be sold, that will of course be up to the Dow Chemical company. That business, Dow AgroSciences, is of course in the same business as we are so as I said anything that would be of compelling interest to our shareholders is something that we're all about here at Syngenta. John, the second two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in terms of the financial expense that relates to very much a one-off event between October and November of last year, when emerging market currencies essentially collapsed against the dollar and it was ubiquitous across the board, at very large levels. The net impact on net financial expense was somewhere around 80 to $90 million all in those two months of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>80 to 90 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's not necessarily something we should worry about going forward because there is certain things we can do to ensure restructuring balance sheets, recapitalizing in local borrowings, as well as probably expecting those events not to recur.</p>
          <p>In terms of euro exposure, when we talk about currency exposure on the EBITDA level, we're actually talking mainly about emerging markets because we do have an ongoing program of rolling hedging on the developed market currencies. And therefore, the euro, the sterling, the Swiss franc et cetera against the dollar are largely hedged. So when we talk about currency, it's mainly emerging market impacts that we're talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had a final follow up question from Thomas Gilbert. Did we get your question answered Ronald?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No just to clarify with the receivable you spoke about net effect, meaning is it after-tax or pre-tax, just to clarify that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's pre-tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my third question actually was a little bit different. It was actually more for Agrochemicals, for John, the question is you have in Brazil, you have a pricing mechanism based more or less on U.S. dollar not on Brazilian real. In -- Eastern European prices are based on the Eastern European currencies, but there are some people moving let's say to Europe -- euro based prices. Is that something you consider to implement also pricing schemes based on euro levels for avoiding the currency issues here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just say that we put a huge amount of effort into managing our prices which is consistent with our, the way we tailor our operations by each territory. And we, of course, a reference point is what are these dollar, or euro prices, what are they and how can we reflect them properly in a country which has a weakening currency?</p>
          <p>I can tell you that, and this is very important point, the fundamentals for agriculture in some of these places like Russia, for example, is very strong. Government buying wheat into intervention, loans extended to farms. There is a lot of positive things going on there. And I think in that context our job is to reflect as much as we possibly can, the devaluation of the local currency in our pricing, and that we are trying to do, and to continue to develop our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I'm getting a signal that we need to close this down, Thomas was it a quick one or, okay go forward.</p>

          <p>Slide 40.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. There is a question on slide 40, just trying to understand if you price Quilt -- if Quilt gives you 15 bushels yield and the farmer makes a $38 profit and the farmer pays 27, where is the distributor in there? How much -- is that $27 to you, or is it to the distributor and how much of that is ending up with you actually?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that is -- the purpose of that calculation is purely to show the benefit of this to the farmer. Behind the 27 is our margin and of course the distributors margin. So, that's all -- that wasn't the purpose of the slide. So, we can do fine out it and so can be distributor. But the point being it's really, and this is what is all about right, it's really interesting for the farmer to do that, because in a very short time he gets high net returns for his investment.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With that, we need to wrap it up. Thanks again and thanks all of you joining by the phone as well.</p>
