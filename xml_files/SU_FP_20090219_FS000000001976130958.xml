        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning everybody, welcome. And thank you for taking the time to come and see us this morning. We are going to be exploring through the results 2008 of Schneider. So I am going to go this morning through the disclaimer which is kind of traditional event.</p>
          <p>The overview of &#x2013; first reminding you what are &#x2013; what is the positioning of Schneider Electric briefly. So, I shall come back on the achievements of new2. You know that we just finished the cycle of company program called new2 and come back on what's we've done through this program.</p>
          <p>Then Pierre will take you through the results of 2008. And I am going to lead you through the main directions of our new company program three-year cycle this time '09 to '11. I'll explain you what -or remind you what are the main guidelines on direction that we have for this new period.</p>
          <p>So moving on, on the overview on Schneider Electric, I'm reminding you what is our positioning. Well, the first thing is, what do we do? Schneider Electric has repositioned to be the global specialist in energy management. So we manage the energy of our customers. And sometime it is better even to define oneself by what we don't do. And what we don't do is generating energy. We don't do thermal plants. We don't do nuclear plants. We don't do gensets. We don't do solar panels. We don't do windmills. We don't do the products for the systems that use energy. We don't do appliances and rack, motors, conveyors.</p>
          <p>What we do is that we connect the power plant to the plug. So we go from plant to plug. And what we do is that we make energy safe which we have always done. But in recent times, we've realized that our customers were asking us to make their energy totally reliable, as the grid was not reliable. And the applications were becoming quite sensitive.</p>
          <p>They ask us to make their energy efficient, to reduce their carbon emission, to reduce their energy bill. They ask us to make their energy productive which is another thing, well, they want to get more productivity from the amount of energy they consume. And finally, they want us to make their energy green that mean introduce some green component in the mix of energy they are using.</p>
          <p>So our job have become &#x2013; has come from making energy safe which was basically everything we are doing, five years ago to making their energy safe, reliable, efficient, productive and green. And it is a complicated equation. Every direction that we are mentioning here, it's pretty much in contradiction with the other direction. So what we do is to help our customers to make the most of their energy.</p>
          <p>Where do we do that? We do that in places where 72% of the world's energy is consumed. So, industry is 31% of the energy consumption of the world. Data centres and network is like 2%, but bound to go to 10% in the next 5 to 10 years on the energy consumption of the world, building 18%, 21% in residential.</p>
          <p>What we really don't do is everything linked to cars and transportation and trucks, but as those will become more electric, we are going to be in the part of supplying the infrastructure for those vehicles to get to be electric. We don't want to be inside the vehicle, but we want to be inside the infrastructure that supplies energy to those vehicles. So, we are solely in 72% of the cases of energy consumption in the world.</p>
          <p>However, we operated the transformation. You've got on the vertical axis the application that we are dealing with. On the horizontal axis, the function that we are delivering to our customers or the values, reliability, safety, efficiency, productivity and green; we started from two historical activities which were low and medium power, medium voltage power, industrial automation and control and we built successively leadership positions in new activities to be able to give the full value to our customers. So we built a leadership position in what we call Critical Power &amp; Cooling services, that's today &#x20AC;2.6 billion of activity.</p>
          <p>We built a poll of &#x20AC;1.5 billion in Building Automation &amp; Security. Around 2 billion in Installation Systems &amp; Controls which makes us a solid number two in this field. We just started last year in Renewable energy solutions which is &#x20AC;300 million today, as of today. And finally, we deliver as of today already 5.7 billion in the field of solutions and energy efficiency systems for our customers.</p>
          <p>So from a basis, which was roughly &#x20AC;9 billion which was low and medium voltage power and industrial control and automation we doubled our size, and completed our portfolio to supply new values to our customers. Well everything &#x2013; we don't do many things in Schneider. We don't do trains, we don't do appliances, we don't do a sort of such that some of our competitors are doing but everything we do is in energy management and everything we do have synergies with the rest of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>But what we do, we do it in leadership position worldwide. This include Japan; this include new economies. These are our worldwide position, so we are number one in power. We are number two in Installation Systems &amp; Controls; plugs, sockets, home automation, cable management, management of the electrical infrastructure. We are number one by far in Critical Power &amp; Cooling Services, in a sector which is pretty much concentrated today in the world, three big ones, all being 70% of the world market.</p>
          <p>We are number two in Industrial Automation &amp; Control; machine automation, discrete process automation, this doesn't include process control in continuous process. We are number four in Building Automation &amp; Security, though if you focus just on climate control which is the most important part for energy management, we are probably number two.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are number three in converters for connecting renewable energy to installations. Number three in the world and just starting on benefiting from all the technology investment and the volumes in the field of critical power, because we saw fundamentally the same technologies applying to different applications.</p>
          <p>And in all of this there is a common green thread, which is in every of those applications, our differentiating factor is to put a superior emphasis on energy efficiency, on energy management. So this is something that we bring everything and if you make the sum of the things we do in energy management and energy efficiency we have really a leadership position in energy efficiency.</p>
          <p>One thing we don't speak a lot about, we don't speak enough is also as a historical commitment of Schneider inside sustainable development. On the &#x2013; we have put ourselves, set ourselves a Barometer in the field of new2, with some of ten criterias, ten indicators, indicating our progress to the environment, to our people, to community, our commitment to better covenants.</p>
          <p>We started with a rating along those criterias four years ago of 3.6 on a total of 10. And we finished our plan with a rating roughly at the level of our target on 8 upon 10. You have things like ads on safety at work, which certainly we are today the safest place to work for in our industry in the world.</p>
          <p>We are speaking about social coverage, everywhere including some of the acquisitions we do in the new economies. We are speaking about the certification of our production sites to ISO 140001. We are speaking about environmental profiles of our products. We are speaking about energy consumption of our own sites. We are speaking about our engagement to the community on the fact that we help youngsters from underprivileged origin to insert themselves in the society.</p>
          <p>While we are speaking about the global compact where we engaged our suppliers while these are places which you may not see, but which make this company more sustainable, less &#x2013; certainly less risky for investment. And more important for us it's becoming more important in the selection of our customers and certainly in the pride of our employees.</p>
          <p>So well this is about the positioning of Schneider on what we are doing. Specialized in energy management, a new portfolio of activity, significantly different from where we are before, leadership positions in everything we do and the sustained commitment in sustainable development.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at new2. new2 is a program that we announced at the beginning of 2005. It was at that time representing a significant change from where we are at that time. And it took us through a cycle of four years of transformation, and transformation of Schneider during that cycle has been pretty significant.</p>
          <p>We transformed the size of the Company. We've doubled the size of the Company in those four years. We've transformed the profile of business of our company. We've transformed the geographical profile and the geographical footprint of the company which is specifically a very strong development in new economies. We transformed the productivity capability, the operational efficiency profile of the company. And what doesn't appear here is that we have fixed ourselves a series of stretched financial targets that we all reached another shot out of the past four years. So, double the size that's pretty obvious.</p>
          <p>New businesses are business of &#x2013; new businesses on our solution capability that went from 36% of our portfolio to 50% of our portfolio during the time of the program. The geographical profile where we brought 80% of our supply chain cost from the new &#x2013; in the new economies in '04 to 41% in '08, but more important so for the future we brought the number of people that we employ in those new economies from 26,000 to 46,000 in four years that was not by acquisition, that was organic and that was a conscious decision of investment, which gives us a very solid platform for the next years to come.</p>
          <p>I'm going be speaking again about productivity and I'm going be speaking about our financial performance and our achievement. A brief snapshot of our geographical profile today. We are presenting more than 100 countries. We sell in 190 countries but we have a physical presence in 100 countries as of today. I see one of the assets of Schneider today is to be very balanced in terms of end-market, in terms of geographies and in terms of activities, which makes us more resilient than any other company in our field.</p>
          <p>Our new economy sales have been multiplied by more than two since 2004. We do 10% of our turnaround in the rest of the world, 20% property in Asia-Pac. And what you see here in Europe, 44% is a drop from 47% the year before. And in that you've got 8% which is in Eastern Europe. As a total it makes 33% of our turnover in new economies.</p>
          <p>While we change our business profile, I &#x2013; we realized that the need of our customers was changing, was evolving. And we built on the very strong leadership position that we have in the field of products to capture more value vis-&#xE0;-vis our customers and we started to propose them some packages which is a combination of products into functions. For instance, you equip a pump so that it's more productive and more efficient with a total package that what we call a package.</p>
          <p>Then we went into independent systems which is, for instance, what we do in the IT field with infrastructure where we do a totally integrated wide space of data centre including the racks, including the cooling, including the power supply, including the mechanical installation of the racks in one integrated system.</p>
          <p>And we deliver more and more totally integrated systems like we deliver all the active parts of an hospital. I was speaking about the data centre. We go from the wide space that APC used to do and we complemented with the low voltage, with the transformers, with the medium voltage, with the automatic transfer switch, with the video cameras optical, with the temperature control of TAC with one cockpit of control, which is One supervision system that enables to &#x2013; our customers to gain on installation system on CapEx and on OpEx.</p>
          <p>And first this is a big growth engine because if you take one existing project that we had where we sold 100 of products here we have the potential to sell 300 to 500. On the value that you deliver to your customers is different from one place to the other one. Not every customer is the same. Some times they ask for products and in product leadership we fear nobody, we have extremely strong products. But as our customers are facing the crisis, they are refocusing on the other one on what they have to do and very seldom is electricity automation and energy management and the core general.</p>
          <p>The core general is data hosting. The core general is taking care of their patients if they are running the hospital. The core general is producing cement or producing synergy. It's not to manage what we know how to manage. So what we want to, we position to is to capture more and more value as we go forward and one of the key differentiator is always energy efficiency as a key feature and as a key differentiator.</p>
          <p>On the right side, you have what we call today eco-structure, which is a total integration of our system and something that optimizes the software control, the communication protocols, and the mechanical installation of all the stuff we are putting into customers facility.</p>
          <p>So, we changed our business profile. Change of operational efficiency, the figure that we see on productivity, excluding raw material inflation. If you take an average across the cycle, our gross industrial productivity was 4.4%. We realize more than 900 million of savings net of labor inflation or roughly five points of margin of sales gain.</p>
          <p>There is one thing that we don't indicate in this slide that was strong operational discipline that we worked on in the past four years, which was a pricing discipline. You saw us starting to price up at the beginning of new term calendar part of the raw material increase. The performance last year was strikingly good, plus &#x20AC;375 million of pricing against an inflation, raw material and labour of 255.</p>
          <p>And this is something that I don't negate that it will be more difficult to price up in the period to come, but this is discipline that we have acquired and that we are going to keep, and that will at least enable us to be more and more professional in defending and maintaining, and sometimes increasing the prices in the future.</p>
          <p>Support function costs down 3% in function of sales. This in a good environment, but integrate anyway in this performance that we acquired a lot of companies. And every time, we acquire a new company, there is a new structure on board, there are costs to cut. So, this was done in a period of intense acquisition and intense aggression of company.</p>
          <p>On the last point that we invested in the right spot, you sometimes told us that we are not leveraging enough the growth in terms of retail, we are also investing, we are investing in new economies and we were investing in the new businesses, services, solutions. And you can see in the results here that these investments carried results in terms of transformation.</p>
          <p>We changed geographical profile. I am following always my points of transformation. You know probably or you remember those figures, 58% of our manufacturing account is in low-cost countries. If you take our purchasing, our production purchase in low-cost countries, that doesn't appear on the slide, is close to 50% today. 50% of our purchase is done in low-cost countries. 41% of our total cost of production is in low-cost countries to be compared to 33% of our sales.</p>
          <p>So, we are in advance to be preparing for our next development. And one element that remains very true is that our business model is not well-integrated, which is more difficult to manage in good times, but to guarantee a flexibility in up-time. So, we are speaking about here of 61% of COGS outsourced with suppliers and up to 70% valuable. This is something that increased in &#x2013; from 54 to 61 billion during the duration of the plan.</p>
          <p>Finally, the financials. Organic growth of the cycle, we had committed already at the beginning of the plan to a growth of the 5%. We upgraded this target at 6%. We delivered, in fact, 10% in average per annum. We finished 2008 at an EBITA of 15% at the top of the target we had announced.</p>
          <p>The ROCE increased by 2.7 points, this including the acquisitions. Remind you for the EBITA that in the middle of the plan came on board APC at 5% EBITA. And if you remember that deteriorated our EBITA and we re-installed the profitability at the original level in 18 months.</p>
          <p>Finally, cash generation that was multiplied by two of duration of the plan, and if you take a period while five years of moving average, we've doubled &#x2013; more than doubled the cash generation over the period of time.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm going to handover the presentation to Pierre who will be speaking about the year 2008 results.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning to everyone. Let's now review in more detail the 2008 results. Our solid 6.6% organic growth rate is broken down in two, as you can see, region. 6% growth in Europe, reduced 1.5% growth in North America, a satisfactory 9.6% growth in Asia, and a very strong 19.2% growth in the rest of the world. As you can see it, we have a 14% organic growth. New economies contributed largely to our performance.</p>
          <p>Along with new economies our businesses, our new businesses posted as well solid organic growth rates with 7% in critical power, 12% in building automation, 1% in ultra terminal in a very difficult environment, as you know, and 20% in services.</p>
          <p>As you can see on this following simplified income statement, 2008 is, for Schneider, another year of solid progression of its results. Our sales have grown by 5.8%, up to &#x20AC;18.3 billion. Our organic growth is over 6.6% as already mentioned. The impact of acquisition is of 3.1%, while the foreign exchange evolution and, in particular, the U.S. and British pound depreciation versus the euro, had a negative impact of 3.9% on our sales evolution.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA grew up by 7%, up to &#x20AC;3.331 billion. And before restructuration cost, our EBITA progressed by almost 10%, up to &#x20AC;2.918 billion, and our EBITA margin before restructuring reaches almost 16% at 15.9%. After a significant &#x20AC;164 million of restructuration costs, our EBITA margin reaches an all-time high 15%.</p>
          <p>When taking into account, first, a &#x20AC;174 million of amortization of purchase accounting, out of which &#x20AC;70 million impairment of a customized sensor business unit, when taking into account &#x20AC;340 million of interest expenses negatively impacted for about &#x20AC;40 million by non-recurring FX losses in a context of a very high volatility of foreign exchange markets in the second half of last year, and when taking into account &#x20AC;555 million of income taxes, reflecting a sharp, but structural reduction of our effective tax rate for the future, down to 24.5%, our net income increased by 6.3%, up to &#x20AC;1.682 billion and our EPS reached &#x20AC;7.02.</p>
          <p>The following chart is our traditional analysis of the EBITA change from &#x20AC;2.562 billion in 2007, up to &#x20AC;2.754 billion in 2008. As you can note, out of 7.5 points of EBITA progression, 11.9 are explained by organic growth, 1.8 is explained by acquisition, while foreign exchange evolution add a negative 6.2 point impact.</p>
          <p>Volume impact accounts for a positive &#x20AC;244 million, while the change in our mix of activities add a negative &#x20AC;145 million. This negative impact is, in particular, attributable to the increased proportion of our sales in less profitable product lines, such as equipment, including engineering-to-orders, ETO, in North America which generally have lower gross margins.</p>
          <p>The significant &#x20AC;375 million price increases, 2.2% altogether, made up for &#x20AC;255 million impact from raw material and labour inflation, but also for a &#x20AC;70 million negative FX transaction impact explained by the sharp depreciation over 2008, in particular in the second half of many currencies, such as the British pound, the Swedish kroner, the Australian dollars and the reais.</p>
          <p>Our continued efforts to improve our industrial productivity have generated &#x20AC;331 million savings, in line with our new2 targets, while our support function costs have increased by &#x20AC;199 million, which is much lower than previous year, and I remind you that it was &#x20AC;354 million in 2007. Thanks, in particular, to the effective cost control in the second half of last year.</p>
          <p>The currencies evolution hurts us up to &#x20AC;159 million broken down into an &#x20AC;99 million translation impact and an already mentioned &#x20AC;70 million transaction impact. At last, the impact of acquisition, as you can see, is limited to &#x20AC;45 million.</p>
          <p>As indicated, our industrial productivity plans generated &#x20AC;331 million savings and are now bigger than our 2007 &#x20AC;295 million savings, and those savings were broken down as follows. The &#x20AC;165 million savings through improved purchasing conditions owing to the massification of a procurement resulting in better negotiation and to the value engineering of our products; &#x20AC;50 million savings through lean manufacturing; &#x20AC;65 million gains from manufacturing and supply chain rebalancing to low-cost countries. And you will note that over the last four years, we have transferred about &#x20AC;1.1 billion of industrial purchases from high-cost country to low-cost countries, and at last 51 million impact generated by industrial rationalization including the closing down and consolidation of six manufacturing plants.</p>
          <p>Such a productivity improvement represent in 2008, 3.6% of our sales &#x2013; of our product cost, I am sorry, and this is obviously in line with our new2 targets. It is worth indicating again that at the end of 2008, Schneider Electric realizing a 41% of its COGS in emerging country as compared to 32% of its sales.</p>
          <p>This following slide presents our profitability across region and before the allocation of corporate cost, one can derive two lessons from the figures of this chart. First of all, as already mentioned, the relative share of our sales in Europe continues to decline from 47% in 2005 to 44% in 2008. Moreover, all our different geographic operation post a solid and rather homogenous EBITA profitability.</p>
          <p>In Europe, our EBITA margin increases from 17.2% to 17.4% owing to a dynamic pricing power of 1.9% to a volume impact, to across the control of our support function cost, to sustain productivity improvements, and to all development on the attractive energy efficiency markets.</p>
          <p>In North America, our operating profitability slightly eroded from 16.5% to 16.3% despite the sharp turn down of most of our traditional markets, but owing to a pricing power, owing to the finalization of APC turnaround, and to a development on attractive market segments, such as water treatment, hospitals and again energy efficiency.</p>
          <p>In Asia, the sharp progression of our operating profitability up to 15.9% reflects a significant volume impact combined with a pricing power of 1.7% and a tight control of our support function cost. At last in Middle East, Africa and Latin America, the positive 16.5 operating profitability is explained as well by significant volume impact combined with our pricing power.</p>
          <p>In the same way, the following chart presents our profitability across the different business units and before again the allocation of our corporate cost. One must note that following the APC turnaround each of our business unit now post a solid EBITA profitability above 13.5%. The progression of our Electrical Distribution operating profitability up to 60 &#x2013; to 18.6%, I am sorry, is largely explained by the volume and the price impact and by productivity gain.</p>
          <p>The limited progression of our Automation &amp; Control EBITDA up to 14.5%, despite volume and productivity gains is explained by our sustained investments to develop new products and position on new markets and by the weaker industrial markets in the later part of 2008.</p>
          <p>Naturally, the further turnaround of APC largely explained the sharp increase of our Critical Product operating profitability from 11.4% to 14.6%.</p>
          <p>Our 2008 sources and uses of funds is now presented, mainly our generated &#x20AC;2.5 billion operating cash flow has allowed us to finance &#x20AC;693 million of capital expenditures; limited &#x20AC;72 million additional working capital needs: This is a combination of operational working capital needs and non-operational working capital needs; &#x20AC;796 million dividends; &#x20AC;615 million acquisition, mainly Xantrex in the renewable industry for &#x20AC;280 million; and resulting &#x20AC;383 million net debt reduction.</p>
          <p>As you probably noted in the slide before, our free cash flow has reached &#x20AC;1.735 billion. It is worth emphasizing that our free cash flow has grown by 25% run-on over the last three years, and therefore, that our cash conversion rate, measured by the ratio of our free cash flow over net income, improved from 85% in 2006 up to 103% in 2008.</p>
          <p>Such an improvement of our free cash flow is explained, to a certain extent, by the achieved control of our working capital needs and of our capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>This following slide explains the evolution of our capital employed. As you can see it, we have, in particular, succeeded to reduce our receivables by more than four days, 4.3 days. And to limit our inventory increase to one day, 1.2 days, precisely, despite a difficult year-end context. We were, therefore, able to reduce our working capital needs by one point, down to 20.8% of our sales, while containing our capital expenditures to 3.8% of our sales.</p>
          <p>As a result, our capital employed, at &#x20AC;17.257 billion, only increased by 1.8% at a time when our organic growth rate was three times bigger.</p>
          <p>As a result of the seven to 7.5% progression of our EBITDA and EBITA on one hand and of the control of our capital employed on the other hand, and as it is exposed on this new slide, ROCE post a significant improvement. Therefore, cash ROCE, measured by the ratio of our EBITDA after tax over capital employed, improved from 13.4% to 14.6% in 2008. While ROCE measured by our EBITA after tax over capital employed went up from 11% in 2007 to 12% in 2008.</p>
          <p>These following slides give you key indication on our gross net debt structure. As you can see it, as of December 2008, 74% of it is at fixed rate, and 26% at floating rate; 55% is denominated in euro, 32% in U.S. dollar, and 13% in other currency such as yen and Australian dollars, in particular.</p>
          <p>At year-end 2008, Schneider Electric was also having &#x20AC;1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalent and was benefiting from &#x20AC;2.3 billion of additional undrawn committed credit facilities.</p>
          <p>In January 2009, we have raised an additional &#x20AC;1 billion medium-term financing, including a four-year-and-a-half &#x20AC;750 million bond. Therefore, Schneider Electric is now endowed, for the three coming years, with a comfortable minimum &#x20AC;3 billion available liquidity position.</p>
          <p>Owing to our solid results and to a strong cash generation, our financial structure further improved from one year to another with, at year-end 2008, 14-time interest coverage by our EBITDA, a 41% debt-to-equity ratio, and funds from operation to net debt ratio, as per rating agency's definition, at 42%, comfortably inline with A-, A3 ratings.</p>
          <p>As exposed on this following slide, our Critical Power business unit posted a solid 7% organic growth rate. Owing to our APC turnaround to the further APC-MGE integration, we've escalated synergies implementation and operational efficiency. Our Critical Power EBITDA margin, after restructuring, increased by 3.2 points to 14.6%. You will note that our Critical Power profitability is now at par with the Group's level, and above all, that we have delivered the post-merger integration plan announced in November 2007. We are even ahead of the schedule we have committed to at that time.</p>
          <p>As summarized on this following slide, in 2008, Pelco sales averaged $608 million; and its EBITDA $106 million. Actually in a difficult market environment, with volume drop, in particular in the U.S., we have been able to deliver only 58% of the expected revenue synergies. But owing to strict cost control we are able to extract 148% of the expected cost synergies. As a result, with 5.4 points increase at 17.5%, Pelco EBITDA margin is above our integration plan objectives and now close to the 19% target for 2011.</p>
          <p>In 2009, the introduction of our new generation IP range of products and the integration in early 2009 of Phuket, an independent, captive distributor of Pelco devices in Latin American and Asian countries, would support Pelco sales.</p>
          <p>As a conclusion of this finance presentation, and as indicated on this last slide, our EPS has reached &#x20AC;7.02, and we will propose a &#x20AC;3.45 dividend at our next Shareholder Meeting. On that basis, it is worth highlighting that, both, our EPS and dividend have grown by 17 to 18% per annum over the last five years.</p>
          <p>I leave back the floor to Jean-Pascal now. Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, I'm going to be quickly going through the main directions of our One program that we introduced to some of you on &#x2013; anyway that we made public on the 28th of Jan. I'll remind you that what we want to accomplish here is, well, establishing four transformation. One, which is transformation of mission to our customers, transformation of business going from power and control products to energy management for our customers, which encompasses what I explained before in our positioning.</p>
          <p>And to do that we need to make three transformation: one, going from product play to a product on solution play, which is already making a significant part of our business at the end of Q2; from leader in mature countries to leadership in mature and new economies; and finally, from a multi-local and complex company to a global and simple organization.</p>
          <p>Now, well, and that's our program, we want to be one company. We want to supply solutions as one company to our customers. We need to be one team in front of our customers.</p>
          <p>And there are two axis which we call our fundamentals, which are common points with the previous program, with new2, which is working on customer sat. We don't speak very much with you guys about this achievement of new2. But we increased by 30% the proportion of very satisfied customers doing new2. And we cut by two the number or the proportion of dissatisfied customers. And there is a very systematic work in all angles of the Company on customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>We define that customer has to be one in every of the decisions we're making, customer satisfaction is the biggest source of growth, and it's a major engine in cost cutting. In a company like ours, every time a customer is dissatisfied, then there is a ghost machine that is trying to repair the mistakes done before. So, we are working on that as a growth engine and as a cost reduction engine.</p>
          <p>Then one team, we acquired a lot of company, 40 to 50% of the Company was not in the Company five years ago. And we want to be one team. And if we want to act as one in front of the customers, we have to act as one as a team.</p>
          <p>Then our three key transformations; one solution provider, one leader in new economies, one global company. Obviously, the two first one are positioning us for growth, or our drivers for growth. The two second one, because of the cost efficiency of new economies and the simplification of our Company, are positioning us in terms of cost efficiency.</p>
          <p>Well, we have launched initiatives leading to a minimum of 1.4 billion savings by 2011, 1.4 to 1.6 according to where the crisis is. This is a plan that we started to work one-year-and-half ago, just in the aftermath of the subprime. And we're talking just at the coffee this morning that I had started to speak about the crisis in October 2007 a bit too loudly at that time. But at that time, I had also appointed a team that would be looking at the way we are working and looking for simplification.</p>
          <p>And we had put into place a plan for structural changes driving to one billion savings inside the Company: 600 on support function costs, 800 on the supply chain. If the crisis is growing harder than we thought then &#x2013; or while it is driving us lower then we can go for 400 million more for adaptation. And those 400 would be more support function costs and deriving less productivity, because we won't benefit, in this case, of the volumes that we usually have.</p>
          <p>We position the Company as a company that would grow on a GDP +3 points basis. We use to be a company that was GDP around. And we believe that with our positioning in new economies, we are able in the new economies to grow GDP +6 with our positioning in new activities, and especially the one around solutions and energy efficiency, which is 30% of our turnover. We are able, everywhere we operate in this field, to grow GDP +5. And we still have onboard mature and stable activities which are growing like the GDP. All compounded, it makes a profile other &#x2013; across normal cycle at GDP +3.</p>
          <p>Across the cycle, the earning driver should support a continued improvement of profitability, we come from 13 to 15% EBITA range, while we realize, at the end of '08, 15% margin achievement. The positive elements will be the capacity to build on our strengths in products a layer of solutions that will help us &#x2013; that will drive more growth. Our positioning in new economies, even if we acknowledge that new economies are going through crisis today, anyway they should be back on structural growth which is higher than the mature countries. One simple way, I just spoke about that, simplification of our structure function costs, and simplification of the supply chain driving 1.4 to &#x20AC;1.6 billion of cost improvement.</p>
          <p>On the other side, some negatives are impacting us. We are deploying an IT common system, which is AV, expensive, and that's impacting us on a negative by &#x20AC;150 million.</p>
          <p>We are supporting salary and general cost inflation. And we have a mix effect as we go into more solutions, those are carrying less gross margin and less profit than our traditional product business. So, this is improving year-after-year. As of today, our solution and service business is just below the average of the group profitability.</p>
          <p>So, in a normal cycle, Schneider Electric would be able to generate an EBITA margin range of 13 to 16%, keeping on growing at a GDP +3% rate.</p>
          <p>In the short-term, we are prepared to manage a global economic downturn. I would say there is one positive thing in all this that we are not facing the crisis in a panic mode. We have been preparing the plan for efficiency now for more than one year. We are suppose to execute it for structural reasons. The crisis, as it is today, will act as a catalyzer and an accelerator of the implementation.</p>
          <p>So, we certainly acknowledge there is a very high uncertainty on the severity of the downturn. The impact on organic growth is today difficult to forecast. We've made range of scenerio going from minus five to minus 15%. We are yet to manage the worst-case scenarios that being the minus 15, while reducing our support function costs, activating the 400 more that I was describing. Going for conservative cash management &#x2013; you saw that we kept on improving our cash management in an environment that was already tough in this sector. We reduced inventory. We reduced our payables. We reduced our receivables. Maintain and increase our payables.</p>
          <p>So, we are, well, putting the priority on cash. And we have restructuring costs in our plan for &#x20AC;660 million, which is corresponding to the worst-case scenario in terms of restructuring.</p>
          <p>Under these conditions, we deliver the savings I spoke about. We want to preserve our margin at 12% before restructuring costs. And we are targeting to have a cash conversion rate of 100% of the income.</p>
          <p>So, well, Pierre, spoke about it, so I don't want to spend too much time on that. But strong liquidity has been achieved through the credit crisis. And what we want to keep as commitment is a A- rating, which is free flow operation on net debt more than 35%. Dividend payout of 50%. We are taking the key assumptions of a worst-case volume scenario; no acquisition, no divestiture, restructuring costs of 660 million. And we go with the level of three billion of liquidity across the timing of the plan with those assumptions.</p>
          <p>Finally, well, just to remind you that our business model is resilient. We have a diversified end market, diversified geographical exposure. We have multiple access to market on a not very integrated business model. We shall capture additional value in the market with solution and services. We shall increase our presence in new economies. We have an exposure to the government stimulus packages, so we acknowledge we won't get much of that in 2009, this is more 2010, 2011 kind of plan.</p>
          <p>In terms of structure, we have a flexible cost structure. Production in low cost countries that we're going to intensify. At the end of the plan we should be, really, around 50% in low-cost countries. And we have our simplification plan.</p>
          <p>With that this close the formal presentation. We are now ready to take your questions and try to answer them.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask three questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a microphone. Three questions, if I could. This is James Moore at Goldman Sachs &#x2013; at Redburn Partners, sorry, old habits die hard. In terms of mix, you've talked about the pressure that you may face going forward, and you report the business in three divisional lines; Automation, Distribution, Critical Power. But you often talk about other parts of the business; building automation, sensors. And I get the impression that internally you don't necessarily think about the business in those three parts.</p>
          <p>Going forward, is there any chance that you may change the way you report that structure? And for now, can you help us a little understand where there are any significant margin differences, to help us think about what the mix issues are? You mentioned a negative mix from service and solutions, but then you said that the margin is quite close to the Group. I got the impression that it was more like nine, 10%, impact there, is it to say that it has lifted that much? And so, a little bit more mix if you could?</p>
          <p>Secondly, a big part of your savings going forward is your gross industrial productivity. You've done a lot, in new square (sic) [new2] . You've moved a lot of your costs to emerging markets, they now exceed your revenues. You've mitigated all the old currency transaction issues. Where should we simply think that you get this next chunk of cost savings from?</p>
          <p>And then finally, I noticed that your &#x2013; a technical question, perhaps for Pierre, your R&amp;D capitalization has gone up by 64 million, which is obviously slightly helping your EBIT margin reporting. Why such a big jump? Is there anything that we should consider in terms of future changes to R&amp;D capitalization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I may answer this question immediately, that's because of Pelco. Pelco has, as you know, significant R&amp;D expenses, which are therefore accounted for as we use to do with Schneider and this explain for this difference to a large extent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have there is Pelco and we have a one or two other ambitious projects that generating more amortization. There is one in automation that was presented last year in Monaco with 1,000 customers, totally disruptive system for automation machines, for industrial machines. It's a system that for the first time enables the total transportability of software from one PLC platform to an HMI platform or to drive platform, which means that you can make without the PLC, which is kind of new thing in the world, and without having to change your software.</p>
          <p>And the second point is quite also innovative platform that we're going to bring in the field of the building enabling you to make the all the energy of the building in a quite innovative way. So, that's driving a few of the R&amp;D amortization. Back to your question about the business presentation. This is a subject we touched on the 28th of January in Paris. We said that we have four, five businesses in Schneider. We have a business, which is geared to the end-user of IT, a business which is geared to the building user, a business which is geared to the process, I mean automation machines and end-user, and the business which is geared to the power intensive kind of customers.</p>
          <p>These businesses are businesses that are mixing products and solutions. We believe that when you're making solutions when you see that solution integrators don't add our product that makes a difference, okay. And we are able to do solutions with products that makes a difference. On the same time when you do products which is often missing is your knowledge of solution and applications, and we are a product leader that is building a solution capability. So, that builds on the two axis. On one axis, you &#x2013; we face integrators. On one axis, we face manufacturers. We are building a very strong differentiation respect to every kind of competitor.</p>
          <p>Now, we're going to structure more our reporting along these lines giving the visibility about the part of products, on the part of solution, knowing that the two are very mixed. I mean, when you start to do solution it's full of our products, okay. And there is still our sense of business going into specific applications, which is more technological diversification, which is a business, which is a bit of part of all the other businesses.</p>
          <p>Now, on the margin of project of services that was the second part of your question, this margin is not 9 to 10, its double-digit in the last year and it's a big, big rates it's below the average of the Group. But it's catching up and as we are getting more professional this margin was really deteriorating in the <mark type="inaudible" /> every investment we did in this field.</p>
          <p>The time you put &#x2013; I always said that on it's &#x2013; you don't find those people already on the market, people do that at least in Schneider. So the time you recruit somebody, train somebody, the person is starting to take projects and solution, it takes 12 to 18 months. And that was heavy investment of on support function cost.</p>
          <p>On the first projects when you don't have the experience to lower margin then you industrialize your solutions. So it's getting better by the day, I would say and we are coming to more industrialize, more differentiated kind of solution on services, which are bringing a better margin.</p>
          <p>Industry, no -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. If I just may have to avoid any misunderstanding on this specific question, the impact of services and project is accounted for in the volume impact. I know it's a bit puzzling because the impact of equipments and ETO is accounted for in the mix impact that was presented to you in the analysis of change of the EBITDA. And I knew it's a bit puzzling, but this is the way we quantify it. So it answers also a part of your question I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Finally, on the industrial, well, I &#x2013; we are facing as much potential as we are facing four, five years ago. We are planning to rebalance the same amount of volume per year in the next coming three years as we did in the past years, and we feel far more comfortable to do it than we were four years ago because at that time we had no platform, no competent people in the countries, we had no suppliers ready to receive our volumes and now we have a momentum. We have an experience, we have people.</p>
          <p>It's a very positive momentum. There is one part of the business that we barely touch, which is our relationship to suppliers. And you've seen this year productivity made more on the back of what we call negotiation. One year and half ago when we saw &#x2013; when we are starting to look at the next steps to optimizing the company, I personally realize that I had not taken enough into account the interaction with suppliers. Suppliers are making 50% of our P&amp;L, when we sell 100 we buy 50 from the outside. They are making 61% of the cost of our products.</p>
          <p>And so we have started to work on it. We realized we had 20,000 suppliers in Schneider, which is probably totally insane, that the target was to go to 10,000 in three years or more important to massive 39% of the purchases that we do today with 1,000 of them to 70%. And when we do that we cut the complexity in a massive way, and we can work together on the cost, we can work together on the innovation. We can work together on our supply chain, on our capability to leverage also our size with the suppliers.</p>
          <p>So this is where we are going to be working so, it's going be a bit more of the same. It's going to be about rebalancing. It's going to be about simplification of our supply chain. We have 140 DCs, we want to bring that to 80 DCs in the next three years.</p>
          <p>So cut 60 of them, we want to keep on working on our SKUs. We went from &#x2013; by the way on the DCs on the plans I &#x2013; we can speak about ideas, we like to speak about track record during the past plan we closed one every month DCs and plants. We &#x2013; the only problem we both want every month. So but at the end of the day we've got the same number of plants and same number of DCs as in 2004, the only difference is that we do the double of turnover with the same set-up in terms of units. So we've doubled the operational efficiency of what we had.</p>
          <p>So we know what we have to do in front of it. We had last year &#x2013; at the beginning of last year 1.2 million SKUs we have 800,000 today. We think we can go with a lot of good marketing, good technical adaptation, go to 400,000 over the next three years. So to tell you we are not missing ideas it's more of the same rebalancing and simplification plus add the place of the suppliers, which are making 60% of the cost reduction that we plan to do on the supply chain side.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Scott Babka with Morgan Stanley. Just two questions please. One on the 2009 outlook, I know the visibility is very limited and you've got a range of five -negative five to 15. Could you just talk around what regions would represent the biggest swing factors, or what business units would provide that kind of volatility? And kind of how you come to these numbers?</p>
          <p>The other question I just had was, just looking at your pricing strategy into 2009, are there certain areas where you feel like you have real competitive advantage and can increase price under any circumstance? Are there other areas where you think the raw material decreases going to have to be given back? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well, there is a contradiction somewhere in your question because, well, if you say there is no visibility, it's difficult to give you a visibility on where it. But not surprisingly, I mean, we can share that. This lack of visibility we expect swings in the mature countries probably more serious than in any other countries. Well, and we expect in Asia to have a slow beginning of the year, it's not some &#x2013; well, we know that Japan which starts to be not significant, but representative in our portfolio is in a very bad shape today.</p>
          <p>China, we have certainly a difficult start of the year, but seeing the energies of the government is putting in the simulation of the economy. It would be back probably sooner than other geographies. But the biggest swing will be in Western Europe or in Europe, by the way, because Eastern Europe is suffering together with Russia and the U.S.</p>
          <p>Now, if you speak about businesses, I would say probably the most impacted businesses could be resin, no surprise, it has already been impacted in the U.S. for long time and in Europe, now for &#x2013; in many places for more than one year. This place being one of the terrible places of Europe for us.</p>
          <p>Building, building is resisting pretty well so far, but it's going to go down on a place restructuring will be the industry, I think in '09. Everything to building, to automation we believe will be suffering. Well, where we see a good resilience which is quite insignificant at the end of the day is everything into infrastructure, energy efficiency, renewables, which seems to be <mark type="inaudible" /> which was quite a North American company. There is lot of potential in Europe where we have exactly the credibility on the commercial networks to take full packages of connections, so that seems very promising.</p>
          <p>Well, I would say on IT, probably at this stage a bit uncertain because IT is very prompt to stop and we saw that Q4 was negative, I am expecting some significant slowdown in Q1. But the fundamental trends in data traffic, in digital storage are there, and the problems of the grid are bigger than ever. So I &#x2013; on the mid-term, I'm not too worried about that. I just think that Q1 and Q2 will be probably under stress. And I am expecting to understand better where the year is going at the end of in Q3.</p>
          <p>In Q1 and Q3, you have to understand will be very interesting, because we're going to be comparing to the historical highs of our historical high point period. And we're going to be probably at one of the most blocked moment of the economy in 2009 where people are quite kind of frozen. I think Q3 and Q4 will be much more significant or to understand where the year is going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if may handle your first question regarding the combination of our pricing part on one hand and raw material price decline on the other hand. Maybe two things, first of all, obviously, we should profit by some sort of a lead-time effect. The lead-time effect which was against us, when raw material prices were going up, should be now in our favor for a while when raw material prices are going down. But in the second part of my answer to you is, in different scenario we have assumed that over time we shall be &#x2013; we should be in a position to give back to our clients the impact of raw material prices decline. So we had been very conservative in this respect.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Mark Troman from Merrill Lynch. Jean-Pascal, just following on from your comments on some of these end market outlooks. What's your read on the de-stocking risk for the first half? You commented that demands might be quite weak in the first half and better and &#x2013; maybe in the second or easier comparatives at least.</p>
          <p>Is there a big de-stocking problem for the high volume businesses that you have or is it brought under control do you think? That will be question number one. And question number two, you said the better areas were infrastructure, energy efficiency. Could you just explain why &#x2013; what do you see that why you think about it is that just because the investments are keeping going or the financing situation or do you think there is a risk there too? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's kind of embarrassing to keep on talking about my forecast in the world where I've said we have got a very limited visibility. And frankly, anybody speaking about our industry, I don't trust very much anybody who would say there is great visibility. So de-stocking, I think we've been through a quite a lot of de-stocking in Q4, and there will be a bit more in Q1. But I -- there is not much you can do in that now. At one stage you got to brace again.</p>
          <p>And by the way, we had already some signals in December, because the end of December was pretty good time for us. It was kind of distributors bracing again, because they had de-stocked and finally there was demand, so they had to reorder and we are there to deliver. Hence, at the end of December that we had calibrated cautiously was better than what we thought, okay, originally.</p>
          <p>Now back to energy efficiency. I think there is only positive here, period. I mean, it's &#x2013; this is market that was not existing. We've been lone preachers of energy efficiency for ages. When we bought PMI many people didn't understand. When we bought PMI and put it together with PowerLogic we took 40% of the North American market. And that put us in a very, very positive technological position. When we added the energy performance of TAC, we have suddenly in North America always back, the biggest energy specialist force of the continent &#x2013; of the place. And now, this was you'll realize that the present administration are not very green administration. The new administration seems to be far greener and that changing the whole attitude of the world.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, you had the European Community who started to vote some very strong resolutions like 20% renewables, 20% less energy consumption, 20% less carbon emissions in 2020. We want to do that, and I think we're going to do it, because some people in Europe are bloody serious about it. I mean take the whole of North of Europe, when they say something, they do it. There would be a massive and there is massive investment into it, and you take some countries now they are very, very practical, major steps taken in order to make this move. This is happening in France, there was something called <mark type="inaudible" /> In France, we are rather well positioned to capture the opportunity.</p>
          <p>And the beauty of this market, it's not a market of new construction, 99.9% of the energy savings have to be done in existing buildings. And it's not massive investment, it's not doing a new nuclear plant which is a few billions, a few years on the payback, which is very long, it's something which can be done in six months, a low investment, very low investment but it can be for P&amp;L reasons because energy will be back up at one stage. And I think sooner than probably later, it can be because your customers are asking for it, they ask you to be green. And you want to go green and we have these phenomena for instance with retailers. Retailers and people like Carrefour, people like Wal-Mart, they're asking us to equip all of their stores, and nowadays they are pretty tough purchasers &#x2013; those guys. They want to see a payback on their investment. It can be for many reasons but people are moving now into the direction of energy or cost reduction. And it's new business. It's really a new business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Simon Smith, Credit Suisse. I had three questions, one was, in terms of costs you've given us the variability that you see within COGS. Is there any sort of similar measure you can give us in term of SG&amp;A? Your cost line is sort of 70% variability COGS, and then may be you could tell us what the variability is there at the SG&amp;A line to volume.</p>
          <p>In term of your productivity savings, obviously a lot of it as you've said is going to from the focus of suppliers, as you go through that process of expanding relationships with some suppliers and maybe cutting others off. Could you give us a feel as to what the working capital consequences of that would be over the next few years?</p>
          <p>And then, my third question is about the competitive environment. And I think you've given us great disclosure to model your business, and how you run it. But if you were look at the competitive landscape, probably more related to the low voltage area. How do you see your margin advantage over the more &#x2013; the smaller and more fragmented players that you are competing against?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In low voltage, you mean. In low voltage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In low voltage, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry. I missed the first question, because the cost reduction programs we have encompasses variable you see the SG&amp;A. So, what is the underlying question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you were to look at your business pre-restructuring, and cost saving action. So I mean &#x2013; I presume when you say that COGS is 70% variable, that is before you start laying off 10% of the people or forwarding COGS or something like that. So just a natural built in cost of that business, which varies with volume is 70%. If I was to look at SG&amp;A, obviously it's going to be much lower. I just wondered if there were any statistics you could give me on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have not conducted certain analysis to try to assess precisely which proportion of our SG&amp;A is variable and which is not. The reservoir of savings, we come from first, a further integration of all the different acquisition we have been making over the last three years. To give you an idea, we have made 60 acquisition over the last three years. So there is first reservoir of saving.</p>
          <p>The second reservoir of saving will come from what we have called simplification of being one Schneider. We have, for instance, very large number of internet sites for the different business unit for the different countries, all that will be massively simplified. It will come up from creating shared service centers, for all what is transaction, for instance, in finance and in human resource. So we have the road map for instance to give you an ID over time by 2013 to have three shared services centers for finance and human transaction resource for the group. While today, we have 900 different units with their own HR and finance transaction.</p>
          <p>So this is a very precise program with a very precise road map underlying it, which would result in significant support for some cost saving over time. And we had given the detail of it, during our Paris presentation on 28th of January.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you're aware, there was quite a few variability of the DVCR headcounts which we had. We estimate that we've cut into almost 10%. That was built in &#x2013; directly in the way our plans were very quick parts it was quite impressive to ramp it down in November and December. And again, we always speak about financial, but in the time of forward cluster like this, which is a most important resource of the delivery for our customers. And we kept on increasing our delivery rate, and I tell you it's not easy when you get plans starting, starting, asking &#x2013; ordering from the suppliers and then stopping the orders from the suppliers. I think our supply chain has been quite tremendous work in the past three months. And it's not finished, but it's a good discipline truly on going with AV variations of business.</p>
          <p>On the suppliers' consequences on working capital it will be positive, difficult to quantify at this stage, but two elements on that as we massify our purchasing, we aim also to have better conditions on the payables, okay. Our mission is you get more, but give us better conditions. The other part, which is probably the most massive, is the inventory. Today, we've got an incredibly complicated supply chain, as we go with flows, which are better organized with a much lesser number of suppliers than we are going to be able to optimize a lot our inventory.</p>
          <p>LV &#x2013; low-voltage margin advantage we estimate our market chain voltage to be double over the next quarters, so it's our leadership, this is massive leadership. The second thing that you have to integrate is that in low-voltage products, already more than 50% of our volume, I'm not speaking about the dollars, have been in the low cost countries, in the new economies and the large part of that is in China. So we are positioned with very effective &#x2013; cost effective products on the mass competitive markets of the world.</p>
          <p>And we were the first public company to start developing specific products for those economies. So we have the range of products, very sophisticated for very critical application the one we find year around to more basic applications with more, just enough kind of products. We increase this capability with a joint venture we did in China with Delixi. I may remind you that Delixi is a number two of the Chinese market on mid to low Chinese market, that give us another insight about what it is to make very, very effective &#x2013; cost effective product or I think this positive is quite well staged to be keeping on building our cost advantage.</p>
          <p>Now this is about technical on industrial costs, which is weighing on purchasing, volumes, on capability to drive your cost down. But the biggest cost advantage is on the commercial because with the 10 sales guys we drive the largest range of the market, largest lineup.</p>
          <p>On the fact that we don't sale product, we sale systems, we sale panels, sometimes we translates in selling products, okay but you sale all the system from the very small breaker that you see in your home or in your room in the hotel to the medium voltage cell, which is at the bottom of this building. And that is a massive advantage.</p>
          <p>First we create the partnership with some of our distributors, which is very strong because obviously a distributor needs to have a total system and not everybody is able to supply a total armed competitive system. On this dimension of system and package we'll intensify on increase because these systems will be communicating by default in the future.</p>
          <p>I mean you can't imagine 10 years from now to have an electrical system as it was before, it has to be all connected. And if you want it to be connected you need a whole bunch of products, you can't be saying I'm covering 70% of your need. Because the customer won't like to have a translator somewhere in the middle between such systems, so I would say the battle of the 80s was to make made-to-order products, now I feel to standard products and we are the pioneers of that change. Battle of the next 10 years is to supply fully integrated, fully communicated, fully superior light systems. And it elevates the difficulty of competing in an incredible way. We are with our positioning and capability to offer full on integrated systems. I don't know if this answers your &#x2013; that in terms of cost advantage is big.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean, I think that has totally explains the mechanism of it all. But, I mean, in terms of your margins, your sort of &#x2013; the margins you state, do you have a feel, I mean, maybe from all the companies that you look at in that area from an acquisition point of view, the smaller players, as to what their margin would average out at in sort of actual &#x2013; total percentage of sales terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is one thing that's clearly seen when we acquire a company, sometimes we need the revenue synergies and something we never miss, it is the cost synergy. This is because we benefit from our economies of scale. I mean it was the case for APC. The case &#x2013; big case for Pelco. Pelco we knew that the business case was &#x2013; may be a risk in terms of volume, but we knew we had reserves in terms of cost and this is what we are delivering today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> of these volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me see that the &#x2013; we have made an extensive review of the last 60 or 70 acquisition we have been making as compared to the original business plan. The outcome is that we are always on time and even slightly ahead when it comes to cost synergies. But we are always slightly late in delivering the revenue synergies. We end up delivering them but let's say with 12 to 18 month delay versus the original business plan wide and Pelco is a good example of that we are ahead of the schedule and APC also to a certain extent was a good example of that when it comes to deliver the cost synergies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there was a little crisis in the middle but that's more necessary</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's fairly not logical because we are pushing those products in incomparable commercial networks through the world, as you know in 140 different countries with a presence every where and some countries are good at reacting, some countries as not as good as we would &#x2013; as we're expecting and that's fairly logical at the end of the day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. It's Martin Wilkie from Deutsche Bank, so. A couple of questions, firstly, could you tell us what China represented of your revenues in 2008? And then in China, where is Schneider exposed between buildings, industrial infrastructure, just so we can see &#x2013; take our own view on the Chinese market, but just to know your exposure within China?</p>
          <p>And secondly, a question for Pierre, you mentioned about lower tax rates in the presentation, you bought some significant tax assets, I think when you made the Pelco transaction. If you could just let us know how would you think of both the P&amp;L and the cash tax and as we go forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I may address the last question. First of all, it's going on according to the plan. So, we'll be able to absorb over time these tax assets. Second, it doesn't have any impact on our effective tax rate, and last but not least, yes, it has an impact on our cash position, but not on our generated cash, it hasn't got &#x2013; we are not paying taxes and that we have as you know a total expected tax saving of about $350 million, what was expected for the coming &#x2013; it will take something like to eight to ten years to absorb it.</p>
          <p>On China, it's bit less than 10% of our turnover. Well, it depends &#x2013; I'm just speaking about outside group numbers, because we export from China to the rest of Asia. If you take the export then if will go to 10% of the turnover, but it's &#x2013; I would say probably 8% of some of the issue. If you put everything together, you put the power sales, the APC sales together.</p>
          <p>What is our exposure? Our exposure is very diversified in China, but I would say conventionally we are less exposed to resin, resin being a sector that is more comprised with low cost, low quality, carrying of products. So that has impacted a lot of the local manufacturers, who are being crushed between raw material impact and a crashing market in many cases. We got fairly large &#x2013; I don't have the percentages, but I am sure that Carina or on the <mark type="inaudible" /> can give you the figures. Carina is pretty good at churn by the way.</p>
          <p>On the source of building, the building market is sizable first. The market, which is suffering first is the industrial market because there was the export of machines to South East Asia, to the rest of world and we see suffering. The industrial investment is also bit stalled today.</p>
          <p>In China, what we have is a superior exposure with respect to our user mix to infrastructure on to utilities, which is good news, which is good news for us for obvious reasons because the stimulus packages are going in to it. On the interest we've seen always repeating it is at also media are making big earnings about China as the producer, but this is one of the countries, which has taken carbon emission reduction on energy efficiency, the most serious way &#x2013; and don't forget that China is a country of engineers, and they measure, and they do, and they implement. And this is a place where we are doing the most in terms of energy efficiency today.</p>
          <p>So that's a very interesting place for us. What is was, this is what I can say so a larger exposure that we have when you go to Beijing to the new airport all the climate control is done by us. You go to Shanghai, the Pudong airport, I saw that in the long-term, which still working by the way. It's whole Schneider.  The Jin Mao Tower is Schneider if you take very large and prestigious buildings, we are particularly expose to everything which is infrastructure.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Securities. Just the quick question please, first of all can elaborate a little bit in the acquisition policy for 2009? And second question follow-up on the tax rate, can you give us some indication on the tax rate for '09 and for the CapEx level as well? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Acquisitions, I would say priorities is to consolidation today. There are few small things that we are more residual of small things. Important but also fairly &#x2013; let's say limited size with respect to the group that we might finalize according towards the situation. We are going to stay attentive to opportunities that could come on the market; many companies would be weakened by the crisis and it maybe an opportunity.  But priority is to consolidation. I personally consider the time is as the dust has not settled yet, and we've got to see what is coming outside of the dust before the understanding what we have to do, and what are the qualities of the business out there. That's for acquisitions and for tax rate.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The CapEx, I'm sorry. I forget to answer the CapEx. Well, we tried to expose it as well during &#x2013; on January 28 presentation. We tried to dimension our CapEx according to the magnitude of the crisis. So, we have a very precise plan to cut down our CapEx from about as you saw it &#x20AC;690 million to something around 550, but if we be we are even the triangular we can &#x2013; could be &#x2013; could be down to 500 or so 480.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that is taking a bit more important equation is the R&amp;D CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>While there are few lines of product that we are preparing in the field of energy &#x2013; energy savings and energy efficiency and I guess really the things that we should maintain those R&amp;D savings because &#x2013; and there would be end to a crisis anyway, and one thing we have to preserve all the innovation systems which are going out in the next coming two or three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a quick question. It's Mark Troman again from Merrill Lynch. Just a quick question on the portfolio, Jean-Pascal, you put your slide that with your market positions and very strong across the board that may be building automation, I think you have number four. Is that an issue you want to address in terms of you will grow your services businesses et cetera?</p>
          <p>Do you want to have a high market share in building automation or do you think what &#x2013; when you look at it locally, you have got high market shares in enough regions to do what you want to do. So, in another words it's being number four in building automation okay for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's a very good question. As several elements in answer, a lot of turnover that we see at our competitors is about facility management. And we don't have facility management. This is not the place where we compete in. By the way, our Building Automation business has a good profitability, which is not always the case of some of our competitors' business. So we want to remain selective on stay on the services which are technology related, okay. So one point is that Building Automation is a business where we are geographically not deployed. So we are very strong in some geographies, North of Europe, Australia, North America.</p>
          <p>And we have started and this has costed us, but it is very promising developing places in the rest of Europe, in China, in India and this is a potential of growth on market share conquest that we have. So we don't want to go by acquiring everywhere. We've got the technology platform.</p>
          <p>And the third point, I would say looking at building automation like we present here is probably an old-fashioned way. The reality of a building is that you are speaking about the energy management in the building. So the old-fashioned way of technology on businesses was to say there is HVAC on one side tower on the side. Now if you are user you want it to be safe, reliable, efficient, potentially, and I don't seeing you would like to have one screen for your power and one screen for your HVAC. So our play is to put together power on HVAC in one integrated play, bring it on security where the visual verification of the cameras can help you to check, if there is fire here or if there is a technical problem here and save on your operating expenses that's the new play.</p>
          <p>When you look at this new play, we are leaders in this sector. So not too many complex it just long, hard work to put into place on innovation that we are developing with our teams.</p>
