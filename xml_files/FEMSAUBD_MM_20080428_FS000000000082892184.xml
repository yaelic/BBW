      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning everyone. Welcome to FEMSA's first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Joining me today is Juan Fonseca and Genaro Estrada, both of whom you know well.</p>
          <p>Our strong performance for the first quarter was driven by double-digit growth in all of our business units. FEMSA Cerveza's operating results were driven by solid volume trends, stable pricing dynamics in the key Mexican market, and contained operating expenses combined with an easy comparison base from first quarter '07.</p>
          <p>Coca-Cola FEMSA continued its positive momentum across its divisions with Mexico accounting for half of the incremental revenues and more than a third of the incremental profits during the quarter. And finally, OXXO continued delivering strong growth in almost every key market after citing a strong first quarter 2007.</p>
          <p>All together, FEMSA consolidated revenues grew 8%, operating income growth approached 20%, and net majority income increased 13%. I would like to remind everyone that beginning this quarter, according to Mexican FRS we have this continued the use of inflation accounting with the exception of Argentina, Venezuela, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua, For comparison purposes, the figures for 2007 have been restated in Mexican pesos with purchasing power as of December 31st, 2007, and our results for 2008 are in current pesos.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our business units, FEMSA Cerveza delivered a solid quarter reflecting resilient consumer demand trends, a favorable comparison base, a generally mild winter in Mexico, and improved pricing dynamics versus the first quarter of 2007. Beer volume in Mexico increased 7.1% and our exports delivered strong growth for nearly 13% against the backdrop of a softening U.S. economy and a declining imported beer category.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, the year was off to a slow start, but picked up during March, growing 2.9% for the quarter. Cool weather and the fact that the Easter Holiday took place early, unusually close to the Christmas season impacted volume growth across beverage categories in that market. However, our Sol brand again drove the majority of our incremental volume, continuing on the right track with the rest of the brands also performing well.</p>
          <p>In terms of Mexico pricing, we rolled out a gross price increase at the end of '07 and through the first quarter, representing approximately 4.5% on average. Unit price in Mexico increased by 1.2% in the quarter on top of 1% increase achieved in the first quarter of last year when the rest of the industry lost significant pricing.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, revenue per hectoliter decreased 3% as price increases were implemented late in the quarter and the sales of some incremental off-trade volumes was shifted from us to the Coke bottling system. As for exports, revenue per hectoliter in Mexican pesos declined 4.5%, as a strong peso more than offset unit price growth of 0.9% in dollar terms.</p>
          <p>This growth was driven by a positive mix effect in the U.S. as higher priced Dos Equis contributed approximately a third of our incremental sales in that key market.</p>
          <p>Other income from operations increased 6.4%, reflecting an improvement in packaging, sales as well as the first portion of the distribution of rights payment received from Heineken, USA in relation with our new 10-year agreement.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales increased 6.4% in line with volumes. Increased prices for grains were offset by better fixed cost absorption, a strong from Brazilian real as applied to dollar cost, our aluminum hedges, and lower costs associated with glass bottles as compared to last year, when we had one furnace down for maintenance, and therefore had to buy larger amounts of our bottle requirements from third parties.</p>
          <p>Gross profit increased 7.2% for the quarter and gross margin improved by 10 basis points. Income from operations for beer increased 35.7% to 673 million pesos in the first quarter. Selling expenses were stable as a percentage of total revenues while operating expenses declined driven by lower administrative expenses mainly. Higher amortization was largely driven by higher volumes and the amortization of expenses related to our direct retail distribution, and operating margin expanded by 160 basis points to reach 7.4% of total revenues.</p>
          <p>Summing up the quarter for FEMSA Cerveza, in spite of the adverse raw material environment and the slowdown of the U.S. economy, our continuing efforts to strengthen our competitive position and our brand equity across our core portfolio and across our markets are helping us deliver results in a challenging environment.</p>
          <p>Turning to our soft drink business, Coca-Cola FEMSA delivered another quarter of double-digit growth at the EBIT level, lacking a high comparison base.</p>
          <p>Cost benefits resulting from lower sweetener prices mainly in Mexico combined with operating leverage driven by a strong top-line resulted in 15.7% EBIT growth and an expansion of 130 basis points in the operating margin.</p>
          <p>Brand Coca-Cola accounted for more than two thirds of our incremental volumes. Top-line was driven by an increase in average prices across all three divisions during the quarter.</p>
          <p>In the key Mexican market, beginning in February, we started distributing Jugos del Valle in the traditional channels and so far we are very pleased with the results. Jugos del Valle portfolio contributed 25% of our incremental volumes with better pricing than the rest of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Mexico average prices were up 1.8% including our fast-growing jug water and grew 2.1% ex-jugs. Volume growth with price improvements combined with lower raw material costs and stable operating expenses resulted in an 11% operating income increase in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our balanced geographic portfolio continues to deliver incremental profits coming from all three divisions. Mexico accounted for approximately 40% while Latincentro and Mercosur each contributed approximately 30%. If you were unable to participate in Coca-Cola FEMSA's conference call on Friday, you can access the replay of the web cast for additional details on the results.</p>
          <p>Finally at OXXO, same-store sales maintained a positive trend and grew 5% for the quarter, reflecting strong traffic growth of 14.5% and a reduction in the average ticket of 8.2%. As we anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2007, the reduction in the average ticket is being driven mainly by migration from consumer purchases of prepaid cellular phone cards, for which we book the full sale prices as revenue to the new electronic air-time purchase, for which we only book the amount of our commission as opposed to the full amount of the recharge.</p>
          <p>For comparability purposes, if we booked the full amount of the electronic recharges, OXXO's average ticket would have grown more in line with past quarters' performance that is in the low single digits.</p>
          <p>In terms of new store openings, we opened 73 units during the period for a total of 698 net openings in the last 12 months and we are confident that we will close the year with more than 700 net new stores in Mexico. Revenues increased 16.4% during the quarter, reflecting strong growth among all product categories.</p>
          <p>Gross margin improved 100 basis points, driven in part by the change in the way we book prepaid cellular air-time, as I just described, as well as by the implementation of improved pricing strategies and promotions and by a strong performance from high margin categories such as coffee and alternative beverages.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses increased slightly above revenues due to higher operating costs at the store level, mainly energy and maintenance-related as well as the initial expenses related to the strengthening of OXXO's organizational infrastructure that will be carried out through the year. Operating margin expanded by 60 basis points to reach 3.5% of revenues.</p>
          <p>Summing it up and in line with our long-term message, we began the year with conviction that our integrated beverage platform once again will deliver results in a year that is expected to be a challenging one.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would like to open the call for your questions. Operator, please.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We'll take our first question from Lauren Torres with HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Beer volume in Mexico increased just over 7% in the quarter. Can you give us a sense of how much of this growth came from healthy demand rather than favorable weather and the Easter shift? I'm just trying to get a sense of consumer sentiment right now in Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is very hard to put specific numbers on that, but just by looking at the performance of the beer business in '07 and the relative numbers for the whole industry, our sense is that definitely the quarter was helped a lot by the easy comparisons of '07, where at the same time we were cautious at the end of last year since the industry started taking price and also the concerns of any effect on the slowdown of the U.S. economy. And I would say that in both fronts, we feel comfortable so far.</p>
          <p>We think that the way the pricing increase was executed taking care with the price increase on the most the price-sensitive SKUs and also taking into account the strength of our brands in the different regions, we feel that consumer has been accepting very well the price increase.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, again the terrible weather last year now was very different and we have a very mild winter, so we're definitely seeing some of the volumes as we were able to sell on the first quarter being driven by that weather effect. So I wouldn't dare to a put a specific number on that. We're confident that looking at the rest of the year, we will be also be able to have a good performance for the industry as a whole, and we have reiterated that we think that volumes in the industry should perform at least slightly above GDP growth for the whole country once we implemented a price increase, which is slightly ahead of inflation.</p>
          <p>So all in all, well, this year is good news as opposed to last year, which was bad. But we will have to continue looking at the performance in the coming months, Laurie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is your pricing so far now all in place or there is more to go with respect to pricing this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The pricing that we've took, it's pretty much what we think is good for the whole year. But we will continue to monitor all aspects of the business competitive dynamics, raw material pressures, acceptance of consumer for the price increase we just put in place. So as any time we will look for more tactical opportunities going forward, but I would say that the big one is already in place.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have a question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on the results. Just want -- my one question would be regarding the amortization, you commented on the FEMSA Cerveza results that you had a positive impact of reducing the amortization of the ERP system, but at the same time the amortization goes up over one year after the other. So can you just comment how we can reconcile that and how much of an impact that had in the gross margin? And if you can elaborate also on the grain impact, I would appreciate it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Yes, first off, as we've informed in past quarters, we basically ended the amortization of the ERP and the increase in the amortization for the quarter, which is slightly above I would say more stable level, which would be maybe 6 to 6.5% of revenues now that being slightly above 7%. A part of it has a lot to do with the mix of volumes and the high growth of volumes we had for the quarter because as you know some of the contracts we had with some retailers, we amortized a component of the help or support we give to some retailers are driven by volume. So as volumes grows also that line starts to grow. And also, some of it has to do with kind of support -- special support we give in terms of fixed support to some retailers, the ones which are more collaborative to FEMSA Cerveza's strategy.</p>
          <p>And the thing with grains -- the question regarding grains, we have stated in the past that we have been or as anyone in the industry have been looking at severe high prices increases all across the board and we have stated that we feel comfortable with levels within Mexico of around 25 to 30% and in Brazil something slightly above 50%, and we think that as the year progresses we will be able to manage, I would say, slightly above those levels and maybe 3, 5, 6% above the numbers I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>We are not concerned looking at the perspectives of supply in terms of having problems with supply. We have guaranteed supply for basically all our needs for the rest of the year, and we are already working also in the longer-term into 2009 and 2010 in some geographies. But so far, if the perspective on grains has changed? It has changed a little bit to the negative in the last couple of months, but still nothing that changes in a dramatic way the numbers we've been sharing with you in the past, Andrea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And regarding Brazil, we saw AmBev increasing prices, and then I believe you guys also followed and the bottoms were very timid, and I believe also is going to happen with AmBev. Can you comment on if the other -- you see like the competitive environment getting better if the other brewers are also increasing prices following pricing after the summer, or if you gonging to take additional pricing in Brazil given that your cost pressures have been higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've increased prices late in the quarter in Brazil. And again, it's little bit too early to tell if consumer acceptance is there. As I said, Brazil was due to a low start for the year, a number of reasons for that. So I think we -- it will take at least a couple of months to really have a good read on what happened in the first quarter in terms of the different elements that put pressure on volumes. But most of the price increase that we were thinking of taking in the industry, I think we've done that more in the late first quarter. But as in Mexico, we will continue to monitor any opportunities that we may have. And in respect to the pricing dynamics on the rest of the competitors, I mean competition is as intense as ever, but I think that we are so far looking at kind of a rational behavior of the other competitors also in terms of trying to compensate on the pricing level partially, at least some of the pressure that everyone -- everybody is experiencing at least on the grain side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Robert Ford with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning everybody. Javier, I just wanted to get you to kind of expand on that amortization question. My understanding is that increasingly you've been moving some of the amortization of exclusives into selling expenses to provide more support to the trade and to see the big increase was kind of a surprise. What's specific number in terms of the amortization of ERP in both periods? And am I correct in my understanding that you are providing additional selling support, which you expense and there is a component, which is capitalized? I'm curious what other marketing expenses are also capitalized?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bob. This is Juan. On the amortization thing, you are right, we have been shifting as more of these point of sale are being opened and we have talked about how rent actually is playing a bigger role because in many of these cases, we are paying the rent for these -- for these outlets and that obviously flows through the income statement in real time. But at the same time, that -- it's the incremental that has been affected, but there are a lot of points of sale with whom we have more conventional agreements. And to Javier's point, the amortization component of the -- let's say the upfront discounts that are given and then are amortized over an average life of three years is that -- that continues to be a big part of the way that we interact with the trade that sells our brands on an exclusive basis in some cases.</p>
          <p>So I think this quarter it shows a little bit of a jump, but it shouldn't be -- you shouldn't expect this to be a new level of amortization, I think, is the main message. We can follow-up, I think, offline if you want in terms of exact numbers for any one of these -- on past quarters. But generally, the message is this is not a new level. It has to do with the volume peak, it has to do with the fact that a lot of these relationships are still based on let's say more traditional agreements and that's pretty much it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as I said, Bob, also depending on how the mix of not only volume geographically and SKU but also in terms of the performance of the retailers, and of course we have been more successful, as I have stated in the past, in order to align interests with some of those retailers as volume growth in those channels are higher than in the rest. But if you look at amortization as a percentage of revenues and if you look at, I would say, a couple of years or three years, 8% levels. And then as the ERP amortization finalized, we went down to something like 6.5 maybe. The quarter is slightly above that, it is a little bit above 7%. But as Juan is saying, this is not like this is going to start pick up going forward in a significant way. I would tell you that within the year, I would say that we will go back maybe to the 6.5 or 7 percentage once the year progresses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then, I'll look forward to getting <mark type="inaudible" /> detail offline. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Reinaldo Santana with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Javier and everyone. My questions relates to your comment when you talked about the selling expenses at OXXO that it is partly related to strengthening of OXXO's organizational structure. If you could expand a little bit more on these initiatives? And also, if you could comment on the magnitude of price increase that you implemented in Brazil late in the quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Reinaldo, how are you? We have also shared this idea in the past in terms of OXXO having a lot of projects in the pipeline not only for '08, but also for '09, and we have described some of those. One, which is going to the month, some incremental head count, has a lot to do with developing the capabilities and the competencies at the region and plus our city level.</p>
          <p>In terms of the replenishment capabilities, we are in the middle of rolling out IT solution combined with new processes in order to streamline replenishment capabilities all across the supply chain. So that is a project that will demand a number of people working head-to-head with the central office and the city plaza level guys in order to precisely build that infrastructure and those capabilities. That's a good example of how -- what do we mean by saying that we're going to strengthen the organization and bring more people into the company.</p>
          <p>Another big initiative, also which is now in the still phase of development and going into the testing, is the new point of solution infrastructure, the new IT solution for what's going on in the store level. And that is going to be a new-generation solution and it also will require by the end of the year to have on board a lot of people knowledgeable about the solution and with the right training in order to implement the solution in a speedy way into 2009.</p>
          <p>So those are only two examples of what we mean by strengthening OXXO's organization, and why we're doing that? We are basically doing that because we think that we need to continue to reinforce the very basic backbone of the business in terms of IT technology infrastructure and capabilities of the whole organization. And, I'll ask Juan to comment on the Brazil piece.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Reinaldo. On the pricing in Brazil, I mean, as you know, we basically are price takers or price followers in Brazil. We follow very closely the activities of the industry leader, and then we adjust based on that. In this case, we perhaps took a little bit longer in terms of getting a read first of what it is that they were doing. Obviously, in some cases, they moved one of their leading brands but not the other or not both, and we have to determine our price gaps what they are and what they should be vis-&#xE0;-vis both of these brands. But I think you can generally assume that it's inflation basically that we've taken, that we have now moved late in the quarter and that we're basically going to be following the trends of the industry leader.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning everyone. Congratulations on the results. I wanted to ask about Brazil, if you can give us a better sense on how to read this volume. I understand it may be a little bit too early to get a sense of what's going on with the volume performance, but wanted to get a sense whether when we look at the KOF numbers and when we look at this overall numbers for FEMSA, if you can comment a little bit on how we should read this? And also, if you are seeing in April a significant change of what you saw in the first quarter to try to a get a better sense of what's going on in the industry? And finally, if you can just follow up on the comments of the additional expenses at OXXO, if this is -- if you see this as reinforcing the infrastructure development that is going to take more people, is that more expenses on a one-time basis for this year or is that just more people on an ongoing basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Tufic. First on Brazil. As I said on the opening remarks, it is still a little bit, I would say, too little time to tell because of things, which are making numbers not that pretty much comparable. I mean weather had an impact, the timing of the Carnival had an impact, price increase of the industry was deployed in a different way. We're looking at the phenomena in Brazil which tells us that our consumers are having now, I would say, more options to, for example, buy durable goods as opposed to immediate consumption of consumer goods.</p>
          <p>We are cautious still to make a statement there in terms of if immediate consumption consumer goods are being hit by that or not. Definitely, the quarter had numbers, which were below our original estimates. And that's very clear, and I'm sure not only for us, but for everybody down there. And what I think, it is still a little bit too early to tell because, again, it is very, very tricky trying to put numbers on consumption of people because of timing issues on Carnival or on weather. So I think we will need to wait a little bit more going into the next two to three months to say if there is something going on down there different to what we are just describing. And what as you are pointing out right, is there is kind of a slowdown on volumes at least for the main categories of beverages in Brazil for the first quarter. And hopefully, we are going to look at that rebounding in the next months.</p>
          <p>In terms of the additional expenses for OXXO, these are projects -- what I have been describing is basically projects, which are aimed, as I've said, to reinforce the capabilities and the infrastructure both in process and in IT solutions for the business. These are not projects which are defined and programmed to take place on a one-year basis. These are basically projects that go all the way from 24 to 36 months from conception to really deploying it all over the close to 600 stores in Mexico. So we tend to look at them as incremental for the next couple of years. And we are going to build the base during the rest of the year. And we will, I will hope, maintain maybe that level into 2009. And then I don't have really a visibility to say if this is going to be a slope, which will be coming down in 2010 and that will depend a lot on the amounts of projects that we would like to put out there. Given the confidence that, of course, we are very, very comfortable with the value added and in terms of the value generation or creation that these projects are going to have for the business for the long term. We wouldn't be doing that if we didn't think that way. So, it's not like a one year and that's it, it's more like a two to two and a half on basically the two projects I just described plus another two or three which are not as big. And that will be my comments on that Tufic.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you. And is there any way you can give us a sense of what the performance of beer was between the KOF territories and the rest of the system?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The split in Brazil that we tend to look at is not that. I mean, we follow that. We look more in terms of the competitive dynamics. We like to look at the business compared with what's going on in the beer industry in Brazil. So we may have some one or two territories of Coca-Cola FEMSA, which are performing better or worse. I can say that there is not a significant performance, which can be explained by we being the distributors at KOF or having some of another friend bottlers doing the job. It's much more driven by competitive dynamics, the strength of our brands and things like that, Tufic.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question from Carlos Laboy, Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Carlos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your operators are doing a great job of creating shareholder value. My question is how are you and the Board of Directors evolving your thinking about the other levers that create shareholder value? What are the merits? For example, why a very aggressive share buyback program that would obviously be beneficial to the voting trust members and for all shareholders, why wouldn't that be more aggressively pursued?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sure Carlos. We have gone to the shareholders meeting, I don't recall for how many years, just to get authorization and to be ready to execute share buybacks programs if we thought it was convenient for the company by the time being. We have concluded that this have not been the case. And if you look at the company, at some point of times, and I will use 2002 maybe as a good example in which the company basically did not have any debt on the balance sheet. But all in all, in the next 12 months, we basically got something like 4 billion in debt because of the acquisition of Panamco and 30% buyback of the beer assets.</p>
          <p>So today we are basically at one time net debt to EBITDA, which is, I would say conservative, but still not so inefficient that people tells that because of financial structure considerations, it will be a good idea. We have been having a revaluation, I think, of the share and that is very good news I think for all shareholders because of the performance of the business and some of that re-rating we tend to believe because of more people understanding the special story of FEMSA being a different company.</p>
          <p>And for the time being what we have also, as in the past, just assured is that we have some flexibility to execute share buybacks if that is the case that we think would be more in line with creating shareholder value for the long term. And that has a lot to do with potential opportunities that we keep on looking from time to time and that we try to develop and foster. And of course, we are not -- we do not have the capability to say if some of those opportunities are going to materialize and when. So we will have to again keep some of that flexibility even though in the short term some people can think that we should be doing something else, believe me, we are taking into consideration things like share buybacks as a way to create shareholder value. But again, we are much more focused on having the financial flexibility to address market opportunities that we may have in terms of acquisitions going forward.</p>
          <p>So this is kind of a moving target. What I can reiterate to you, as we have said in the past to most of our shareholders, is that we are not a company, which would go into a highly inefficient financial structure for the medium term. If we find ourselves in a situation in which we cannot find good value opportunities for the long term and we are getting into territories in which the financial structure of the company gets to a highly inefficient point, of course, share buyback is an alternative as are some other alternatives, special dividends or whatever. So that will be my comments, Carlos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Javier, when you look at ImBev, for example, trading up what 15% in two days after announcing a more aggressive buyback or this quarter Anheuser-Busch getting all its EPS growth from share buybacks or even Modelo now talking about share buyback. I mean, it seems -- or all the food companies in the U.S., for that matter, it just seems that it is a very aggressive theme and a way of adding shareholder value and you're staying away from that. Does it worry you that you may need to look at this a lot more closely?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean I respect a lot what other people are doing. And you're putting in a same basket, I think, companies, which I would say have varied and quite significant differences in terms of managing shareholder value creation and using financial leverage to do so. I couldn't think of a more diverse universe of people as the one you just mentioned. But what I'm concerned really, Carlos, is again to have a good read on the probabilities to be able to allocate capital in shareholder value creation opportunities for the business that has a lot to do with acquisition, that has a lot to do with using the financial structure of the business to have a good cost of capital and to return value to shareholders. And if you look at the whole history of FEMSA at least in the past 10 years I think -- or more recently in the past three to four, I think that we have found a good balance in doing so. So our challenge going forward is to keep in mind, I would say, the concerns that you are expressing and at the same time putting them and facing them with the opportunities that we have still to make this a bigger and more profitable company. So, we're very carefully looking at what everybody is doing, but still we are playing our own game here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wanted to go back to the beer company, one clarification, you mentioned in the opening comments and I think I might have missed it, that there were some Heineken in the other revenue. Can you just confirm that and tell us what they were and whether they will be recurring in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Lore. Yes, the payment that we have got from the 10-year commercial agreement, which has a couple of payments all along those years, we will be reflecting those on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So the amount that we have reflected in the first quarter will also continue to flow on the second, third, and fourth and then it will lap going into 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, 2009 it ends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lore, we still get it except you won't see the incremental. Right? It's smoothed over the five years and then there is another payment equivalent. So basically you can assume that for the next 10 years that will be in place except you will only see it make a big difference this year during the four quarters. The exact amount is something that we haven't really disclosed, Lore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Understood. In terms of the raw materials pressured that you've described in Brazil and Mexico, how much of that is in the first quarter numbers and how much of that is yet to be seen into the second, third, fourth quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe half of that haven't already been seen in the first quarter, and that's the best guess I can have on top of my mind, Lore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So then the other question I have and my last question is, we saw higher pricing for your competitor domestically this quarter. And sometimes one quarter does not -- it can have wrong trends of their mix differences et cetera, but it was a pretty big difference. So I am wondering if you intentionally took a price increase below your competition, and if so would you sort of tap it up? I mean, some of it, I guess, may be timing because maybe you did it a bit later than them, but if my math is right, they did eight and a half and you did five, that's a pretty good gap. Can you give us your perspective on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Sure. No. I mean the price increases we took on average and we've monitored markets in order to make this statement. It is pretty much similar to the competitors. It's bigger in some cases and it's smaller in some others because of competitive dynamics. But the numbers in the quarter tend to be radically, I mean, different for the two companies as they were in first quarter '07 in which our competitors' pricing took a severe dip of around 4% and we grew 1%. So if you -- we see those comparisons taking those numbers out of the first quarter. And going into second quarter, my guess because of what we are looking at the market in both performance -- I mean the performance of both companies in terms of the pricing frontline is going to be very, very similar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So what you are saying is there is some differences in terms of the comparison in the first quarter but as you see it, both you and Modelo, put through something like 5%, and that's what we should think going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>And we'll take our next question from Alex Robarts with Santander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi everybody. Just back to the beer assets. One of the trends here is obviously Brazil pricing and you've made it clear that you are a taker and lagged some of the AmBev movements. But I guess it was the other piece that I was interested in which is the sale of the off-trade volumes going to the Coke system. Can you give us some color behind that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Sure, Bob. We're still, two years after acquiring the business and this is something very similar to our experience when we bought the Coca-Cola FEMSA franchise in 2003, we're still doing some, I would say, fine tuning on the both pricing architecture and the go-to-market footprint. And the explanation on the price change is due to change of sales coming from us going to bottlers, has a lot do with changes that we are still implementing in terms of how to serve better the modern trade. So in some cases we have been serving directly and that is Kaiser have been serving directly. Some change in some geographies basically on the modern trade.</p>
          <p>And as time has been progressing and we have been creating protocols on how to better serve those customers, we have been transferring some of that volume now to be taken care directly by the bottlers as opposed by Kaiser. And that creates the effect of now having a lower price per hectoliter, but again or now we are not incurring some of the expenses that we used to in order to serve those customers. That is basically the explanation behind the comment of the volume change, Alex.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you feel like you are at the end of the process or perhaps in the middle? I mean do we take this as kind of maybe there is going to be a slight downward shift in the selling prices now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are basically in the last stages of it. I mean, we have started as we took the business with very, very small actions there and we have taken in the last couple of years. But again in this first quarter, we took some decisions that I would say, not ended the process but we are in the final stages of that. I would say in the next couple of quarters maybe we will be ending that strategy, Alex.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And just to understand what I assume will be an interesting, let's say, rollout or new push into Minas Gerais as you have the infrastructure set up with Coke FEMSA in that state. Have we seen some of the spend related to Kaiser, Sol push there? Will there be one or will it just kind of be something that you'll go to and handle on a kind of on a rolling basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're saying in terms of Remil <mark type="inaudible" />, will Remil represent an increase in selling behind the brand? Is that --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, perhaps specifically will we see some spend associated with that whole territory and the brand rollout, that's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think the levels of spending behind the brand in Brazil, as you know, have been high for a number of quarters. We are very consciously deploying a good chunk of resources to both of our brands or well, to the whole portfolio. But obviously, Kaiser representing still a big part of the volume and of course Sol being the flagship to be, the levels of spending are high, but there is really no special amount that is being allocated to Minas Gerais. We do have high expectations for that territory this year in terms of bringing it into our own hands, but no, <mark type="inaudible" /> any change in the trend of SG&amp;A in Brazil because of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. A lot of that -- we have not held back any dollar or Reais of investment in Minas Gerais because this was not our operation. On the other hand, because of the incorporation of Remil we are sure that because of the focus we are going to have on that business in the short term even though we're going to have to make a lot of adaptations and changes to reflect Coca-Cola FEMSA's best practices and to capture the obvious synergies that exists in the territory just because of the focus that we're going to have in the territory because of this, we are confident that we may have some short-term boost of performance on volumes. But not due to the fact that we're going to put more dollars in terms of marketing or distribution capabilities or some things like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And just a very last thing is the admin expenses, sorry, in the beer assets noticing that 5% drop year-on-year interested by that and maybe could you give us some color behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean we talked about the ERP system, amortization being done and just general efficiencies. I mean the idea, Alex, is to continue to spend behind the brands, but we need to fund that with efficiencies in different parts of the value chain and the admin is one place where we're being able to get some of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And some of that also, Alex, is we've talked about that last year being a very tough year because of pricing, raw material and competitive dynamics. And the results of beer were not the ones that we at the beginning of the year imagined. So some of the efficiency programs that the beer business put in place last year, some of that is rolling into 2008 just because of the timing circumstances on when those efficiency programs were put in place. As additional ones are also put in place that is basically, some of the reduction in admin has a lot to do with streamlining parts of the organization at the beer business during '07 and now in '08.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you think these levels as a percentage of sales might be the more indicative going forward in beer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The levels if you look at absolute terms you may be looking at -- there are some expenses, which have something to do with seasonality also. But definitely, the trend of the expense would be coming down or at least growing significantly less than the volume or revenue line.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. Quick question on OXXO. You had been sort of guiding to, despite the fact that margins have been rising over the past year, 100 basis points or so, you had been guiding to maybe half of that for 2008. And I was just wondering if that was consistent with what you were telling us. I mean, if that already reflected the expectation of these additional projects so forth or do these projects we're talking about this morning lead you to be even more cautious on the expansion of margins for OXXO? And then, I would just, a follow up question on barley. You had been guiding up your expectations for barley costs at the same time that wheat prices are sort of tumbling down and if you could just reconcile that for me, that'll be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On OXXO, the answer is definitely yes, Jos&#xE9;. We're again factoring in, in our comments not only the effect of incremental spending because of the strengthening of the organization, and we're also explaining the effects on margins or a change in the way we register the new air-time, electronic air-time for phones, cards. And it's also, we are looking still at very robust performance indicators at OXXO.</p>
          <p>So we're continuing with our guidance of margin expansion at a fraction of past years. And we think we can still deliver incremental margin for OXXO in '08 even though we are going to put a lot of money behind some of these projects that I just described. And in terms of barley, at least for '08 and as the year progresses, of course we will have a much more certainty about the specific numbers, but by the way we negotiate prices, we feel pretty comfortable about the guidance, as we've been sharing. Also we tend to have at least in Mexico a couple of times and which we can secure the pricing and of course, the supply also. So we feel pretty comfortable that the agreements that we have gotten even though we are going to suffer, I mean, a very, very high price increase on this, the very important raw materials, we are now coming to a time and I would say that the end of the second quarter would level the rest of the story to be, for sure, 100% sure what the price increase effect is going to be in terms of the size of it. So we feel that the guidance that we have been providing to you is the one that we are going to be reflecting in the income statement for the future months.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask little bit about the traffic growth at OXXO and help us understand a little bit better. Obviously there was a big divergence in traffic and ticket. You helped us with an explanation on the ticket side. But in traffic, can you give us a sense for how much of --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Again, some of the effects that we have been looking and we are sure of that Celso just because of looking at this statistic of how many transactions we do to sell some products and what is the mix of those products. We are definitely sure that some of that traffic is being driven by now the ability of consumers to buy as less as 30% in electronic air-time as opposed as in the past of having to buy at least 100 -- I mean, not 30%, 30 pesos, but as opposed to the fact that in the past consumers had to buy at least 100 pesos phone card. So we are looking at thing or a phenomenon in which people are coming more frequently to the store. But they are acquiring at least when they buy time for their cellular they are buying less in terms of the amount that they are now buying, because of now having the availability of 30 pesos transaction. So, some of the traffic has been driven by that definitely.</p>

          <p>We will take our next question from <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you talk a little bit about CapEx for FY '08 and first quarter of '08? Also if you could go into where you see most of this CapEx being implemented and what percentage of it is maintenance and what is exactly expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The first quarter for -- I mean for CapEx was -- I mean at least basically always a slow start. We invested, if I recall correctly, something like <mark type="inaudible" /> million for the quarter. And we have shared that we have a program for something like $1.2 billion for the year. We think, I'm not sure that we are going to be able to exercise all of it. I'm sure that we're going to be able to exercise the majority of it. Basically, all the projects that have put into the CapEx for the year are projects, which we feel very comfortable at exercising, but there may be some things during the year that would make us to defer some of those, or like in some other cases, to anticipate some of those.</p>
          <p>So the whole idea would be to exercise those taking into account specific conditions through the year and that is the way the projects are being deployed, the timing of the currency exchange sort of situation, negotiation with suppliers of machinery and equipments which is huge. And so, I would say that our intention for the year would be to exercise, if not all, most of the CapEx programs that we put in place. And the number just been told here is $180 million for the quarter, which is a fraction only of $1.2 billion, but again, first quarter being all the time the slowest one.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Could you also go into where do you see most of this CapEx being implemented? And I'm trying to get a sense of what your level of operating leverage is and at what point would you need to Internet expansion CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. A number of these -- the number, if you look at, I would say, with the actual size of the company, I mean, the more stable number for CapEx will be more in the maybe $900 million. If you look at the incremental spending or investing in CapEx, a lot of that has to do with capacity expansion. And I am not only speaking because of the new factory, I mean, the new brewery and the new glass factory in Chihuahua that we are just starting to invest as we speak, but also we have capacity expansion programs in Coca-Cola FEMSA in Jugos del Valle and also some of the distribution in Mexico. So I would say that a good chunk of the CapEx for 2008 is pretty much destined to either break bottlenecks at some of our existing facilities or to build new brand, new breweries and glass factories as the one we just announced on the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
