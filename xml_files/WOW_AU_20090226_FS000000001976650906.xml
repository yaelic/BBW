        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for joining us today. I know that we are competing with a number of other very important companies for your time, so we appreciate that you've chosen to spend some time with us. You've obviously now had quite a bit of time to look through what we've got presented, so we'll endeavor to go through this fairly quickly and devote as much time as possible to questions. So between myself and Tom we hope to motor through this.</p>
          <p>This obviously is a very strong result and really is underpinned by both the activity that we've had over the past five to six years in investing in the underpinnings of our business and of course also the rejuvenation of our brands. So firstly, with BIG W and Supermarkets and of late with our brands in consumer electronics and New Zealand,</p>
          <p>We've opened a significant number of stores 122 and completed 190 refurbishments during the half and of course in those stores we've continued to add many new services such as optometry and hopefully create an even better shopping experience for our customers and clearly our customer account numbers in each of our businesses suggest that we're doing just that.</p>
          <p>We are very proud and happy to say that we created 9,000 new jobs in the first half, and our target will be to create another 7,000 jobs in the second half and all of this is being achieved in the context of us having very clearly defined strategies. Each of our businesses are performing to their strategies and a couple of them are obviously in, very much in transition and change mode and more importantly that all of us are being very focused on making sure that we keep our company in a very sound financial position, both to continue to fuel growth but also to make sure that any unexpected challenges that come up we're able to meet.</p>
          <p>The numbers there are self evident: sales up nearly 9%, EBITDA obviously a strong operating performance from the business up 11.7, EBIT up 10.2, net profit after tax 10.3 and earnings per share up 9.3% to $0.809 cents.</p>
          <p>Some of the highlights for the year and people in this room are probably very familiar with these, the rollout of the 2010 format is going well and truly at full steam and we continue to get both great sales and margin improvements out of this, but more importantly the customer feedback we get is very, very pleasing. We've got 263 at the moment, by the end of the financial year we'll have another 60. So we'll be about 40% of our store fleet would have been completed by the end of the financial year.</p>
          <p>Supply chain, we continue to invest. So particularly on the physical side we opened two new distribution centers, one in Melbourne, one in Sydney for liquor and they created 800 jobs, which was terrific. But more importantly the systems that sit behind it which is the great secret of our success in this area, we've deployed those into the liquor business ahead of opening the DCs so there is a nice marriage there and we are deploying them and just finished deploying them into the New Zealand marketplace at Christmas. And we're also doing a version of them into BIG W as part of project Quicksilver.</p>
          <p>Not sure, Richard must have put this slide together. The message here is that, we obviously have a much better ability to understand the behavior of our customers and line it up with what we hear to be their aspirations through our focus groups and our market research and as a result we can actually range, and format and price and promote in a much more targeted way and a much more tailored for each of the individual stores and clusters of stores that we had. And already we're seeing in our business that we can truly measure the benefits that we're getting from a number of initiatives that have flowed from that.</p>
          <p>Just one of those is on the next page where we have the opportunity with 2.8 million customers to actually talk to them on a regular basis through email at about a cent a time and give them offers not just for supermarkets and Big W, but for all of our businesses and these have been remarkably well received by our customer base.</p>
          <p>We announced prior to Christmas a unique alliance with another iconic brand, with Qantas; perhaps we didn't do a great job in really explaining what it is that's going to happen but in simplistic terms, if you are a registered member of our Everyday Rewards, that's the orange card that you collect presently, your petrol discounts and now you're getting these offers. When you this card, you will collect Qantas frequent flyer points, not just at our supermarkets but eventually across all of our brands. But more importantly, if you choose then to use a form of payment like a credit card, where you also get frequent flyer points then you're going to turbo charge it. So this is, a quick frequent flyer point, it doesn't require a credit card. It just means that you're going to swipe it, so you qualify for a petrol discount but at the same time you're going to get some points. And of course this will absolutely turbo charge our ability to get a lot closer to our marketplace. So we're very, very delighted with our partnership with Qantas and we believe that it will be really good for both us and for Qantas. Two iconic Australian brands that will both know a lot more about their customers going forward.</p>
          <p>Now credit card, I guess in the context I'm delighted with the progress that we've made with the credit card, it's actually accelerated since Christmas. We have won the award for the most innovative product for 2008 or 2009 from Money Magazine and could we have chosen the worse time in the history to have launched a credit card? Probably not, but given that context, I think that the team there and I personally am actually delighted with how we're going there. More importantly what I see is a book that's growing that is being very diligently and very prudently managed so that we actually have made sure that those that take up credit cards are actually those that can afford credit cards. So rather than just having a book that is full of problems for the future this is a very, very secure book particularly for our banking partner HSBC.</p>
          <p>This is one area that I'm very excited about, we're rolling out our new format, our Dick Smith stores, so Tandy aside and Powerhouse aside, the Dick Smith stores in last half, their comp sales actually were11.6% and I think the next best that I saw out there in the market place was 11.1% comp sales. And the 33 that we'd actually completed prior to Christmas of those Dick Smith stores, the new ones were significantly higher than that 11.6. So the customer facing part of what we're doing with the new brand format and the new promise is actually working even better than I hoped it would.</p>
          <p>Lot of work happening with our people in making sure that they understand they now have to be sales people, not just technical experts. We got a new price promise that means that people can be comfortable that they are not going to be walking down the road and getting a better price and certainly the big change has been the radical change in range, which has brought the challenges that we see in range, in margin, particular as we go a little bit further down the track. But there is no doubt there are significant cost benefits that we are going to extract from this business particularly as we move to one brand, so that the triplication of everything that we've got in the back of house will gradually move &#x2013; will eliminate, not eliminate but will merge the larger format Powerhouses into the Dick Smith brand that's happening now, it'll be finished by the half.</p>
          <p>We'll have about 80 Tandy stores that are usually in about 150, 200 square meters. On average they got about 18 months to go on their lease. Most, the latest one I think is about three years, and as they come we'll be looking for something in the 4 to 600 square meter range nearby where we'll put the new Dick Smith format, and where we've done a couple of those already, the results are &#x2013; we get several times what we were getting in the original store in term of sales. So we're very, very happy with it. Lot of challenges still, but we're very much on the same track that we undertook with BIG W when Greg commenced the change there and Julie has continued it. So going forward, I think we're going to have a really good business.</p>
          <p>In New Zealand, we're following the same path. We've continued our changes and at the end of the last half, we've finished the open heart surgery of all the systems, so they're now actually deployed and we're now de-commissioning the old systems. The team in New Zealand did a marvelous job in coping with a very challenging, economic environment in New Zealand and also having the heart ripped out of all of their management and operating systems. So we're now focusing on the front part of the store, and the early signs from our new generation Countdown stores are very, very promising and of course our property pipeline which was non existent, is now up to 17 new stores</p>
          <p>Okay, financial results. Here's our scorecard that we normally have, just a reminder that in first half of '05 we had some acquisitions benefit, same in 6, same in 7 in '08 we had some property gains that obviously are not reflected in '09.</p>
          <p>Profit after tax up 10.3 and EBIT up 10.2, more importantly the powerhouse of our business Australian Food and Liquor had a very, very strong half, up 16.8.</p>
          <p>Our cost of doing business down 31 basis points. When we take out the distortion of Petrol and Hotels, we still well and truly achieved our reduction of 20 basis points.</p>
          <p>Gross profit margin down a tick, obviously we had to absorb some Aussie dollar effect and also mitigate inflation, which we did in our stated inflation numbers internally versus the headlight number for the economy, there was a big gap there, and it was important that we actually showed some leadership there. But nonetheless, even after accounting for all that and the investment that we've made in price in a number of our businesses and BIG W being a key one there, we're able to manage to hold our margin pretty close to the 24% mark.</p>
          <p>I'm not too sure how many companies will be saying this over the next couple of weeks, but we will be increasing our dividend to $0.48 up 9.1% on last year and the payout ratio is pretty much on the 60% mark that we have been having for the last few years.</p>
          <p>Now to the Supermarket division, just a tremendous result, maintained our margin, reduced our cost of doing business dramatically; $1.2 billion, up 16%. Transition from Leon to Greg has been just seamless. Leon did a fabulous job in managing and leading our Supermarket and our Liquor business for a number of years, and Greg has moved into the Chair and the transition has happened without a blink of an eye. So the guys have done a terrific job there.</p>
          <p>Inflation, as we know was around 4.1 &#x2013; inflation was actually over 5 in November and December and it's actually come back to about 4.8 in January. So there are some good signs there to show that we'll have some better outcomes for inflation going forward.</p>
          <p>Petrol, key thing here is the liters. We live or die by how many liters we sell. I'm delighted to say that in a declining market our comparable sales volume for the half was up nearly 2%, which is great. So we have obviously grown market share and our EBIT has been steady at about $0.019 per liter, that's including the profit obviously we make on non-food items.</p>
          <p>Pay at pump trials internally have been underway and it seems to be working pretty well and we'll have to roll that out in 2009. And we've done a lot of work to try particularly with our new designs and some refurbishments to make our sites a lot more efficient in getting people in and out and we are reducing congestion, but also enhancing our non-fuel offer.</p>
          <p>In liquor, another really great result, sales for the half were $2.8 billion and Dan Murphy's and BWS and our supermarket group have all performed really well. Dan Murphy in particular has been an outstanding result for the half and private label has been a wonderful growth opportunity for us.</p>
          <p>New Zealand Supermarkets, challenging economic conditions and I won't repeat the comments I made before. We are $8 million down on last year, but I am absolutely in no doubt that this is a wonderful business for us going forward and we will continue to stick to our game plan. We haven't varied one bit from the moment we set the plan and we will continue to do exactly that. Perhaps the most exciting thing, of course, is that we have actually put the new generation countdowns down, two of them, and they are slight variations on the 2010c. And they are working very, very well and have been accepted by the New Zealand community really well.</p>
          <p>Cost challenges in New Zealand, we had KiwiSaver, which is the comp superannuation come in and youth wages moved to adult, and of course we started picking up some of the depreciation of the things that we'd just finished installing without getting much of the benefit at this stage. So a lot of work's happening there in each of our businesses, we have projects that are involved in business improvement in this particular area, a big focus on &#x2013; particularly on cost improvement and you'll see that over time we will actually reestablish this at a lower CODB going forward.</p>
          <p>BIG W, this is just a wonderful story. Three years ago this was the third biggest discount department store in the country. I remember a few people in the audience, not anyone here today but from your group, suggesting it was time for us to think about divesting BIG W, and we put forward a plan that some believed in, some didn't. I am here to say today that we've now moved to number one in terms of sales for department stores and growing particularly strongly. Following a wonderful competitive position of being able to reduce our gross margin and match it with the reduction in cost of doing business and seeing that EBIT in a very tough time for general merchandise improve by 10.5%, I think was a terrific result for Julie and the team. And once again a great transition from Greg to Julie.</p>
          <p>Hotels, sales have been tough. The smoking bans have made it tough for hotels. There's no doubt we're doing a hell of a lot better than the rest of the industry at the moment. We have cycled those now in November. We've seen the comp guidance sales from that time start to be positive again, so that's really good. The warmer weather we've experienced this summer counter-intuitively actually is not good for pubs. People tend not to go to pubs when it's really hot. But the important thing here is the guys have really worked well with utilizing such things as private label, etcetera, in getting the gross margin up, and also have worked very hard on getting the cost of doing business, although it went up, it had the opportunity to go up a lot more in this half than it did. So the guys there have done a fantastic job.</p>
          <p>Consumer Electronics, spoken quite a bit about this, but once again we've got a plan here, we have got a team that is focused on particularly improving the margin. Now that we've changed our product mix, we have to get a better margin, and already we're starting to see some good signs there. But more importantly, we have to reconfigure the back of house in terms of cost and there is lot of activity underway right at the moment there. So going forward over the next couple of years, you will see that the recalibration of margin and CODB for this business will change from what you see here before today.</p>
          <p>So we are down $11 million on last year. In the overall scheme of things Woolworths, it's not such a big deal, but for this particular business, it was a challenging half. We obviously had to <mark type="inaudible" /> gross margin take into account that we had to clear a lot of the old stock that were no longer going to be part of our go forward and in particular, we had to move to much lower margin products such as the large screen TVs etcetera. But the important thing is we've got the top line really motoring along now, particularly in the DSE brand and even in New Zealand, the DSE brand is really starting to motor at the top line so we've just got to tinker with it at the next two lines and we're going to have a great little business.</p>
          <p>In India, we're motoring along quite nicely there. The big challenge has been the last 18 months, the property market in India just got ridiculous so we had to slow down, our partner had to slow down the new store rollout. Over later months in chatting to our team in the last couple of weeks the price for retail property has reached more sane levels, so we should see that starting to ramp up again.</p>
          <p>And now, it's your turn to sing Tom. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I'll just take you through the balance sheet and some aspects of the cash flow and current views on capital management. In relation to the balance sheet, the total funds employed is up to 8.9 billion, that's primarily being driven by the increased or the additional CapEx that we've spent, we spent about 930 million for the half, just under $1 billion. Inventory is up about 8%, sales growth is up about 8.8% and I'll comment on that in a minute. And our net investment in inventory at 781 was impacted by the period end close which impacted credit result. I'll explain that in a minute as well.</p>
          <p>In terms of our borrowings our total borrowings have increased but it's just important that included in that borrowings number there is a mark to market of our U.S. dollar hedges in there of 341 million, which is offset in the hedge assets and liabilities line. So the net repayable debt is 2.4 billion and really reflects the CapEx spend for the period.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the cash flow. The period end, as I mentioned last December for those of you who can remember, a couple of you remember which is really nice to know that you remember what I say, have come &#x2013; were impacted by the period end close. So last December the period end close was, 30 December and this year period end close is the 4 of January. So that's a five day gap between the two. Clearly we don't stop paying our creditors because our year end shifts and that means our creditor balances were different between the two half year ends. So we've done a pro forma just on page 30 and that's the one I'll talk to.</p>
          <p>The impact of our creditors was to overstate creditors about 300 million plus last year and understates creditors about 300 million plus this year. So we have adjusted that in the pro forma and you'll see that there are cash provided from operations about 1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>The net interest paid is up 100 &#x2013; to a 124 million, that's up just over 10% and that's again really a reflection of the increased debt relating to the CapEx.</p>
          <p>The tax paid has moved for a couple of reasons. Firstly, there was a one-off deduction we took last year which reduced tax paid. And secondly because obviously the income levels were higher last year, the tax installments in this half were greater, plus we are expecting a refund in &#x2013; which is not reflected in that number in January or February. So that has meant that that tax paid number is a bit higher than normal.</p>
          <p>Our CapEx at 913 million which I talked about before.</p>
          <p>The payments from businesses is 98 million. And that's purely just hotel acquisitions primarily.</p>
          <p>And our proceeds on disposal of property plant and equipment. In this market, we won't be selling unless someone comes along with a really good offer, properties in this market. So the proceeds that we receive from assets sales will be down in this half.</p>
          <p>And the dividends received, last year we received a special dividend from the warehouse.</p>
          <p>So our free cash flow as a percentage of net PAT is around 67%.</p>
          <p>Just on the total year, we expect to be able to fund our CapEx at around $2 billion. Pay our dividend in accordance with our normal dividend policy subject to the earnings guidance Michael will go through in a moment, with only a small drawdown on debt levels for the full year and that's probably two to 300 million. So I think that's a really good position to be in.</p>
          <p>Average inventory days are flat at the top level. If you would exclude the indent, we are down 0.7 days. And we still at the operating businesses target one day out per year.</p>
          <p>Our shareholder payouts, that's really just our dividend for you, half year 588.</p>
          <p>In terms of capital management, the balance sheet remains really strong, and credit ratings remain at A- and A3 for Moodys. Our interest service cover is 15 times and our fixed charge ratio is 3.08. So our balance sheet and financial position is in a very good spot.</p>
          <p>We don't have to &#x2013; as I mentioned before, we don't have to refinance any long-term debt until 2011. We probably will be changing uncommitted to committed facilities in the next few months, just to strengthen our debt profile going forward, which I think in this environment is a good thing to do.</p>
          <p>Return on funds employed 17.51 and the return on equity is up a tick at 15. &#x2013; just over 15%. Michael?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom. At Woollys, we have some very clear short, medium and long-term objectives few of which are here today that we shared publicly. One is obviously, the performance targets that we set and we have a scorecard that we report on each half and the other one is our capital management objectives, which two of the objectives are obviously relevant to the audience here today. Clearly, we have other objectives on a more broader base that are more relevant to other audiences.</p>
          <p>To support that, we have two plans and we focus on one continuing to draw our core business, focusing on our customers. And then secondly, to continue to re-invigorate our CVP in each of our businesses over time and you see that there are nine individual plans that we focus on in each of our businesses, where it's relevant. And just to give you a taste of that, we've already talked about, how we are leveraging our supply chain expertise across the business. Private label is going immensely strong, our private label growth for Homebrand is running at about double the branded product and of course Select and others that are a little bit newer are growing faster than that again. And we still believe particularly in Select that we've got a wonderful opportunity to further go into categories, among the categories we've just going into of course salted snacks and we've gone in with a really innovative product. For those of you that haven't seen it, it's fat &#x2013; not fat-free, but it's the lowest fat chip. It's only &#x2013; we got technology from Japan. A small company here in Australia has we are partner with them to produce a unique product for this marketplace. In fact as I said it's only other place it's available is in Japan. So that's a great example of where we see in some of those major categories that we are going to go in and establish a true point of difference.</p>
          <p>Global sourcing, we continue to look at opportunities there and that continues to grow. This isn't necessarily replacing Australian manufacturing with overseas manufacturing. To a large degree, this is replacing the middle man with their own people and getting a better quality, better product. Both for products that we sell, but also for products that we use to build and maintain our stores, so fixtures, fitting and equipment, just about all but came from that market place, it was just someone else helping us along the way for a small fee. We decided that small fee would be better in the hands of our customers and our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Developing our customer engagement strategy, we talked a little bit about that before. There is no doubt in our mind that when we further extrapolate this into the buyer alliance that 2.8 million cards that are registered will dramatically increase. And of course, that will give us a far greater reach and a far greater quality database to really understand not just our customers in our supermarkets, but of course we'll be encouraging people to use this card right across our business. So, we will have a very broad view. And when we ally that to our credit card with &#x2013; that card is also used outside of Woolworths, then you can begin to understand that we are moving into a whole new era of really tailoring our business, based on information that presently, and in the past was not, available to us.</p>
          <p>Financial Services. Over and above the card, the switch has been an amazing success. We've put through a 0.5 billion transactions already. The system has been up 100% of the time, and it has operated at speeds that are just absolutely world class in the peak periods of Christmas.</p>
          <p>Pay @ Pump trials are underway. We had to launch midway through this year, and we've got some new products on the way. One that I am happy to share is a prepaid debit card for those that either have an aversion to credit cards or don't qualify for one. The convenience of plastic and some of the benefits that come with having your credit card will be available to those that personally don't have one. So, we think that we will have once again a product that will be a first in the marketplace for some of the attributes that we are planning to have with it.</p>
          <p>We also believe that we have market share and this is not a new tune to those here in the room. We believe that we've got wonderful opportunities to continue to grow in each of the markets that we are in.</p>
          <p>Lots of speculation in the media about things that we are doing, or not going to do. I can't wait to open the paper each morning to see what I'm going to do. But clearly we will remain very disciplined and open to any opportunities that come up, and at the appropriate time when it's important to inform the market, we will do so. But clearly, any delving for what that might be prior to that will be met with the normal straight bat. But clearly we're focused on that.</p>
          <p>But the important message that we gave the media today is that we're absolutely focused on our core business in making sure that we remain strong. We remain in a position where we can continue the momentum in our business, which is so important for large retailers, it's like the Queen Mary, you slow down, the cost in margin and CODB and human endeavor to get it started again, because I've been in it once before in Woolies, and I can tell you, never want to go through it again.</p>
          <p>So, in our own way we act just like the government. When we see anything happening with any of the KPIs, we apply our own little stimulus program, and keep the momentum going, because if you slow down, that was the important thing in consumer electronics, the BIG W when general merchandize was slowing down, the important thing was to keep the momentum going.</p>
          <p>We'll worry about the other stuff in the longer term. We'll take a little bit of a hit if we have to in a couple of the lines, but the momentum in retail business is &#x2013; large retail businesses is absolutely critical.</p>
          <p>It's one of the things that, in talking to the folks of the successful retailers, the large global guys, they just say, you know what, whatever you have to do, keep it going. If you let it slow down, you're going to pay for it. So, pay a little bit in the short-term to keep it going. Don't pay a hell of a lot more in the longer term if you let the thing slow.</p>
          <p>And we're going to continue to reinvest in our businesses, so refurbs and new stores, and brand rejuvenation, and new systems in particular. One of the ones that we're going headlong into is that a core of retailing of course is merchandizing systems. And we will, over time with the major project, replace our core merchandizing systems across our businesses with a new platform that is very much in keeping with what we will need to do.</p>
          <p>Particularly as we integrate consumer engagement data and information into all of our decisions. It's important that we have a platform that integrates them both seamlessly, and the way that we go about ranging and space management et cetera, et cetera will change over time as we introduce these new systems.</p>
          <p>So, the things that are cosmetic and we can sort of hang back on. We have decided to stay in business. We won't paint the trailer on the truck if we don't need to. We're going to wait, we'll hold back on that. But anything that actually has a return or is important for our strategic future in CapEx, we will continue to push ahead at a 100 miles an hour.</p>
          <p>And lastly, we still have a very strong program with new stores. What has happened, we've actually become, probably one of the larger developers. So, we've always been our own largest customer with Fabcot which is our construction company. What we're finding is a number of our long-term smaller developers, have found a little difficult to get credit. So, we've actually been working on various mechanisms to actually provide them with the seed capital so they can get started, so we don't delay any of these new stores.</p>
          <p>Obviously taking proper protection around our investment, and that has been working really well so that's meant that stores that may have not been able to be delivered over the next couple of years, are now back on track. And we need to do that because now that some of the larger opportunities with shopping centers with some of the property trusts probably will be delayed for a little while, so it's important we keep our own investment going so that we feel growth there.</p>
          <p>Okay, trading up-to-date. In the third quarter, first seven weeks, sales across our business have similar trends in each of our business to the first half in fact, they've actually strengthened a little. Particularly in the supermarket and liquor business, it really has strengthened. So, we are happy about that.</p>
          <p>More importantly, we have been very focused on making sure, should something really harsh happen, that we've got the flexibility to react pretty quickly in our business. Not that we anticipate that we are going to have to do that, but it's important to actually have the plan ready to go if it does happen.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, unless something is actually strategic or a safety issue or it can't develop or deliver pretty quickly economic benefit in terms of CapEx, we will delay it. And as Tom said, it's not a great time to be selling properties at the moment, so we will obviously have quite a bit more on our balance sheet over the next 12 months or so until yields return to something a bit more normal, and we will obviously move on there. We've got 57 new stores and 170 refurbs that we will complete in the second half.</p>
          <p>And finally the guidance, subject to the macroeconomic factors that we are seeing; factors such as inflation, petrol prices going up a little bit again, interest rates including the non-cash impact on certain discounted balance sheet provisions such as long-service leave, unemployment hopefully won't rise too dramatically, and consumer confidence levels.</p>
          <p>We are happy to &#x2013;  one reaffirm our sales guidance for the half, where we expect sales from continuing operations to grow in the single &#x2013; upper single-digits, excluding petrol. We are obviously the leaders, is the important thing from profit basis, on a 52-week basis and reaffirm our earnings, so we expect that EBIT will continue to grow faster than sales in this financial year, and we expect net profit after tax for this year to grow in the range of 11 to 14% on a 52-week comparative basis or 9 to 12% on a 52 versus 53 week basis.</p>
          <p>And with that &#x2013; pardon me &#x2013; we can open the floor to questions. Shaun as usual, number one.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, just in regards to Australian Food and Liquor...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just talk about the 2010 stores, the return on capital you are getting and whether &#x2013; and how you are seeing the pace of the return on capital, is it increasing, declining as you sort of move through your network?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we had &#x2013; I know you've asked several times before as many people in the room, we actually don't disclose the return on capital, but it actually has &#x2013; each refurb actually has to meet our internal hurdle rates,  MPV, Igovar et cetera. And if it doesn't do that, then it doesn't get done and every year we go back and we test to see whether the business has been met, and they are meeting it and exceeding it, number one.</p>
          <p>Number two, what we're finding is, because generally our business has been extremely strong, it seems as though all the moons are aligned, we are actually getting a turbo charging effect generally because Woolworths is a brand that is doing so well. So, we're actually doing even better again. So, usually you might find that, the early ones do really well, and then it sort of tapers off, well it's actually not quite doing that &#x2013; and had probably more to do with the macro effect because we obviously did the ones that we thought we'd get &#x2013; the biggest return on first, and then over time we will do probably the tail end. But I have to say at the moment it's probably more the general effect that just says it's actually going counter-intuitively, the curve is actually the other way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean, I guess maybe moving on Aussie &#x2013; Australian Food and Liquor is going, fantastic, but New Zealand's pretty tough. Could you just maybe quantify or give us some comfort around the degree of one-off costs in that business, if we're looking at what's going on in that business and when should we anticipate any sort of improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, without going into details, I have been very heartened by the sales trend in January, February. So, some good signs there. We have got the backend of the systems done. We've got the Home brand part of the private label done, but not all of the Select done. We have got a big refurbishment program to go and a new store program to go, and it was important that we actually did the first couple of refurbs in the new brand, the new generation countdown, which is basically a 2010c and test what happened with our sales increase which has been really good, our margin that we get and our cost, including the cost of doing the refurb.</p>
          <p>What we see says that we should push ahead, even though the economic situation in New Zealand is not the greatest, and even though the government over there clearly doesn't have the wherewithal that the Australian government has to actually add any external stimulus to the economy. We have a plan that we put together, some time back, we have been ticking off one by one, and we're going to continue to tick that off and we're not going to vary that plan. I think one of the great benefits we now have is of course, Greg now heads up Food and Liquor and he has &#x2013; how many years did you have in New Zealand?  20 years in the food industry in New Zealand. So, he actually knows all the history and knows the geography really, really well. So we've got an unexpected bonus by having a New Zealander heading up our Australian business now. Although you're an Australian citizen now, aren't you, that's right. Your boys going to play for the &#x2013; who are they going to play for? You don't know, ok. One of each I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in terms of consumer electronics. I mean, you guys obviously got a lot of work to do there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Why did you focusing on trying to improve that business when it generates a return on capital of around sort of 70%. Aussie supermarkets are generating something closer to 80%. I mean, shouldn't you want to be investing where you get the high returns and why do you want to persist with the business that has not generated good returns for you for a long period of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we are investing in the supermarkets as quickly as we can. So, it's not as if we've got things that we could invest in that we're not investing in, so it's &#x2013; Greg's team particularly on the change starting construction, refurbishment and systems and all the other things, they're running at 110 miles an hour. So, spending any more money in the supermarkets may be counterproductive. Once again, consumer electronics, I think both &#x2013; presently we've got a business that is bricks and mortars, but it's a multi-channel future in that area. And it is part of everyday life now.</p>
          <p>I've been a record as saying my kids would rather miss their food than not have a mobile phone. It's become their basic commodity of life. And we need to be in it &#x2013; and we just need to learn how to be successful over the long-term. So we are very successful for a long time. We've generated really good returns, but what we took our eye off the ball some couple of years back was the world changed, and Dick Smith didn't, and our customers told us and then when we went and spoke with them, they said, better get back on the train, so we are jumping on the train at the moment, but we've still got one leg on the station. But we'll &#x2013; Deborah's done a fantastic job, the senior management team there now is pretty much since Deborah's gone, changed.</p>
          <p>So, new merchandising, new store ops leader, new finance leader, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So, a lot of things that are happening in the background that I am not at liberty to talk about, but in the next half we'll talk about the things that have changed, particularly on the cost basis that will put us in a much better position, and some of the things that we're working on on the margin side that we know can be done a lot better, and we've seen being done a lot better elsewhere in the industry, and we think we know how we have to do that. So, do I like standing up here and saying that we're down by 20 plus percent? Absolutely not. Did we make the right decision to bite the bullet or just &#x2013; we could have just sat there and milked it for the next couple of years, but I want this business, we want this business to be part of the Woolworths family going forward. But we need to make sure we have a relevant brand, a relevant offer, which is just not bricks and mortar, but bit broader than that. And it needs to be very, very relevant to the consumers of the future. Phil, oh sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a question on New Zealand. I think you are up the third year now, and on the balance sheet there is about 2.8 billion of funds invested and if I want to get a 15% return on that, we're talking of 400 million EBIT, looks like it's 200. I just want to reconcile that. Would you comment that it's tracking according to plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This question has been asked before. We obviously got a great deal of other benefits that are not attributed to the EBIT in New Zealand. And we track those diligently and in fact I've got the latest report at the half. When I add the two together, I'm confident that we're heading in the right direction and we earn more than &#x2013; well and truly more than our cost of capital. So, we're heading in the right direction. And without quantifying it, the benefit we've got outside of New Zealand was in the same sort of ballpark as what we've got in New Zealand. So, it's a terrific benefit for us. Tom, do you want to comment anything further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's it. We &#x2013; you've got to remember we have the 20 stores. There was the buying term benefit on both sides of the order. And as we mentioned there is arrangements in place to give us some tax advantages. So, it's quite, in terms of achieving its, whack, we quite comfortable with that but as Michael said, we are driving pretty hard to increase the profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, every time in the Australian Supermarket business improves its sales that's just a beautiful thing for that little calculation. So, can we do a lot better? Absolutely, but this is not something where I'd look at and say we should not have done it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And where is the big driver, if I look at the cost of doing business just to isolate that, I mean it's lower than Australia, in New Zealand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the &#x2013; the whole basis of cost is different, of course, we had some kick-ups this year with Kiwi Saver and the youth rates. But clearly as we've input new systems we have an opportunity to review how we do the backup house and redeploy, which we will. And we are actively engaged in doing that with our people at the moment. And secondly, we know as we deployed all our stock into our business, that we had tremendous cost of doing business savings in our store because we weren't triple, double handling so we're already starting to see that filtering down to our stores although it's just early months yet and we continue to see that in our stores in Australia. And you get other benefits, of course, with improved shrink et cetera, et cetera because you're not losing, damaging product.</p>
          <p>And the next bit that will come is that we're working on the change in the distribution arrangements. So, we know that we can generate significant benefit there. We are starting early stages of primary freight and we know that there is significant benefit there. We don't have from our New Zealand partners tremendous inbound service levels at the moment. So, we are going to work very carefully with them as we introduce the direct link with them and move away from paper based forecasting et cetera and we move to the same platform that we have here in Australia that we will improve along with primary freight our inbound service level which will in fact also improve our in-stock and our sales and our all the cost as well, because you're not running around doing things other than selling product.</p>
          <p>All of that's still to come. So, as I said, we've got a very comprehensive plan, we know where the value will be generated. We just got to do it, but keep in mind that this is a business that we put under tremendous stress and change. So, we've got to be really careful we don't overload them with change because it's not as if we don't know what it is we have to do we just need to make sure we put them in the right sequence. And give them enough to keep them busy but not too much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then can I just ask one on the wider growth question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how the management team and the Board think about it? Market cap of 34 billion to make a meaningful impact from an acquisition perspective you're probably going to have to talk meaningful dollars, how does the Board weigh up risk versus size of investment, to make a decision &#x2013; to make a difference? And then I guess secondly onshore, offshore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You've obviously been sitting in our Board room. They are discussions that are generic to Boards anywhere and those key questions that you are asking are those that we've actually been through and we are very clear on what we will do and what we won't do. And at the appropriate time when we're ready to do what we are going to do then we will let everybody know that we're doing it. And then you can judge whether it was a good decision or not or whether it's going to be successful or not. But those from about May last year was when the Board actually signed off with &#x2013; this is going to be our approach and I talked at the full year about our approach, about being prudent, about the size of the acquisition.</p>
          <p>We do &#x2013; we back solved the mathematics of &#x2013; here's our scorecard, here's the sales we need here is etcetera, etcetera. This is what we think we can grow. Here is the GAAP. It's &#x2013; at macro level the maths are reasonably simple. Then it's saying, well, how do you fill that with opportunities by bolt-ons, by accelerating your growth in your existing businesses by domestic acquisitions or potentially acquisitions elsewhere? And there's a whole range of opportunities that we are thinking of, of late &#x2013; no shortage of phone calls in saying boy have we got a deal for you, but boy, have we got a deal for you properly has some hairs on it. So, we're being very careful.</p>
          <p>So, we're really focused at the moment and making sure that we don't get distracted by that. I know that the media gets really excited about, we're going to do this, we're going to do that, and we're going here, we are going there. Important for our team, we've got a small team that's working with the Board and the senior management at those opportunities, but for 99% of it, we've got to keep the main game going. And that's where our focus is. We got to make sure that we continue to deliver.</p>
          <p>And today hopefully you see that we've delivered. Couple of challenges, New Zealand, Consumer Electronics, but we know where we got to go, we'll get there. But the main game you guys are looking for consistency for being able to depend on, what we say we're going to deliver <mark type="inaudible" />. We set these targets for this half way before anyone told us that the globe was going to melt down. We didn't change them once. We just said to the guys, okay, we said, we're going to deliver this. We're still going to deliver it. The in &#x2013; the full year target, we set that way back then. We haven't changed that. We're going to &#x2013; we're working on ways of how we are going to deliver and we will.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Michael. Greg Dring from Macquarie. Hi. It looks like Richard's has been reading "Good to Great" because I love your loop and I've seen it before. But on that theme &#x2013; at least it's not a doom loop, eh? Okay, on that theme, can we talk about the engagement or participation in your direct marketing campaigns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, without being explicit are you getting, 10, 20, less than 50, greater than 50? How is it working and what's sort of magnitude of expectation do you have behind it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look the expectation, well our experience is actually in six and seven &#x2013; in terms of sales response, it's been amazing. So, we &#x2013; it's like having another business. So, part of the success in the Supermarket business at the moment and some of the things we are seeing in Dick Smith, et cetera, have been as a result of marketing campaign. So we are babes in the wood when it comes to it. We've got new analytical tools that are being delivered at the moment that will actually take us to the next level again.</p>
          <p>And that along with some of our consumer led ranging where we've actually changed the range in a number of stores, we've seen some really great benefits, but in terms of these, it's not 10 or $20,000 it's like &#x2013; and you've got to remember it's not just that direct one, what we're able to measure is <mark type="inaudible" /> sorry. On other products that are bought with that product that also attract people's overall spend with you over the longer period. And even if you discount that larger, that last one, and the second one by a huge factor, it's still a wonderful engine for the business going forward. And the guys from Tesco and that have utilized that very, very successfully over a number of years. And that's all ahead of us.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In December, I mentioned to you that the cost of your loyalty program went up with the introduction of Qantas Frequent Flyers, and your response at the time was, we'll cut some advertising or marketing or some primary activity also. Can you expand on where that elsewhere is? Are catalogs going? What are you going to do to fund the loyalty cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we spend money on catalogs, we spend money on newspapers. We spend money on other campaigns that are on free to air TV, on pay TV, on your mobile phone, on billboards, on trucks, in store with point of sale, et cetera et cetera. We've got a very, very large marketing bill. Now, as we transition, and you are seeing this &#x2013; the cost of sending out an email with an offer is $0.01. Cost of putting a page in the national newspaper is &#x2013; how much is it, Luke?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>80 to 90.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>80 to $90,000 to have in each of the major dailies around the country. So it's &#x2013; if you have a look at the way that others have done it, you know the number of promotions come down, they've become more meaningful. But there is a whole new relationship between you and your customer that happens down here that means you need to spend less here, more here. So there's a lot more brand up here and a lot more transactional things happening down here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the answer is, above the line, all media's the most expensive and presumably we might expect to see that diminish over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I have got no doubt that we will readjust the way that we spend. I wouldn't say that we are going to spend less. But certainly the conservations that Greg and I have had along with Luke is that this is not about adding a big lump. Now, when you first start, there might be a little bump, but over the long-term, it's actually about redirecting to a more effective spend.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just come back to the overall growth profile, I guess for the business. Are you comfortable that when you look at your internal opportunities, New Zealand, Consumer Electronics, things you continue to do with Food and Liquor that those opportunities continue to deliver the sort of double-digit profit growth over the medium term of company you'd be used to? And that you can do that maintaining the current return on capital while improving that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We obviously, have looked forward over a number of years and done all the sums, so the answer is firstly yes. The second thing, Grant, is of course, today we are talking about things that are in the public domain. There are lots of other things in our existing business that we are working on very diligently at the moment that we will continue to actually turbo-charge that and once again, at the appropriate time rather than signal to all and sundry, we'll, probably when we are doing it, we'll let everybody know.</p>
          <p>But Tom and Mark in particular, spend a lot of time looking at all the scenarios going forward, we look five very in detail and we look 10 in a little less detail and exactly the metrics that are important for a business like ours are those that we say how do we make sure that we meet those. So internally, we are very focused on those so today in this little pack we've talked about a couple of our objectives, but of course, we've got a much bigger book of things that we want to achieve as a business. And we're very aware of the fact that particularly our shareholders want to see that the money that they allow us to invest is actually getting a good return.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

          <p>Thanks for that. And just a question on the Consumer Electronics repositioning strategy. You've said that, I think if I interpret correctly, that this more ideal size of store there is sort of 4 to 600 square meters, significant change in merchandizing range. You've got a big tail of stores that are quite different to that, I mean particularly in the Tandy business, and at a lot of Dick Smith stores that are very, very small. So could you explain maybe how you're going to go about repositioning the store portfolio? And then I guess following on from that should we expect sort of a more prolonged period of change in that business before we see the fruits of that repositioning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There is about 300 and something 320 &#x2013; 340 odd Dick Smith stores, and the vast majority of those are actually 350 square meters or above. So we can deal with those, if we've got and we have short-term leases with these, with options. But we have the opportunity, particularly of late to actually move to slightly bigger premises just down the road. The larger Powerhouses will just become Dick Smith with a broader range and the ones that we've converted already are doing particularly well so Penrith is a great example of what we've done there.</p>
          <p>For the Tandy's, we've got 84, I think at the moment. Their average lease is 1.5 years; I think they go out to about three yeas at the latest. And some of the stores that we've converted to the new Dick Smith, where we've moved to a slightly bigger one from what was a Tandy in the same shopping center. The sales have multiplied, so not just gone up by a percent, but multiplied. So as those leases come due, we'll already probably change out there, identifying where we're going potentially go. We will move to two or three, probably three at the most, different size bands, so that will be the sort of smallish one for certain market places, where they don't support a big one, a medium size one and a larger one in key areas, so the larger one will still be part of the offer. But more importantly, everybody in this room knows that this category is a multi-channel category. So part of our game plan is to become a really good multi-channel retailer in this space, but we've got a lot of work to do there yet.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess what I was seeking to understand is as you go through that change program clearly maybe the store portfolio might shrink a bit, but the average store size might get bigger...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you &#x2013; can you retain your current level of profit through that period, as you go through that change or do you need to consolidate it back a bit further before you step up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our present indications are that we should not only consolidate but our plan should be that we can improve because we've got impetus in sales, and there are things that guys are working on in terms of our first margin, and our second margin and also our cost of doing business that over the next six months will, in fact is starting to flow into the business now so. I have to stand up here and God willing in six months time and say that there is a couple of lines as well as the sales line that have improved in this business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one final point of detail, just the gross margin drop we saw in that business, was that due to the run out of old lines and basically of the repositioning of the merchandize or was that some other factor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was, well, there were three things: there was the Aussie dollar, which was probably came more late in the half as we used the stock that we already had. It was the exit of a lot of the stock that's no longer part of what we do. So we had to sharpen our pencil on that lot. We got little bit to go not much, but broken the back of it. And the third one, of course, is you've got the big categories like gaming, like LCD T.V.s, etcetera, where there is not a huge amount of margin. You've got to be really smart at on-selling. So we've got quite a big program teaching our guys how to just don't sell a TV,  there's other things you can sell with it. And then, sorry, I've lost my train of thought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, three, there's one more. I'll come back to it when I remember it. But there was one other that was not as material as the others. But there are a number of effects that really just said that &#x2013; this is a change, it's a game-changing thing that's happening. Sorry, the last one, was quite frankly, everybody was out there fighting for their life so, my friend Jerry was out there fighting for his life, I'm not sure how the result came out for his sales and profit for the half yet, I haven't heard. But, Richard was out there and fighting for his piece and thankfully we have comp sales and DC were a little higher than his and <mark type="inaudible" /> but &#x2013; wasn't an easy thing to do. But it was a pretty hot market out there for Consumer Electronics, particularly going into Christmas.</p>
          <p>So, &#x2013; there is a couple of sayings I could use if you know what I mean, you're either in the game or you're we decide we are going to be in the game. And thankfully because we're part of a much larger business we can afford to take a little bit of hit in that small business to make sure we maintain the momentum more importantly in our business. You got to keep the enthusiasm of the &#x2013; people within Dick Smith are so invigorated by this new brand. They &#x2013; when can I have this happen at my store. It's just like the supermarkets &#x2013; Greg gets email after email saying can you refurbish my store? When can I get my new shirt with this on and likewise with big W, it's  &#x2013; they just &#x2013; when you give them a new successful brand, people just want to work there, they're proud, they just changed their whole attitude.</p>
          <p>And for us to wave the white flag going into Christmas saying we're not going to get into that game would be &#x2013; we may have made a bit more &#x2013; maybe we would have perhaps even broken even with the half. But you know what would have been a long, long time getting the confidence of people back that we're serious about being a player in this business. So, sometimes you've got to invest in things that you can't touch but after a few years when we're telling, I know how important they are &#x2013; confidence of the people that you know what you're doing and you are serious about being a player is so important.</p>

          <p>Hi, Mike. Can I just explore the gross margin in the Supermarkets business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Has been a few periods where it was increasing noticeably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now that's stopped in the first half '09. How should we think about gross margins going forward? And are there any other drivers, things like fresh, things like rollback, shrinkage that may boost gross margins going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look we will continue to &#x2013; private labels probably the big opportunity still for us and continue to &#x2013; particularly &#x2013; we are in &#x2013; if you take, select there is a whole heap of really big categories where we don't have a presence yet. We have got a really good presence in a lot of categories that are not huge, but &#x2013; and learning. So we had our first foray into nappies. And it was okay, but not game-changing.</p>
          <p>And we went back and changed the packaging. That itself was fantastic. And made it very obvious to the consumer that they were looking at exactly the same pack size and they could immediately do the comparison inprice and the quality. And it's a whole different ballgame again. So we have learnt that in a challenging category like nappy where you've got a really dominant player, that you can actually do some really good stuff. So there are a couple of other categories that over the next 12 months or so that you will see us appear in, that weren't the first choices, but they are big categories. So that's one big opportunity.</p>
          <p>In terms of fresh, we will continue to actually improve our margins so Deli, if I take as an example. We will probably see over time less footage to pre-sliced meat in the cabinet. Where you've got to serve it, so there's shrinkage and a cost to that and our Deli Express, for instance, where we have the same product but pre-sliced, vacuum-packed et cetera very convenient. You'll see a lot more of that and that's been really successful. Likewise, chickens that were cooked that were behind the glass as opposed to chickens that are cooked that are actually in the sealed bag. One, there are much better chicken, much more moist and secondly, the convenience &#x2013; you don't have to line up, get a number and all that sort of business.</p>
          <p>So  &#x2013; there are a thousand of those that over time will help us with that margin. Now, we will continue to reinvest in establishing and maintaining our value position in the marketplace. So rollback and all those and maybe a few other things that will excite customers may appear over the next little while. So, we think it's a great opportunity for us to actually deliver the best value we can going into Christmas, when the inflationary effect was pretty high. We actually took some pricing decisions that under ordinary circumstances we wouldn't &#x2013; we actually took a hit, but we were rewarded with customer traffic and sales and that's the important thing for us in the long run.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just then on the other side, the cost of doing business within the Supermarket...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Group. Few things, firstly there is a line in the accounts on the P&amp;L called administration costs. From what I understand that's above store level costs and that rose 11%, I just want to understand why that was &#x2013; had risen at a such high level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's on the Group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That was basically to do with some of our startup costs for our card, our Everyday Rewards card, our credit card and a few other areas that &#x2013; and of course, we've also got quite a &#x2013; we've got Martk's group that's looking at growth opposite &#x2013; opportunities. So we've got the cost of that. So there is no one big thing there. It's actually just things that are usually for the benefit of the whole group that we want to hold centrally. But we always take it to profit. So we don't say here is a one-off over here. We've actually taken a profit. We just take it out of there because it's actually in most -in fact just about all cases not actually to do with one particular division, it's something that we are doing for the whole Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the Food and Liquor business, obviously like-for-like sales were somewhere north of 6%. I assume like-for-like cost growth &#x2013; operating cost growth, is less than that. So there would have been a substantial degree of operating leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just trying to understand how large that was compared with the supply chain savings because they're &#x2013; they're somewhere in the order of 30 basis point improvement in CODB. Could most of that be explained by leverage and therefore few savings on supply chain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It was &#x2013; we actually do on regular basis what I think they call rainfall charts...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Waterfall charts...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Waterfall charts. Thanks, Luke. And we identify with both margin and with costs where it's gone up and where we've made savings. And when I look at the savings for the Supermarket Group, it's been pretty constant. However, I have to say that Marty and his team did a fabulous job in labor productivity over the last six months. So, full credit to Marty and the regional teams.</p>
          <p>But there are a whole host of, including supply chain, items that have all contributed to that result. So there's no one big bang thing that's happening. And of course we've had some &#x2013; on the other side, we had some things that &#x2013; of costs that we had to swallow, and that's okay. Maternity leave is a cost to our business on the top-line, but it's a wonderful investment. In fact, the net benefit to our business is fantastic; I think we've got nearly 900 women on maternity leave now that will come back, and in the past we would have lost a great percentage, probably about 38% of that talent, we wouldn't have got back. And now we've got right up to general manager that are coming back into the business, sometimes coming back part-time and sometimes coming back for a little while, have another baby and then come back again. But what it is &#x2013; so terrific about it is that we actually maintain that intellectual property and that, you know as I said to Grant, the esprit de corps that's so important to what Woolies is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The supply chain you mentioned, these boxes we've built and the technology we've got in them, are designed, and were designed, to fractionalize costs as volume goes up. So the more volume we put through these boxes, the more efficient we get.</p>
          <p>Nearly all of them have met or exceeded their business labor cost per carton, expect for Brisbane, which is the last one off the cabinet rank and one of the biggest . So just answering your question on the supply chain, that's exactly what we've built these boxes for and that's what the technology is for. And with increased volume, you don't increase your costs at the back of the store because the technology we've got with all our stockrooms is stock smart. So the whole thing starts to really on fire when we put volumes through and that's what they're designed to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That being said about Brisbane, I think I'm right in saying Jeff that the labor cost per carton is Brisbane is probably the lowest in the nation, or close to the lowest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the investment is fantastic. But we've set pretty challenging targets for these guys in terms of the metrics, but as I said Brisbane is already delivering the lowest labor cost per carton.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably, the only other question about the costs would be depreciation, which I think rose 18% in the first half, could I &#x2013; would it be right to assume that would even grow faster in the second half, given the CapEx so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the CapEx is up, it is about 1.4 or 1.5% of sales; it's up a bit from about 1.2, 1.3. That will continue to increase because we are investing in the CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's interesting, when you look at the CapEx as a percent to sales for global retailers, and whilst our is perhaps, let's say about in the low 3s, when you look at Wal-Mart and Tesco and others, it's 4s and 5s.</p>
          <p>So, some people suggested as a retailer we're putting too much CapEx in, but when you look at those that are winning out there at the moment, they actually invest a little bit more; and they're, depending on obviously the deprecation regimes in their countries, but correspondingly you'll find the deprecation load they carry a little bit higher.</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Going into the second half, you're slightly behind the April on the guidance, with your 10.3% net profit growth and I suppose the guidance we should be looking at is 11 to 14%, unless there is some arithmetic quirk there...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I know how it works. We set a range, and everybody goes to the top of the range, and if it's not at the top of the range, then we're behind the 8-ball. Our guidance is a range for the first half, and we hit it; our guidance for the second half is a range, and today we're saying that we're confident we're going to hit it. Where we hit it in that range, time will tell. So, giving guidance on the guidance is problematic, at the best of times.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we gave the range and we're very confident we're going to hit in that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What I want to know, though, is do you think the improvement in the second half will come more from the Australian Supermarket business; again doing extraordinarily well, and offsetting the lower growth in the other businesses, or is it due to an expected pick up in things like New Zealand and Dick Smith in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I mentioned, for both of those businesses, we got plans in place for business improvement on costing and margin on both of those. And both of them are showing in the first seven weeks, extrapolating that across 26 is always hard. But they're doing well in terms of sales. So they are up on their running rate in the first half. Our expectation is that we should see an improvement in both of those businesses, and that's our plan.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, yes, we want the supermarkets, and we want liquor, and we want Big W to continue to being the dominant players that they have been. So it's a combination of that and every now and again, there will be some things that might come; so, if we suddenly get a 2% drop in headline rates and the bond rate drops, then those that have large accruals for long service life et cetera you actually, under the accounting rules it's stupid to go ahead, but you got to &#x2013; you actually have to re-calibrate, and you know if that happens, then we will have to come out and say, "you know, subject to blah, blah, blah," but at the moment, you know, we've given the guidance and I'm standing here and looking you in the eye saying, "we anticipate we are going to hit that range." But it will be, we won't be solely reliant on the supermarkets to do that, although it would be big chunk of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just adding to that, Martin, yeah, when we did our contingency planning for what may happen over the next sort of 12 to 18 months, given the uncertainty around the world, a lot of the cost initiatives that we came across and really focus the business on, we've just starting to put those in place now. So we've managed the pot, as we call it to try and achieve the outcome. So....</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The half we've just done, is a comparable number of weeks 27 to 27.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Except for what you know the &#x2013; in terms of the cash, what Tom described.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, indeed. So isn't it fair to say that given that it's the same number of weeks for this half versus PCP that the guidance, really for this half, would have been 11 to 14, and then when we think about the second half when we've got a one week less; then that's when it's more along the lines of the 9 to 12.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't follow your logic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess, the other way to ask...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The guidance is for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I understand that, but given the guidance is 9 to 12 across the full year, and you actually achieved- even though you had the extra week in this half...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Retailing, actually, is not a 52 week, same week. You know, you got public holidays that you've got to pay for in certain halves, you don't have to in the other one, and they are very expensive for big companies like us when we trade and we have to pay people the triple time odd, for the business. So you can never go &#x2013; the average was this first, per week, and just multiply that out.</p>
          <p>I would never let our guys do that with the budget because I know what happens. And each of the businesses have a different profile across the year. So, most general merchandise businesses would discount department stores, and department stores would budget to make profit for certain months of the year, and budget to make a loss for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>In Big W, thankfully, we are now in a position where we make profit period-after-period. So, we sort of set ourselves a little bit apart from others, but you can't just &#x2013; I wish it was so easy to mathematically just do that, but it doesn't work that way, unfortunately. And so if you take the math &#x2013; the simple math that you are using and try and come up with that answer, then it will never work that way unfortunately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Also a question on gross margins. One thing that I think would help us work out where gross margins might go, particularly within Food and Liquor, is to get a sense of the difference, or how much more you might be earning roughly &#x2013; in rough terms, on the private label, relative to branded product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's material.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we &#x2013; are we talking, would it be as high as 10 percentage points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's material. Look, it varies by product, but it is material difference, otherwise you wouldn't go to the effort of doing it, but it is significant. And then if you think about it, all the costs that go with the brand <mark type="inaudible" />, big head office, marketing bills, dedicated fleets, all accounts departments et cetera, all that sort of stuff &#x2013; don't need it. So, you can actually deliver a better spec product, far cheaper, and you can deliver to the consumer a far better product and make a much better percentage and penny margin. So it's material, but we're going to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You're not going to say the exact number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, commerically, why would you do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; as a percentage of sales, clearly it's growing. You talked about it being, growing at twice the rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if that was of the rest of the business, or the rest of brand and business. In terms of total percentage of sales would you be over the 25%, Mike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's something we never disclose, and nor do we focus on, to be honest. We focus on repeat business by delivering great products, but percentage will look after itself. So we don't have a target number of products. We don't have a target percentage of sales. We actually are about delivering products that will cause people to come back through our doors again, because they've got great value, and the numbers will actually take care of themselves.</p>
          <p>So, I couldn't tell you what percentage it is at the moment, because I don't care to even know it. And I, well, twice a year when I come here, I ask, how many products we've got in Homebrand and Select, but I'm not sort of &#x2013; what I'm interested in, is every week there is a basket comes in the office with new products that I take home and test and hand out to neighbours, say tell me what you think of this. That's the important thing. And hence, why I look like the way I am at the moment, because they're pretty good products. I know everyone's keen to know those numbers, but one, they're not ones we focus on, and number two, even if we did, commercially it's not &#x2013; it's not a thing to be broadcasted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just in terms of some relativities then, is that &#x2013; would you say that is the biggest potential positive contributor to gross margin, in the context of some of the other things you've spoken about within the presentation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's one of them. It's one of them, it's up there with &#x2013; but it's not the sole one. It's certainly one of the big ones, yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>From ABN AMRO. A couple of questions if I may. The impact of the Australian dollar, falling as much as it has in the half, has that changed your thought process on your, sourcing yourself from overseas? Because, I'd imagine if, you know, sourcing through a third party, in effect gives you a little bit of a buffer room where you can push some of the currency, or the impact of the currency on to them. Direct sourcing yourself, you've eliminated that buffer room. So, I'd just be interested in your thoughts on direct sourcing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the face of it, what you said, you'd say absolutely, but in reality what happens is, even with the Australian dollar dropping, because you're dealing directly with the factories, you can actually go back and renegotiate, which we do. You can &#x2013; and they are very keen to see us, because the American and European buyers are suddenly absent, and now I think they may even be &#x2013; there is a rumour around that an Australian sourcing office for our retailer might not be around for much longer up there.</p>
          <p>More importantly, you can look at your shipping, so shipping costs have dropped dramatically. And in the end, the alternative is &#x2013; you've only got two alternatives. You don't sell it, because it's not manufactured here. You buy it from overseas, you buy it from someone else, or you buy it directly yourself.</p>
          <p>You buy it from someone else, you're not going to get exactly the product you want. And you're going &#x2013; he is going to clip the ticket. He or she is going to clip the ticket.. So you're always better off doing it. The alternative is don't sell it; for Big W, that's not a great alternative, or for Dick Smith, it's not a great alternative.</p>
          <p>More importantly, for a lot of products, we actually use the same factories that Tesco and Wal-Mart and others use. So that quite often we can just jump on &#x2013; change the plug, put a different badge on it, and we'll have that one, thank you very much. And without showing you, but I could take you around our stores and say, this actually is the Tesco product. This is &#x2013; someone else's, this is someone else's. So our team up in Hong Kong and Shanghai, have actually, all of them pretty much have come from Home Depot, Tesco, Wal-Mart et cetera &#x2013; Target, USA, et cetera, et cetera, so, Carrefour, some of them. So, the alternative is &#x2013; you don't want to buy from someone else, and you simply don't want to &#x2013; not sell it because we might as well shut the door.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Oh, look there are some that add &#x2013; if they add value, so in certain apparel lines, the reason that we've continued to use specific brands is that they have got some great design there, and they have actually got brands, iconic brands that mean a great deal to the Australian consumer.</p>
          <p>So, whilst a lot of its manufactured in China, whilst it's got Bonds on it, or one of their other brands, it's got a start-up, walk-up start in the consumers' mind. In some other apparel areas, they've got some great design houses that we could replicate with the great deal of expense, but we don't choose to at the moment. And they add, yes, it cost a bit more, but they add value. It's those guys that just, give you the invoice and add X percent, are the ones that we're cutting out.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us an indication, please, the first half impact of in effect your mark-to-market, with the change in the interest rate on your long service leave, I'd imagine on your, you see a granulation et cetera. Was there much of a cost in the first half and what are you, in effect assuming for the second half; similar sort of profile, or a radical change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We were lucky, in that we always had conservative provisioning around, the big provision is the worker's comp and public liability. And we'd always had conservative provisioning around that. And obviously, long service leave, whilst it's a much smaller provision. So we have, we didn't have to adjust significantly any of those because we had significant, sufficient provisions.</p>
          <p>However, in the earnings guidance, you will see that we've added in a comment that says if the bond rate falls, then those provisions will have to be written down, to discount with the drop in the bond rate, so there is nothing we can do about it, it's an accounting adjustment. The good side is when the bond rate goes up, I'll be dropping that out and back into profit. These are accounting adjustments, that flow through. You've seen some of the other companies report them. They have no impact on the business whatsoever, so...</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh no, we will drop it out and we will put it in the result and we'll show you what it is. We don't differentiate on that stuff, but we'll tell you what it is. But &#x2013; as long you, if you penalizes me the way down, you've got to give me the credit on the way up. This is, I'm expecting both sides of the equation.</p>

          <p>And there are &#x2013; our external auditors are sitting in the back around here, and this is clearly something that they watch very, very carefully, and they're comfortable with our treatment. And of course, as Tom said, we are probably over &#x2013; have been over conservative in our accrual in the past, but that's great because when times are tough it gives you that little bit of fat.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi Mike. Hi Tom. You mentioned you normalized the cash flow for your creditor payments and you said that there was a tax movement last year, compared to this year. But you didn't actually say what the impact of that was. Can you normalize what the cash flow would have been, had tax been &#x2013; had that tax benefit not come through last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd probably prefer not to, considering it's a tax payment &#x2013; tax deduction.  But it was a reasonable size deduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would your operating cash flow growth, Tom, had that been normalized to be in line with your EBIT growth, had that been normalized?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it wasn't that big, David, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Property profits, you mentioned you're not likely to sell any property this year, and yet you had $50 million of property in last year. In your guidance that you were thinking about when you gave the guidance in August, were you thinking that you would have been selling property at a profit this year? In other words, is your underlying trading performance better now, than what you were thinking back then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did have some profits budgeted, but we did the budget as Mike said back in March, April last year. So we had assumed some property profits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To be accurate, we actually had some properties on the market about the time, and from memory, Ralph, we got one just away before, just before yields went the wrong way, and thereafter that we just basically took them off the marketplace. So we actually had identified those products that we wanted to market this year, but we're just going to delay it, no point in giving them away because they're good assets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The profits in that would have been in your previous guidance but now they wouldn't be, but your guidance is still the same, is that right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's correct. Filled the hole, David, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Mike, there was one comment, I think Tom said it, but I wanted, and a lot of it's on your increased capital expend, but I think Tom said that this year, you free cash flow wasn't going to quite cover your dividend payments, which is obviously 2 billion bucks worth of CapEx does that to you. I'm just interested as to how long you're likely to let that continue, or how long will it be until we can expect the free cash to really start spitting out of the company rather than significant reinvestment in capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would expect the reinvestment to continue through FY10, David.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think FY11 will probably slowdown.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Tom, you'd be expecting that your free cash flow will still be a bit shy of your divvy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this stage. I mean, given the uncertainty of the environment we are in, but we do really want to focus on spending CapEx in our growth areas, you know, new stores, refurbs , the new business area &#x2013; new business areas that we're focusing on. So we're happy to pull it back on this stay-in-business type CapEx which doesn't really matter if you do this year, next year or the year after, but on those growth &#x2013; those growth investments, we really want to keep focusing on those.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on your funds employed having increased by 1.4 billion. I mean you probably answered this question, I mean if you have, then don't worry- you have increased your funds employed by 1.4 billion, so you're going very hard. Are there any signs that you might just want to pull back a smidgen given that we're going into very uncertain economic times?</p>

          <p>Not as yet. Part of that funds employed was impacted by the period-end close issue that I spoke about.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that's probably added 300 million plus to that number.</p>

        <plist>

          <p>But we are &#x2013; we don't do this blindly, David- we review where the trading businesses are on a weekly basis, and we make those decisions. So we are not going to be silly in this. But right now, as Michael said, the businesses are tracking very well. So at this point we  just continue with our plan.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just quickly David on the &#x2013; we do check runs month-end and weekly runs, and previous half finished on December 30. So it sort of missed end of month, and of course this year is January 4. So it got the end of month and it got the weekly run. So there's about, between the two over-inflated last year and sort of a hit this year. Combined, it's just short of $700 million in the turnaround. So that's why the normalized, or the pro-forma's there, to reflect the fact that we got a free kick last year, which Tom did bring to the attention of this room and this year the alternative has happened.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And just very finally, on consumer electronics, I know that that's been done to death, but just on your cost of doing business; I think best in-class in Australia at the moment is about 13 or 14%. You're obviously a way away from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Wonderful opportunity, absolutely. I would suggest that's an opportunity for us. We are not going to get there overnight, but it's a wonderful target to set your sail for, isn't it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I just wonder with the new store format, the ones that I looked at, I am just wondering whether you can get your cost doing business down to that level, and obviously that must be your plan, is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, one of the great things about this is that they are very interactive. So customers can actually get a lot more information about the product and touch and feel, without us having to go and open a locked cabinet to get out something, and then talk them through it. So, there is a lot of, more of self-service, and self understanding of product, than the present model.</p>

          <p>No more? Is there is any final question here in the room at all?</p>
          <p>Once again, thank you very much for your attendance here today, and I look forward to well-balanced reports coming out, with recommendations that are showing confidence in Australian retailing. Thank you.</p>
