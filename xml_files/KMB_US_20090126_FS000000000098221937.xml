        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David, and good morning everyone. We appreciate your interest in Kimberly-Clark. With us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Randy Vest, Vice President and Controller.</p>
          <p>Here is the agenda for today's call, Mark will start with a review of our fourth quarter results. Then Tom will provide his perspective on the results for the quarter and the year and also discuss our 2009 outlook. That will leave us plenty of time for Q&amp;A. Now for those wishing to follow along, we have a presentation of today's materials, including our 2009 planning assumptions, in the Investors section of our website, which is www.kimberly-clark.com.</p>
          <p>First, let me remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the call today. There can be no assurance that future events will occur as anticipated or that the company's results will be as estimated. Please refer to the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted operating margin. Management believes that reporting in this manner enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. For additional information on why we make these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, see today's news release and additional information on our website.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Mark.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike, and good morning. This morning's news release includes all the details of our results for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.01, compared to our previous guidance range of $1.02 to $1.07. There were a lot of moving pieces which impacted our results versus plan, so I'll start with a quick summary.</p>
          <p>From an operating standpoint, weaker than expected sales volumes, predominantly due to deteriorating economic conditions, were mostly offset by lower input costs and expenses. Looking at other key factors, we had a higher than normal level of other expense, which was worth 0.04 to $0.05 per share, and approximate $0.04 per share impact from weaker foreign currency exchange rates, particularly at our Mexican affiliate. These two factors were essentially offset by a lower-than-planned tax rate.</p>
          <p>Now let me get into the details of the quarter starting with sales. Overall sales decreased by about 3% to $4.6 billion, including a currency drag of 8%. Organic growth was solid at nearly 5% and was driven by our focus on improving net realized revenue, which led to a 7-point gain in net selling prices and an additional point of improved product mix. Total sales volumes were down about 3% and were impacted by a generally weak economic environment, particularly in North America and Europe, and our continued emphasis on price realization. A portion of the volume weakness experienced in the fourth quarter was related to customers and consumers reducing warehouse and pantry inventories. In addition, consumer trade down affected our market share.</p>
          <p>Turning to the top line for each of our segments, in Personal Care, sales were down more than 2%, including a nine-point currency headwind. Organic growth of more than 6% was driven by higher net selling prices up nearly 6% and somewhat better product mix. Overall, volume was even with the year-ago period. In North America, Personal Care sales fell about 2%. Net selling prices rose nearly six points due to benefits from price increases taken in the first and third quarters of 2008, partially offset by increased promotional activity, primarily in Huggies diapers, to match competitive activity. Overall volumes were down about 7% primarily due to results in diapers and training pants, including the impact of customer inventory adjustments, consumer trade down in diapers, and some category weakness in pants.</p>
          <p>Moving to Europe, Personal Care organic sales were off 3%. Overall volumes, including Huggies diapers in core markets, were even with prior year. However, net selling prices were down over 2% due to the continued competitive promotional environment.</p>
          <p>In the developing and emerging markets, although Personal Care sales were off 1%, organic growth was a strong 15%. Price and mix contributed more than ten points of growth and volumes were up 5%. Volume highlights included mid-teens growth in the fast growing BRICIT countries, double-digit growth in Australia and Vietnam, and mid-single digit growth in Latin America overall.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Consumer Tissue, sales were down about 3% including an eight-point drag from currency. Net selling prices were up approximately 11%, with solid increases from around the world. Volumes fell about 6% and were impacted by our continued focus on revenue realization, some category weakness and consumer trade down. In North America, net sales increased 3%, as higher net selling prices of almost 13% were mostly offset by lower volumes of about 10%. On the pricing front, we had strong realization from the increases taken earlier in the year.</p>
          <p>Regarding volumes, branded volumes were down across all categories. This reflects our focus on revenue realization, category weakness and some consumer trade down, particularly in Towels. In addition, the volume declines continued to reflect our decision to exit some low-margin private label business at the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>Switching to Europe, Consumer Tissue organic sales were up modestly. Net selling prices rose 4% due to increases in several markets, and product mix contributed another point of growth. Volumes fell by 5% in response to the price increases and category weakness, particularly in the UK. In the developing and emerging markets, Consumer Tissue organic sales rose 15%, driven by a 13-point gain in net selling prices and two points of improved mix.</p>
          <p>Moving to K-C Professional and Other, sales decreased more than 8%, including over seven-point impact from currency. On the plus side, our focus on revenue realization led to a 5% increase in net selling prices. However, sales volumes were down by more than 5%. KCP is feeling the effects of the economic slowdown, in particular in North America and Europe, where sales volumes were down high-single digits.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Health Care segment sales were up approximately 1%. Organic growth of over 3% was driven by higher volumes of 5%, while product mix was off more than 1%. Our higher margin Medical Device business had a strong quarter delivering double-digit volume growth. Meanwhile, Surgical Supplies volumes rose 3% led by double-digit growth in exam gloves.</p>
          <p>Now moving to operating profit and cost savings, and for this discussion I'll refer to adjusted operating profit and margin, which excludes certain charges and gains detailed in this morning's news release. Fourth quarter operating profit fell 10% to $629 million, with an operating margin of 13.7%. Profitability was impacted by cost inflation of more than $135 million and negative currency translation effects of about $60 million. Due to some moderation in pulp and certain oil-based costs during the quarter, the inflationary impact on our bottom line was somewhat better than our plan for the fourth quarter. And although margins are still down versus last year, I'm encouraged to see the 120 basis point sequential increase versus the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Despite the impact of inflation, we continue to invest in our brands. Strategic marketing investments increased by over $25 million in the quarter. Margins were also impacted by 80 to 90 basis points from planned production downtime we took in order to improve our inventory position.</p>
          <p>Now turning to cost savings. Total savings for the quarter were $34 million. Our ongoing FORCE program generated savings of $20 million in the quarter, that's despite higher spending in some of our facilities. In terms of the strategic cost reduction plan, we realized $14 million of year-on-year benefit in the quarter. For the year, total cost savings were more than $170 million. That's somewhat below our full-year objective of 200 to $250 million. We over delivered on the strategic cost reduction plan, but fell short on our FORCE savings for the year.</p>
          <p>Now let's look briefly at the fourth quarter segment operating margins. We delivered sequential increases in Personal Care, Consumer Tissue and in Health Care as all segments benefited from our focus on revenue realization and recent declines in cost inputs. Health Care margins also reflect a particular focus on cost reduction. Lastly, KCP profitability was solid, similar to the third quarter despite the volume pressures in that business.</p>
          <p>Now moving to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash provided by operations was $678 million, down 1% from the year-ago period. Key factors included lower earnings, a reduced level of accrued expenses, and a $50 million contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2008, mostly offset by lower tax payments in the quarter. For the year, cash provided by operations grew about 4% to more than $2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Looking at capital spending, we invested $253 million in the quarter. That brings full-year spending to $906 million. That's right in line with our plan. Regarding share repurchases, we bought 1.3 million shares of KMB stock at a cost of about $75 million during the quarter, bringing year-to-date repurchases to 625 million, consistent with the commitment we made in October. So that wraps up the financial review.</p>
          <p>To recap the quarter, we achieved solid organic growth driven by revenue realization. Sales volumes were impacted by the recessionary environment. And although margins are still down versus a year ago, we delivered sequential progress. Cash flow remains solid.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark, and good morning everyone. I'll give you my perspective on our results and our progress in 2008 and then I'll review the outlook for the coming year. My headline today is that we're managing through a very challenging environment. And we have a strong near-term focus on improving our margins and maximizing our cash flow. At the same time, we're doing what's right for our long-term success.</p>
          <p>Just to recap 2008, we faced a very tough external environment as economic forces caused commodity costs and currency exchange rates to swing wildly. And the rapid rise of oil and other costs in the middle of the year took a toll, even though we accelerated our price initiatives during that period. By year-end, inflation totaled $725 million and that compares with our original estimate for the year of about $400 million.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, inflation moderated in the fourth quarter as commodity costs tumbled from the highs they were at earlier in the year. At the same time though, currency exchange rates also plunged and that adversely affected our fourth-quarter results by more than $0.20 per share versus the fourth quarter of 2007, and really wiped out all the currency benefits we had realized for the first three quarters of the year. For the year overall, currency was negative 0.05, $0.06 per share.</p>
          <p>And then finally, late in the year, as Mark mentioned, we also began to see some consumers and customers scale back purchases in our categories in response to the economic weakness happening around them. So these unforeseen factors were primarily responsible for our bottom line results falling short of our objective for the year. Adjusted earnings in 2008 were $4.14 per share and that compares with our original target of $4.45 to $4.60.</p>
          <p>So regardless of the reason, there's no one at Kimberly-Clark that's satisfied with this outcome. And while we're working hard to overcome the near-term challenges facing us, we remain focused on the strategies that will drive long-term sustainable growth for Kimberly-Clark. As you'd expect, we're rigorously controlling discretionary expenses. We're driving costs out of the system wherever can. And we're focusing on improving our revenue realization.</p>
          <p>This focus contributed to a sequential improvement in operating profit margin in the fourth quarter, which gives us some positive momentum as we enter 2009. We are also paying more attention to cash flow in this environment than ever. So we're taking a harder look at capital spending, we're trying to limit our investment in working capital to make sure we've got a strong financial position overall. In this environment, I believe that strong cash flow is more important than ever. And I'm encouraged by that cash provided by operations increased about 4% to $2.5 billion in 2008. During this time, we also brought down our debt by more than 275 million during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, we continue to made good progress with our global business plan strategies throughout the past year, and this is most apparent in our top line performance as we delivered organic sales growth of 5.6% in 2008 and that's above the high end of our 3 to 5% long-term target.</p>
          <p>We continue to successfully pursue our targeted growth initiatives with notable gains in the developing and emerging markets and in higher-margin areas like the Safety business in K-C Professional and Medical Devices in our Health Care business. We also continue to build our capabilities in marketing, innovation and customer development. This enabled us to bring innovative new and improved products to market and further enhance the competitive position of our brands. In fact, we increased our investment in strategic marketing by about $95 million in 2008.</p>
          <p>We also successfully completed our strategic cost-savings program as of the end of the year. This was a significant multi-year effort that our teams executed extremely well, with lower overall cost and cash outlays than we originally anticipated. Even better, the total savings from this plan are on track to reach nearly $400 million, and that's well ahead of our original target.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to the outlook for 2009. The collapse of global financial markets has precipitated significant changes in commodity costs and currency rates and resulted in a high level of volatility and uncertainty in the current business environment. Meanwhile, although commodity costs have fallen dramatically since mid-2008, the related weakness in foreign currencies along with higher pension expense will be a significant drag on our 2009 results.</p>
          <p>As noted in our news release, the increase in pension expense in 2009 is equivalent to about $0.34 per share or more than 8 percentage points of earnings growth compared with 2008. In addition, projected incremental currency transaction losses could further dampen earnings growth by as much as 5 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Based on plans in place, we expect to generate sufficient improvement from other aspects of our business operations to substantially offset the negative effects we're going to experience from pension and currency. As a result, adjusted earnings per share in 2009 are expected to be similar to 2008 in the range of $4 to $4.20 per share. In light of recent trends, adjusted earnings per share in the first half of the year are likely to be down versus 2008 with improvement expected in the second half of the year. And more specific details about our 2009 planning assumptions are included in this morning's news release.</p>
          <p>Our plan for 2009 assumes no improvement in the external environment in the near-term, with gradually improving conditions later in the year. And we're encouraged that commodity costs have fallen from their highs they achieved in 2008, and that should help us improve profitability over time. Plus, as of today our cost assumptions appear to be on the conservative side.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind, however, that a number of factors could cause consumer demand or net selling prices for our products to change unexpectedly or result in further volatility in currency exchange rates on our input costs. So we'll carefully monitor economic and competitive conditions and adjust our plans as appropriate to make sure we can deliver the best possible results in this environment.</p>
          <p>The strength of our marketing and innovation programs are vitally important to ensure that our brands provide a great value to consumers. So expect us to continue to invest to build our capabilities in these areas. And we will continue to support our growth initiatives and further build our brand equity with higher marketing spending. So we have no plans to cut back on these key investments.</p>
          <p>And meanwhile, we will be disciplined to strike the right balance between volume growth and profitability. At the same time, we'll accelerate cost reductions and drive efficiency in every aspect of our operations to improve our competitive position wherever we can. In particular, we'll go after sourcing and supply chain costs more aggressively and we'll align our compensation and benefits with the current economic environment and with our own performance. So overall, we're focused on maximizing our cash flow and maintaining a strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>To summarize, although it's become more challenging to predict our results in the near term, we'll continue to do the right things for the long-term health of our businesses and effectively manage those factors that we can control. In short, we'll continue to focus on executing our global business plan strategies, which are designed to build strong and enduring brand franchises.</p>
          <p>Our Kimberly-Clark teams around the world are committed to improving their underlying business performance. And we're confident that we'll emerge from this challenging period stronger than ever and that we have the right strategies in place to drive sustainable growth and deliver shareholder value over the long term.</p>
          <p>With that, thank you for your interest today, and now we'll be happy to begin to take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. (sic) [Ms.] Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Lauren.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm Mr. Lauren Lieberman.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We weren't confused, Lauren. We knew who you were.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lucky me. I want to talk a little bit maybe about Europe. I know in the release the way you guys wrote it talked about economic weakness in Europe. But frankly I thought volumes held up really quite well there given the news flow seems to be a lot worse than that and I would have expected maybe there to be evidence of more trade down in Western Europe in diapers and in tissues. So can you talk a little bit about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean I think we probably saw less of the inventory correction in Europe. But Europe had a weaker third quarter, as you might recall. So they might have gotten some of it a bit earlier. Obviously, it's still a competitive environment. The UK in particular is a very important market for us. We've seen a lot of buy one, get one free activity particularly in diapers from our primary competitor, and we haven't matched all of that. And so that accounted for a little bit of our volume weakness in the quarter. But other than that, I mean we were down about a point in tissue across-the-board on share, down a similar amount in diapers. So I'd say again in this environment, we're not going to declare victory or anything, but I'd say we're holding our own.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think one of the reasons maybe, just thinking out loud, is that private label is already so well established in Europe versus in the U.S. where it's sort of in incremental change the consumers are making as they feel cash strapped, but in Europe it's sort of already a known entity and maybe not that much of an opportunity for consumers to trade down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well certainly for tissue that's true. Private label shares in Personal Care in Europe aren't that different than they are in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay and then just since you mentioned it, on the trade destocking in the U.S., I was a little surprised, or I'm curious maybe I should say, at how much it could be given how bulky your products are, high-turn categories and so on. I mean, is it a week or two and then kind of done? I wouldn't expect there to be much more trade stock that could still happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think there's a couple of things happening. First of all, we said it was consumer and customer. So I think you also saw some consumer pantry destocking. If you look at, for example, the Nielsen's Three outlook data for bath tissue and towels in the fourth quarter, I think bathroom tissue, the category was down 5.5%. Towels, I think the category was down nearly 10%.</p>
          <p>And so I think what you're seeing is a phenomenon where, obviously if the consumer runs out of bathroom tissue, mom's going to the store, but she might not be buying the big bundle pack, especially late in the month. So they're going to be buying the smaller count packs. And we're seeing much more responsiveness to the consumer around lower price points right now, because they're conserving cash and they don't want to build any household inventory.</p>
          <p>And things like household towels and facial tissue, which are a little more discretionary, if you run out at home, it goes on the list but if you're out a paycheck, it may wait until the next purchase cycle. And so, you saw that in some of the underlying consumer categories, particularly the ones that are bit more discretionary.</p>
          <p>On the customer inventory front, whether it was consumer customers, KCP customers, everybody is just really trying to run inventory tighter. And so in some cases, it's not even a week. It's three or four days. But at the margin, everyone is trying to conserve cash and run their inventories tighter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you think the de-stock for KCP, was that similar, that's similar to the consumer business? It would be sort of a pretty short-lived one-quarter adjustment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the question's going to be what happens in the economy. So you saw in the fourth quarter some of the inventory destocking expecting things to get worse. And as you just look and see how the economy unfolds, certainly some of the news that was out this morning isn't good for employment. So we'll just see how this gets. I think you may start to see more of the impact of the actual economy slowing down affect KCP volumes early in the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you so much.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with the Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I want to see if I get this right. So it sounds like you guys are sort of conceding that you're being somewhat conservative on your commodities outlook. But you're throwing the caveat in there that maybe you're not being so conservative on pricing. And I don't know if I'm reading that right or not. I'm wondering if you can give a little color. I mean how would you rate your conservatism in your pricing outlook versus in your commodities outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess what I would say is I try to think about we've got three, at least three big moving parts: exchange rates, currency costs and selling price increases. And we try to look at all three of those together and make sure that our assumptions roughly hang together. So you could point at any one of them and say, gee, that one looks conservative. But if you changed it, you might have to go look at some of the other ones and say does that have any impact on the other assumptions?</p>
          <p>And so the question would be not so much whether you'd roll the price increase back or would you have to spend more promotionally, would you have to do something different on coupon values if you assume that you're going to have lower commodity costs for an extended period? So we think in total those assumptions hang together. And we try to be transparent on them. And I'm sure all of you will judge whether we're conservative or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. And I just wanted to also get a sense on your assumptions for oil at 70 and gas at 7 or 8 and particularly pulp at 740, I mean is there something, is there some particular reason that you guys are forecasting it that way? Or is it just because obviously they've been such a slippery thing to forecast in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's maybe even less scientific than that. When we rolled the forecast up at the end of December, we did probably planning assumptions in early December, and we looked at what the futures market side and that's what we used. That's what we typically do every quarter. And so you can see that level of volatility. If you looked out in some of the late '09 futures in early December for oil, you still saw things in the upper 60s to lower 70s.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. That's helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And for gas, we're hedged probably 70% of the year at this point with a little bit more in the front half and a little bit less in the back-half. And that's at pretty close to the rate that's in our assumptions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That's helpful. And just one other quick thing on pricing. So I guess you guys are saying plus 2 to 3 for the year, and I know, I guess some of your pricing will roll up after Q1. But can you kind of give a sense sequentially of how that's going to flow considering the run rate was so high at 7%? I mean is there an assumption that you're going to see rather significantly negative pricing as you get to the back half of the year or is it smoother than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we had in the consumer markets in the U.S., when we had pricing in some of our categories in February, we had I think fem care was in May. We had some things that happened in August and September, and then facial tissue was later than that. So it'll kind of break through the year as those roll off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you are assuming, is your pricing assumption assuming that any of the pricing that you've taken actually rolls off at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean other than the things that we've talked about with diapers of doing some pricing count changes, which are pretty modest in the scheme of things.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of quick questions. One is just alluding to the last question. The second half of the year hopefully better than the first half. And yet the price increases, unless there are some this year, will roll off. Are you basically anticipating a more than offset of that from higher volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we'd expect to see a better volume environment in the back half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then could you talk a little bit about the balance sheet, in particular the shareholders' equity? If you look quarter-by-quarter, it really fell off. And I know you guys are buying back stock, but it normally would not fall off. But specifically it went from like 5.6 billion at the end of the second quarter to 5 billion at the end of the third, to under 4 at the end of the fourth. Could you just, maybe Mark can tell us what's going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm kind of a rusty old accountant, but I'll give you my insight and then let Mark answer it in more detail. Two big factors are the change in the pension obligation. It goes through other comprehensive income and hits stockholders' equity. And then the other is the translation effect on the balance sheet of foreign currency swings goes through UTA. So but, Mark, I don't know if you want to add any more detail to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's great to have a boss who's a former accountant. That's spot on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so I guess that sort of is inferring, because if you made a rough assumption and said, and I know everybody had a rough year last year, in the market it would look like if the 4.6 billion in assets went down, say, 25%, and you're paying out the normal 300 plus million in benefits, that actually the shortfall could have grown, I guess, I don't know, to 3 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well just, yes, you'll get all the pension stuff in the footnotes. I mean the pension swing was roughly 700 million, I think, and the UTA swing was roughly 900 million. So that should come pretty close to reconciling your stockholders' equity I think for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And then the last thing is you mentioned the hedge being about 70% gas. Do you hedge any of your oil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, because almost all of our oil is secondary. It's adhesives, it's packaging material. We do, probably the only one that comes close is diesel, which is a direct pass through. And we don't hedge it at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So one way of looking at your outlook is that this is sort of an insurance in your pocket a little bit, whereas maybe the U.K pound being a bit weaker than what you've assumed, it would go the other way and hopefully it all evens out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Chip, having come into the last four years thinking we had inflation figured out and it always did things we didn't expect. I don't know which pocket it's in. But it feels like we tried to call it the best we could. And again all these assumptions together we think are linked and makes sense. And so we think this is a pretty realistic plan for us.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ali.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple questions. One is, if I look by segment, this is I guess your first quarter since roughly '04 that consumer tissue is showing kind of improvement in margins. On the flipside, this is the third quarter in a row where Personal Care is actually showing negative margin change. How should we think about that given that you had been certainly most recently leaning more and more in Personal Care? How should we think about that going forward? Are you switching strategies, for example where you're spending? Is it all really just commodities and pricing that are coming through? Et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, first of all I mean Personal Care margins have hung in there around 20%, give or take, for a while. And so I'd say if you look at what happened to them in the fourth quarter, they probably took a little bit more downtime that affected them. They still had the impact of not getting their price increase fully effected as they had to spend back on some of the larger count packs to meet competition.</p>
          <p>In tissue, we got a little bit more benefit from the lower commodity costs flowing through in natural gas and in pulp and distribution costs. So I mean we were obviously very focused on realizing more revenue in tissue and took a little bit more volume risk and needed to get our margins back above 10% and hopefully headed higher than that here in the next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Ali, keep in mind that the Personal Care margins were lower in the third quarter and improved sequentially from 18.8% to 19.9 in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. On the -- you mentioned downtime and being a little bit more aggressive on pricing. I mean you look at 5% organic growth, which is good obviously, 7% pricing, negative 2 volumes. You guys addressed the pricing question just before. But that algorithm obviously has effects that you've mentioned which is on downtimes, a little bit of margin pressure certainly as you do that. And now in the context of, as you guys say, fine-tuning pricing and promotional plan, and I'm always concerned when people say fine tuning because I don't really know what that means, how should we think about the effect on your margins from downtime from volumes going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I think as we go into this weaker economy, I think we'll just have to see how it goes. Our goal is to make what we sell. So if the categories are declining, we will obviously have to take adjustments in our production schedule to account for that. It's not our goal to go into the year losing share in any of our key categories. So we're certainly going to try to make sure we're competitive on shelf and have got a fair share promotion and are spending strategic marketing money behind our innovations. We've got a good innovation program coming in '09. So we would expect to drive volume behind that. But if the consumer continues to be weak and if retailers continue to pull back on inventory, we'll have to make adjustments in our production schedule.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And two real short quick ones. On the FX side, the top line this quarter was about negative 8% as you say in the release and you mentioned earlier. If you then go to your bottom-line impact, it was certainly north of that, so minus 11% once you kind of roll in both translational and transactional. So 1.25 roughly amplification between the top line and the bottom line. Is that the ratio we should expect going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the big swing this quarter as we talked about in the third quarter was Mexico, and the impact of the U.S. dollar debt, and the pretty market depreciation of the peso this quarter, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I exclude Mexico it's still, my 11% on bottom line this quarter is excluding Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that the transactional amount is going to be more difficult to predict because it's going to depend on the level of hedging and which market we're able to hedge and what the currency does in that particular market. So we had a bit more than normal this quarter than we've had in prior quarters. But that one is going to be harder to predict going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But is there going to be at least an amplification between the top line and the bottom line on a sustainable basis? Is that how you're structured?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well what I would say, again it kind of depends on the market. If you look at Europe where we don't have very high margins, then sometimes the translation impact hurts you a lot worse on the top line than it does in the bottom line. Other markets like Korea and Australia, which have seen probably some of the biggest devaluation, where we have above company average margins, the translation impact is pretty significant for us. So it's a difficult question to answer.</p>
          <p>But the currencies that matter the most to us are the Mexican peso, the Australian dollar, the Korean won, the UK sterling, and the euro. Not necessarily in that order. But the ones that have a bigger impact on our bottom line are the peso, the A-dollar and the Korean won.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last quick one on just other expense line. Clearly higher this time. What should we expect on that? It looked like you were playing a little bit of catch up. How should we expect that? We note that it's 0.04 to $0.05, and in the release you say it's normal. You haven't been normal recently. So how should we think about that, and what's really in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think it's 4 to 5 million was the number that should flow through there, as opposed to 0.04 to $0.05. But this quarter there was a bunch of stuff that happened late in the year. We had a, we mentioned the litigation settlement that happened in the last two weeks of December. And we had an issue in Brazil that went the other way, that was positive near the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>So there was a number of things that happened near year-end that flowed through there. And collectively it wind up being a much bigger negative than we were expecting. But there wasn't any judgment on any of those. They happened and that's where they get recorded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I'm trying to get a little more sense of the volume trends. Is there anything you can say, I guess, separating developing and developed market trends as you kind of moved through the fourth quarter and into 2009? Did you see just kind of a flat table down trend or any sort of shift?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say in emerging markets the core volume in category growth held up better in the fourth quarter. I'd say, it's slowing somewhat but still growing. So whereas I would say, most of the categories in the U.S. were negative, flat to negative in the quarter. So certainly you're seeing a little bit of slowing in emerging markets, but there's still pretty robust growth there for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to give you some numbers around that, Gail, the organic growth was strong throughout, and there was perhaps more pricing that made up for a little slower volume. So when you look at developing and emerging markets in the fourth quarter, organic growth was 14% and for the year it was 15%. Now there's again different components there. Price and mix were stronger in the fourth quarter than they were for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I was just trying to get a sense of volume trends and I guess the extent that inventory, the pantry destocking issue, if you're past that or is that something that's continuing into '09 looking at the sequential trend?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you look at them sequentially, the only category where private label did not go up was facial tissue. If you look year-over-year, it's similar trends, but not as many categories where private label share is up.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. My first question has to do with your pricing outlook. Assuming you're not planning on rolling back any pricing in the U.S., I'm actually surprised that the target for the year, the 2 to 3% increase, isn't higher because I would have expected you to take pricing overseas to offset some of the devaluations. Are you not doing that?</p>

          <p>Well, the calculus you're looking at overseas is, if you look at last year, you had very strong currencies and very strong commodities early in the year. And so, from a local currency standpoint, because the currency had gone up so much, they weren't actually seeing a lot of the cost input. And now you've totally flipped it around where their currencies are weaker, but the commodities are weaker.</p>
          <p>And so everybody is going through that calculus market by market as to, has the currency weakened more than the commodity costs? And is there a need for pricing?</p>
          <p>And so I think the encouraging thing in the fourth quarter was we actually improved our margins just a bit in developing and emerging markets. So even though the size of the P&amp;L is changing, we're trying to improve the shape of it as we go through this big swing here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So in a market like Brazil today with the devaluation having been as sharp as it has, you haven't taken significantly more pricing down there, let's call it over the last 90 days?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We took some pretty healthy tissue price increases in Brazil this year, which was a big factor. Now that you see pulp weakening, the question will be how much farther can you push that value equation in what's happening in the local marketplace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got it. And but fair to say that even with private label having gained some share here in North America, Wal-Mart hasn't called and said, hey, you got to roll back 5 or 10% of those price increases you took in '07 and '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that all of our customers are sensitive to what's happening in the commodity cost environment. And they're trying to make sure they understand the consumer value equation. So we're watching our elasticities better than ever in terms of where does the consumer trade down? Is it absolute price point? Is it price per unit? What is the critical variable and try to get that right and get the right packings and distribution to really make sure we've got a relevant offering on shelf.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And with that in mind, the planned downtime, the negative operating leverage, I think you said it was 60 basis points in the third quarter, 80 in the fourth quarter. With inventory levels, I know you don't, you can't really tell what inventories are at consumers' pantries, but given what you know about where inventories are today at the customers, at the retail customers, what should we be looking for in the first quarter from a kind of "planned" downtime hit to margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you should expect us to be aggressive in continuing to manage our inventories down. I mean our absolute inventory was relatively flat. But when you look at the sales decline, it winds up, our inventory metrics weren't where we wanted them to be. So we're going to continue to watch and see what happens with our sales and with the first quarter and take more downtime if needed. It could be as much or more as we did in the fourth quarter though.</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning.</p>

          <p>Good morning, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Quick question, sort of follow-up on all the pricing, you're talking about not taking the list pricing down, but going with some more promotional price points. So can you talk a little bit about the discussions you have with retailers in terms of, are they comfortable in this environment sticking with more of a high/low pricing strategy? And I guess is that the understanding that you don't want to take the list prices down if oil does run back up? Or can you talk a little bit about how they feel about having this big price gap, on-shelf price versus promoted price? And how that plays into their private label strategies as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean I'd say first of all, if you look at margin of our segments, even at current pricing levels, we still haven't fully repaired margins from where they were several years ago, particularly in consumer tissue. So the fact that there was a big swing in commodities, if you look back over three years, we've seen kind of consistent margin decline and we're finally starting to get some commodity relief where we can get margins back to where they were three years ago or close to it.</p>
          <p>So that's sort of the nature of the dialog is that we're, yes, commodities have pulled back, but we never got full realization of the commodity cost increases on the way up. And so that's sort of where the discussion starts.</p>
          <p>And then it's looking at what is the right promotion strategy? What is the right pack count by channel? And what are their objectives? What are their private label strategies? And so, I would say changing list price is a very blunt instrument, that there's a lot of other things that you do from a marketing standpoint, on a strategic marketing standpoint before you got to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you feel like there's pretty good agreement between yourself and your customers that as you said there's a couple other instruments that you can use before you just simply go ahead and lower the list price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the biggest instrument is innovation. As we're bringing more news to the category, for example we rolled out a new improved Kleenex Ultra facial tissue. It's much easier to couple a price change with a significantly better product in this market. Then the consumer gets it, the retailer gets it. And so, as we've got very robust innovation plans in '09, part of that justifies the value that we're bringing to the retailer and to the consumer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so not to beat a dead horse, but you feel like the retailer understands that concept and agrees with you at least at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean because they're going to stand up and say, gee, what they really want is to be advantaged. So they'd like you to lower their price and leave it the same for everybody else. Right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because in the end if you take price down, you're just taking dollars out of the category.</p>

        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it hurts their same-store sales. So it is more about what is the relevant value you bring to the consumer? Do we have the right level of innovation? Because if you look at the super premium segment in a lot of our categories, it's actually held up pretty well in this environment. And so the areas that have been picked up by private label tend to be the lower end of the category.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think about 70% of the pension expense increase hits cost of sales and the balance hits SG&amp;A. I think Mark and company are all nodding their heads. So I think that's about right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. On the P&amp;L, I understand where the transaction expense is going to hit. So when we get to your quarterly segment breakdowns, after you have the operating profit by segment, we've got other unallocated in charges. Which of these three sections is going to get the transaction expense? Or does it go into the segments themselves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think to the best we can, we'll try to put it into the appropriate segment. And where we can't, then it'll wind up in unallocated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Also in the quarter in this segment section, charges went to zero for the first time in I don't know how many quarters. Is that a reflection of the ending of the restructuring? Or were there charges and gains that were offset in that particular line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well basically we wrapped up the restructuring program within the fourth quarter. I think we actually had a small gain on the sale of an asset that offset some of the remaining charges. But we've completed the charges that we're going to take against the competitive improvement initiative program with the fourth quarter of 2008 results. So we'll continue to talk about the benefits as those continue to roll out through the end of 2009, but then we would expect to have that entire program behind us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So in that, I guess it was an expense of about 54, 55 million for the full year. Does that essentially, excluding maybe one-time items, go to zero in 2009?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So just, I was curious just a little bit about K-C Professional, the volume decline of I think 8% it was in North America, it got worse since last quarter. Can you remind us, I don't have in my model, what the volume decline, what the worse point was like after 9/11? I mean can we expect this volume decline to get a lot worse? And also is it in the tissue part or is it in the non-tissue more equipment type stuff that you're doing in KC-Professional where you're seeing the declines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we saw some softness across the board in K-C Professional in the quarter. A lot of it was inventory pull back. But then some of it is just fewer people working. So you're also seeing end-users really pulling back on spending and carrying less inventory in their operations as well.</p>
          <p>So if you go back to 9/11, I mean my recollection was, which is a little rusty, was that we saw double-digit volume declines for a period. But it was shorter and sharper and it came back quicker. I think, we'll see what happens here, I think we're preparing for this to be a longer, deeper recession than we had the last time.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about this idea of getting your tissue margins back to a more historic norm. And obviously you have some commodity relief coming through. How should we think about your willingness to perhaps maybe give up some volume in order to drive tissue margins back towards the teens, which has being kind of the multi-year average? And kind of as a tangent to that, where do you think your private label tissue competitors stand in terms of generating adequate margins to get adequate returns on invested capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it really depends across the board. If you look at Europe, which is probably the biggest private label market, it's probably one of the lowest tissue margin markets in the world as well for everybody. So our margins in Europe aren't where they want to be. I mean SCA has a lot of public information around. You can see what their margins look like and they're a big tissue producer on both the branded and private-label front.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., I think if you look at the big commodity costs, I think we buy pulp as cheap as anybody does. I think we're buying natural gas, and our distribution costs are pretty similar to everybody else. We get some scale advantages because of the size of our assets. We typically are in the premium end of the segments that we operate in, and that helps us as well. And so those are all the things that we focus on as we go forward.</p>
          <p>If you look at some of the other big players, I mean Georgia Pacific Coke is obviously pretty highly leveraged in this environment still I think from their acquisitions. Some of the smaller private label guys as well. So we'll see what happens. I think the big question is what's pulp going to do in this environment? And we'll just have to watch that and see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, if you think about oil staying down in the 45 range and pulp going lower than your 740 number, under that type of scenario, are some of the private label competitors in coke in North America levered enough and have felt enough margins destruction over the past few years that perhaps you wouldn't see the price points go down? Or is that too optimistic a thesis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well even if you look at tissue today, a lot of the promoted price points haven't gone up yet. So there's been list price change at the shelf. But what you're seeing is not full reflection yet promotionally across all channels of the selling price increase. So and we're being competitive as well. So it's not everybody else and not us. We're all I think trying to find where this is going to settle out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just trying to get a little more clarity on the transactional impact you guys have highlighted from foreign exchange, upwards of $0.20 a share. And trying to separate it out between what, if I understand it correctly, are things like Kimberly-Clark may go to a balance sheet issue and translation and maybe more of a P&amp;L issue in other markets where input costs in dollar terms have sustained higher because of the devaluation. Could you give me maybe just a little more color on that $0.20? What's kind of behind it? Is it more the inputs on commodities in dollar terms that are up, or is it more balance sheet driven items?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a mix of both. Maybe Mark can give you a little bit more color on that but.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think one of the things we've highlighted is we've had a great run of our business. We've generated a ton of cash in Latin America. And there's some markets that we're planning on pulling cash back to the U.S. in 2009. So we've called that out as something that's a little different year-on-year. Transactions is basically buying commodities in different currencies than we're selling in the local market. Some of those we've hedged and some of those either we can't hedge or the exposures are so small that we don't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, places like Korea and Australia for example, the currencies have fallen farther than most of the commodities have fallen. And so you'll see a bit of an income statement transactional drag there. But then we'll also have some balance sheet exposure coming out of Latin America where we're going to try and bring some cash out.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then in the other markets like Korea and Australia, you're talking about basically a gross margin drag from the inputs not falling as fast as the currencies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It looks like you had a fair amount of pricing now in your D&amp;E markets. Are you holding pat on the pricing, or are you looking to potentially take more as the industry is probably experiencing a similar dollar-denominated commodity impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's going to be a market-by-market event. And part of it is you're also seeing some slowing in some of the more developed emerging markets. So as you look at places like Korea and Australia, as those economies slow, your ability to take more price there is probably pretty limited in many categories. There will still be other markets though where you're able to get price to offset higher commodity costs. Markets like Vietnam, where they've had huge inflation, I mean everybody has taken price just to keep up with the inflation in the local market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you would describe it as an industry wide or category wide phenomena, as opposed to you guys specifically, because you're based in U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean I think every multinational is going to be facing some element of this. As you look at what happened to commodities and currencies in the last year, it's a pretty unprecedented amount of volatility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, all right. Okay. And then just on your destocking comments, North America in particular, how do you differentiate between destocking and channel shifting, because you said it like Nielsen data, which is obviously the unfavored channels in this environment? Are you seeing a similar level of category slowdown in some of the more value-oriented channels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you looked at an estimate of the all-outlet, that would moderate the Nielsen category declines a bit. But you'd still see some net decreases across the board. So and I also think some of the, really every customer is looking to run with less inventory. So you're seeing across every channel customers looking to pull back on inventory levels.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, can you just talk a little bit more about the pace of sales as the quarter progressed? I mean was October great, November soft, and then December got terrible? I know you kind of called it out. And then another question along that is, how much of that is related to lack of credit for some distributors in emerging markets? And then kind of what you're seeing in sort of January-to-date in terms of order levels? Has it bounced back because the credit markets have unfrozen a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean I guess I'd probably decline to give you monthly sales data. I'd say typically December is a bigger month because it's got more shipping days in it than November. That was the case again. I'd say in the U.S. on diapers, we were probably a little weaker early in the quarter because of some of the competitive promotion pricing that was happening in certain channels that we responded to in December. So things picked up a bit from there.</p>
          <p>In January, it's early days yet. So we watch daily sales. I'd say all signs are the economy is not getting better but I can't say that it's getting progressively worse either at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you sort of separate out the difference between consumption declines and destocking? I mean has destocking gotten less back? Because if people have four or five days of inventory, I imagine out-of-stocks would be becoming a pretty big problem?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I mean a lot of retailers have a January 31 year end, so they're obviously very focused on that's when their balance sheet date gets measured for their working capital metrics. So I'm sure you'll see them push that hard to try to make sure they have their balance sheet looking the way they want it before the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then if you look at, what was my question, operating margins in Europe this year, I know it'll be in the 10-K but I wonder if you could give it to us now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They'll be down. So basically, we're going to probably wind up giving back a good bit of the progress we've made over the last several years in the restructuring with some of the impact of what's happened in Europe this year. So I mean I'd say if you look at the shape of it, all our businesses are profitable there. We generated a lot of cash in Europe again this year. But it's not as profitable as we'd like it to be overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that like you said should probably help the currency transaction piece as well, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It should.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For the margins. Okay. And then I was just looking at your currency assumptions in the footnotes, and it looks like everything is sort of realistic with spot prices except for the real and the pound. Is there any magic to the 1.59 pound estimate? That's a big business for you guys. And then if I look at the real, it also assumes, I think it's at 0.43, and you guys are at 0.48 in your assumptions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean we set those all the same way as we set the commodity costs. So you kind of look at when we set this stuff up in early December before rollup of forecasts at the end of the December, that's basically where the forwards were for all those rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'd say in the last six weeks the pound and the euro separated a little bit, and I think it's just a reflection of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We continue to look at it and it's one that we never get right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And nobody else does either. And then just lastly, so the $300 million of input cost deflation next year, that's net of currency transaction, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that's basically taking those, how much of each of those commodities we buy and pricing it at its U.S. dollar equivalent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Can you talk philosophically about pricing and volumes? And you've talked about continued focus on price realization, but concede there's obviously some economic sensitivity. And you've obviously been aggressive on price. So as we've seen with the volumes, there is some response. And I just want to know, are you comfortable with this heightened level of mid-single digit or high-single digit volume declines given that you are losing some share and consumers are trading down in light of the economy? I understand the destocking, but what if it's more and more persistent than that? So maybe just talk about, in general, volumes versus pricing. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure, no, I mean our goal is not to lose share in key categories. And so, the question is how long and how far do you have a, if you lose a share point, how quickly do you have to work to get that back? And if you look at our planning assumptions for our businesses for the year, we're really not assuming we're going to lose share in any of our key categories.</p>
          <p>And so you do it with innovation, which we have a robust innovation plan coming forward in each of our major businesses. So that's a key element. But you also have to keep an eye on what's happening with the competition and make sure that you're competitive. But we're trying to do an even better job of understanding what consumers want in this type of environment because they're conserving cash, and making sure we get the right promotional offerings that fit their paycheck is a key element of our strategy as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say given that most of our premium competitors have followed, and there even has been some private label movement on price, you're not going to see big, big shifts at this point in time between unit volume share and dollar share.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Steve Mackie with EverKey Global.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's actually Fred Searby with EverKey Global. A couple of quick questions. One, you had I think it was an $0.08, a pretty big hit from Kimberly-Clark de Mexico, which is obviously non-cash related to the dollar debt, a translation. And what are you assuming in your guidance for '09? Because that would flow off the Mexico peso will be the hit there. It seems like a big swing factor even though it's somewhat deceptive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think Mexico is assuming a relatively flat year overall with some of the decline in peso translation year-over-year being offset in progress elsewhere in the business. I think we're pegging the peso for the year at around 13, and so that would actually assume a little bit of appreciation from what we saw at the end of the year. So obviously that's something that we'll have to watch closely. We've probably got a little bit of downside there if the peso gets appreciably worse.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Have the ad rates, marketing rates gone down? In other words, to make a consumer impression is it now less expensive than you might have thought two months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think there is some weakness in ad spending. If I just judge it by watching primetime TV and how many times they tell me I need to get a digital box to get my TV service to work after February 17, I'm sure that's ad space they couldn't sell any other way. So I'm guessing you're going to see a bit of weakness there.</p>
          <p>So what we're seeing is, we should be able to get even better coverage for what we're planning on spending in '09. And if there's opportunities to trim it a bit and still hit our strategic marketing objectives, we'll absolutely take advantage of that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think we're realistic, but there's probably some upside there depending on how slow the economy gets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then back to the question, I'm trying to get a handle on the magnitude of this pantry deloading, just to focus on diapers. If I were to look at Nielsen plus Wal-Mart, is the volume in terms of consumer purchasing in the fourth quarter down 2%, something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the category itself overall --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The category, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes the category overall was pretty flat. And you'd say normally it would be up a percent or so in a normal environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is in volume terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes. So --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So what we would typically see is some, we saw the shift to the larger packed format, but it was in part driven by some of the price rollbacks in some channels on the larger pack format.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that's really not very much of a disparity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not as much in diapers. I think the closer you are to a product that, if you run out of diapers, you run out of bathroom tissue, that's a trip to the store for somebody. If you run out of some of our other categories, it may go on the list, but it may not make this repurchase cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I were to look at tissue and include Wal-Mart in the fourth quarter, was the category volume also sort of flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say bath tissue was down about probably low to mid-single digits. Towels were down mid to potentially high-single digits. And some of that in bath tissue is impact of desheeting where there's -- we measure the category in tens of thousands of sheets. And so as some of the competitors and us have taken sheets out over the year that's a part of it. But a part of it is also consumers trending toward buying smaller count packs and less toward buying the large bundle count packs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what would the comparable number be for childcare category?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Childcare, there you're seeing the category in some ways shift more into diapers. So some of the strength in diapers is the effect that consumers rather than pay the higher per-piece price for training pants are just leaving them in diapers a little longer and training them out of diapers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the childcare category might have been, including Wal-Mart, down?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Down probably mid to high-singles.</p>

          <p>Oh, Mr. Lieberman, we're so happy to hear from you again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two quick ones. One was on the cost outlook, one piece that wasn't discussed is just the recycled fiber where prices there have just completely plummeted. So I would think that that's a relatively large positive, at least within away-from-home margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it should be. That's sort of a recent phenomena. We went from a shortage last fall to a glut. You're actually finding some municipalities now are land filling recycled fiber because they've got nowhere to go with it. The export market to China has almost completely dried up. Some of the Chinese companies have pulled back on their purchasing. And so that's starting to flow through at this point in time.</p>
          <p>And so we'd seen prices that were up over $200 a ton for an extended period. And now you're seeing pricing in the high-100s and in some case even a bit lower than that. So there could be some more upside there for us.</p>
          <p>But again, we're in the process of implementing a number of price increases. And so if in fact your input costs come down, it'll probably be more difficult to pass along as much price as we've assumed in that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then the final thing was just, if you have anything specific on goals for '09 inventory levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean if you look at working capital overall, we're going to look to take three days out of the cash conversion cycle. So most of that's going to be coming out of inventory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Chip Dillon with Dillon Investment Research .</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just a quick one. Just a follow-up earlier, in light of the decline in shareholders' equity and if you add the underfunded pension I guess of about 2 billion to the debt, is that something that you feel, I think you're comfortable with it, certainly I am, but do you feel you need to approach the ratings agencies or have they approached you just in order to talk that out and protect the credit-rating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have an ongoing dialog with the rating agencies as you would expect. And so, yes, we've been talking to them all year about what's going on. And we will continue to have discussions with them.</p>
          <p>The credit rating is very important to us. So maintaining that solid A-rated credit, especially in a market like this where access to credit isn't as robust as it was just a year ago, is something that's very important to us. So obviously, we'll be talking with the rating agencies about the positives from our cash flow standpoint, from our margin improvement in the fourth quarter, and how we're going to manage through some of the pension funding issues.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think, Chip, the way they --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate the lack, you're not buying back stock either this year as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we generate quite a bit of cash and pensions become a higher priority for funding requirements. So the good thing is we generate healthy cash flow, and we've got opportunities to meet that obligation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And obviously if we have a recovery, like we've always had eventually, that might actually take quite a bit of, open up quite a bit of free cash flow in future years as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That'd be great. We look forward to that.</p>

          <p>Once again, this has been a challenging environment. We're doing all the things you would want us to do as shareholders of Kimberly-Clark to run the company for your benefit. So expect us to continue to drive innovation, to invest in our brands and to manage our cost aggressively as we go through this process. Thank you for your interest in Kimberly-Clark.</p>
