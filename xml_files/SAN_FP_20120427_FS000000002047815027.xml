          <p>Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter Conference Call. As always, I'd like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement. I must advise you that information presented in the call today will contain forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. These may cause actual results to differ materially. I invite you to refer to our Form 20-F on file with the SEC and also our documents for a description of those factors.</p>
          <p>For today, with us on the call, we have Chris Viehbacher, our CEO; Hanspeter Spek, our President of Global Operation; as well as J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Contamine, our CFO.</p>
          <p>Without any further ado, I will hand the call over to Chris.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, S&#xE9;bastien. Good morning, good afternoon, everybody. I think we've got a very strong set of results in the first quarter. Sales up 7% at constant exchange rate. Business earnings per share are up 7.2% at constant exchange rates, clearly benefiting from the acquisition of Genzyme, which you may remember we completed on the 4th of April last year.</p>
          <p>I think it's always useful to come back and say where we've been going strategically. If I go back to 2009, you'll all remember that really the story around Sanofi were the key genericized products, how many sales were going to be lost. And you can really see the cliff graphically here. The products, and they're noted in the footnote on the bottom that are subject to patent expiry amounted to some &#x20AC;2.2 billion in Q2 of 2009, which was kind of the last quarter before the cliff started. That &#x20AC;2.2 billion on the same set of products today is now down to &#x20AC;813 million. So as we've seen, and I think we have roughly a &#x20AC;250 million drop in the quarter due to generics in the first quarter, but that's down from the average of about &#x20AC;500 million from what we've been seeing up until now. So increasingly we get the cliff behind us, certainly from a sales point of view, it's pretty much behind us. From a profit point of view, of course, the second shoe has now to drop on the patent cliff.</p>
          <p>We're really about T-minus three weeks from the patent expiry of Plavix in the U.S. Avapro went at the end of March. And of course we'll see generic activity restart actually in August of this year, but clearly the impact of Plavix is the biggest one. This shouldn't be a surprise for anyone. We've been detailing this amount since September of last year. This is roughly a &#x20AC;2 billion effect on a full 12-month basis. Because this is occurring in May, we're obviously not going to have a full 12 months, so the impact on the bottom line on net after-tax profit of losing both Plavix and Avapro to generics is around &#x20AC;1.4 billion for the year. So Q1 obviously is great because we still have Plavix. The next four quarters are certainly going to be impacted by that, but none of that is a surprise; it's something we've been preparing for quite some time. We built our growth platforms not only as a means to compensate for the loss of sales, but to put Sanofi on a track for sustainable growth. These are all businesses that we believe are not dependent on patents that have long lives because of either our strategic positioning or the expensiveness of capital investment, the knowhow, faith in brand. But we believe the growth platforms provide long-term sustainable growth.</p>
          <p>To that, we now add "new Genzyme". "New Genzyme" is essentially the Rare Disease business today and will, in future, include the Multiple Sclerosis business. So Genzyme is really focused on Cerezyme and Fabrazyme, Myozyme, Pyrogen, Aldurazyme and to that we will add Aubagio and Lemtrada as we launch those. And you can see the benefit of the improvement in production. We hit an important milestone in the first quarter in that the new production facility in Framingham, Massachusetts was approved by both the FDA and the EMA. Already in the first quarter, we were able to fully supply patients on Fabrazyme in the United States so we are now looking at extending supply to other markets. This means, of course, that we will now be able to shift production of Fabrazyme from Allston progressively to Framingham, which simplifies Allston. It allows us to get faster out of our consent decree situation and really, I think, can have an important benefit in terms of capacity for Cerezyme.</p>
          <p>And as you can see all of these have performed pretty well. We have good solid performance with diabetes up 14.4%, really driven by Lantus, with over 17% increase. Emerging markets growing at close to 10%, including, obviously, the benefit of Genzyme, but also including the effect of vaccines. Vaccines is not showing stellar growth, but this is nothing more than what we see in the northern hemisphere in the third and fourth quarter. Some years we have the flu vaccine in the third quarter; some years, it's in the fourth quarter. Well, the same thing happens in the southern hemisphere in their winter time; sometimes it's in the first quarter, as it was last year. This year, the sales will be in the second quarter. And Hanspeter will come back on Animal Health, but again, I think you'll see that actually, when you look at it on a quarterly basis, the business continues to perform in line with expectation.</p>
          <p>The Cerezyme is now coming through. We are busy ramping up. Approval of a site doesn't mean immediate release of product. We've essentially been able to sell the three validation batches, but there is a time that is necessary to ramp up production. We continue for the moment to still produce Fabrazyme in Allston as well as in Framingham and progressively we'll phase that out. But I think you can see extremely good results on that rare disease portfolio. I think we're very confident certainly of share gain in Fabrazyme because it is objectively a better product, five times the enzyme for the same price. And Cerezyme I think we have an opportunity because, as you will have seen, Shire did not get its extended capacity at its Lexington facility approved, and we know that up until now Shire has been capacity constrained as well. So as we gain capacity, this, I think, gives us an opportunity in Cerezyme. I think the difficulty of Shire with its Lexington facility does demonstrate that none of this is easy. There is always a certain fragility of biological manufacturing and I think it underlines the importance of Genzyme's recovery.</p>
          <p>I think one of the things that's really emerging from Sanofi over the last year or so is a very strong late-stage pipeline. We did a lot of work 2 or 3 years ago to clean out products that we didn't see of high value. What really is interesting to me is not so much what we threw out, but what we kept. And what we kept actually, I think, has really stood the test of time, which tells me that we were sufficiently rigorous in deciding what to keep, so much so that of course we submitted five new molecular entities in the last nine months.</p>
          <p>Kynamro, which is for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and the severe heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in Europe and that has been submitted now in the U.S. in the first quarter. This is an important population for us because although a little bit more severe, this really lays the groundwork for the PCSK9 coming along, which even though will have a larger patient population, it gets us already involved in this field commercially.</p>
          <p>Aubagio, this week, we have AAN. And while lot of excitement is around Lemtrada, we shouldn't forget that this is a drug that has shown equal efficacy to the standard of care, Rebif, with all the convenience of oral dosing. So I think we have a significant opportunity with Aubagio, especially when we're looking at launching both Aubagio and Lemtrada over the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>Visamerin in VTE pretention in chemo-treated patients and you've seen we've got an advisory committee coming up on that and that really is an indication where nothing is there today. Lyxumia, our GLP-1, this is progressing well in Europe. We're waiting for the cardiovascular study in October and would expect to file in the U.S. towards the end of 2012. Zaltrap is progressing well in second-line metastatic colorectal cancer, both in Europe and was filed in the U.S. in February. And I think we've got a good opportunity really to get back into the field commercially also with Zaltrap here.</p>
          <p>Two exciting compounds in the pipeline, obviously, the PCSK9. A number of analysis, analysts, as well as journalists really pointing out that the PCSK9 probably one of the most exciting targets in the industry today. We appear to have a lead on that. We also were able to publish extremely interesting Phase II data and our Phase III program is set to start shortly. Lemtrada, I'm going to come on to in a minute. But we've been able to really, for the first time, show the data of the CARE-MS II study. Up until now, we've had to be circumspect in what we said simply because we didn't want to dilute the impact of this presentation at AAN this week.</p>
          <p>We've got three slides on Lemtrada and I really only just want to focus on this because I think Lemtrada's had a certain reputation out there and I have to say, I used to share it. When we were acquiring Genzyme, I think we rightly had some question about the ultimate value in the absence of data because of the long history of development. Equally, I think one has to give credit to where data are there and where the data are showing a different story. And I think actually, particularly when you look at the CARE-MS II study, the data are nothing sort of stunning. Obviously, because of its history, Genzyme and before then, Bayer, set the hurdle high on their Phase III. I mean they knew that if they're going to come to market, they had to have an extremely convincing set of results.</p>
          <p>So when you look at MS studies, there are really two facts in which you look at this. The first is the score of your EDSS, which is really a score of showing disability, zero being great, ten being not so great. And then the question is, well, how long can you show some kind of benefit in slowing down disability. So the minimum you have to do for regulatory is three months; obviously, the higher hurdle is six months. Then of course, the question is what are you are comparing it to. Well, if you're going to give someone a sugar pill with MS, you're probably not going to see them do very well, so it's a lot easier to show that you've got some level of efficacy here. However, because of this high hurdle, the need to really have credibility, I think Genzyme did an extraordinary thing and put an active comparator in and they didn't even pick the most advantageous comparator, they took the toughest one; they took Rebif. And you can see how many people have actually done this against Rebif; essentially nobody. So the data that really Lemtrada are showing are very difficult to compare to anybody else's studies because no one else has subjected their molecule to the same set of rigor and high hurdle that Lemtrada had.</p>
          <p>So what do they show? Well, let's look at relapse. I mean relapse is extremely important and these are all two-year studies with follow-up periods, so this isn't a flash in the pan type thing. This is a disease where patients are going to play a big role. Now, patients want to have two things. First is you want to be disease free; you want to be feeling better and you're going to feel this in terms of whether you have a relapse or not. So when you look at the number of patients that have not had any relapse for two years, you're looking at 78% for Lemtrada versus best-in-class of Rebif, which is only 59%. So if you ask patients, what do you prefer, you're going to find a very strong preference for those who don't have any relapse because this feels like you're getting back to a normal life.</p>
          <p>Now, the other thing is disability and we know that MS is a progressive disease and this is going to have an impact on your quality of life. Up until now, all drugs have done trials to really show that they slow down the progressive nature of the disability. And again, zero was good, ten is bad, so an increase is not good. And you can see the black line up top, which is Rebif. And through the course of the study, you saw that patients actually progressively did worse on Rebif. What happened with Lemtrada? Well, we can see that actually, for the very first time, a drug actually showed that you can improve the situation of disability, so you've got a longer period without relapse and you've got an improvement in disability scores. Even I can sell this drug.</p>
          <p>So where are we going? R&amp;D milestones for the remainder of 2012. We will be filing one product in Q2. As I already said, Lyxumia in Q3. We will be presenting the ORIGIN studies at the ADA. The retrospective cohort studies will also be presented at ADA. The TOWER headline Phase III results in remitting multiple sclerosis will be in Q3. Dengue vaccine results also in Q3. We are going into Phase III in Q3 with the anti-PSK-9 (sic) [anti-PCSK-9] and we'll start our second Phase III with our anti-IL-6.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn it over to Hanspeter Spek for a review of the operations.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris. Good morning and good afternoon. I would like to share some additional information, focusing on the growth platforms. And you'll find that as a first chart beginning with Number 17, the performance in the emerging markets. If you remember that we had achieved for the first time and as the first company, &#x20AC;10 billion of sales in emerging markets here in 2011. You see then that is &#x20AC;2.6 billion; we had once again a very strong quarter. It was of nearly 10%; 9.9% to be precise. If you concentrate on separate countries, the growth even has been 16.5%.</p>
          <p>If you look to the four different segments we have spelled out on to the chart, you see that overall, we have a strong growth rate, so we are able to also compensate less stronger growth rates, as in Eastern Europe and in Turkey. You know that Turkey has been hit for several times now by price cuts. And overall, we have to see that Eastern Europe, in terms of growth, is approaching more and more Western Europe, but from the other segments close between 8% and 16% overall we achieved to compensate sole single-digit performances.</p>
          <p>In Diabetes, we had a very, very impressive acceleration during the second half of 2011 and this performance continues. You see that in the first quarter, we achieved &#x20AC;1.3 billion in sales, nearly 18% respectively; 14%, of course, at constant exchange rate.</p>
          <p>Excellent performance of Lantus helps by now 51% of quarterly sales in the U.S. through SoloSTAR; a solid performance with 8% in Western Europe; and the really outstanding performance in emerging markets, with 32%, which means that if you go more into details in the emerging markets, we have growth of 64% in China, 35% in Russia, 30% in Brazil and 57% in Mexico. So after having analyzed <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:27) for the first quarter, we are extremely satisfied with this performance.</p>
          <p>We believe that we have to continue to close. We have outstanding, very interesting results from a large long-term study using insulin in type 2 patients, called ORIGIN. This will be published in June and we expect from this study not only more information on the so-called cancer risk concerning Lantus, but also on other, especially cardiovascular, outcome of an early insulinization therapy.</p>
          <p>Equally positive, our performance in the first quarter with Oncology sales of nearly &#x20AC;750 million, close to 17%, respectively 13% growth. Jevtana has nicely contributed to this, but we also see that after we have intensified focus and investment on the formally by Genzyme managed and promoted Oncology product, that those products show reactivity with a growth of 8%. We have had mitigated news on Celtrap less positive; evidently, it's a failure of the product in prostate cancer. But the very same day, we have obtained the information to have a priority review by the FDA, which makes us very optimistic to be able to launch the product if this review concludes positively before the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Now on something which may be sometimes overlooked, our performance results products which are off-patent and you find on Page 25, Plavix and Lovenox. And you see that Plavix in those countries where the product has been launched already as of 2010 and then later on evidently in 2011, the product still is achieving &#x20AC;359 million sales only in the first quarter. And this is due to nearly 12% close in Japan where the product still has a number of years of patent lives ahead of it, but also 5.2% growth towards the &#x20AC;200 million from the other emerging markets.</p>
          <p>On the right side of chart, Lovenox performance, even more remarkable, I believe. More than &#x20AC;400 million sales during the first quarter, a growth of 12%, those sales outside the U.S., where the product more or less never has been patent protected and is undergoing direct competition from other normal regulatory review since many years. I believe it's worth to note also that inside the U.S., Lovenox performed above our expectations, mainly, but not only, due to the fact that we have seen no additional entries of a generic product. But I think it's fair to say that also we have extreme customer loyalty, since evidently helped by continued supply problems of our existing competitors.</p>
          <p>The Consumer Health Care became a more and more substantial growth platform for us during 2011, mainly through the launch of Allegra and the number of acquisitions we can report for the first quarter, as we continue this development, again with the two-digit growth rate of 13% respectively and 11%. We have been looking at this a lot of interest how Allegra would behave in its second allergy season. And as you see, this sales of &#x20AC;87 million in the first quarter, the product does extremely well and therefore contributes to the overall impressive sales number of &#x20AC;805 million. This once again is also supported by a very strong performance in emerging markets, which goes to 22% inside a very impressive contribution of our recent acquisition in China, Sunstone, and they are mainly a product <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:05).</p>
          <p>Chris has made already a comment on the performance of Pasteur, which is seasonally affected. We have a growth of 11% in the mature market and minus 13% in the emerging markets, which is, as said, due to the different seasonality of flu in the Southern hemisphere. We assume a strongly successful, be fully normalized during the second quarter and overall, we are optimistic to achieve another record sales for the first half of 2012 in total. We are also content to report that after we had a brief remark on a number of changes concerning the supervision and the management of our joint-venture, we see quite improved performance during this first quarter.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, on Merial, our animal heath activity, we have a slightly negative sales growth. You see from the chart on Page Number 23 that this is first of all due to an extremely strong first quarter in 2011, which has been artificially high because we had obtained important sales for foot-and-mouth disease vaccines and for Bluetongue virus disease vaccines in the first quarter of 2011, which could not be repeated in the first quarter of 2012. Nevertheless, we are convinced that the Merial business will equalize performance during the second quarter and will go to growth into second half of 2012. The performance as of today is exactly in line with our budget.</p>
          <p>So I'll close here and I'll pass on to J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Contamine on the financial.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hanspeter. So I am now on Slide 25, for this is just a recap of the variation of sales from Q1 2011 to Q1 2012. So as you see, we've lost &#x20AC;235 million sales from the generication of our key product and here it's mainly Taxotere. And I'll remind you that we're still selling Taxotere with no competition in the U.S. in the first quarter of last year and a few other products. We have also have the impact of the end of an agreement we had with Teva to sell Copaxone in Europe and because of the disposal of our Dermik business, we have also a negative element on the like-for-like basis due to these two elements, which is the next column.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, the growth platforms, as described by Chris and Hanspeter before, have contributed to &#x20AC;287 million of increased sale, so basically compensating even more than from the <mark type="ph" /> seasonal product's (26:26) negative impact and of course, the general parameter was not compensated, but the general parameter was differently compensated by the Genzyme contribution. And here on this slide, you have the Phase Genzyme in the first quarter 2011, so the valuation of Genzyme sales have now been taken into account into the cost platform as we qualify Genzyme as a growth platform as from now.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'll remind you that in the first quarter of 2011, the exchange rate of U.S. dollar against the euro was $1.37. During this quarter, it was $1.31, so clearly we are benefiting in euro accounts from the slightly weaker euro against main currencies, in particular, the U.S. dollar, so we have a positive impact of the exchange rate variation of &#x20AC;187 million. So all-in-all, our sale have grown over the quarter by 9.4%, including 7% on a constant exchange rate basis.</p>
          <p>On the P&amp;L, I mean you will notice that we have posted a strong P&amp;L, i.e., with good ratios, whether it's a gross margin ratio or OpEx sales ratio and I will comment so much more on that.</p>
          <p>Before that, on Slide 26, I'd like just to say that is the last quarter where, when you compare P&amp;L, I mean the P&amp;L in Q1 2012 is, of course, impacted by the consolidation of Genzyme, which was up once again between the tough quarter 2011. So as from the second quarter, we won't see any such variation.</p>
          <p>And the second thing which can be noticed from this slide is that we finally post a ROI, a business operating margin which is above the business operating margin that we posted in Q1 2011, which I think, in the environment where we are, with generally competition and switch of business, is really a good achievement. It was somewhat helped by a positive outcome of a litigation of settlement on a litigation we had, which has impacted all the current operating income. It's not the full difference between 2011 and 2012 or so because 2011 was negatively impacted by the acquisition expenses related to Genzyme, so when the impact of this non-recurring event, let's say, is definitely there, I mean it's a small impact or a small impact of the performance of this quarter.</p>
          <p>So if I move to the next slide, I think that some of you have been somewhat positively surprised by our cost of sales or sales ratio. I would say that this cost of sales, the sales ratios is really in line with what we anticipated. After a period where we had seen a deterioration of this ratio around the period where we were recovering from high generic competition of loss of exclusivity of some of our main products, we are now in a period where we are basically able to compensate with productivity improvement, the remaining impact on the cost of sales ratio of these genericized products. On top of that, we have an improvement of the cost of crude heparin on the slight positive impact of exchange rate on the like-for-like basis. So we are really heading towards where the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year, i.e., that the cost sales ratio should be somewhere around 31.5%, when as you see, we are now able to stabilize. We still think it's a good sign that we are both really achieving this productivity improvement, but also that we are getting out of this period where we are regularly a decline of ratio, but now we are stabilized and that there we will be able, as from next year, to improve this ratio.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D, here again, I think we clearly have had a good control on our cost and I would say specifically on our internal cost. So we start to benefit from the new reorganization of our research and the closure of our New Jersey site and the cancel of research activity in the U.S to our Cambridge site. So we see that there is, in fact, a decline of our internal expense and at the same time, we continue to invest into late-stage development phases. So all-in-all, as you can see, the ratio of R&amp;D to sales has improved, if I compare to Q1 2011. And even if I compare to Q1 2010, it's an improvement by 0.7%, which I think is clearly a good achievement in terms of streamlining and improving on the cost side, the productivity of R&amp;D expense on investment. When on the efficiency side, we also see that there are some new, I mean, late-stage products which are now coming closer to filing an even big file. So we could say also that we benefit from the indication of Genzyme. I already mentioned the closure of our New Jersey research site and we are already generating synergies with Genzyme on the R&amp;D side.</p>
          <p>On SG&amp;A, very much the same. We have digested basically the impact of Genzyme, but there are still some improvement to come on G&amp;A savings. But now we are back to a ratio of 24.9%, which is very similar to the one we achieved during Q1 2011. There is, of course, some variability on the quarter-by-quarter in terms of impact &#x2013; I mean the sales and marketing expenses. But I think that we are really satisfied with the excellent achievements we have reached in terms of cost containment. And as you can see, if I had included on a pro forma basis Genzyme for Q1 2011, then the SG&amp;A expense is down by 4.9%.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, there is not much to say. I can just highlight that the net financial expenses are slightly higher than Q1 2011, which is no surprise because in Q1 2011, we had no debt associated to the financing of Genzyme. But I could see on the reverse that when we had to leverage &#x20AC;8 billion more debt during Q1 2012, the increase of financial expenses was very limited, really showing that we have been able to finance Genzyme at a very, very low cost of debt.</p>
          <p>The tax rate we expect for the full year, as I mentioned already on February 8, is the 28%, leading to a business net income increasing by 12.5% or 8.4% on a constant exchange rate base. Of course, we have slightly more shares outstanding during Q1 2012, as I recall you that we pay our dividend partly in shares during Q2, but the difference is pretty limited, as we have brought back the large part of the new shares we issued at the time of the payment of dividend in share. So as you can see, if I now look at the business EPS, the business EPS is increasing by 7.2% on a constant exchange rate basis of &#x20AC;1.66 to &#x20AC;1.85.</p>
          <p>Cash flow, I see that we are pretty satisfied with this slide. It shows the ability of the group to generate free cash flow on the reimbursed debt. We have generated &#x20AC;2.4 billion of free cash flow after payment of CapEx and taking into account the variation of working capital, which basically very under good control and that it be basically neutral. So it's an increase of free cash flow of 23%.</p>
          <p>We have had limited acquisitions over the quarter mainly some few payments or milestones in connection with in-licensing. We continue to do opportunistic share buyback, along of guidance in that respect, so we bought back &#x20AC;400 million of shares. So all together, what we have bought back during the second half of 2011 is around &#x20AC;1.5 billion of shares that we bought back.</p>
          <p>So all in all, the net debt is now down to &#x20AC;8.6 billion, so you could sit below the &#x20AC;10 billion target we have. I just remind you that we are going to pay the dividend in a few weeks now. I think it's the May 15. So the debt by the end of June will be about &#x20AC;10 billion, but we are clearly heading to a direction where we should get close to this &#x20AC;10 billion level by year-end, which is what we already highlighted in previous presentations.</p>
          <p>So to summarize before taking questions, I think that we have already achieved a good performance on our growth platforms. We clearly see the positive contribution of Genzyme by <mark type="ph" /> full means (36:24), both in terms of growth, in terms of synergies, in terms of R&amp;D, in terms of pipeline. We clearly have seen some significant progress on our late-stage pipeline in particular. We continue to have sustained cost control. And I mean to reaffirm clearly our guidance for the full year, which I remind you is a decline of profit, of course just taking into account this new impact of the credit loss of patent in the U.S., the decline of profit between minus 12% on minus 15% on a constant exchange rate basis.</p>
          <p>So with that, I think I turn back to S&#xE9;bastien to handle the next stage.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have a couple of questions. The first one is on the Origin trial and I fully understand you can't say anything about the results. But I'm hoping you can in broader terms, say how this trial could theoretically be impactful or not from a commercial perspective to the franchise, if the primary endpoint is either hit or missed. And then a second question is on the various drugs that are filed for regulatory review or that will soon be filed, I'm hoping you can answer two different questions. Which of those products has the highest eventual sales potential in your opinion and which of those products is perhaps the riskiest in terms of a regulatory outcome?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean I think on Origin we want to save this for ADA. So I think when we start trying to dance around this and sort of say, well, we think this would have an impact or not, I think let's just wait for the ADA. I think the second question, Tim, was which one do we think has the highest impact of the ones already filed,  is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's really of the ones that have been filed or soon will be filed, which of those could be the biggest in terms of eventual sales potential? And then also, which of those products do you think embeds the most regulatory risk in terms of getting a favorable regulatory outcome?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think we really see &#x2013; on the regulatory outcome, I mean I'd rather predict the weather than predict a regulatory outcome. Right now, as I look at it, I don't particularly see a higher risk on any of them. And actually I think everything so far we've seen, everything's progressing well.</p>
          <p>I mean they're all in different categories. Kynamro obviously doesn't have the same size population as a Lyxumia. At the same time, I would suspect that, that's probably a little bigger than what most people think. This is a drug that really has a very clear, meaningful benefit in those patients that need the drug and there isn't anything out there today and so I think Kynamro's probably under estimated.</p>
          <p>Lyxumia's extraordinarily important for our Diabetes franchise and getting that. And then I think particularly because I think it's fair to say Hanspeter we see a big synergy with Lantus, especially because you can either add GLP-1, 2 insulin or add insulin to this, which Victoza can't and so I think that one's a big one.</p>
          <p>The Visamerin is going to be kind of a tricky one because there isn't anything there today. Is there something that physicians prefer to use today in terms of Lovenox, we'll see. But I think actually having the data and showing a clear benefit is going to open up an opportunity. You could figure out what Zaltrap is going to do because that's market's pretty well known. And Aubagio I think is also one that's probably underestimated. I mean you've got an oral treatment. It is clearly shown to be equal in efficacy to standard of care, but it is becoming a competitive field.</p>
          <p>The one that hasn't been filed yet, but clearly is about to be filed is Lemtrada. And actually I know their sales forecasts are all over the map. I personally think actually, and I recognize I'm changing my tune on this, but I'm changing my tune on the base of data, I think this is going to be a major drug. People are concerned about safety. I don't see the reason for that. We've seen a higher incidence on impact for thyroid, but thyroid conditions are not uncommon in this population and, indeed, others and are pretty easily treated with standard therapies. The ITP has not been as severe as we've seen outside the population and has all been reversed. If you look at the <mark type="ph" /> dysobres (42:02) of the <mark type="ph" /> gylenias (42:03) of this world, where there's some concern around fatal side-effects, so far we haven't seen anything like that with Lemtrada.</p>
          <p>I mean the biggest thing I think with Lemtrada that we're going have to really change people's minds about is this is &#x2013; I still see comments out there that this is an immune suppressant, it actually isn't. This is acting on the lymphocytes and somehow in the repopulation of these lymphocytes, we are rebalancing immune system. This is a drug that's in and out pretty rapidly. You're getting five infusions and then nothing for a year and then another three infusions and then that's it. And if you can go several years without relapse, you can see some improvement in disability, then I think this is potentially a best-in-class. And I would not agree that is going to be used actually in the most severe patients because I think when you get out there, and you see where the side-effects are versus the others, I think we're going to stack up pretty well. Now, we know this is a conservative audience. 80% of the treatments are still in ABCR, which tells you the conservative nature of physicians, but each of those drugs are selling well over $1 billion, and so I don't see why this one wouldn't be.</p>
          <p>And I guess the final one is really dengue. This is a disease that actually affects 230 million people every year; roughly half the world's population is potentially affected by this. This is a first-in-class vaccine. We're about five years ahead anybody else in this, so you've clearly got that. We'll see Phase IIB results of that later this year. If they are strong enough, we have some countries that we know would be prepared to see that. Obviously, later on, we'll talk about the PCSK9, but that's not ready to be filed, but that could be quite major too.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two quick questions. Firstly, on Aubagio, timings might suggest that you would know whether you were going to need an outcome from the FDA, yet we haven't seen anything announced. I just wonder if you add some color. And then just a quick question about productivity improvements in COGS. J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me, could you quantify in euro terms what that would be? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're in discussion with the FDA. Some sort of regulatory decision is expected by Q3, but we haven't heard anything either about an <mark type="ph" /> adcom (44:50) at this stage. That doesn't mean that there will or won't be; we haven't heard anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me, you want to take the .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the COGS question, I mean it's sort of a mix. I mean it's not easy, let's say, to quantify it in euro because you have to take into account the shift of mix over time, so it means not just a direct equation, so it's somewhat more complex. But what I can say is that we are now, I mean, reaching around 4% productivity improvement per year and this 4% would apply to Pharma; it would not really apply into Vaccines, which is somewhat of a longer-term improvement. But you should take just the Pharma across and take 4%; you arrive to something like &#x20AC;200 million to &#x20AC;250 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I just &#x2013; a quick follow-up then? I mean if you take what you're saying in terms of productivity improvements in SG&amp;A and R&amp;D as sort of around 5%, 6% and you add in your &#x20AC;2 million for COGS, you're already getting close to &#x20AC;1 billion a year for this year and you targeted &#x20AC;2 billion by 2015. So I'm just wondering how quickly you're going to reach the &#x20AC;2 billion and really how far are you going to go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you have to go step-by-step. So I mean we are really heading into the right direction. I mean clearly, the Q1 results show that we are, I mean, generating cost savings, productivity improvement, as well as synergies, with the expectation of both Genzyme and Merial possibly somewhat faster than what we expected. But I think it's a bit early to revise how much we can achieve for the full year. I mean keep in mind that there will remain some variability on a quarter-by-quarter basis in terms of expense. So yes, I think you remember that we have given objective to save &#x20AC;2 billion from 2012 to 2015 and, well, there's a good chance that we achieve more than the average proportion of a discussed cost here. But we need somewhat to be cautious and I like somewhat to wait for the next quarter to give you somewhat precise revised quantification for the first year. But we have to take into account the expense we are going to appreciate to new launches. As you know, we gave the &#x20AC;2 billion target on the net basis, not on a gross basis, so we take into account also the extra expenses, which will link to the launches of the series of products we have discussed a few minutes ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's fair to say that, I mean, nobody ever feels like they run an organization that you can take a lot of cost out, but once you lose some patents and you're under pressure of profits, it's amazing when you start looking at things, how you can take costs out of the business. I mean when we launched our first &#x20AC;2 billion program, I could tell you that there was not a belief that this was going to be easy and we ended up doing it in two years instead of four years. I think I agree with J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me; it's a little early to say. But equally, I think there's been some very strong work done on looking at just things on efficiency, how we organize ourselves, every piece of the business actually has things that could be run much tighter. So I can certainly say that I'm extremely confident that we'll get the &#x20AC;2 billion, but we are going to be reinvesting in some of that in new product launches. But we'll give you an update later, but obviously, we're certainly pretty confident about the cost savings.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Peter Verdult from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. Peter Verdult, Morgan Stanley. Chris, just firstly on your guidance. Given what you've achieved in Q1 and you stated conservatism regarding planning for our Avapro and Plavix generics, I'd just like to better understand what actually needs to go wrong for Sanofi for you not to comfortably exceed your current EPS guidance for the year. And then on Lantus, can you just remind us what U.S. sales forces for prompting Lantus currently and what your plans are, if any, going forward? And then if I could quickly add on to Hanspeter Spek on the ORIGIN study, just a clarification. We know it's getting presented at ADA. Can you just clarify, are the results in the house or has anyone from senior management actually seen the top line data for ORIGIN yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So guidance, we're confirming guidance. We've never updated guidance after one quarter's worth of results. We give guidance because we have a degree of confidence in achieving it. Having that said, we live in a reasonably dangerous world, with the macro economic situation where it is. I would say that one of the things that has progressed is that a lot of the uncertainties that used to be associated with Sanofi are pretty much gone. We used to worry about are we going to get for Lovenox. Well, we kind of know that. What's going to happen with the growth platforms versus the patent expiries and I think we've built up these growth platforms. They're 63% of sales these days, so they have real critical mass. And so I think barring anything that's really unusual in the macro economic environment, right now, I don't think we do see anything that would put us off our game. At the same time, I think it would be far too early; we won't have enough data really yet to see how things are going to go to change the guidance at this stage.</p>
          <p>You want to talk about field force, Hanspeter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think for understandable reasons, we don't be really precise on the number of FTEs, but there's an overall orientation. Evidently, we have significantly increased the support during 2011, which then triggered the nice increases you saw. At the second orientation, of course, we tried to match and we successfully match usually with Novalatus. And there's a large, perhaps, very recent comment we have taken notes at, I believe, today Novalatus announced to Envisage to increase their overall head count in the U.S. by 15% and we would be prepared to do the same each times come. So if you match us with Novalatus, you will get a pretty good picture.</p>
          <p>Now on Origin, once again, I don't want to say much more than what Chris had said before. Please keep mind, this is a very huge file; it is a largest file ever done on insulin. It's more than 12,000 patients; it's up to seven years. And so it is not possible to just say this is a success or this will be not a success because there is market for the outcome. There is the question of the benefit of earlier or later insulinization. There is the question on cardiovascular outcome. So it will be an extremely interesting report and, evidently, I cannot go any further.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I've got two questions, please. So firstly, on emerging markets, you certainly seem to have a very strong quarter compared to some of your peers. Were there any particular large tenders in the quarter that we should be aware off? And then secondly, for J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me, just going back to the other operating income, just to check I'm understanding you correctly. So the license litigation settlement, are you saying that, that's somewhere in the region of &#x20AC;50 million to &#x20AC;100 million? And also, can you explain what that was with regard to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I did phonetically not understand the middle part of your question, when you were referring to emerging markets. Would you be so kind and repeat it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course. So for emerging markets, you had a particularly good quarter compared to your peers. So I just wanted to check whether there are were any large tender orders during Q1 that we should be aware of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely not. More in the contrary. The development we had in Africa, which charged below 10%, was a little bit marked by tenders which were delayed also due to the overall situation in the Northern part of Africa. So there is no upside from tenders at all.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your second question, Luisa, I can say that the net impact on the &#x2013; I mean as you know, we have bid the guidance by around 10% and we can say that around 3% was due to this positive outcome of this license litigation. I mean the actual topic I cannot disclose precisely because the other topic <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:18) disclosed, but I can just tell you that it came out to a pretty good &#x2013; I mean license dating from the other group.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you meant of the 10% beat versus consensus, about 3% was related to that settlement. So without that, we would have still been ahead by about 7%.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on your strategy on acquisitions and bolt-on acquisitions. You were talking about the possibility to spend &#x20AC;1 billion, &#x20AC;2 billion in bolt-on acquisitions in emerging markets a few months ago and I think that nothing happened, so what's going on this? And the second question is with regards to the anti-PCSK-9. In the Phase II data, infection rates, as well as injection site reactions occurred. What's you view on that, with regards to the Phase III trial and also the device? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean on the &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;2 billion, it was meant to be a guidance versus a target. I think we constantly are looking at things, but it's a little like fishing: you're never sure; you may be out there fishing, but you're never sure when the fish is actually going to come in over the boat. I would say that pretty much all the acquisitions we've done have been able to drive some significant value because we've kind of been ahead of everybody else. I can tell you that there are plenty of people wonder why they missed Medley, for example. I think the Chattem acquisition really showed a lot of value because we had Allegra. So I think we spend our time looking at things. We're not just about to go jump in on some things. I have some concern when I see what some of our competitors are doing and some of the valuations that are being paid. So you've really got to look a little further, in a little different places to create value, so that you're not just doing what your competitors are doing. So it's meant to be a guidance, but I wouldn't say that, hey, if we don't do &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;2 billion by July, that we're falling behind.</p>
          <p>On the PCSK-9, so we would expect that the device will be some sort of auto-injector device for our patients to use themselves. We haven't really seen any big issues with injection site reactions. Been very few discontinuations for this reason in the studies that we've seen to-date. They're not even really enough to know what the actual number is, so I don't see that as being a big issue.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Michael from Barclays. Just one question on Lantus. Your friendly competitor said at Lilly, you're quite aggressive with a view on biosimilar Lantus. I think they suggested that the analogs market, the data margin could be split in three ways, with equal shares between improved products, Lantus as it is today and the biosimilars. I'm just wondering what your answer to that would be. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a simple answer: it's that we don't share this point of view for many reasons. If you look to penetration of the biosimilars which are to-date in the market, you see penetrations which are much, much lower than what you have been transporting Lilly for. Second, we believe that the impact of devices will play another role for not just say &#x2013; will present another hurdle to a more rapid penetration of biosimilars. So we don't share this point of view at all. On the fact perhaps another positive information, we have obtained a prolongation of our patent protection, our overall protection, due to the pediatric use as of a couple of days ago. So also from a pure time point of view, we feel rather comfortable.</p>

You have to, at some point, go back and look at analogues on any of these forecasts; you can't just have people hoping for things, which is what this Lilly forecast sounds like. You don't see that kind of a market situation in the other market. If you go back and look at, say, respiratory devices, for example, we know that the device plays a big role in patient preference. I believe Lilly's own comments have said that they don't expect this to be a substitutable product, so how are they going to get this. I mean you can go look at other cases like the growth hormones, erythropoietins, interferons. We haven't seen that so far; it doesn't mean it won't happen.</p>
          <p>But I think you're going to see something like this is going to be a fourth entry into a market; this is going to be essentially a me-too insulin analogue. And fourth entry into a me-too market has got anywhere from probably around 10% market share. I mean I think that's what you've seen in some of these other biosimilar markets; I think that's what you probably see here. And by the time you take into account devices and new formulations and the fact that Lily, remember, is not really present much in emerging markets, so they don't even have the presence that a Nova-Nordisk really does, so I don't think we wouldn't share the same &#x2013; we don't share the same forecast as Lily does.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. One question on gain on emerging markets. Because if there is no special items in the Q1, it might be product mix and geographic mix that makes you much better than especially your UK competitors, so we should be able to project that for the next quarter. Do you think it will be the case that we can project about 8% comparable for the next few quarters in the emerging markets? Can you make a comment on price component in emerging markets as it deteriorated especially in China in the quarter? Maybe if I may, another one on the other line in the other prescription product line that seems to be deteriorating a bit faster than usual at minus 6% is there any special item here in and should it continue this way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I basically expect that similar product for the upcoming quarters, perhaps with the limitation of China, which answers also your second question. We have seen not a negative price impact on our presence in China during the first quarter, but we expect price changes for the rest of the year. We can only speculate for the time being on which products may be an impact on Plavix, may be an impact on Lantus for the time being; we don't know. So in summary, I have to leave a certain question mark in terms of continued growth for the second and the third quarter for China. But for the other markets, being it Latin America or being it Africa, I don't see this, at least as of to-date.</p>
          <p>The negative close of the other product is mainly driven by the trends we have in the European community. And the European community, once again, is hit by all sorts of interventions, mainly price cuts which occurred during the year last 12 months. And on top of it, we have a pretty negative scenario in Turkey, as far as the emerging markets are concerned coming from price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I have maybe a follow-up on organic growth? You were almost at the 0% organic growth in this quarter and you will have less headwinds with the Vaccines and Taxotere in the second quarter. If emerging markets go the same way, can we hope to have a positive organic growth in Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let's not get into doing guidance on a quarterly basis here. I mean I would say look, I think we've always said that 2011 was where we felt to be the bottom of our patent cliff on a sales basis; clearly, not on a profit basis because we don't consolidate Plavix on the U.S. and there is a cliff piece of that this year. How fast we can get back out, I mean this is kind of a little bit of a mix. It's pretty hard to predict where quarterly sales are, but I think the kind of the 0% organic growth that you saw is kind of consistent with the message that we've been giving all along that we got to a point where the organic growth is able to offset the patent expiries.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. I was just going to ask you another question on with Lyxumia or lixisenatide. And I was curious, beyond the combination with Lantus, what you might see as some of the differentiating features of this drug. And I was also curious if you believe that there may be a good strategic reason for Sanofi to add another GLP-1 to your portfolio. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the time being, we really try to have Lyxumia. And why Lyxumia; because we believe it is an easier combination partnered with insulins and more specifically, of course, with Lantus. The profile of the product is very favorable to see it as a preferred partner and that's our intended positioning. If there will be other products of the same <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:25) cannot be the subject of today. Lyxumia shows very good tolerability beside a disease to titrate because you have only titration step to make, while the other product also shows you may speculate about &#x2013; need several titration steps. So we believe that this product is not the first-in-class, but we believe that it has a very attractive profile, especially for us as our very strong position for Lantus.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any other strategic reason to consider another GLP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just given all the speculation that's going on, I think we're just going to leave it sit there. I mean I would suspect this is kind of a backdoor question around the Amylin situation and we couldn't comment on any specific target. We're very happy, as Hanspeter said, with our GLP-1. I think it marries extremely well. We're committed to not only the launching it as an individual product, but you may remember, we've got a considerable investment in developing this as a combination product with Lantus and would expect to go into Phase III with the combination product in early 2013.</p>

          <p>Your next question is from Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of questions, please. Firstly, what you're seeing updates on how you're seeing the situation of bad debts across Europe, given the obvious fiscal crisis. And in France how you're seeing the taxation situation developing around the presidential election candidates. Anything you could help us on with those two would be good. And just one on the diabetes franchise. I think we're seeing <mark type="ph" /> Glavamere (1:07:32) taking a little bit of incremental share in the U.S. If you could talk us around the dynamics there and how you might resolve those that would be useful too. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's take the first two and then Hanspeter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the bad debt, well, we need to keep in mind that our total sales in the countries which are mostly impact to this risk, i.e., sales <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:08:03) to decline, so we could say that the overexposure we have tends to decline. So far, we have not seen really significant deterioration of cost, I mean except the Greek situation of our payment conditions. So we are used to the fact that in some Southern European countries hospitals tend to pay late or public sector tends to pay late, but it has not really deteriorated over the last 18 months, I'd say. So very, very marginally, so I would not say today that it is really a dire specific concern of our attention, but not an area of specific concern.</p>
          <p>On the taxation in France, while it's pretty difficult to read through the &#x2013; I mean the program from the candidate, basically, there is a trend towards somewhat increase of taxation, but we move more on personal situation than on corporate situation. So when it comes to corporations, not so clear that would be some significant deterioration on top of that. I'll remind you that today, we are making only 8% of our sales in France and also, I mean we have a taxation scheme adapted to IP taxation on royalties into IP, which have been pretty favorable, which I don't think is going to change because I think France is still looking for sustaining long-term innovation in biological sector and other sectors as well. So nothing dramatic as I see it today, but once again it's a bit difficult to read the crystal ball in this present situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Cool. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then on Lantus and Levemir in U.S., I, in fact, see nothing alarming. Lantus keeps by far the lion's share in the segment of analogues with approximately 80% market share. The overall market, including Levemir and Victoza, by the way, is flat in total prescriptions, and Lantus is growing approximate between 7% and 9.5%, depending on the timeframe you are looking. So 9.5% is year-to-date February 2012, which means we continue to build up market share, of course we keep an eye on Levemir. But we see absolutely no reason to be alarmed.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Thanks for taking my question. Just quickly on the upcoming producer for Pfizer <mark type="ph" /> Doprizer in Daufay (1:11:03), just interested to get your perspective if that comes to the market, how in your view, it might affect the market dynamics. And then just what's your latest view internally and assumptions around potential timings of any generics of Lovenox in Europe? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on <mark type="ph" /> Daufay (1:11:25), I mean quite honestly I'm not even sure why Pfizer is bothering here. You've already got two players in here in a rare disease market. Doing a market share strategy in rare diseases doesn't strike me as being a particularly intelligent strategy. But in any case, the product is approved. I believe it's in Brazil and hasn't done extremely well and we've certainly been able to maintain a big share of that, even with our constrained supply situation. Obviously, the product has had some difficulty in getting approved everywhere else, including in the U.S., which suggests that there are some wrinkles around this product. So even if it does I would suspect we'll have plenty of ammunition to defend Cerezyme here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On Lovenox generics in Europe, Hanspeter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on Lovenox, the European market is totally different to other markets mainly because the low-molecular market in Europe has seen competitions in 10, 15 years. There's a group of products which is very, very similar, perhaps not biosimilar but pretty similar since many years. Consequently, there is intensive competition on price and on contracts and we have seen sharp battles between Sandoz, Novartis, us, GSK, previously Pfizer and Pharmacia. So I don't see a lot of opportunity for biosimilar low-molecular weight heparin because this is really not in use there, no innovative aspect to it to come today with a biosimilar low-molecular weight heparin in Europe. So I believe a very, very low penetration for those products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. We had made the commitment to some analysts that we would keep the call within an hour and 15 minutes and I think we're just about there, but I will let Chris conclude the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, again, we keep getting one quarter further every time through the patent cliff and one quarter closer to getting back to our growth situation. I look at the performance of the growth platform. There's obviously a lot going on in the world, but very good performance in the first quarter and that's really what's going to drive Sanofi going forward.</p>
          <p>Last September, we gave a medium-term outlook, which suggested a compound annual growth in sales of about 5% between 2012 and 2015. When I look at the growth platforms, I look at actually an increasing robust portfolio of new drugs coming along and I look at the very strong cost control that all of our colleagues here have been able to implement. I continue to be confident in the medium-term outlook of the business and we're on track with where we said we'd be and this is yet one more month of good solid execution.</p>
          <p>So I thank everybody for your interest and your questions and we'll talk to you again.</p>
