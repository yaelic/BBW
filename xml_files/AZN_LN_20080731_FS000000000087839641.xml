        <plist>
          <p>Good, Jonathan. Thank you. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for joining us on our webcast and our conference call. And as Jonathan said we will cover second quarter and half-year 2008 financial results. The program is pretty straightforward, I'll make some brief opening remarks and then, as Jonathan said, Simon Lowth is here. He'll take you through the details of the financial results for the quarter and John Patterson will then provide his customary semi-annual review of the R&amp;D pipeline. And then after our presentations, there'll be plenty of time to take questions.</p>
          <p>So why don't I just do a quick intro for you. The first half of 2008 has really seen some significant accomplishments for the Company; with a solid performance in the first half now under our belt, we have been able to increase our full-year target for earnings per share by $0.15. Around half of this is from currency and the other half is from improved operating and financial performance, and Simon will fill you in the details &#x2013; on the details of how we did this in his guidance remarks in just a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Market conditions in the established markets of the U.S. and Western Europe continue to be challenging. The overall rates of growth in those markets have slowed to low-single digits and, as you all know, healthcare cost pressures are increasing. These factors are clearly impacting our business. That said, the geographic diversification of our business continues to be a source of strength. We're driving strong growth in the emerging markets; our sales in these markets increased by 20% in the second quarter, leading to a new milestone. This is the first time sales in emerging markets have exceeded $1 billion in a quarter.</p>
          <p>Since the year-end results report in late January, we have also successfully mitigated two very significant near-term risks to our business performance by reaching a settlement of the Nexium patent litigation with Ranbaxy and earlier this month the successful outcome of the summary judgment motion in the Seroquel patent litigation upholding our valid intellectual property.</p>
          <p>We continue to execute on our comprehensive Company-wide plans to reshape our cost base. We are firmly on track to deliver the interim target, which is to deliver two-thirds of the total program benefit of $1.4 billion in annual benefits by the end of this year, with the balance of the planned savings to be delivered by 2010. Since inception, we are now just over 60% through the anticipated $2 billion restructuring and synergy provisions. These programs are not just reshaping the cost base, they are bringing a focus to the need for changes in the way we operate so that we are prepared to compete effectively in the more challenging market conditions that we are facing.</p>
          <p>Regarding our most important priority, the research and development pipeline has been further strengthened during the first half of the year as you will have seen from the pipeline table. John will take you through the details, but the highlights certainly include the regulatory submissions for Onglyza, both in the U.S. and in Europe. We have also made two new Phase III program decisions for the anti-thrombotic AZD0837 and the anti-cancer treatment MEDI-561, which is a development collaboration we have with Infinity Pharmaceuticals. This increases the late-stage portfolio to 12 projects in Phase III or registration, compared with five projects in 2006.</p>
          <p>There is also progress in the early and mid-stage pipeline to report, which I will leave to John to do. And before I hand over to Simon, who will cover the details for the second quarter, here is a quick look at the headline results for the first half of the year. Sales in the first half were up 3% in constant currency terms, and with the 7% uplift from currency sales were up 10% on a reported basis. Core operating profit increased by 7% at constant exchange rates. Below the operating line, we have an increase in net interest expense from the debt financing of the MedImmune acquisition. As a result, that 7% increase in operating profit becomes a 2% decrease in core profit before tax.</p>
          <p>The share repurchases since the beginning of 2007 have given rise to a 3% increase in core earnings per share in CER terms to $2.53 per share. You'll have seen that we resumed share repurchases in the second quarter, and we're still anticipating around $1 billion in repurchases for the full year.</p>
          <p>Reported earnings per share were $2.14, a 3% decrease at CER compared with last year. That's a result of the Ethyol impairment charge taken in the first quarter of 2008 and the inclusion of six months of MedImmune-related amortization, which was only partially offset by the lower restructuring and synergy costs during the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>It has been over year since we acquired MedImmune. We are pleased at the integration of the Cambridge Antibody Technology and the AZ biologics assets has gone smoothly. And there are now more projects than ever in the biologics segment of our pipeline, and we are continuing to grow and invest in this important area of our business. Finally, the Board has recommended a first interim dividend of $0.55.</p>
          <p>In summary, a first half performance that leaves us well placed to deliver on our increased full-year target. And with that what I will do is handover to Simon Lowth and let him take you through more specifics. Simon?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. I will cover five topics this afternoon. First, I will summarize our financial results for the second quarter. I will then describe the main drivers of our second quarter sales performance, looking at trends by major region and for the key brands. Next, I will explain the key drivers of our core operating margin improvement and how we have successfully translated top-line growth into faster growth at the bottom line. I will then briefly review our cash flow performance for the year-to-date and then, finally, I'll update our financial guidance for the full year, in particular to explain the basis of the increase in our full-year earnings guidance.</p>
          <p>David summarized the first half results, so I will now turn to the results for the second quarter. Sales were up 2% at constant exchange rates to $7.95 billion. As you would expect, the weaker dollar has had a positive effect on the top line, adding 7% to growth. So sales on a reported basis are up 9%. Core operating profit was up 3% in constant currency terms, with improvements in gross margin and efficiencies in R&amp;D being partially offset by some higher SG&amp;A costs and lower other operating income compared to last year. Core operating profit was up 14% on a reported basis, with currency adding 11% to growth.</p>
          <p>Core EPS was up 7% on a reported basis, but stripping out the currency benefit it was down 4% in constant currency terms. The decline in core EPS for the quarter is driven by the increased net interest expense, which has more than offset the rise in core operating profit. You'll recall that the acquisition of MedImmune was completed in June last year. As a result, we had only one month's worth of interest expense on the MedImmune financing in the second quarter of 2007, whereas we have had a full three months' worth of interest expense in this quarter. Reported EPS was $1.11, a 4% increase in constant currency terms, chiefly because restructuring and synergy costs were significantly lower than those incurred in the second quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to our second quarter sales performance, and for the avoidance of doubt, when I refer to sales growth rates they will all be on a constant currency basis. So starting with an analysis of sales trends by region; sales in the U.S. were down 4%, primarily due to the decline in Toprol-XL sales due to generic competition. In the first quarter, the full in-season sales of MedImmune offset the decline in Toprol. In this quarter, however, MedImmune's off-season sales have been insufficient to offset the $268 million decline in Toprol. So if you strip out Toprol-XL, then the rest of the U.S. business actually increased by 4% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In contrast to the first quarter, in which you will recall that we saw some destocking of around $200 million, we have experienced an inventory build in the second quarter of around $100 million, or about two days' sales. Again, this is well within the range of normal limits. Market conditions in Western Europe do remain difficult, and sales there are up just 1%. Sales in Japan rebounded strongly from the soft first quarter after the biennial price reductions in April.</p>
          <p>Once again, we have seen a strong performance in our emerging markets. We increased our sales there by 20%, and as David mentioned, quarterly sales exceeded $1 billion for the first time. We continue to invest to drive that growth even further with increased sales and marketing effort deployed against our key markets and key brands. Despite this investment, we continue to grow contribution in our emerging markets faster than sales.</p>
          <p>So turning now to our key brands, and again my comments on sales growth rates will all be on a constant currency basis. The five key brands combined grew by 8% in the second quarter, up from the 4% growth that we saw in the first quarter. As you can see, we had good double-digit sales growth for Seroquel and Symbicort and a 27% increase for CRESTOR. Globally, Nexium sales were down 4% in the quarter. Sales in the U.S. were down 12%, though the U.S. team is doing a good job in managing the maturity sales of Nexium's life cycle in this market. We estimate that ex-factory volume growth in Nexium was 11% in the quarter. Most of this was due to strong growth from lower-priced non-retail channels. In the critical retail segment, we grew dispensed retail tablet volume by around 40 basis points, despite the continued share gains for generic omeprazole and the launch of generic pantoprazole.</p>
          <p>Therefore, it is the net price decline that has driven the sales decline in the quarter, as indeed has been case for the past few quarters. Now you'll recall that most of the net price declines experienced in 2007 occurred during the fourth quarter. So we will see large negative price variances through this year, up until the fourth quarter when the year-on-year net price differential will narrow. In the rest of the world, Nexium sales were up 11%, with sales growth of 36% in emerging markets being the principal driver. Based on the first-half performance and the outlook for the rest of the year, we continue to expect to a mid-single-digit sales decline for the worldwide Nexium sales for the full year.</p>
          <p>CRESTOR sales increased by 27% in the second quarter to $916 million. CRESTOR sales in the U.S. were up 18% to $415 million. Fueled by the promotion of new atherosclerosis indication, CRESTOR is the only branded statin to gain share this year, with market share up 0.5 point to 9.1% of total prescriptions. Prescriptions were up 8% over second quarter last year, and we have also gained ground in new patient starts and we're showing net gains among the patients that are switching statin therapies.</p>
          <p>Outside the U.S. we had another excellent quarter, with sales up 37% to just over $0.5 billion. Sales in Western Europe were up 19%, Canada posted a 30% increase, and in Japan, sales were up 150% and CRESTOR dynamic share in that market is around 24%, closing to within just four share points of LIPITOR.</p>
          <p>Seroquel sales were up 11% in the quarter to $1.1 billion. In the U.S., sales were up 8%. Total prescriptions grew by 6% compared with the second quarter last year, which is twice the market rate. Prescription market share was a market-leading 31.6% in June 2008. While promotion of SEROQUEL XR has been confined to just the schizophrenia indication, it still accounted for 40% of Seroquel prescription growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the third quarter, when you look at phasing of U. S. sales growth for Seroquel, but do keep in mind that there was around $80 million of initial stocking of SEROQUEL XR in the third quarter last year that will not recur this year. Sales in the rest of the world were up 18% to $379 million. With most of the major lifecycle management programs for SEROQUEL XR now awaiting regulatory approvals, we will see a global rollout of XR launches in bipolar disorder, major depression, and generalized anxiety disorder starting late this year and into 2009.</p>
          <p>Arimidex sales increased by 6% to $490 million in the second quarter. Sales in the U.S. were up 13% to $201 million, mostly due to inventory movement in price as prescriptions were up just 1% in a flat market. Arimidex in the U.S. is nearing maturity; although it's still the market leader in new patient starts, the incidence of breast cancer is declining. More importantly, we are now starting to see the effect of patients reaching the end of their five-year treatment regime, and as a result the total number of patients under treatment at any one time will peak in 2008, and then start to decline slowly over time. Arimidex sales in other markets were up 1% in the quarter to $289 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, turning to Symbicort. Global sales were up 12% in the quarter to $518 million. The lion's share of this business is outside the U.S., where sales were up 6% to $461 million. More than half of the sales growth came from our emerging markets, where sales were up 29%. Sales in the U.S. are on track at $57 million for the quarter. Our product trial rate amongst our target specialists is now approaching 80%, and 27% of their new patient starts for fixed combination therapy are going to Symbicort. The trial rate in primary care is also growing. More than a third of primary care physicians have tried Symbicort, and Symbicort is being prescribed for one in six patients newly starting combination therapy. Overall in the U.S., Symbicort new prescription share of the combination market is now 9.1% in the week ending the 18th of July, with a new patient share of 17.6%, which is a strong leading indicator.</p>
          <p>Having described the sales trends, I will now turn to the P&amp;L and the drivers of growth in core operating profit. Our focus here on core margins and profit as this is the basis upon which our guidance is based. The press release does of course contain the statutory numbers and the detailed reconciliation to our core measures. And as with sales, when I refer to growth rates they will all be on a constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, core gross margin increased to 82% of sales, an improvement of 170 basis points. This increase was primarily due to reduced contingent payments to Merck resulting from the lower proportion of sales accounted for by Nexium and Toprol in U.S. And in addition, gross margin benefited from improved product mix and efficiency gains, partially offset by higher royalty payments. Core R&amp;D expenditures were level with last year as we continue to progress the key discovery and development programs with greater efficiency. Our productivity initiatives in R&amp;D are delivering ahead of our initial expectations, along with restructuring benefits and portfolio changes.</p>
          <p>Core SG&amp;A expense was up 5% in the quarter. This increase reflects the inclusion of a full quarter of MedImmune SG&amp;A, increased sales and marketing investments in the emerging markets to drive the top line, and some increased legal expenditures. Core other income was $51 million lower than the second quarter last year; the one-off disposal gains in this quarter were lower than those in the prior period. Overall, on a constant currency basis, core operating margins increased by 30 basis points, driving core operating profit growth of 3% compared with sales growth of 2%.</p>
          <p>For the first half, core operating margin increased by 140 basis points, due again to improved gross margin, delivery of the R&amp;D program with improved efficiencies, and partially offset by some increased SG&amp;A. The improved operating margin drove core operating profit growth of 7% compared with 3% growth in sales.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to cash flow. This is a dimension of business performance upon which we have placed increased emphasis over the course of this year. In particular, we are seeking to improve the conversion of profit into cash flow through tighter working capital management; and we're bringing an increased discipline to the evaluation and allocation of capital to investment in our physical plant, our systems, and indeed to externalization. We've seen these initiatives bear fruit during the first half of this year with net debt and net interest costs below our initial forecasts due to a combination of improved operating cash flow and lower capital investment. This is one of the key contributors to the increase in our earnings guidance for the full year.</p>
          <p>As you can see here, cash generated from operating activities has increased by over $1.1 billion in the first half 2008 compared with last year, due principally to increased operating profit and improved working capital utilization. We have deployed that $4.3 billion of operating free cash flow into the $2.6 billion payment to Merck as part of our phased exit from that venture; deployed $6 billion investment in capital and intangible assets to drive future business growth and productivity; and a $2.2 billion distribution to shareholders through the final 2007 dividend and the first stage of the 2008 buyback program. Overall, net debt increased, but to a lower level than we had originally anticipated, from $9.1 billion to $10.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude with an update on our guidance for the full year. We have increased our target for core earnings per share by $0.15 with the new range between $4.60 and $4.90 per share. We have maintained a $0.30 range to accommodate business uncertainties that the challenging market conditions present. Around half of the $0.15 uplift to guidance is due to currency. This is the further benefit realized in the second quarter, compared with the rates used in our original planning assumptions, which were the fourth quarter 2007 average rates.</p>
          <p>For the second half, guidance is set on the base case planning assumption of Q4 2007 rates. As you'll recall, our estimates for the sales and earnings sensitivity to movements in our major currencies such as the U.S. dollar were provided in conjunction for the full 2007 results announcement, and we have included again in the half-year slide pack.</p>
          <p>Turning to the other half of the $0.15 increase, this is related to operating and financial performance improvement. Here is our current view of the main points of guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year. We still expect sales growth to be in the range of low-to-mid single digits at constant currency. Core gross margins still expected to be flat against last year, again at constant currency. R&amp;D expense, with our latest view on productivity and portfolio changes, is now looking like low-to-mid single digit growth in constant exchange rates. We now anticipate core SG&amp;A expense growth in low single digits with efficiencies on track, but incremental investment in emerging markets and some increased legal costs. Core other income is still looking unchanged versus 2007.</p>
          <p>In summary, against a challenging external environment we have turned in a solid financial performance in the first half. We have absorbed the generic erosion to Toprol-XL and still increased sales by 3%. Our productivity initiatives in R&amp;D are delivering ahead of our initial expectations, we are increasing our investments in emerging markets, and are still delivering an improved operating margin. And finally, our cash performance is ahead of our plan.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me hand over to John Patterson, who will provide an update on the progress of the R&amp;D pipeline since the beginning of the year. John?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Simon, and good afternoon everybody. Over the past few years, I have talked regularly about the four key components of the AstraZeneca R&amp;D strategy. In the short term we seek to maximize our marketed products through our lifecycle management activities. Secondly, we are building our portfolio by increasing our discovery and development productivity. We have invested considerable time and effort improving the quality, speed, and cost efficiency of our discovery and early development to bring more projects into the Phase III program, and faster.</p>
          <p>Finally in the medium and long term, balancing our portfolio by complementing our internal efforts with externalization as well as accelerating and delivering a biologic strategy. This is an exciting time for R&amp;D as we are now seeing concrete results from this strategy. We're delivering on our promise on all fronts.</p>
          <p>Over the next 20 minutes, I plan to review the significant number of achievements in the first half of 2008, starting with an update of key developments in our Phase III and lifecycle management activities, followed by an overview of our pipeline. So far this year, we have delivered 12 lifecycle management regulatory submissions, as well as two of the three new substance submissions we set out to deliver this year, namely motavizumab and Onglyza. We are making considerable progress reducing our cycle times and our costs, but without compromising the quality of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>We have increased our Phase III pipeline to 12 projects. This is a considerable increase from this time two years ago. Our externalization efforts and the narrow focus of our disease area strategy are also producing results, one clear example being in the type II diabetes area, where our deal with BMS has delivered a submitted regulatory package as well as Dapagliflozin in Phase III. And then finally by way of introduction, our relationship with MedImmune is now one year old, and we're still on track to deliver a strong biologics portfolio.</p>
          <p>I now would like to take you through the key developments of the last six months, starting with Motavizumab. Motavizumab, through its increased preclinical potency, could be a real step forward in respiratory syncytial virus. The BLA submitted for premature infants and infants with chronic lung disease was delivered in January 2008 and is currently under review. The congenital heart disease study data is currently being analyzed in-house, and we are on track for the U.S. supplementary submission planned for the first half of next year, as well as the EU submission for all high-risk infants within the same timeframe. Finally, the Phase III Native American study accrual has now been completed. I am sure that by now you realize that Onglyza is the trademark for the selective DPP-4 inhibitor with the generic name saxagliptin.</p>
          <p>The second key achievement of the first half of this year was the Onglyza announcement that we made last Wednesday jointly with our partner BMS. We delivered the regulatory submission to the FDA on June 30th, and have recently received validation of the MAA from the European Medicines Agency 15 months earlier than previously planned. The submissions are based on a comprehensive Phase III program conducted in addition to standard therapies as well as in treating naive patients as monotherapy. The program included studies that evaluated the drug as well-tolerated at up to 80 times therapeutic clinical doses. The overall Onglyza data set involved more than 4000 patients.</p>
          <p>Data presented during June's ADA meeting showed significant reductions in all key measures of glucose control. And you can see on the slide the effects on hemoglobin A1C, fasting, and postprandial glucose as monotherapy and in combination. The remaining Phase III data is planned for disclosure at the European Diabetes Meeting in September. Onglyza is an important opportunity for us, as type II diabetes is a growing global problem. Its prevalence is expected to grow from 190 million to 330 million by the year 2030.</p>
          <p>2008 is also a key year for Zactima, a potential new medicine for non-small cell lung cancer and the medullary cancer of the thyroid. All four second-line lung and thyroid registration studies, namely the ZEST, ZODIAC, ZEAL, and ZETA studies completed recruitment on schedule. These studies are powered to achieve benefits measured through progression free survival as the primary end outcome, with overall survival as a secondary endpoint.</p>
          <p>Event rates have slowed below predicted levels in the three lung studies, as you can see illustrated here on the ZODIAC graph. The studies remain blinded, and the code will only be broken after the completion of the studies. As a result of this event rate slowing, the results will consequently be delayed by one quarter, which means that data will still be available to us this year but the submission date has been revised to the first half of 2009. We still plan to submit the non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid regulatory applications in parallel in the revised timeframe.</p>
          <p>Continuing with the key developments in our Phase III program, the PLATO outcome study of AZD6140, a reversible platelet inhibitor being tested in acute coronary syndrome has completed recruitment, and we have entered the 12-month follow-up window. Approximately 18,600 patients have been enrolled to this study. And this is obviously a key milestone for this project as it means, subject to the event rates, we are on track to the EU and U.S. submissions planned for the second half of the next year.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Recentin, this oral VEGF receptor inhibitor is currently being assessed in a wide range of solid tumors, both by ourselves as well as through a CRADA with the U.S. National Cancer Institute. Back in February this year, we announced progression of this project into Phase III for first-line colorectal cancer. We are on track for the EU and U.S submissions in colon and recurrent glioblastoma, both of which are planned for 2010. In addition, there have been a number of external presentations showing encouraging data in other tumors, including renal, prostate, and ovarian cancers.</p>
          <p>With regards to lung, we're reviewing our strategy in this indication and plan to share the final data from the Phase II-III BR24 study at a meeting before the end of the year. All of our other Phase III projects are making good progress and are on track for their previously announced milestones. 4054, our endothelin A reception antagonist, is being developed in M1 and M0 hormone-resistant prostate cancer. We've plan to publish the Phase II data during the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>PN400, the project we are running with POZEN, is using a fixed combination of enteric coated naproxen and immediate release esomeprazole in patients who would receive NSAID for pain relief in arthritis. And this too is on track for its NDA submission, which is scheduled for the first half of 2009, as all Phase III pivotal trials have now fully enrolled.</p>
          <p>The Phase III program of Dapagliflozen, a potential first-in-class agent for type 2 diabetes, is progressing well with seven studies currently ongoing between ourselves and our partner BMS. The Phase IIb data presented at the ADA this year demonstrated that dapagliflozen induced glycosuria consistent with its mechanism of action, improved glycemic control, lowered weight from the baseline, showed little propensity to cause hypoglycemia, and was well tolerated over a 12-week period. Finally, CRESTOR/TriLipix, a combination of CRESTOR with Abbott's TriLipix, previously known Abbott 335, is on target for its NDA during the second half of next year.</p>
          <p>In the past six months, we have two additions to our Phase III portfolio. Firstly, MEDI-561, a potential first-in-class inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 being developed together with Infinity, is planned to commence a Phase III registration trial in refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors, so called GIST, this quarter. In addition to this orphan indication, a program of Phase II trials in a number of tumors is ongoing.</p>
          <p>And then finally in Phase III, the latest small molecule entry to our pipeline, AZD0837. 0837 is a once-daily oral anticoagulant; it's a selective and reversible direct thrombin inhibitor. It is being investigated for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation. As I'm sure you know, atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, with approximately 7 million patients worldwide diagnosed today, whilst its prevalence is increasing to an estimated 12 million patients expected by the year 2020.</p>
          <p>Atrial fibrillation patients have a five-fold increased risk of stroke. Anticoagulation is effective treatment, but warfarin, as shown in this graph, is hard to control and has serious limitations such as an increased risk of bleeding, a narrow therapeutic window, and numerous food and drug interactions, such that many patients who should be anticoagulated today are not.</p>
          <p>So, what do we know about 0837? It has been extensively and intensively investigated in preclinical and clinical trials, details of which are on this slide. More than 900 atrial fibrillation patients have been dosed to date, with the longest exposure being 16 months. We have demonstrated a positive overall benefit-risk profile for 0837 when compared with a vitamin K antagonist such Warfarin in the prevention of stroke in patients with AF.</p>
          <p>As you might expect from our Exanta experience, we have scrutinized the tolerability in general and the liver effects in particular. Our comparative Phase II study showed that 0837 was well tolerated and no excess liver risk was seen. We are confident that there is a considerable opportunity for AZD0837. It could be a highly effective medicine that strikes the right balance between preventing stroke and risk of bleeding, because there is a predictable relationship between dosage and blood levels, while at the same time it has a low PK variability. Our Exanta experience, as well as our biomed market capability and the extensive modeling conducted, have proved very useful in selecting the proposed dose in AF patients.</p>
          <p>The extended release formulation is once-daily with no relevant food and low-to-moderate drug interactions. Most importantly, it reduces the plasma peak-to-trough variation, which we see as key to safe, predictable anticoagulation. We plan to start recruitment into Phase III this year and we expect to present Phase IIb data next year.</p>
          <p>Although we support all of our marketed products, I would now just like to highlight four of them as the most important lifecycle management programs, starting with Seroquel. This is a large and comprehensive clinical development program that has delivered differentiated data providing a strong platform for SEROQUEL XR growth. As you can see from this slide, there has been tremendous progress in our regulatory activities since I last presented at the beginning of the year. The list of submissions delivered is extensive; the two remaining submissions to be delivered are SEROQUEL XR for bipolar maintenance in the United States, and for generalized anxiety order in Europe. They are both on track to meet our fourth quarter 2008 timeline. The slide also lists approvals and PDUFA dates. Approvals are beginning to come through, and as the claims breadth increases beyond schizophrenia, we can further establish the XR in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Iressa is the first and only EGF-targeted therapy to demonstrate survival as good as single agent chemotherapy in pretreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer, with better tolerability and superior quality of life to the chemotherapy. In May 2008, an MAA was submitted to the European Medicines Agency seeking approval for Iressa as a treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in patients who have been pretreated with platinum-containing chemotherapy. If approved, this will offer these patients another much-needed treatment option.</p>
          <p>The other key recent study for Iressa is IPASS, which stands for Iressa Pan-Asian Study, conducted in Japan and across Southeast Asia. IPASS exceeded its primary objective and demonstrated superior progression-free survival for Iressa compared to intravenous carboplatin/paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy. In addition, Iressa again demonstrated a more favorable tolerability profile and superior quality of life to the chemotherapy.</p>
          <p>IPASS is an open label randomized parallel group study, which enrolled 1,217 clinically selected Asian patients with advanced non-small lung cancer who had not received prior chemotherapy, whose tumors were adenocarinomas, and who had either never smoked or were long-term ex-smokers. The full data are still being analyzed and detailed results of this exciting study will be presented at a forthcoming medical congress.</p>
          <p>Supplemental NDAs were submitted in the U.S. for Symbicort for use in COPD and for pediatric asthma, specifically 6- to 11-year-olds, in April and June respectively. We are also on track to file supplemental data for the pMDI formulation in Europe for asthma and COPD later this quarter.</p>
          <p>And last but by no means least of the lifecycle programs that I want to cover today is CRESTOR. Back in March, we announced the early closure of JUPITER due to unequivocal evidence of efficacy. We aim to present the results of the study at the American Heart meeting this coming November. You will also hear the results of the GISSI heart failure study, the independent outcome study of CRESTOR in unselected heart failure patients, at the ESC meeting in September. And finally on CRESTOR, the statin study, a direct head-to-head comparison between CRESTOR and atorvastatin which is looking at plaque progression and regression, is ongoing and actively recruiting.</p>
          <p>Let me focus in now our R&amp;D productivity and the overall pipeline picture. During the first half of the year we've continued our efforts to improve our speed, quality, and cost efficiency. This is paying off as we are seeing clear evidence of a stronger portfolio which is progressing faster without cost increases. In January, we guided you towards a high-single-digit year-on-year R&amp;D increase. Our improving productivity and efficiency, together with portfolio changes such as an early end to JUPITER and RECENTIN in lung cancer, lead me to lower that guidance to low to mid single digits as an increase for this year. We are doing more and moving faster whilst controlling the cost base.</p>
          <p>Focusing our attention on Phase I as an example, we reduced our cycle times considerably since 2006, as you can see from the graph, and are already close to achieving our 2010 Phase I target of 10 months. This has been coupled with a significant reduction in our project costs, as we're stopping failing projects earlier, and for those that do progress we're seeing a reduction of approximately a third versus 2006 figures in Phase 1. It is these efficiency benefits, coupled with our restructuring efforts and portfolio changes, that have led to the revised 2008 guidance.</p>
          <p>So looking at our pipeline today, it now includes 143 projects, including 100 projects in the clinical phase of development. Since the last update on the 31st of January this year, 20 projects have progressed to their next phase, including seven molecules entering first human testing. Fifteen compounds have been added from discovery research, whilst three have been withdrawn. It's worth noting that discovery is playing an active role in improving the productivity and speed of the whole R&amp;D process.</p>
          <p>So in summary, as you can see from this bar chart, we have built a stronger and more balanced pipeline. We are seeing clear evidence of delivery of the strategy we announced two years ago, and we are on track to deliver our 2010 targets. We've achieved the portfolio breadth we require to launch on averaged two NCEs per year from 2010 onwards. We have more than doubled our Phase III pipeline since 2006, and we're building our Phase II portfolio.</p>
          <p>The flow of projects from Phase I to Phase II is clearly visible and indicates a dynamic shift in the composition of our pipeline. At the same time, our discovery and early development productivity has increased in order to sustain our future portfolio growth. Of course we can still get better; in particular we need to continue to build on mid-phase portfolio through progressions and in-licensing.</p>
          <p>At the end of last year, we mentioned an unprecedented level of Phase IIb decisions that will occur this year. So far we've had three positive progressions and are expecting ten other than project decisions before the end of 2008. By this time next year, that bow-wave of projects should have led to a considerable strengthening of Phase IIb as the current Phase III projects move into registration.</p>
          <p>I believe we've demonstrated real progress and evidence of improvement on many fronts. However, we can't afford to stand still, and we will seek to continuously improve with the same vigor and intensity until we have met and exceeded all expectations.</p>
          <p>We thank you for your attention, and I would now like to hand over to David Brennan to summarize.</p>

          <p>Great, John, thank you. And thanks to you Simon as well. Now, just to let you all on the line know, we are going to go to the Q&amp;A session in just a couple of minutes, but I've been asked by the conference operator to remind you, <mark type="operator instructions" />. I have a couple of quick summary comments, and then we will go to the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>As I said, before we take that first question, let me just wrap up the formal remarks. I think that John's presentation has captured the real sense of momentum that has been building in R&amp;D. That said, I would echo John's important comments that the pipeline remains a work in progress, and in the end what really counts is advancing these projects through regulatory approval and on to the market. And that's the next phase of what we're looking forward to.</p>
          <p>John also cited the great strides being made in productivity and cost efficiencies in R&amp;D. And I must say we are achieving that throughout AstraZeneca. And as I said in my opening remarks, we are on track to deliver the target of $1.4 billion in savings by 2010. And finally, as you heard from Simon's presentation, despite the challenges in the marketplace we continue to deliver on our financial targets. We have grown sales despite the generic inroads to Toprol-XL. We further improved operating margin. We're generating strong cash flow, and we have announced an increased to the interim dividend. The end result being that we are on track to deliver our increased earnings per share target for the full year.</p>
          <p>So, with that I will open the floor up to your questions. And as I said, <mark type="operator instructions" />.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the Q&amp;A session, why don't we go to the line to Andrew Baum from Morgan Stanley. Andrew, welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. I know that you dedicated three pages to 0837 in your PowerPoint presentation. Three quick questions on that. First, as far as I'm aware I think this is the fourth small-molecule antithrombotic to go into Phase III clinical trials in AF, and these trials aren't cheap, 200, 300 million. How are you thinking about risk-adjusted ROI in terms of this investment, and given you are late to the party?</p>
          <p>Second question, as far as I am aware this is the first antithrombotic to have gone directly into AF without jumping through the hoops of orthopedic, which may potentially be considered derisking to some degree. What additional risks are you taking on by this new development paradigm? And then my last question is, if memory serves me correctly, in the Phase IIa trial, there was an elevation in creatinine at some of the dosage. What have you seen in the Phase IIb data, and additionally have you looked patients with renal impairments, as many as these patients invariably will have? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Andrew. Thank you. I'm going to just go right over to John. I mean, we know this marketplace from our experience with Exanta very well, and recognize what the characteristics of a successful product could look like. So John, why don't you talk about the profile and what we're trying to accomplish.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Andrew. As far as the Phase III program is concerned, yes, they are not cheap, but obviously we do look to make sure that what we're doing makes sense from every perspective, both technically and commercially. There are two factor tenase and an oral thrombin inhibitor ahead of us, but we have looked at them very carefully and we think they are not perfect, and we think there are things we can do that actually are smarter and can learn from our Exanta experience that will allow us to do a good program and bring a very competitive molecule through to the marketplace.</p>
          <p>For instance, we actually went back and developed the extended release formulation because we wanted to get rid of the peak-trough variability and to be able to really control the level of anticoagulation, so that you can walk that tightrope between controlling the emboli and not getting bleeds. As far as going direct into atrial fibrillation is concerned, our experience from Exanta was that actually, going into short-term indications initially didn't give you the kind of information you needed to be more comfortable about the risk-benefit of the product in chronic therapy in AF. And in fact, in many ways it got in the way because the way orthopedic surgery is treated is very different on different sides of the Atlantic; there are different dosage regimes as well to be used in that circumstance around surgery, and we actually felt it was better to go to what we thought were the key population, direct.</p>
          <p>And then your memory is good, we did a see a small transient elevation in creatinine in the Phase IIa studies. That is repeated throughout the program, it is completely reversible, it is what is seen with a number of agents, and is not actually a renal-toxic phenomenon, it is a straightforward creatinine phenomenon. And unlike other agents that have very significant changes with creatinine that are symptomatical <mark type="inaudible" /> of renal impairment, this is not the case here. And there are a number of drugs in the marketplace that do exactly the same, and there is no clinical significance.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, John, thank you. Andrew, thank you. We will go to Marcel Brand, and then there is an e-mail question from Kevin Scotcher we will take after that. Marcel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for taking my question. First question on SG&amp;A. Comparing the first quarter of this year to the second quarter, I guess, emerging market investments and the MedImmune SG&amp;A that's affected both quarters, and in particular MedImmune, if I recall, had always higher SG&amp;A in the first and the second quarter. So although forces were also in place in the first quarter, so, we have a big jump here from Q1 to Q2. And I am wondering to what extent that has been driven by those legal charges, and if you could maybe explain how big those are?</p>
          <p>Second question is, what have allowed you to file saxagliptin earlier in Europe? And the third question, did you have any discussions with regulators on your Phase III development program in general with 0837 so far? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I'll make a comment about SG&amp;A. Generally, I do really think you need to look at the first half of the year as the guidepost for that, I think we are going to see variations from quarter to quarter; you picked up the annualization of taking MedI for the whole year has an impact, and I think when Simon was making his comments, he pointed out that we have made some incremental investment in the emerging markets, as well as there were some legal expenses. But Simon, would you like to add anything about the first and second quarter SG&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you've largely covered it, David. I think first I should start by saying that we have a restructuring program, as you all know, that is driving improvements in our SG&amp;A efficiency. But in addition to that, we have got a wide range of other productivity improvement programs underway. And these are all delivering targeted reductions in SG&amp;A around our business. For example, in our Western European sales forces, our IS infrastructure and overhead expenses generally, that that program remains firmly on track.</p>
          <p>You will also recall as we set out our guidance for the year that we explained how these efficiencies in SG&amp;A will be offset by the incorporation of MedI's SG&amp;A for the full year. And, Marcel, I think you were drawing attention rightly to the fact that in the second quarter we have the full year incorporation of MedI, but obviously given its seasonality, very little sales from MedI carrying that. So the second quarter does represent a slightly anomalous picture for looking at overall trends in SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>So, key point, driving improvements in SG&amp;A, offsetting the incorporation of MedI, it's fair to say we've made increased investments in our emerging markets relative to our initial expectations for the year to drive growth and profit and value in those markets. As I stressed in my talk earlier &#x2013; in my remarks earlier, this is profitable growth for us. And where we see further opportunities to invest for faster growth, we will pursue them. And in addition, there have been some increased legal expenses; part of this is phasing, no single significant item. I think just a reflection perhaps of the increasing costs in litigation, particularly in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, Simon. Thank you. I think that does give a bit more detail. John, there were two questions, one was about the earlier saxagliptin/Onglyza filing in the EU, why were we able to do that? And the other was did we have any regulatory discussions around 0837? So let me give those to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay, David. As far as saxa is concerned, our original plan was to file later in Europe based on our earlier understanding that extra data was going to be required for Europe. What happened is that as things have matured around this particular class, and as we've developed a very good database of 4000 patients with a very good benefit-risk ratio, we felt more confidence to go earlier. We had discussions with the rapporteur and the co-rapporteur, and on the basis of those discussions made our filing, which I stressed has not just been filed but has actually been validated by the EU and therefore accepted for filing at this point.</p>
          <p>As far as 0837 is concerned, you can bet your life we have had discussions with the regulators, particularly with the FDA, significant discussions about the size and powering of the</p>
          <p>Phase III and what the endpoints should be, and of course sharing with them the Phase II data. So we are going into Phase III with our eyes widely open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, John. Thank you, Marcel. Thank you for your questions. I will take an e-mail question here and then I'll go to Graham Perry, who is on our line two. But let me take the e-mail question first. That's from Kevin Scotcher at HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is, does your guidance range include a positive outcome as your assumption to the Pulmicort Respules Citizen's Petition and summary judgment in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, as you all know, there are number of moving parts within our business that we try to accommodate the guidance around. This has been a consideration, and maybe I can ask Simon to comment on that. I would say more generally, the issues around the challenges we are receiving on intellectual property, as you all know, are now very different than they used to be. I think we now consider this part of how we need to operate regularly to do business, to be able to accommodate the potential ups and downs of the scenarios. We are very confident in our intellectual property, but we have a lot of considerations, as you heard at the beginning of the year, around Nexium and Seroquel, and now as we look to the future. But Simon, you want to pick this one up specifically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The $0.30 range in our guidance reflects the range of uncertainties, both upsides and downsides, that we see around our business plans for the year. And one such uncertainty would be alternative outcomes to the ongoing Pulmicort Respules litigation and, needless to say, we will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property and rights in that matter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. Thank you. I am going to go to Graham Perry. Next, Graham from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. I was just wondering if you could give us a bit of a feel for the currency sensitivity on cost lines that you are expecting for the remainder of the year? So, for example, if FX rate stayed as they were at the moment, should we expect to see an improvement &#x2013; continuing improvement in gross margin in reported terms? Secondly, I was just wondering on the ZACTIMA, when you will communicate the data to the market. So I think you had previously said the guidance would be &#x2013; you had communicated something around the time of filing, but could we still hear something before the end of this year if you actually have the data in-house yourselves?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly on 0837, I was just wondering if could you actually remind us a little bit more detail on the Phase IIb data, end-points used and how that product compares versus Warfarin? And as you go into Phase III, you're looking for non-inferiority or superiority here?</p>
          <p>And then finally on the drug-drug interactions, you said low potential for drug-drug interactions. I was just wondering which drugs you do see an interaction with? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Graham, that's plenty &#x2013; some of that is going to go to John. We'll go to that in a minute. I think the sensitivity of cost line to currency, we've decided to play it pretty straightforward on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But why don't I ask Simon to just comment on how we have handled so far to make it clear, and what our expectations are for the rest of the year as to how we would handle it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sure. Graham, thanks for the question. I mean, we set out our guidance, as you know, for the full year based on fourth quarter '07. And we have added to date $0.12 of currency benefit realized to date for the first half, and the remainder for the second half is set back at the quarter four '07 guidance rate. In terms of looking ahead for the second half of the year, we've provided in the pack today, but also on the website, a table which sets out movements in sales and earnings for a 10% relative movement in our currencies versus the dollar. You'll be glad to hear we backtest that little ready reckoner against our results, and it proves to be a good predictor.</p>
          <p>So I would simply advise you to apply that to whatever your currency assumptions are for the second half, to get a handle on the impact on sales and earnings, to give you a bit more granularity and to help you in that analysis. If you look at the schedules on page eight for the second quarter and page nine for the first half in our press release, we have shown the relative movements in the cost as a percent of sales, in actual and in constant currency terms, and that might give you also an indication of at least relative movements for the first half. Hope that helps, Graham.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>That helps.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent, Simon, thank you. And then John, there were a couple of questions, the one around ZACTIMA and the day-to-day timing, and then the 0837 on the IIb data, the superiority versus non-inferiority question, and then the interactions on drug-drug as well as our experience in IIa, so. If can give a picture on those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, briefly, Graham, from ZACTIMA's perspective, we will see the data in-house during the course of the fourth quarter and we'll put the program together. Therefore, we're likely to be able to say something about the program at the annual results. I don't know whether we will be able to say anything about it before then, but certainly our intention would be, at the annual results a the latest.</p>
          <p>As far as 0837 is concerned, you asked a series of questions, I think the best thing to say is we are going to be putting the Phase IIb data into the public domain next year, and you will get a chance to look at the issues that we address there. As far as Phase II is concerned, there is a good program, we have done a very wide kinetic review looking at potential interactions with both food and drugs, and we will share that with you next year as well.</p>
          <p>Phase III, the power of the program, we are looking there at obviously both power to differentiate in terms of bleeding and power to make sure that we are as good as well-controlled anticoagulated patients, and therefore non-inferior in terms of efficacy. We will no doubt be filing the protocols for the Phase III program, again, probably around the turn of the year and you will have a chance at that point to look at those protocols.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brian Bourdot, Deutsche Bank. A few questions on the R&amp;D side for John Patterson, and couple of questions for Simon Lowth, please. Firstly, on RECENTIN, are you able to give us any color about the dose used in some of these other cancers, like we have glioblastoma, renal, prostate, compared with lung cancer in which we saw an imbalance of toxicity?</p>
          <p>Secondly, Iressa, the INTEREST study, would you potentially be able to file that in the U.S.? And also, would you perhaps look to be launching CRESTOR in markets like Spain and Germany following the decision, do you have any claims there?</p>
          <p>Just on the financial side, I guess, Simon, I was wondering if you can us some kind of ballpark number in terms of how important legal charges were this quarter compared with last year? And also you talked about cost savings, about how costs savings in R&amp;D were running ahead of your expectations. Will you just stop after you achieve the targeted cost savings, or do you see perhaps any potential to deliver above target? Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Okay, that was plenty. I'll let John think about the cancer questions for a minute. And I didn't quite catch the first part of it, I don't know if John got it all. If not we may need you to repeat part of it. I would just say around the approach that we have taken on the cost savings programs, and certainly Simon can comment more as well, but I think our mindset around this is one of continuous improvement. We expect within our organization that we are going to continue to be able to drive efficiency in the way we operate and the things that we do. We are not trying to cost-cut our way to success; we are trying to create efficiencies and a mindset within this organization about what it takes to run it really efficiently. But John, let me go over to you, there was the Iressa U.S. question, the plan &#x2013; any plans for CRESTOR, Spain and Germany, and that initial cancer question, which was ...</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which was RECENTIN dose in other tumors, I think, David. Okay. So, let me try and go through this. RECENTIN dose in other tumors, or RECENTIN dose generally. We have used RECENTIN at doses between 20 and 45 milligrams in a number of different studies. The most commonly used dose has been 30 milligrams, and occasionally 45. So the bottom line is, the doses still need to come down, especially in combination with chemotherapy. What we find is it is an incredibly potent agent, and when you give continuous VEGF inhibition with this agent as you do, we have to watch the tolerability. So the bottom line is, I think the renal data has already been published, and so you should be able to see the dose from what was published at ASCO, and the other tumors will be dosed in that range.</p>
          <p>As far as Iressa and INTEREST is concerned, that study is primarily going to be of value in Europe and in Japan and the rest of the world. We do not expect that we will file an NDA in the United States. And, at this point in time, we have no plans to file an NDA where comparative benefits, while non-inferiority such as this, is not recognized by the oncology division at the FDA, who are looking to have an overall survival benefit for the agent.</p>
          <p>And then CRESTOR, in terms of the countries were it's not yet sold in Europe, which was I think Norway, Spain and Germany, we are in the process of starting up a repeat EU MR submission, which will actually include those three countries together with Poland and Malta.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, John, thank you. And Simon, would like to comment on the legal, this year versus last year, and maybe the trend we are seeing here as much as anything, and then anything else you wanted to add about the cost savings in our approach on these programs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay. Brian, we do not separately disclose legal costs. What I would say is that they are up year-on-year. And I suspect, David, in terms of trends, that is probably a trend that we will see continuing and across the sector.</p>
          <p>Turning back to the cost and productivity improvement, we are well on track as I said earlier on our restructuring program, which the goal for this year is to get two-thirds of the $1.4 billion benefit into the P&amp;L during the course of the year. We are well on track to do that. But I think it's important to say, and I think David made this point, driving productivity is not simply about a periodic restructuring. It's about instituting continuous improvement in everything that we do. And I have been impressed with the progress that we have made during the first half of this year in that regard.</p>
          <p>I think you saw it very visibly in R&amp;D. You can see we are delivering against our discovery and development pipeline, and doing so at levels of cost and productivity which passed our initial expectations at the beginning of the year. It is a great evidence of the progress that we are making. And yes, there is going to be more opportunity for us, and those opportunities won't disappear; we will keep on finding new way to doing what we do better.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's good, thank you, Simon. Thank you, Brian, for your question. I'm going to do a quick question from e-mail here, and then I will go to Jo Walton at Lehman Brothers. But the e-mail question is can you &#x2013; given better-than-expected cash flows, could you comment on the potential to accelerate share buybacks next fiscal year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, so, pretty straightforward one. I mean the Board takes the decision around share buybacks as, we look at the entire expected picture for the year, including the cash flow. So it's not a decision we would make until the review with the Board at the beginning of next year, and something that we would announce with our year-end results. And before that we won't be making any additional comments on it. Okay, let's go to Jo Walton at Lehman Brothers. Jo?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, three quick questions. Firstly on CRESTOR, your sales in the U.S. grew substantially more than the prescription numbers. I wonder if you can tell us a little bit more about the dynamics there. This has been a very cost-sensitive market, if you can just tell us a little bit more about that? Looking at Symbicort in the U.S., and in fact at all of those products, the market doesn't seems to be growing very strongly. Is this an issue that patients aren't going to the doctor, perhaps because of the weather, or are the prescription numbers that we're seeing screwed up by high levels of sampling perhaps? And finally just on the restructuring charge, can you give us an idea of how much more of the charge is likely to be incurred during 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll let Simon work that one through while we go back to CRESTOR. I mean the dynamic in the CRESTOR &#x2013; in the U.S. market around CRESTOR, as you know, has to do with price. I think we have been pretty successful in retaining our position and our pricing in the U.S. Our net pricing is pro &#x2013; increased year-on-year. So we are not seeing that as a factor. There is some stocking that goes on back and forth between the quarters, but it is not something that we are going I think try to delineate each quarter exactly how much it was.</p>
          <p>So, Jo, we're driven by the prescription growth, by the atherosclerosis indication, by the positive momentum that is in that market that is pushing towards the branded products. Clearly with the difficulty a couple of our competitors have had, there has been some patients that have moved back and forth between the generic segment of the market and the branded segment, and we seem to be getting the preferential side of that. We're the only branded product that's grown in the market.</p>
          <p>So that's the picture with CRESTOR, and we are continuing to make sure we've got a competitive level of resourcing there so that we can drive it and continue to maintain our positioning in managed care and in other formularies.</p>
          <p>Regarding Symbicort, the feedback we've had from the &#x2013; our gang in the U.S. is that this is a slower allergy season, and has been for a while. I don't think that it's significantly impacted by sampling. We did have some discussion about it, but generally that just didn't seem to be any of the messaging that came through. Simon, was there anything more when we did the business review that struck you about the U.S. market for Symbicort?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think the &#x2013; that the past season doesn't seem to be as pronounced, and that appears to be affecting underlying demand to an extent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. And then the restructuring question, you want to talk about the rest of 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I mean the guidance for the year was that two-thirds of the remaining restructuring and synergy costs would be charged in 2008. We had an initial restructuring cost of 2 billion; we invested about a billion of that last year, two-thirds of the remainder, therefore in the sort of late 600 millions. That remains our guidance for the year. You will have deduced, Jo, that a little bit more of that is loaded into the second half than the first half of the year, given mid-200s for the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just wondered if it was being pushed further back. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jo, thanks for your question. I will go to Tim Franklin at Dresdner.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Firstly, on the emerging markets, you had a very strong performance there. Could you provide a view on the percentage of total sales coming from emerging markets, say within the next three or five years? And you also mentioned about the contributions faster than sales, what sort of margins are we &#x2013; is there relatively &#x2013; are we looking at here, and where could these go to? And then the second question is with relation to JUPITER, you mentioned that we probably hear the results at the AHA meeting, but are we likely to see any top line data before then, and when would you expect guidelines to change, once you actually see the data? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. Tim, thanks. On the emerging markets, without trying to put a forecast in place that would line up a percentage of the total business, given that it is growing at a rate significantly faster than the rest of our business, we do see it becoming a much more substantial part of it. I think it's really dependent upon the GDP growth in those markets and the development of the healthcare systems that enable people to participate differently than they have in the past.</p>
          <p>But our expectation is that those markets will continue to grow and that potentially more markets will come on-line, places in Southeast Asia &#x2013; places beyond China, if you go to places like Vietnam, Taiwan, if you go down to Latin America and look at the businesses that are &#x2013; the markets in Brazil and in Mexico and even some of the smaller markets, the rate of growth in the participation of people in general is greater than it's several ever been. And while some that maybe have a higher disproportionate amount of money paid out of pocket, the fact is that the branded products have a place there and we're getting good growth with products like Nexium and CRESTOR in some of those markets as well.</p>
          <p>So it is not just our old products, it's our new one. Simon, would you like to comment about the amount of profitability and the contribution to sales position and margins? We are not going to give out the specifics, but I think you're comfortable with...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think we are pleased with the profit contribution from our emerging markets. And as I said, we see that contribution in absolute and finished terms improving. The overall contribution today is not as a great as some of our more mature markets, and that reflects a combination of a couple of things. Firstly, we are investing strongly to build demand. And secondly, there are some differences in relative price levels. One of the benefits of continued strong growth is we are obviously getting more leverage off the fixed cost base that we have placed into these markets, and that's what's driving the improvements in contribution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Simon, thank you. There is a question on the e-mail about the effects of the partial retirement, Oh I'm sorry, John, I forgot JUPITER. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I couldn't possibly forget JUPITER. Okay. We're all very excited about JUPITER, but I need to put what's happening in perspective. We stopped the study two years early, and we are now collecting data on some 17,800 patients out of the 90,000 screened across 26 countries. It's a huge logistic exercise. And actually getting the database clean, finding all the people who were lost to follow-up, et cetera, within the time period that we have set ourselves to meet the American Heart deadline, is by itself a monumental task.</p>
          <p>So at this point in time, only the data monitoring committee and a small number of the investigators know the result, and a relatively small number of people. And until we have a clean database and we've analyzed it, we can't say anything about the likely outcomes in the way of guidelines, et cetera. So I think you'll just have to wait, and the chances of your seeing or hearing anything before American Heart I would say are virtually zero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. And there is an e-mail question and then I will go to Kevin Wilson. But first let me take this one quickly, it's from Stefan Wikholm, and the question is can we give some comments about the effects of the partial retirement of the Merck agreement. I think Simon went through some of the cash payout aspect of it in his reconciliation of what's happened to the cash position over the last year, but Simon do you want to just add exactly how this has affected us both strategically as well as financially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We made a payment of $2.6 billion to Merck, you saw that through the cash flow. That was the payment for the partial retirement of the Merck agreement. Merck chose not to exercise the first option; that is now on our right in 2010, and the second option in 2012. The partial retirement brings a number of benefits. The first is relief from contingent payments on the first tranche of products. And it also, subject to our exercises as the latter options, brings us strategic freedom from Merck to develop and partner and sell drugs within our therapeutic areas. The specific drugs and therapeutic areas are described in more detail in the annual reporting accounts, and in addition in our &#x2013; we have elaborated somewhat in the disclosure today.</p>
          <p>If I turn to what that means in terms of the P&amp;L effects, the relief from contingent payments effectively means that contingent cash payments that were running through the gross margin have been replaced by amortization charges. And as indicated I think at our last call, we have not taken any amortization charge which replaces a contingent payment that existed, we have not taken out as part of our core adjustment. However there is some amortization that we are &#x2013; a slight increase of amortization that you can see going through the SG&amp;A line. And that's shown in the schedules on page eight and page nine. So that's a slight reduction from earnings level at the reported line, but we net that out for core. At the overall gross margin level, it's broadly a wash perhaps a slight uptick to gross margin. But those are the financial implications.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Simon, thank you. Kevin, we will go to you now at Citi, and then to Marietta after you at Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Kevin Wilson?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. Three quick questions. Emerging markets growth of 20%, is that a good benchmark going forward, or might it accelerate? Secondly, CRESTOR in the rest of the world, you kindly talked about the opportunity in the remaining European markets. Are you now launched in all the markets in the world that matter or do you have some left? Just a bit of flavor on whether that could further move ahead?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, on Seroquel, Seroquel IR actually in the U.S. The trends have been a little interesting in terms of new prescription share recently. In particular it seemed like you were losing some share to abilify following that product getting an adjunct to depression indication. How do you read that, and is that an encouraging trend, should you get an approval for XR in depression, or is it something that's just going to chew away at the Seroquel IR franchise over time? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kevin. All right. Well, the emerging markets, your question about rate of growth is good, and it's difficult to benchmark it because we do see probably more fluctuation in some of those markets than we have seen in the established markets. I think our experience has been this high-teens double-digit growth is something that has been pretty consistent. But I must admit, some of these markets do slow down for a period of time a bit unexpectedly. So I have trouble putting a number on it in that respect, but it is certainly outpacing the developed markets by a few factors.</p>
          <p>On the CRESTOR, rest of the world more &#x2013; markets, our CRESTOR business in rest of world has been very successful, especially the launches in Japan and Australia where we have had significant market share accomplishments and penetration into the overall market, not just the branded segments of the market. I believe we are also approved in China, although I'm not sure the reimbursement is all worked out there yet, that will probably be next year, John says. So I wonder from a regulatory perspective, are there any other major markets that you're thinking of, John, that were pending in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The mutual recognition in Europe will include Spain and Norway for instance. And there's a potential uptick in China next year because they do a five-year cycle on the reimbursement committee, and 2009 is the year that the reimbursement committee is due to meet, and therefore a number of our products could potentially get reimbursement next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. And then the other question was about the position of Seroquel, and especially in depression and the IR formulation. And we have developed our extended-release formulation as the product to compete in that area, and while we are on the market currently, as we have said this would be a stepwise acceleration of the extended-release product. And starting with schizophrenia, which we are now promoting for but it is limited, but we will move into bipolar disorder next and have filed the data for the approvals for both the major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.</p>
          <p>So we see that over the course of the next year or so we will significantly expand the label and expect to be much more competitive. John, I don't know if maybe if you want to comment for a moment on the outcomes of the depression trials with Seroquel and the extended-release formulation, as well as the anxiety, because it certainly was a bit &#x2013; it was good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was more than good, it was outstanding, David. Normally when you do these studies, a fair percentage of them fail, even when you have positive controls in there to try and get rid of the placebo effect. We actually managed to get every single one of our anxiety studies came to a positive result, and all bar one of the depression studies came out positive. We look to the drug at the severe end of depression both as monotherapy and as adjunct to standard therapy. So again, compared with the abilify program in depression, we have the monotherapy, which they don't have.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Good, Kevin, thank you. Let's got to Marietta Miemietz at Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Marietta?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. A couple of quick financial questions, please. The first on the phasing of MedImmune costs of the course of the year, because looking at old MedImmune P&amp;L's they would actually charge the vast majority of their cost base into Q1 and Q4, in line with when they actually report most of their sales. Based on some comments you were making on SG&amp;A, I was just wondering whether in your accounting you have changed that, and the MedImmune cost is a lot more evenly spread over the course of year.</p>
          <p>And the second question is relating to the Merck arrangement. I think you had at one point said that as you move away from the joint venture, you are free to seek tax efficiencies, and I was just wondering if that is something that you can now envisage post the partial retirement, and how rapidly that could potentially be coming through. And finally, I was wondering if you could just give us very, very rough flavor off the CRESTOR lawsuit timelines in the U.S. Do you think there could be a summary judgment, do you think that the full trial could have proceeded before the Waxman-Hatch stay expires? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, certainly go to Simon for the first two on the MedI cost phasing versus &#x2013; quarter one and quarter four versus spread, as well as the Merck tax efficiency one. I am quite familiar with it, so go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On the MedImmune phasing, the SG&amp;A costs, there's really no seasonal phasing of note within the MedI cost base. There is though a growing trend within the R&amp;D simply that we've been continuing to step up our investment in our biologics investment &#x2013; in biologics R&amp;D, and that tends to mean that we'll see some progression in the R&amp;D cost in MedI over the course of the year. The question on the Merck arrangements, the partial retirement gave us greatest strategic freedom; that's principally in the development of therapeutic areas, the compounds and science within it. There is no particular tax issues that that enables, that I would draw out, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Great. Thank you, Marietta. Thank you for your question. I'm going to take a &#x2013; there is an e-mail question then we will take our last &#x2013; oh, I am sorry, the CRESTOR question, I forgot I have it written here. Our position on the CRESTOR intellectual property is not dissimilar what our others are, which is the &#x2013; we believe we have got strong intellectual property, we have filed suits against it and started the 30-month period where we will fight it out, and the discovery schedule is to start in &#x2013; scheduled for February 2010, so that's the beginning of the parts of the process relative to summary judgments and things like that that yes, where it's really &#x2013; there is no way to comment on that.</p>
          <p>I think our position on this is pretty straightforward. We think we've got solid, valid intellectual property and we will defend it through the entire process. So we will take Mattias as the last question. But let me do the e-mail question first. It's just a quick one, why we are keeping gross margin guidance unchanged. This is from Marcus Litkin at Electa. Given our strong performance &#x2013; Simon, you want to comment on that, since we didn't change our guidance in that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I mean we are ahead on gross margin for the half year, as you all have seen. And we're pleased with that. But it reflects principally volume and mix effects. But also some earlier phasing in of the operational cost improvement program that we have underway. Given this is primarily phasing and mix fluctuations, we've retained our gross margin guidance for the year, but obviously our EPS range does reflect some range of outcomes for the business for the year, upside and downside.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. And good afternoon. Firstly on Symbicort, a question on whether AstraZeneca has filed the requested additional safety information that FDA had requested? And secondly, does AstraZeneca have an idea on when the advisory committee discussing safety on long-acting beta antagonists will take place later this year? And lastly, has this safety probe somehow affected your U.S. launch of Symbicort?</p>
          <p>And then also, David, several pharmacies, they obviously have talked recently about the need for differentiation and specifically emphasized interest for consumer business and access to generics in their offerings. And as the world is changing, does AstraZeneca management team see a need for change of its strategy as well, or is this existing strategy the one to pursue for the coming years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. I will let John go to Symbicort in a minute. But let me take the last question first. Right now we have been very clear that we we're not pursuing a global generics strategy. We look at opportunities for branded products in markets locally, and will execute against those. But they tend to be local strategies and not something that operate at a global level, and they really are based on the conditions in local markets.</p>
          <p>The situation in India for example is very different than what we see in China or in Mexico to have some branded generics in our line. So that's really opportunistic, we're still very focused on the human health research-based pharmaceutical business that we have at hand, and the one that we are pushing very hard to become much more productive and bring more meaningful differentiated products to the market.</p>
          <p>So we don't have any plans to move beyond that. In the diagnostics area, we are really look at diagnostics when they are closely aligned with something appropriate for one of our products that are either in development or coming to the market. Again, something that would be related to our business as suppose to a change in the business strategy. So, John, last question on Symbicort to you around safety and where we are?</p>

          <p>Right. Okay. This has been a pretty hot topic, not just with the FDA; multiple health authorities actually have requested larval safety data over the past year, including MHRA, FDA, and Health Canada. In fact, MHRA has made a statement on the safety, and that's one which is consistent with our position. So the bottom line is, we actually have submitted our data to the FDA, and we expect or anticipate &#x2013; but it's entirely in their gift and advisory committee discussions &#x2013; sometime in the third or fourth quarter this year.</p>
