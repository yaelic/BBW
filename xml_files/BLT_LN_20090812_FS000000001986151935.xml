          <p>Ladies and gentlemen welcome to today's Presentation of BHP Billiton's Preliminary Results for our Financial Year Ended June 2009. I'm speaking to you today from London. Alex Vanselow, our CFO is in Sydney and we also welcome our audience in Johannesburg.</p>
          <p>Before we begin today, I'd like to point you to the disclaimer. I remind you as always that it's important in relation to the material that we are going to present today. I'd like to start off by giving you a brief overview of results then I will hand over to Alex. And then I will come back and give you a few more thoughts.</p>
          <p>2009 has probably been the most challenging year that I can recall. Within the 12 month period we went from exuberance and an environment where the industry could not satisfy rampant commodity demand to one in which demand simply evaporated; and then more recently we've seen stabilization. Our results today show that we're certainly are not immune to these events, but they also demonstrate that BHP Billiton's unique proposition based around low cost assets and our strong balance sheet, unchanged strategy, place us in the unique position to deliver shareholder value over the long term.</p>
          <p>I will talk a little later about how we see the demand outlook, but let me begin with our financial results. Our underlying EBITDA was down 21% to US$22 billion and underlying EBIT was down 25% to US$18 billion. On a percentage terms, this means that our results are materially lower than our 2008 results. In absolute terms and in the context of the environment that we've experienced, $18 billion of EBIT is a very significant result.</p>
          <p>Attributable profit for the year was US$10.7 billion before exceptional items, down 30%. Earnings per share was down 30% to 192.7 U.S. dollar cents per share before exceptional items.</p>
          <p>The two highlights for me in today's presentation is the fact that we achieved record cash flows of US$18.9 billion, and secondly, an EBIT margin of 40%. Both of these results prove the strength of our asset portfolio in the face of what has been very challenging external market conditions. As a result of this exceptionally strong cash flow, our balance sheet remains strong with net gearing at 12%.</p>
          <p>I said at that the outset that 2009 was the most challenging year that I can recall. Although economic conditions have stabilized over the last three months or so, we do believe that the true picture of the underlying demand for commodity products will not be visible until 2010. On the back of this outlook, therefore, we have announced today that we've maintained our dividend on a half year and half year basis at US$0.41 cents per share, which brings the dividend for the full year at US$0.82 per share, which is up 17% on an annual basis.</p>
          <p>Now as always, I'd like to begin with the review of our operating performance and begin that with safety. Our workforce is made up of very, very talented people who make this company what it is. I'm saddened to report that during the past year we have lost seven colleagues through fatalities at our operations. A single injury is unacceptable and these fatalities highlight the need that we continue to have much more to do to protect the health and safety of our people. To this end, we have undertaken a variety of measures, including the review of our management procedures and systems.</p>
          <p>More encouragingly, seven of our customer set to groups, out of 10, reported improvements in the injury performance; 24 sights completed 12 months without an injury which is something like 23 million man hours worked without an injury.</p>
          <p>On the operating side, we took a number of measures during the year to adjust our production as demand, particularly in the early part of this calendar year, fell. These actions included the indefinite suspension of our Ravensthorpe Nickel Operations as well as production curtailments in our iron ore pellet, metallurgical coal and manganese operations.</p>
          <p>We also decided not to proceed at this time with some longer dated growth options and made similar decisions on lower priority activities. As we always do, regardless of where we are in the cycle, we continue to review our business on a continued basis to ensure that we're well-placed for current and future demand levels.</p>
          <p>As I said, our low-cost, asset-based generated record cash flows, which has importantly allowed us to continue to invest in our business for future growth consistent with our strategy. Our capital spend for the year amounted to some US$11 billion. The capital program delivered first production in six projects and five of these projects were in petroleum and contributed to the annual production record that our petroleum business achieved.</p>
          <p>We continue to manage our business for long-term value and we approved four new projects during year, including one very significant one in iron ore, and three in petroleum. In addition, in June, we announced that we'd reached a non-binding agreement with Rio Tinto to establish production joint venture covering the assets &#x2013; the iron ore assets of both companies in Western Australia.</p>
          <p>This joint venture provides an enormous opportunity to achieve scale benefits from what is a Tier 1 resource province. These scale benefits will be achieved by maximizing the resource utilization and optimizing the current and the planned infrastructure and mining footprints of both sets of assets.</p>
          <p>The shareholders of the companies will share in the synergies, which we have estimated in excess of US$10 billion in value. Importantly, because of the unique overlap of the assets and infrastructure resources and so on in the case of this asset set, these very substantial benefits are only available through the combination of these two asset sets.</p>
          <p>We're currently in the process of drafting detailed agreements and we aim to which we aim to conclude later on this year and we obviously are jointly preparing for the various regulatory processes that need to be completed. And our expectation is that the JV will be finalized around mid-2010. We believe that this joint venture will be uniquely positioned due to its advantageous resource base, infrastructure, as well as proximity to customers.</p>
          <p>Now let me hand over to Alex to take you through the details of our financial results. Alex?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marius, and welcome everyone. Marius had already covered most of the key financial metrics of our results, so instead of going through them again I'll move directly into my favorite slide that some of you will be familiar with and revisit our strategy. I think that's especially important in the current economic environment.</p>
          <p>We first showed a Jackson Pollock chart a few years ago to help investors understand the essence of BHP Billiton strategy. During the good times of the past years, when the cyclical nature of our industry was considered to be an issue of the past and Stronger for Longer was the new motto driving industry behavior, it was very difficult to illustrate the value and strength of our strategy.</p>
          <p>The economic roller coaster ride of the last 12 months, although painful for all of us, provided a formidable test to the strength and resilience of our well-founded strategy. In a split second, we moved from higher prices and insatiable demand to free-falling prices and consumer de-stocking. Concurrently, we were faced with persistently high input costs and the hangover of years of increases in labor and royalty rates.</p>
          <p>So in short, we were in one of the most volatile years in the commodity industry. Our underlying EBIT margin which is the &#x2013; represented by the black line on the chart, remain at a very strong 40%. And even if you just look at the past six months, our margins still remain at above the 30% level.</p>
          <p>The reason I like this slide so much is that despite its abstract look, it clearly shows two very important realities. First is that individual commodities are indeed cyclical and volatile; and second, the diversification with quality and scale can provide a natural buffer to volatility and reduce the cyclical impact.</p>
          <p>The value of our commodity diversification is also evident in the following slide. As you can see, Iron Ore, Metallurgical Coal and Energy Coal all achieved record underlying EBIT. And to some extent, this strong performance helped to offset the impact of the lower underlying EBIT in our other customer sector groups.</p>
          <p>This year more than ever before, we had to remain very diligent in the way we review and manage our portfolio. You will recall that during our interim results in February, I noted that our post-tax exceptional items had a negative impact of $3.5 billion. In addition to this, we have recognized $1.3 billion of post-exceptional items in the second half. The majority of these charges were in relation to the announced sale of the Yabulu, the scale back of the operations at Nickel West, and the cessation of the Maruwai metallurgical coal development; and full details for this are available in our news release.</p>
          <p>The extreme range of economic conditions that led to these decisions also materially impacted the results on an operating level. This next waterfall chart is a good summary of the key factors impacting our results over the past 12 months. In this slide, you can see that our profit variance was significantly impacted by lower realized prices.</p>
          <p>This is particularly evident when you are comparing prices for the two halves. In the first half of the financial year, the price variance had a positive impact of $3 billion. This is in stark contrast with the negative impact of almost $7 billion when comparing the second halves of both financial years. Despite the recent recovering prices, commodity prices at the end of 2009 financial year were still about 20 to 60% below the start of the financial year.</p>
          <p>Another key driver of underlying EBIT variance is volumes. And in the case of volumes, this is mainly due to lower copper and manganese sales, both of which were well reflected to the market. Copper production was significantly impacted by the decline in grade but also technical issues at the Laguna Seca mill, the SAG mill in Escondida. The 45 day planned maintenance to replace the starter coils on the mill has been completed successfully. And we expect a more reliable mill operation from this current quarter on.</p>
          <p>Now with manganese, that's a good example of how we took swift and responsible actions to respond to change in market conditions. Very early in the downturn, we benefited from in-depth market understanding provided by our centralizing market &#x2013; centralized marketing structure. Where there was a lack of demand for our product, we were able to very rapidly adjust production and stockpiles to meet our customer requirements. But however, if you look at iron ore's case, we were in a position to use our market knowledge to continue to sell our full production despite the market turn in the December 2008 quarter.</p>
          <p>Our participation in the evolution to make a more transparent iron ore pricing helped us to keep our sales stable and despite of some deferrals of long-term volumes in long-term contracted bottoms.</p>
          <p>While significant price volatility and lower demand had an immediate effect in reducing our revenue, the reduction in input cost prices will have a delayed impact on the cost of goods sold. Our costs, in real terms, were flat for the year if you include the benefit of falling exchange rates. As you can see, excluding the benefit of exchange rates, the bulk of our cost increases for this financial year was incurred in the first half, which we had highlighted during our Interim Results Presentation in February. This included higher raw material prices that were closely linked to a heated market conditions and costs deliberately incurred to maximize production in order to capture the benefit of higher prices.</p>
          <p>The sticky nature of some of this cost is better represented in the next slide. It is evident from this chart that the rate of cost increases moderated in the second half of the financial year. There is no doubt that prices remain higher for some of the key input products, but however we are progressively seeing sings of lower input material prices. An example, the average price for caustic soda remained at $645 per ton in the second half of the financial year, but has recently fallen to approximately $150 a ton. We will only see the benefit of this in the first half of the current financial year.</p>
          <p>Achieving cost efficiencies is also absolutely critical in our business. In what was a very challenging environment, we achieved efficiency gains of $188 million, and this for various cost containment projects, knowledge sharing across operations and our supplier relationships.</p>
          <p>But as I said earlier, including the benefit of falling exchange rates, our costs in real terms are flat for the year. We expect to continue to improve our cost performance in the current year in that through business improvements and through lower input prices and usage rates.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to our cash flow position and return to shareholders. I'm pleased to show that our net operating cash flow which is the &#x2013; after payment of interest and tax was a record $18.9 billion. BHP Billiton lower operational and financial leverage has been a clear competitive advantage and resulted in this outstanding cash flow.</p>
          <p>Our cash priorities remain unchanged and at a time when others in our industry had to substantially cut their capital spending, we continue to invest strongly in growth. Our capital expenditure for the year was close to $11 billion, and this was highly skewed towards brownfield expansions right in our backyard.</p>
          <p>For many companies, the current market environment has also presented a threat to their ability to fund dividend payments. However, today we maintained our track record of a progressive dividend policy and declared a final of dividend for the year of US$0.41 per share. This brings the total dividend declared for the year to US$0.82 per share, which is more than six-fold the US$0.13 per share declared in the first year following the merger between BHP and Billiton only seven years ago, so six-fold in seven years.</p>
          <p>It is sometimes difficult to put a perspective around numbers when you are talking billions of dollars. So it is interesting to know that this year's dividend payment of $4.6 billion is more than the total net operating cash flow of $3.9 billion generated seven years ago; that puts a little bit in context.</p>
          <p>Our strong credit rating and balance sheet have enabled us to raise significant funds in the U.S. and European debt capital markets on very good terms. With a very low gearing of 12%, debt maturity skewed towards the medium and long-term, a high margin diversified portfolio and a deep inventory of growth options. We are in a unique position to continue to invest and deliver value to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>We also have the balance sheet capacity to make opportunistic mergers and acquisitions. The iron ore production joint venture we announced with Rio Tinto, which Marius just talked about, is an example of our ability to continue to add world-class capacity to our portfolio.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll now turn you back to Marius in London.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alex. Now that Alex has taken you through the results in detail, I thought that I'd share a few perspectives about the demand environment. At our interim results in February, we reflected on a period in which we'd seen global demand disappear effectively and commodity prices collapse. Over the last six months, we've seen quite a rebound in commodity prices and in particular the velocity of recovery in China has indeed been positively surprising. China has been the major source of demand for commodities in 2009.</p>
          <p>In February, we also said that we had seen of the end of destocking in China, which I think proved to be an accurate call at the time. The key question for us now is just how much of the recovery in China has been as a result of pent-up demand from a much depleted inventory chain and how much represents real underlying demand? We believe that there's been a substantial rebuilding of inventory in China across commodities at both the end-user level as well as with traders and strategic stockpiles. It's therefore our view that restocking in China is essentially complete.</p>
          <p>Outside of China, by way of illustration of the impact, we saw steel capacity usage fall to 50% in the three major steel markets of the U.S, Europe and Japan. We're now seeing that usage growth starting to climb as the first evidence that restocking in these major economies has commenced. I must say that restocking in Europe and Japan, albeit early days, has probably occurred a bit earlier than we had anticipated.</p>
          <p>But I'd like to caution that as the metals-intensive nature of these developed economies is lower than that of the developing economies, the absolute impact of the Chinese restocking will be greater than the developed world restocking for our products. As a further point to note that the U.S. in particular is self-sufficient in certain commodities, notably some of the steel-making materials. Finally, as demand recovers we need to consider to what level it will recover compared to the pre-crisis level of demand.</p>
          <p>So the world seems to have averted a full-blown economic crisis. The major economies have started rebuilding their inventories, led by an early recovery in China. And although it won't be in our opinion until 2010 before we see clean, underlying demand that is not masked by inventory effects, we do expect to see a more predictable demand scenario for our products in the coming financial year. However, it continues to be our view that globally we will come out of this recession less strongly than in previous cycles.</p>
          <p>Now let me talk a little bit more about the one region that has seen demand recover. Chinese demand, or import demand, has been exceptionally strong in cases where imports have replaced higher cost domestic production, often constructed on the back of very high prices in preceding years. In products, such as in iron ore, where our imported products is a substitute for the domestic products, we've seen a very discernible impact. And the chart on the screen illustrates two interesting points in the case of iron ore.</p>
          <p>Firstly, we can see how the domestic iron ore production in China has developed over the last couple of years to be a very, very substantial of producing &#x2013; producer of iron ore in global terms and a very meaningful source of supply for the domestic steel industry. The second and more interesting point, if we examine the slide, is how responsive the domestic supply of iron ore has been to changing levels of price in the market clearing level of iron ore prices.</p>
          <p>In the first half of this year, we believe that about 70 million tons of domestic production was curtailed as the market clearing price for iron ore collapsed. We're already seeing some of this volume come back on the back of the very recent rise in market clearing prices for iron ore. So really, it's very difficult for us to discern a sea-borne market on its own of a fixed size and really as we've said in years past but now can say with some conviction, you really do need to talk about a volume and price relationship when you talk about these products and the volume of supply required has to be viewed in relation to a specific price.</p>
          <p>Similarly, we also believe that the domestic supply of nickel pig iron and metallurgical coal will react to changes in price. So therefore, generally, and it's often difficult to generalize across a diversified portfolio, we think that even with more stable global demand levels, which we postulate, we're unlikely to see very significant price reaction from this point onwards because there's plenty of idled or domestic capacity in many of these products, and that this capacity can come on often quite quickly and often in the short-term in quite quick response to the movements in price.</p>
          <p>However, for us as a company, the long term is probably more important than the short term. Many of our decisions are obviously based on trends in the long term. Our business is a long-term business. Our planning is based on a long-term view of demand.</p>
          <p>While in the short and medium term it's difficult to predict exactly what will happen to those prices and demand levels once the respective government surplus packages have worked their way through the various systems, we do continue to see global demand growth biased towards the Asian economies, the developing economies. And obviously, as we've said many times before, from a demand perspective for our products these economies are more resource intensive because they're driven by investment and hence, the amount of material consumed per unit of GDP is very different from in the developed economies.</p>
          <p>In these developing economies, we've just got a China steel example up on the screen, our belief is that China and these other economies have got many, many years of materials-intensive commodity growth ahead of them. Just to elaborate a little bit more on this chart, we've obviously scaled the 2008 finished demand to 100 and we've plotted what we estimate the 2025 demand level will be like.</p>
          <p>And therefore, you can see that we anticipate strong demand over this period driven by, firstly, growth in construction and the two main factors they are just the absolute increase in floor space. And secondly, as the cities get built, as the buildings get higher, you get a higher steel materials intensity per square meter. And that's really shown in that first block over there.</p>
          <p>Secondly, growth in the capacity of the Machinery sector, obviously in the first instance to serve this domestic growing economy, but also increasing China's penetration into the world markets for Machinery. And thirdly, the penetration of the motor vehicle as the population seeks to in some ways emulate the West in terms of vehicle ownership.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to how BHP Billiton is positioned to capture this share of demand growth that we postulate over many decades. While the recent shift in prices and demand level has clearly presented challenges for us in the short term, we always focus on value creation in the long term. And let me remind you that BHP Billiton's long-term value creation is based on a consistent, lasting and unchanged strategy, as Alex outlined earlier for us. It's also based on a simple, effective and accountable organization to deliver that and a balance sheet that enables us to invest for the future.</p>
          <p>In the current environment in particular and in the period past, a strong balance sheet means that we're almost uniquely positioned to invest for the long term. If you take this slide that we've got on the screen, if you take our capital spend over the last 12 months and we add to that the $5.8 billion that we hope to spend in the joint venture with Rio Tinto, our capital investment in the single 12 month period is very comparable to the market capitalization of several mid-sized mining companies.</p>
          <p>So let me conclude by reiterating that the last 12 months have been challenging. We've had to make a number of very tough decisions in adjusting our business. We've made those, as you would expect, proactively and cleanly. And in spite of these challenges over the last 12 months, BHP Billiton has emerged incredibly well-positioned with strong cash flows, exceptional world-class assets, substantial embedded organic growth opportunities in the backyard and a strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>As we've said before, our operating cash flow for the year was at a record US$18.9 billion and we ended the year with a net gearing of only 12%. Our strong cash flows and balance sheet have allowed us to continue to also with our progressive dividend policy at the same time as we're investing in our business for the long term.</p>
          <p>So on that note, I would like to thank you ladies and gentlemen. I would be pleased to take your questions. We will still start in London, then rotate over to the other venues. If you could address the questions to me in the first instance, I will pass them over to Alex as required. If I can have the first question here in London, please; if you can just be reminded again to state your name, that would be very useful.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Marius. Rob Clifford, Deutsche Bank. Two questions, firstly on the costs. During the ramp-up over the last couple of years, there's a lot of talk about increasing the costs such that they wouldn't be banked and could come off rapidly on the way down. Alex talked about sticky costs. Where have you been surprised at the stickiness and will they be unstuck shortly?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just on iron ore you announced recently, effective advertising, you are now to shop for all sorts of deals in iron ore, but still looking to settle about half. Where do you stand there; and more specifically, how are you seeing the battle with China panning out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Rob, I'll leave the second part of how the cost base is expected to react to Alex who can make more comments. On iron ore, I wouldn't describe it as a battle. I would describe it as normal commercial negotiations and in what has been an incredibly volatile pricing environment from $200 to, I don't know, mid 40s back up to 105. On a market-clearing basis, one can expect that it's quite difficult to form a consensus view of what will happen for the next 12 months, which is effectively what you've got to do when you set the benchmark price, so I wonder if we should be very surprised. Today, I unfortunately have no update for you on those negotiations.</p>
          <p>Clearly, volumes are being shipped into China, particularly on a provisional pricing basis. And equally clearly, our endeavor over many years now has been to exactly try and remove the emotion from negotiations such as this by getting more market-clearing prices. And at the end, what we stated before, while that process is really difficult to predict exactly how it runs its course, if any of the other commodities is anything to go by that course is probably pretty secular, Rob. But no real update for you on the benchmark negotiations.</p>
          <p>Alex, I don't know if you perhaps want to go into fixed and variable costs and baked-in and non-baked-in costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll stay with the sticky and slippery costs. The reason I use sticky is because you basically have three key components of cost, to drive costs: one is price; the other is volume; the other is efficiency of costs or usage rate.</p>
          <p>The one that has disproportionately the greatest impact on cost is price of inputs and we went through a great extent during the inflationary days to make sure that the structural changes we had in our costs, overall structure was less so than the variable ones and I'll give you some examples on that. But if you take commodity inputs as one of the key drivers of our costs you have things that are very, very quickly to come out like fuel inputs.</p>
          <p>As fuel prices move, our costs move accordingly. And you have others that are not so quick which you have some sort of three-monthly brick type of contracts, and you would put caustic coke and some of that; so you have a delayed, a lag. We had that lag on the way up. We're having that lag on the way down.</p>
          <p>Where it gets more sticky is where you had situations, for example, where you had labor disputes and the tentative of labor rates increased or royalty rates increased, for that matter, and those were the two examples that I used. And during the heated times we went through great expense to the point that we had weeks of strike in Escondida and other places to differentiate what was components out of the heated market in terms of recognition of labor performance to what was structural changes. But nevertheless, you went through many years of labor corrections that tended to be above inflation levels and those are, with time and with volume increases, that you see those coming down of the cost structure. Is that right &#x2013; is that clear, Rob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Alex, perhaps just two things to add in addition. The way I always look at it is that I look at the overall cost base and then I look at the &#x2013; how it differentiates per business.</p>
          <p>First thing to note is that different businesses have very different cost structures. If we take, for example, metallurgical coal to aluminum, very, very different drivers of cost. Alex will do better on the absolute numbers but I generally think of our costs in aggregate as being about 25% inputs, 12.5% labor and 25% services, contractors and so on. Those are sort of engineering approximations.</p>
          <p>And for the first component, we tend to follow markets, so that's all on the input; we don't cut through them but there's the lag that Alex has described. On the second piece, labor very difficult to reverse; you've got a get that back through efficiencies. And on that third component there's sort of a more mixed bag.</p>
          <p>The last thing, Rob, that I would add is that getting to an apples-to-apples comparison of cost base across companies, given third-party products, freight in or out; how you treat thing is extremely difficult. The way we tend to look at it is measuring our margin development versus our peers, versus the industry and I think that's where I would like to focus you on because that is a more reliable view of where costs are going.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tobias Woerner from MF Global. Two questions if I may. The first one relates to your balance sheet and in the context of the outlook when you say real demand is difficult to assess going forward. You have a very strong balance sheet; I was wondering how you will steer your balance sheet through this period. There's obviously some opportunities for you out there, but also a modicum of threats in as far as if you are too conservative in a way. So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, with regard to CapEx, you're going for about 9.5 billion in 2010, main focus being iron ore and petroleum if I see that correctly. Maybe just explain your thoughts behind that; and secondly, where else you see opportunities going forward on the organic basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Tobias, I think we feel very comfortable where we're managing the balance sheet. We're managing to that strong, single A rating and we don't want to change that. I think that our approach has been consistent over many years. Alex just highlighted how the dividend has grown six-fold over almost as many years. Alex will correct me, but I think we've returned about $32 billion of cash in the form of dividends and buybacks since the company was formed in its current form.</p>
          <p>So there's a clear priority here in our business of maintaining the balance sheet, investing in our business and returning surplus cash. And you won't see that change. We do think that the current environment offers, still offers opportunities. I have said before that we are always on the look out for opportunistic and non-organic growth opportunities; nothing that I can comment on specifically today, unfortunately, as you would expect.</p>
          <p>On the CapEx, I think that that base that we've set there of close to $10 billion as a forecast, I think is what we feel comfortable with. If you take into combination the dividend at 4.5 billion plus CapEx, that means that you need a base cash generation of $15 billion in order to not start leveraging up the balance sheet, so we feel comfortable with that. Obviously, within the portfolio there are many opportunities to accelerate investment, should cash flow allow that.</p>
          <p>And then to your last question, if I can highlight just one specific opportunity which people don't have a lot of visibility on is &#x2013; perhaps, if I take something like the potash, where we're pre-feasibility at the moment. We spent, I think, about $95 billion over the last year advancing, in particular, one project called Jansen. We think it's a magnificent asset. We think that there are resources there to produce 8 million tons per annum for 50 years plus. We're just starting preparations to put the brine down to freeze the location where the shaft will go as a sort of long lead time thing.</p>
          <p>We hope to put this into feasibility sometime next year and perhaps the year after take a formal investment decision. And I don't want to give any forecast on what the capital cost is, we never do; but it's clear that if you talk about a capacity of 8 million tons per annum ultimately and what would be industry norms on a cost per ton, you're talking about quite a few billion dollars of investment and that's one option that's in the pipeline.</p>
          <p>Equally, on many of the other things we've got the resources in the portfolio to keep on investing and you should take it as read that we're going to review that investment to basically live within our means, as Alex and myself call it. Bit of a long-winded answer, really, Alex; but I don't know if you wanted to add something to that.</p>

          <p>... with the same. First, invest in the business, maintain the balance sheet and then return excess. And we have done all three of them so all three are in very good shape. On the graph in the booklet you can see the compounded annual growth rate in each one is quite significant and it's probably leading edge in not just the industry, but globally.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Alex, thanks Marius. I just wanted to focus on an area of concern that I have, the Gulf of Mexico. It looks to be struggling to make capacity rights in most of the assets that have come onstream to date. Atlantis is at water injection mode; Neptune seems to have peaked well below capacity. I'm just interested in what you can say to me to give me a little comfort that the growth can come and that the capital is going to generate the return that you'd hope. Obviously, high oil prices have saved you to a degree, but I'm interested in terms of the operating performance.</p>
          <p>Second thing, Scarborough sits up there in Western Australia, certainly a resource that almost appears stranded. What plans do you have for Scarborough and how do you think you can commercialize that resource?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brandon, let me try. Obviously the Neptune reservoir has been a little bit more challenging than we would have hoped. We've got, certainly, several targets there to continue to add to that resource. And in Atlantis, we've said that before we've got the water injection going, we would not expect the plateau that we previously forecast to be reached, even though we expect the total amount of oil to be recovered to be unchanged.</p>
          <p>Couple of things to point at; the petroleum business, despite the &#x2013; and we normally don't look at this way, but the petroleum business, despite the heavy investment program that it's under, is cash generative. If we look at the return on capital, we are very confident that we're going to make our targets there.</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, you have sometimes good and not only bad luck. I mean, for us to be in what BP has described, the giant fields of the Gulf of Mexico, to be in two of the three with the recent Mad Dog discovery and Atlantis, despite what has been a few setbacks there's always &#x2013; there's also been a few things that have added. So we're confident about continuing to invest there.</p>
          <p>In terms of Scarborough, you know that the Thebe accumulation is close to that as well; and we're obviously working with our partner, ExxonMobil, to commercialize that. Early days, we're not into feasibility yet, but we are very, very confident that that gas will come to market in due course, Brandon.</p>
          <p>Mike, I think you may be on the line, albeit by telephone, from Perth if I recall. You might just want to add a few words. Sorry to ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Marius, can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes we can, perfectly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Yeah, Brandon, I appreciate the opportunity to follow up a little bit. In regards to our Gulf of Mexico, let me just mention &#x2013; I'll just reiterate quickly, Neptune's a little more compartmentalized, but more drilling to be done. And also we've run new seismic and we'll be moving into the northern part of the structure, we hope here in the next year; so, so much more to come.</p>
          <p>Atlantis, as Marius says, is going to enjoy the benefit of the water injection; we're beginning to move forward on that operationalizing. But in the meantime, we've had some very successful development drilling and have now raised Atlantis to around 140 to 150,000 barrels a day. That's against that named plate capacity of 200,000. So we've made significant gains there. The Atlantis north wells have come in extremely strong, so obviously we are still very excited about a long, very high plateau on Atlantis, and once the water injection comes on line even moving it up from here.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, of course, we did stream the Shenzi project three months early, in March of this year versus a July projected date. Shenzi was targeted for 100,000 barrels a day and is doing well in excess of that now. On some days we're at 120 and 130,000 and we're still leveling that out and there's still more drilling to go. So yes, as Marius says, there's some ups and downs but our Gulf of Mexico business is very large and going to be large for some time and although we'll have a few different movements here and there, overall we've got a very, very strong profit center for many years to come.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Neil Goodwill from Goldman Sachs JBWere. Just a couple of questions. In your steel make raw material business, I've just got a question really around capacity utilization, particularly in coking coal. Can you just give us some indication of where &#x2013; what capacity utilization you actually had and how quickly you can increase production there? And also, I mean, the growth in coking coal has sort of been on again off again for the last sort of five or six years. How quickly and how willing are you to actually bring on production in coking coal?</p>
          <p>And I guess the second question is a bit more general, but given the downturn that we've had and the partial recovery, can you just run us through what you think you've learnt from the whole experience and how that has impacted your strategy going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Neil, I think it's fair to say there have been months in the last couple of months where coking coal capacity utilization has been high. We are very, very committed, long term, to growing that business and we're committed to growing it in two ways. I think we feel that there's substantial de &#x2013; internal debottlenecking opportunities at low cost by taking a basin-wide view, particularly of the Queensland Coal fields, which will be relatively cheap and relatively easy to bring on. I can't give you any detail, but certainly Yubi and the team there are working that day and night to bring that on. And then secondly there are the bigger projects such as Goonyella and Peak Downs which are setting there.</p>
          <p>The fact that you haven't seen any of the moving to &#x2013; and then obviously the Hay Point, HPX 3 as we call it, expansion.</p>
          <p>So the fact that you haven't seen any of them moving to execution yet does not mean that there is an enormous amount of work going on. Obviously, against the backdrop where in the early part of the year it was difficult to sell any coking coal at all at some point in time. It was a little difficult to take expansion decisions right in the midst of that crisis, but you're going to see us take investments there as we go forward; and I would say that our plans are unchanged.</p>
          <p>You've seen that evidenced over the last 12 months by the Saraji purchase. We believe we've got a tremendous business to go there with our partner Mitsubishi and Mitsui and BMC on the back of very strong demand in India, China, over the long term, and in Brazil, obviously, in addition to our traditional markets.</p>
          <p>What I have learned from the downturn? Tier 1 assets are Tier 1; we are manically focused on Tier 1 assets. Neil, if anything, I think Alex and I would be even more focused on what is a Tier 1 asset and working our non-Tier 1 assets out of the portfolio at appropriate times so that you don't have to take difficult decisions at the most difficult possible time. From an overall strategic perspective, I think you'll just see our current strategy sharpened, not changed. Alex?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Marius, a couple of questions; firstly, with the situation in the nickel division, can you give us what the plan is now? Do you have to go back to the drawing board and revisit the strategy in nickel?</p>
          <p>Secondly, following on from Neil's question regarding coking coal, I suppose the big surprise in the first half of this year was the strength of China is imports; wondering what the BHP Billiton outlook it for sustainability of China is coking coal imports?</p>
          <p>And finally in terms of the result for the half just gone, the iron ore price per se, just wondering if you can put some more numbers around what you're actually receiving in terms of maybe in dollars per ton. Was it close to benchmark throughout the half that was achieved with the Japanese and the Europeans on the sales into China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll leave the last one for Alex to just comment on the disclosures that we've already made. I don't think we've got anything new to say on average prices, but Alex can talk about that a little bit.</p>
          <p>In nickel, clearly the Ravensthorpe has been a learning, particularly so against the backdrop of where the nickel market dynamics, both in terms of substitution but also in terms of new production technologies, has been an interesting thing. I would say that we'd probably examine any investment in nickel laterite that is not of the Cerro type kind very, very closely, i.e. a very high grade laterite that is processable by electric furnace. We'll probably think about that very closely over the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>So in that sense I think, yes, the strategy has changed on the back of a setback and on the back of quite dramatic changes in the demand environment and in the supply environment. However, we are committed to this business and we believe that while we probably don't have mature growth opportunities in that portfolio at this particular point in time, in due course that business will expand along with the others in our business. Craig, I've just forgotten what the &#x2013; I wrote down here China, but I don't know what the &#x2013; just remind me again what the middle part was.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Coking coal. Our view, which we articulated when we bought additional resources in Queensland, has always been that high population density economies, when they grow, overwhelm the geological endowment. Our prediction is always been in China that in due course it will overwhelm its geological endowment for coking coal.</p>
          <p>Now, whether that &#x2013; I think at the moment the run rate for coking coal importation may be as high as 30 million tons per annum, which is starting to make that a sizable chunk in a world market that is only about 200 or 220 million tons per annum depending on your definition.</p>
          <p>But our view is perhaps not as much short term as it is long term. Long term, we believe that Chinese customers on water with large blast furnaces are going to need our coking coal on a structural basis in order to make steel.</p>
          <p>Can I perhaps rotate through, I can't see Kalarni on the screen here, but I know that he's in Johannesburg and I'm ready to take the questions there. Kalarni?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm Martin Creamer from Mining Weekly Online <mark type="inaudible" /> questions. Just going through the returns that were produced, starting with the energy coal, can I anticipate any selling problems as consequent <mark type="inaudible" /> which seem to be doing right now and <mark type="inaudible" /> And when can I anticipate that <mark type="inaudible" /> for production here?</p>
          <p>And on the aluminum front, can you give us a view on when that might turn up? Can I anticipate any further investment in Southern Africa in the next few years? And then the last question, are all these Southern African businesses Tier 1 and are you planning to dispose of your non-Tier 1 businesses, if you've got any?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Martin, my sincere apologies to you. The first two parts of your question was probably quite garbled on this side technically, so you may have to repeat them. I got &#x2013; I think I got the last two, which is, will you continue to make investments; have you got any planned in South Africa and then do you have any disposals identified.</p>
          <p>Martin, yeah, we don't have any projects beyond the two coal projects which are obviously very, very substantial and indeed the largest investments that I think, outside of the hillside aluminum smelter, that we've made at any time in South Africa. Those are progressing well, but we don't have any projects and feasibility beyond that. Really, that investment is designed to turn our Energy Coal business which was in need of reinvestment into a long-term Tier 1 business. And particularly, given that as markets play out and we've seen how India is now a substantial taker of South African Energy Coal, as its energy demands grow, we're very happy about that investment.</p>
          <p>Other than that on the disposal side, in the core of our businesses in South Africa, the coal businesses configured, the titanium business, the aluminum business and the manganese business, I would say is on the strategic fairway and we're really pleased to have those businesses. But you might have to just repeat the first two questions for me, if you don't mind.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Marius, sorry, you have covered the Klipspruit and the DMO projects, which was my first question. And my second question, which you haven't really covered, and that's to the outlook for the manganese businesses. And the question I had was when do you expect these to normalize to full production, particularly those in the northern Cape?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the other question which you didn't get was around the outlook for aluminum, although you did touch on that? When do you expect some uptake or normalization there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I still did not get the second piece, but I've got the manganese piece. Martin, it may be good to touch base with Peter, who I know is in attendance there afterwards. For my sins, as you know, I once ran the Samancor business which Peter runs. And I can tell you that manganese has got this attribute that because it's not very bulky you can stock quite a lot of it, unlike coking coal and iron ore, and therefore you go through these stocking and de-stocking cycles that are very, very difficult to predict. We've obviously seen some buying activity. It's a long way from normal yet, but I would &#x2013; wouldn't like to make a prediction on exactly when that normalizes. In the long term obviously, we believe that that business in the Northern Cape is extremely well.</p>
          <p>I think I'm going to have to cut back. I know I may not have answered your complete question, but just mindful that I want to give other people a chance as well. Kalarni, could we try the next question and perhaps just try a different microphone?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Looking at that, your compound annual growth rate translates to just over 4% per annum, Can you give me an indication of your economic assumptions that go into that and your intensity of usage, because that seems to be quite a relatively low number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James, I wouldn't like to dig deeper into that. I can say that our long-term forecasts are probably not very different from what regular forecasters do and obviously that's quite a big variable. On the steel intensity, basically you should understand that that demand picture has built up laboriously by looking at building height trends, dwelling size trends, retail space trends, car trends, air conditioner trends, and so on and so on. Sorry, air conditioners was probably more for our copper study, but &#x2013; and so it would be very, very difficult to do that.</p>
          <p>But in those three blocks it's really that our belief is that on the building side, more buildings above 16 floors, as a proportion, which gives you a higher steel intensity. Dwelling size trends, we extrapolate. Then on the machinery it's basically looking at what machinery stock you need to service a given economy and then also what the export market penetration will be.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, on the vehicle penetration, just bearing in mind that vehicles have become actually more affordable, if you want to call it that, in that vehicles penetrated at lower GDP levels than they did when other economies industrialized, but I really can't dig into that. We are quite confident that that would certainly be our best and very, very fundamentally underpinned forecast that has been made, you understand.</p>
          <p>I'm mindful that I only asked two questions here in London, so before I go to the phone I am going to take a couple of questions here in London and so, Nick, perhaps ...</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Nick Hatch at ING. Marius, looking at the supplementary information on the individual business areas and comparing 2009 against 2008, there seems to be a major improvement in the EBITDA level in third party product sales, part of which is explained by a derivative in iron ore. But can you give a bit more color on that and on whether any of that is repeatable going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick, I think &#x2013; let me try and then Alex can mark me. The IFRS was a wonderful thing from a consistency point of view. However, the fact that physical and derivative positions cannot be hedge accounted effectively, but have to be &#x2013; the one has to be accrual accounted and the other one has to be mark-to-market accounted, gives us a lot of P&amp;L volatility, and that's why we keep on pointing to the cash flow.</p>
          <p>Our overall statement is always that economically, we try and follow the markets. If we sell at a fixed price, we take out paper to unwind it. For example, in Energy Coal, I think if you take our net after production, it's roughly half and half. Half is sold on index, half is sold at fixed price which is then unwound. So you do have these derivatives which are geared to basically give you the floating price outcome on all of our products, which is an unchanged story for us.</p>
          <p>If you look at last year's P&amp;L, what you basically had is that in an environment where prices were rising against when you took that &#x2013; when you basically locked in that economic position, you showed an economic &#x2013; sorry, a mark-to-market loss on the paper. This year, because it's turned around, you show the mark-to-market profit and when you didn't take the delta between the two you get a quite large number in terms of volatility.</p>
          <p>Without being too specific, the key areas are in coal, which is sold on a fixed price sometimes and then has to be unwound; freight, where we basically try and follow the freight market but sometimes you have to lock in freight for a period and then unwind it by way of freight futures; and then there's some other minor effects as well. Alex, I don't know if that constitutes a pass; you may add to that.</p>

          <p>That's a gold star, Marius. The only thing I would add to that is I think in this year, Nick, we also didn't buy as much third party uranium as we did last year to complement our supply requirements. So that, that was a missing in terms of cost this year that improved the third party business.</p>

          <p>...yeah, capacity particularly in China; so aluminum, nickel, some coal and iron ore. Can you address what that means for your strategy in your CSGs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it changes much. I would say that the changes in the alumina industry and the changes in the nickel industry probably has reset our overall profit expectations for those two businesses downwards. In terms of, let's call it the connecting of the domestic iron ore business to the sea-borne market, and with the incipient part of that in the coking coal market, we're actually very pleased because we are the low cost producer, we've got extensive resources and basically what that means is that you don't have to be so worried about building capacity that then can't find a home because you've always got the swing capacity. In my mind, the latter two actually make those better, more resilient markets from an exporter's point of view.</p>
          <p>I'm just going to go to the phones. Jodie, if we can have the first person on the phone, perhaps?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just interested in the structure of the company, particularly the DLC, and the impact the pricing is having on your transaction currency, which is your pay driver in Australia and the U.K. What thoughts do you have on that relative trading or the structure of the company or what it may or may not mean going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Peter, I mean our view is probably unchanged that we see having the DLC is an advantage. As a PLC shareholder, I can tell you that I'm annoyed by the discount sometimes as well. But we do see that it's an attractive currency. I know we didn't consummate our proposed Rio deal last year, but it would have played an absolutely pivotal role. I note that a very substantial chunk of the world's mining industry's listed in London.</p>
          <p>So having that currency available is, I think, very, very valuable as we contemplate things and I don't see any reason why Alex and I are going to review that imminently. That doesn't lessen the frustration sometimes by having a spread between the two registers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Marius. Just really just to share in any data I can offer on progress with the iron ore merger proceedings with the European Area trust? Is it a joint sort of round of submissions that both you and Rio Tinto are putting together equally or is it being pushed more by your side or their side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously I think we've got quite a lot of information which we've been able to share with Rio Tinto which they didn't have the benefit of having gone some ways through that process last year. So I think there was some learning, but now it's a completely joint process as it has to be.</p>
          <p>Okay. I've sort of lost my track here. I think it's probably opportune to just give Alex the opportunity for a few questions in Sydney.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Marius, hi Alex. Paul McTaggart from Credit Suisse. This is a very simple question. A ten-fold shift in Escondida contribution downwards, unfortunately, during this year. Partly a function of copper price obviously and we talked about the impact of costs. Going forward, do you think you've got the SAG mill fixed now?</p>
          <p>Are you going to go back to full production rates; are you going to try and run that mill at lower rates to make sure that we don't have recurrent problems? What's the thinking and what do you think production will be out of Escondida in the next 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, I don't think we've made any additional sort of forecast of production. Let's just step back on the issues that we've had with the SAG mill, though; half of our milling capacity; similar problems at other mills around the world, including the Antamina mill. We think that we have solved that problem. So we do think that from a pure milling rate perspective we'll be up to 100% milling capacity.</p>
          <p>However, we have indicated that for the next couple of years, we are going through some low grade material in the Escondida pits. There is some come back in 2012, I think, but we shouldn't expect to, over the next couple of years, hit the peak production that we did couple of years ago, but I don't think we've made any projection for copper output beyond that. Alex, perhaps you can help.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just add a little bit, Marius. One thing that you have to remember is that we've been working on that SAG mill for the last 45 days. So it was operating, actually, below what it was before we started operating on it. So what you can see now, that we will gradually keep an eye on that and see how it ramps up and stay and performs. You're starting from a base that for the last 40 days, the production was actually lower. So that's all I would add to Marius' comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Alex, perhaps the next question.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Tim Gerrard from Austock. Three questions, the first one very quickly on oil loss, wondering from this point, are you still looking at about a 10% compound production growth rate through to 2011? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And in fact the second question is just with regard to Queensland and the Queensland government looking to sell the rail in particular, is there much scope for BHP to look seriously at being an owner of the rail; and I know there would be a lot uncertainties to do with that, but is that something that you are looking at in a serious fashion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, we don't have any update on oil production growth. I mean, Mike is very confident that the targets that we've put out there previously are the correct ones. In terms of the Queensland rail, it is extremely early days there. There's a lot of water to run into the sea on that one, but I would say that we're probably not a natural owner of public infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Alex, perhaps one last question and then we'll try Johannesburg again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Marius. It's Glyn Lawcock of UBS. I just wanted to under &#x2013; if you maybe could just touch on, do you see any fall out across the Australian producers from what's happening with the Rio-China situation, either positively or negatively, just from across your businesses?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, you talked about coking coal, but I just &#x2013; you also talked about, earlier, about China obviously outstripping its domestic resource by &#x2013; one of those is obviously copper, but when I look at your portfolio, I mean copper is like coking coal, extremely absent over the next five years and I'm just wondering when you can update us on what's happening there, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Glyn, we're basically selling all of the product that we can produce. Obviously, I would have liked to have had a benchmark settled by now, but that hasn't impeded our ability to price and ship material, not only in iron ore but also in the other products. I think if you look in particular at another steel-making raw material, which is coking coal, you will have seen that we were very quick to capture a very good market share in what was a market that appeared quite quickly.</p>
          <p>I think that to your comments on copper, there is growth and there is growth. I mean clearly I would have liked beyond the Olympic Dam and Resolution projects, to which I have no update today, I do think that those two projects, particularly the Olympic Dam one where we earn 100% is a very material investment opportunity. I don't have any update today. And certainly over the next five years, there's no additional production from these two projects included in our five-year plan.</p>
          <p>In the 15 years that I've been with the company, though, I've learned that different products grow, wax and wane in the portfolio. I've at times worked for a company that was accused of being an iron ore company, an aluminum company, a petroleum company and no doubt that will continue to be the case. You must understand that we view our investments pretty much on an opportunity-by-opportunity basis as opposed to we must grow copper. We take all of our opportunities. We look at which one is the best, best return, the easiest to do and that's the one that we do regardless of the product rating.</p>
          <p>Kalarni, being very mindful that we suffered there a little bit, perhaps take a couple of questions in South Africa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure, Marius; and now for questions. James, again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Marius, hi, James Allan here again. Just like to look at one of your smaller businesses, which is the diamond business, I'm quite interested to see that your EBITDA margin improved from 2008 to 2009 in a period when diamond prices were slumping. Could you perhaps elaborate on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, James, lower carats and better ones; and then obviously the titanium business is wrapped into that business. And in addition to that, there are some impacts of project spend, which has been curtailed on some of the investments in Angola and in Corridor Sands which would give you a change on a period-on-period basis as well. Again, I mean our investor relations can tease through that detail.</p>
          <p>Kalarni, can we have the next question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

          <p>Marius, I just want to get back and revisit iron ore. Can you give us any guidance at all in terms of whether the provisional price that you're achieving is actually &#x2013; where it is relative to the Asian benchmark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Warren, it would be extremely difficult for me to comment on that today. That would be commercially not discloseable information at this point. What I can tell you is that clearly there is accrual in the accounts on that provisional basis. And I would say that the basis on which we've reported our profit is obviously consistent with having a high degree of confidence that the accrual that we picked there is a attainable and is appropriate. Alex, I don't know if you want to add to that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sam Catalano from Macquarie. If I could just ask two related questions to ones that were asked earlier. If you look at the projects that you no doubt have been studying in the first half of this year from an M&amp;A perspective, do you think that potentially you've missed an opportunity there, given how asset prices are moving in the more positive outlook?</p>
          <p>And then similarly, on your organic growth projects, have you attempted to accelerate, I guess, the feasibility and development and execution of some of those, given I guess what would conceivably be a better environment to actually develop and lock in better project rights for the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Sam, I think Neil Goodwill asked how our strategy would be different if we did it again and I said even a sharper focus on Tier 1 assets. I think that few Tier 1 assets, if any, were available for purchase. It wasn't a question of price, it's availability. We're very pleased that we can invest in a Tier 1 asset on a non-organic basis as part of this joint venture. But I think that the way we look at the M&amp;A opportunity is availability, not price, was the constraint.</p>
          <p>Clearly the extreme period of financial squeeze was shorter than we thought it would be and some of the family silver didn't get shaken loose and I think we spoke about that last time. We said we didn't know whether it would happen or not. As it turned out, companies got out of the extreme financial duress relatively quickly with financial markets opening up again and weren't forced to sell Tier 1 assets.</p>
          <p>On feasibility, obviously we review capital basically on a monthly basis. I think it's no secret that from a higher level of capital spend postulated at the start of last year, Alex and I and the rest of the management team did remove some projects from that spending, particularly during the period of extreme uncertainty and kept on investing at that sort of a $10 billion per annum rate. Clearly, our view is now that there is stabilization looking forward, and I would say that it's probably correct to say that the activity levels on some of the projects, bringing some of those things back into the investment spend that were taken out, is gathering some pace.</p>
          <p>The next question here in London, please. Jason?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Jason Fairclough from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just a, maybe a follow-up question on the projects. To the extent that we've seen the input costs to project go down pretty dramatically, whether it's steel, contracted labor, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you talk about how you, if you like, revisit budgeted capital for these projects? I mean, are you actually locked in to the CapEx costs or could we see a situation where you're pushing down capital cost for your entire project pipeline by 20 or 30%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, we typically don't lock in capital costs until approval of the project. Up to that stage there's a wide envelope of uncertainty. Typically, when we approve a project we tend to have fairly high level of engineering, perhaps compared to some peers we tend to place contracts quite quickly. That's probably even more pronounced in the petroleum business than in the minerals business. And so there is some impact of material variables; obviously, in some cases there's scaling factors for that.</p>
          <p>But I think the biggest impact in the short term on contracts actually is probably exchange rates, if you look at the U.S dollar terms. And then secondly, just raw productivity; if I look at some of the major escalations that we had, particularly on projects in Western Australia and in Canada, it was that labor productivity at the height of the &#x2013; unemployment being at its lowest, really deteriorated quite sharply and that is come back quite quickly.</p>
          <p>To that effect, Alex and I commented to each other the other day that from an overall perspective on the approved project slate, and the projects that are currently in execution, we've certainly never seen so many that we would say completely green, tracking ahead of schedule or under budget, or at budget.</p>
          <p>We normally &#x2013; our estimates are P50 and you sort of get 50% of them hopefully in a narrow range, but around the mean. Basically at this stage, I would say, that is probably skewed towards being all green and deviating relatively little on the negative side on costs. And that indicates to me that structurally, costs have come down even on the existing projects. But it's a little difficult to forecast because if I take, for example, potash project that we spoke about, two years from approval at least, where will the Canadian dollar be in a project which will have a very, very heavily Canadian dollar-centric cost. We certainly don't know at this stage and don't forecast.</p>
