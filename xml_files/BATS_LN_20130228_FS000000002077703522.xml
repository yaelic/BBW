      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I'm Nicandro Durante, Chief Executive of British American Tobacco and as usual, I'm joined by Finance Director, Ben Stevens. Also in the front row, there are a number of my colleagues including Richard Burrows, Chairman; and John Daly, Chief Operating Officer. And welcome to those of you who are listening on the conference call or watching via the webcast. After the presentation, as usual, there will be an opportunity for those of you in the audience to ask questions.</p>
          <p>2012 was another very good year for BAT. We met all long-term financial goals. In what was another year of financial uncertainty and rising unemployment with investors and consumers continuing to look for security, the group delivered a strong financial performance across all regions. Reported volume for the group was down 1.6% and organically 2%. This was principally as a result of industry volume declines in Western Europe, Brazil, and Egypt together with volume losses in low margin brands in Indonesia and Turkey.</p>
          <p>We have grown our Global Drive Brands by 3% with all brands contributing to the increase. Share is up in the majority of our top 40 markets with a strong performance in many markets including Brazil, Canada, Malaysia, France, Germany, the GCC, and Pakistan, offset by losses in Indonesia, South Korea, Italy and Turkey, however, following increased portfolio investments, share in these four countries has stabilized in recent months. And as a result, overall share in the top 40 is up over the last six months of 2012. I am pleased to say that we have good share growth momentum entering 2013.</p>
          <p>Currency was a major feature in 2012, with headwinds impacting revenue, operating profit and EPS growth by 5 percentage points. Reported revenue fell 1.4% but on organic constant basis, grew nearly 4%, reflecting good price mix of 6%. Pricing remained strong and we have already achieved 80% of our planned pricing for 2013. Adjusted profit on a constant basis was 8% ahead.</p>
          <p>We continue to do excellent work in addressing our cost base with operating margin up 160 basis points. Adjusted EPS rose 7% to 207.5p and would have been 12% up excluding the effects of currencies. The board is recommending a final dividend increase of 7% to 134.9p.</p>
          <p>Now to the brands, it was another good performance from the Global Drive Brands. Excluding the impact of the one-off in Japan in 2011, the GDBs were up 4% against the market down 1% to 1.5%. The GDBs now account for over a third of group volume.</p>
          <p>Dunhill grew share and volume was up 2% with good performances across the globe including Indonesia, Taiwan, Malaysia, South Africa, and Romania, offset by a decline in South Korea as a result of price disadvantage. Excluding South Korea, Dunhill volume was up 9%.</p>
          <p>Kent grew 1% with increased volume in Russia, Vietnam, Ukraine, and the Middle East. Adjusting for the Japan one-off, Kent would have been up 4%.</p>
          <p>Lucky Strike continued to go from strength to strength with outstanding volume growth of 11%. The brand performance is strong in all regions with convertibles accounting for 80% of the growth in 2012. Our all natural version is showing significant growth.</p>
          <p>Pall Mall continued to grow volume and share globally. Volume was up 3% during the year despite declines in two of its key European markets, in Italy and Spain, with growth coming from Pakistan where it reached a record share of 25% in December as well as Russia, Romania, Canada, and the UK.</p>
          <p>All four brands maintained or grew market share and overall GDB share in the top 40 markets was up 23 percentage points or up 0.4 percentage points, excluding the Japan one-off. Total international brands, including GDBs, grew 2% to &#xA3;377 billion and now they account for 54% of group volume.</p>
          <p>Now looking at volume and revenue, group organic volume was down 2%. Excluding the one-off in Japan, it was down 1.7%. This was driven by industry declines in Western Europe, Egypt and in Brazil, following the excise driven price increase, together, with volume losses in low margin brands in Indonesia and Turkey. Organic revenue at constant rates was up 4%, driven by continued strong pricing, all regions contributed to this performance, although Asia Pacific was impacted by geographic mix and the high Japan comparator. Excluding Asia Pacific, price mix across the three other regions was strong, averaging 8%.</p>
          <p>Organically, operating profit grew 8% in constant currency. Every region contributed to this good result with EEMEA in particular, putting in an excellent performance, up 15% in constant currency terms. Western Europe delivered good organic profit growth of 3% despite the economic difficulties in the Southern European countries. Elsewhere, the Americas region achieved a strong constant organic profit performance of 6%, despite a 3% fall in organic volume, mainly as a result of Brazil excise-driven price increase. And Asia Pacific reported strong constant profit growth of 7% despite a 2% volume decline.</p>
          <p>Overall, these good profit performances were adversely impacted by exchange rate movements, reducing the group's reported operating profit growth by 5%, down to 3%.</p>
          <p>Looking at the regions individually, in Asia Pacific, strong performances from a number of markets and favorable exchange rates helped the profit growth 8%, to &#xA3;1.7 billion. At constant rates, profit rose 7%. Good volume performance in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Taiwan and Malaysia were offset by declines in South Korea, Indonesia and the high Japan comparator.</p>
          <p>Excluding the Japan one-off, revenue and profit at constant rates would have been 2% and 9% higher, respectively. Volumes would have been flat.</p>
          <p>In Australia, volume was lower, however, profit rose as a result of higher pricing, cost saving initiatives and favorable exchange rates. As you know, plain packaging was implemented at the beginning of December and early indications are that has had no impact on the markets.</p>
          <p>The change in excise structure in Indonesia and excise-driven price increases adversely impacted volumes of the low margin local brands. This, together with increasing market investments and high clove prices resulted in a decline in profits.</p>
          <p>However, our investments in building a new portfolio are beginning to pay off with the launch of Dunhill Mild and the re-launch of Star Mild, both performing ahead of our expectations. As a result, market share stabilized in the final quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Malaysia delivered an outstanding performance with growth in market share and profits. Dunhill continued its good performance, achieving a record share of 47%. In South Korea profit, volume and share were impacted by price-based competition, however, market share has stabilized during the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>In Japan, profit was up but volume and market share were down, following the high comparator last year. We have successfully retained an increase of more than a full share point over the 2010 exit share despite significant competitive activity. As a result, market share is 12% a record achievement excluding the one-off distortions in 2011.  This was driven by the success of the new innovations in Kent and Kool.</p>
          <p>Bangladesh, Pakistan and Vietnam all grew profits, share and volume.</p>
          <p>In the Americas region, profit was down 2% from last year to &#xA3;1.4 billion, mainly driven by negative exchange rates and lower profits in Mexico. The lighter shaded part of the graph on the slide represents the organic numbers at constant rates. As you can see, organic constant revenue was up 4% and profit, 6%. Regional volume was almost flat at &#xA3;142 billion. The decreases seen in Brazil, due to the excise-driven price increase were almost fully offset by the additional volume resulting from the Colombian acquisition.</p>
          <p>Stripping out this impact, regional volume was down 3% on organic basis. Brazil's profit was driven by an improved product mix and higher pricing. As I previously mentioned, industry volume was down following the excise-driven price increase last year which fuelled the growth of illicit trade despite the establishment of a minimum price. Our market share rose strongly, mainly driven by Dunhill and some key local brands.</p>
          <p>In Canada, volume increased driven by the good performances of Pall Mall and du Maurier, leading to good market share growth. The absence of significant price increases resulted in the illicit rate stabilizing. Profit was flat. In Mexico, industry volumes continue to be impacted by the increasing illicit rate which now stands at 17%. Lower volumes and a tough comparator at the beginning of 2011, due to the excise windfall resulted in lower profit. However, market share was up, mainly driven by Pall Mall.</p>
          <p>Colombia saw good growth from the GDBs and Mustang, the main brand acquired in the purchase. In Argentina, overall volume was down. Market share was flat, but premium share improved to a record high of 29%, up over 3 share points versus 2011, with Lucky Strike the fastest-growing brand in the market.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, reported profit was down 3% but up 3% on a constant basis. Overall, the region saw good profit performances in France, Germany, Switzerland, Romania, and the UK, partially offset by a decline in Italy. The economic uncertainty in the southern part of the continent continued to put pressure on consumers' disposable income and to impact volume, which declined by 5%, mainly due to Spain, Italy, Poland and Hungary.</p>
          <p>Share of the fine cut markets grew with volumes up 8% versus 5% for the industry and Pall Mall strengthened its position as the leading brand in fine cut with an 18% uplift in volume. In Italy, both volume and profit were down as a result of the difficult economic environment. Share in cigarettes declined but profit and share grew strongly in fine cut.</p>
          <p>In Germany, volume and share were up outperforming all other industry players and trade brands. Lucky Strike extended its leadership of the all-natural segment and was the fastest-growing brand in the market in 2012. Profit also grew, driven by higher pricing and good cost management.</p>
          <p>In France, profit and share grew despite the market contracting. Lucky Strike convertibles and all-natural offerings were key drivers of share growth.</p>
          <p>In Spain, operating profit increased strongly, on the back of price increases and a lower cost base. Share declined despite the growth of Lucky Strike, which is now one of the fastest-growing cigarette brands in the market.</p>
          <p>In Romania, industry volume was slightly down. Nevertheless, group volume increased, resulting in a higher market share, mainly driven by the strong performances of Dunhill and Pall Mall. These, together with good pricing, resulted in higher profits. Market share increased in the UK, driven by the strong performances of Pall Mall and Rothmans. Price increases and efficiency improvements led to a strong growth in profit.</p>
          <p>Profit in the EEMEA region grew 8% to &#xA3;1.4 billion, mainly due to stable volume and good pricing which was partly offset by the adverse impact of exchange. At constant rates, profit increased strongly by 15%. Losses in low margin brands in Turkey and continued political instability in Nigeria and Egypt impacted regional volume, which was marginally lower at &#xA3;235 billion.</p>
          <p>In Russia, both profit and market share grew. Exit share at the end of 2012 was 0.5 points higher than the prior year. Rothmans, which was launched in the value-for-money segment during 2012 has performed well and has already achieved an exit share of over 1%. The group maintained leadership of the premium segment with another good performance from Kent.</p>
          <p>Ukraine, saw a strong increase in both volume and market share, also driven by Kent's good performance. However, a very competitive pricing environment coupled with increased marketing investment resulted in lower profits.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, profit grew at constant rates but was flat at current. Despite the continued growth of illicit trade, volume was up although market share was slightly down.</p>
          <p>Continued political instability in Egypt and poor law enforcement fueled the growth of illicit trade, resulting in sharp declines in volume and profits, but growth in market share. In Turkey, Kent and Lucky Strike performed well, however, losses in the low price segment led to a decline in both volumes and market share, although share showed some signs of stabilization in the final quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Lower volume coupled with adverse exchange rate movements resulted in lower profits. The GCC markets reported good market share growth due to Dunhill's continued good performance and a strong profit growth mainly driven by improved product and price mix.</p>
          <p>Ben now will take you through the financial statements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nicandro, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>I'll start with operating margin. As you know, our medium-term target is to grow operating margin by 50 to 100 basis points on average each year. Obviously, some years will be below the average and others above, but I'm delighted that we've comfortably beaten this target in 2012 with margins increasing by 160 basis points. In organic constant terms, the margin increase was 140 basis points.</p>
          <p>All the regions contributed to the improvement. Asia Pacific was well ahead, driven by higher pricing and tight cost management particularly in Malaysia, Japan, and South Asia. EEMEA also grew strongly with good improvements in the GCC, Russia, and South Africa. The Americas continued to improve operating margin despite already being above 40% and Western Europe was also ahead of 2011 despite the challenging economic environment.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the income statement, adjusted profit from operations grew 3% to &#xA3;5.7 billion. At constant rates, this growth was 8%. Revenue growth at constant rates was 4% and as you've just seen, our cost program is continuing to improve margins, leading to an 8% increase in operating profit at constant rates. Restructuring costs were marginally higher than 2011 at &#xA3;206 million. It's mainly related to the introduction of our new operating model, together with the continuation of factory closure and downsizing activities in Australia, the integration of Colombia, the closure of the Bremen factory in Germany, and restructuring in Argentina.</p>
          <p>Amortization of trademarks is slightly above 2011 due to the full year impact of Colombia. Profit from operations increased by 15%, aided by the absence of the one-off charges seen last year. Net finance costs were marginally below 2011 despite the higher closing net debt position. This was mainly due to the absence of a number of one-off interest costs associated with tax cases and the advantage of low interest rates. These were partially offset by lower investment income.</p>
          <p>Associates were 3% higher at &#xA3;692 million. For the purpose of the adjusted earnings per share calculation, the adjusted contribution from associates was &#xA3;38 million or 6% higher at &#xA3;697 million. The contribution from associates was 10% higher at constant rates of exchange. The adjusted contribution from Reynolds American was 4% higher at &#xA3;448 million. At constant rates, the increase was 3%.</p>
          <p>ITC delivered an excellent performance. The group's share of profit after tax increased to &#xA3;237 million, a growth of 9% at current rates and an impressive 23% in constant currency.</p>
          <p>Profit before tax was 15% higher at &#xA3;5.6 billion. The underlying tax rate was 30.6% compared to 31.2% in 2011. The key drivers were geographic mix of profits and the positive resolution of some tax audits in Germany and New Zealand. Our guidance for 2013 is for a tax rate around the current level.</p>
          <p>The non-controlling interest charge was similar to 2011. At constant rates of exchange, this charge would have increased 8% with the difference mainly due to the devaluation of the Brazilian real. Profit for the period rose 22% to &#xA3;4.1 billion.</p>
          <p>The share buyback program reduced the average number of shares from &#xA3;1,982 million to &#xA3;1,949 million and as a result, the adjusted earnings per share is 207.5p, an increase of 7%.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share growth of 7% was adversely affected by exchange rates. At constant rates, the growth was an impressive 12%. This was driven primarily by the increase in profit from subsidiaries. The good performance from associates, the lower effective tax rate and the share buyback program all contributed positively.</p>
          <p>Moving on to cash flow, operating cash flow was &#xA3;240 million lower at &#xA3;5.1 billion, with the reduction driven by two main factors. Firstly, capital expenditure was higher due to the funding of our innovation strategy, the One SAP build and the purchase of Globe House. As a result net capital expenditure increased by &#xA3;176 million over 2011.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you may recall at the half year announcement, we had an increase of around &#xA3;450 million in working capital and we anticipated that this would partially unwind. As you can see, the increase at the year-end had reduced to &#xA3;141 million. This increase over 2011 was mainly due to stock builds in a number of markets.</p>
          <p>The lump sum payments on pension funds primarily relates to UK schemes. It's now shown separately to give greater transparency to cash flows of this nature.</p>
          <p>Net interest paid was lower primarily due to one-off payments relating to interest on tax cases in 2011, which don't recur and tax paid increased broadly in line with profit growth.</p>
          <p>The main driver of the higher income from associates was the Reynolds share buyback program. Overall, free cash flow was &#xA3;3.3 billion. Operating cash flow conversion was 90% with free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted earnings at 81%.</p>
          <p>Dividends paid to shareholders rose 8% to 2.5 billion. Under the share buyback program, 38.9 million shares were repurchased at the cost of &#xA3;1,258 million, including transaction costs.</p>
          <p>Net investment activities relate to the purchase of CN Creative Limited in December and a small increase in our shareholding in the business in Bangladesh.</p>
          <p>In 2011, the main investment was the Colombian acquisition. There was a net cash outflow of &#xA3;637 million for the year.</p>
          <p>And finally, net debt, which ended the year at &#xA3;8.5 billion, the increase was limited to &#xA3;545 million despite the outflows from share buyback program.</p>
          <p>Given the strength of our balance sheet, we have announced this morning that we'll reopen our share buyback program to a value of &#xA3;1.5 billion for 2013.</p>
          <p>That's the end of the presentation, I'll now hand it back to Nicandro for the Q&amp;A session.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ben. In summary, 2012 has been another very good year for British American Tobacco. We have met or exceeded all our financial targets. Despite facing a currency headwind and economic uncertainty, we have once again delivered high single figure earnings growth of 7% at current rate or an excellent 12% at constant rates.</p>
          <p>The proposed dividend per share is 7% higher at 134.9p and we are also increasing our share buyback program for 2013 from &#xA3;1.25 billion to &#xA3;1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>I am confident that the business will continue to deliver. Price remains strong, we have a very good brand portfolio, a proven capability in innovation and marketing, good share growth momentum and a diverse geographic footprint.</p>
          <p>We'll now open the meeting for questions. And for the purpose of the webcast, please remember to state your name and the firm you represent. So, who'd like to start? Okay, David.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's David Hayes from Nomura. Just about the margin progression, to your point about being ahead of the target, were there kind of one-off in there? That means this 150 will suddenly drop to 20, that you've brought something forward or would you say that it's sort of still a steady progression?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on Brazil, just wondering whether you can talk about the resilience of the market volume wise the last couple of months following the additional price rise following the tax in January?</p>
          <p>And I guess staying in Brazil, just in terms of the limitation on ingredients that is coming in, I was wondering if you could talk about if we should factor in either volume or cost associated with that change towards the end of the year? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Should I do operating margin first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The guidance for operating margin is 50 to 100 basis points a year and we feel no reason to change that at the moment. If you strip out the operating margin increase from AsPac, actually the rest of the group was 0.9% so it's bang in line with the guidance we gave. AsPac did have one or two one-offs in it; FX was quite a contributor so that was about 0.4. The Japan volumes last year, remember, we were flying in products in jumbo jets and that hit the margin in 2011, so that's been an increase as well. We've got the closure of the Australian factory as well, so that's a one-off in Australia because that's not going to come every year. But also, you've got good pricing and tight cost management so some one-offs in Australasia and that's why I'm comfortable in holding to the 50 to 100 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take your Brazil question. Let's talk a little bit about the impact of the excise increase we had last year. As I remember well, what happened in the first half of last year was sizable. Excise increase is a five years plan in Brazil and every year, the excise increase will go down so the excise increase that we faced in January 2013 was lower than last year. And in 2014, it's going to be lower than 2013 and 2015 is going to be even lower. So in 2015, excise increase would be around 5%.</p>
          <p>The impact in terms of the market, because of the large excise increase, the market was down from the duty paid point of view, 6% last year. And this was mainly driven by the growth of illicit trades despite the minimum price that was introduced. Illicit trade went from 20% to 22%. What's happened in Brazil is that local companies, they abide by the illicit trade by the minimum price, but the contraband, of course not. So the national companies' share went down and the illicit trade went up.</p>
          <p>The volume in Brazil from a consumption point of view was 3% down. So the difference between 3% and 6% is the growth in illicit trades. If the question is how much of the market is going to be down in 2013, with the new excise increase, it's very difficult to predict. We have to wait and see.</p>
          <p>But more importantly, Brazil, despite the large excise increase or despite the fact that the competition usually lags increasing price against BAT, we grew market share big time in Brazil, 1.2%. So it was the highest market share growth that you have in a single year. This just shows that the portfolio has worked extremely well. We have up-trade in the market. Dunhill is doing extremely well. So the company is in a very good shape.</p>
          <p>Regarding the ingredients ban, that's &#x2013; the main impact with the ingredients ban was the ban in menthol, don't forget that menthol is a very small segment in Brazil accounting for less than 2% of the market. So we don't <mark type="ph" /> force (33:18) the ingredients ban, the introduction of the products without some of the ingredients because some of them, are they still allowed, such as sugar, of course, will be in September 2013. So, we are ready to come to the market with the new &#x2013; with the products with &#x2013; according to the new law. Some of the change has been made already. We don't fully see big changes in terms of the cost for the company.</p>
          <p>Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, James Bushnell from Exane BNP. A few questions on volumes. Your volumes in the Asia region seem to tail off a little bit in Q4. I wonder if you could just talk about the moving parts and how we should we think about that going to 2013?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on Western Europe, conversely your volumes seemed to have got a little bit better in terms of the declines. We've obviously heard a few different things from you competitors about how they see Europe. What are you thinking about Europe? Are you seeing it as a stable volume decline situation or one with up or downside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, in the case of &#x2013; first of all, it's very difficult to analyze volume trends when you look for quarter by quarter base because you have loads in one quarter as compared to the other as you saw in places like in Brazil before the price &#x2013; the excise increase, in Philippines and things like that. So, probably we will see the impact, for example, in our case in quarter one in Brazil that probably, the volumes are going to be lower than the quarter four. It doesn't mean that the underlying dynamics of the market have changed dramatically. That's the first point that I'd like to highlight. And the way that I see the market going for 2013, overall markets, from the consumption point of view is going to be pretty much similar than what we saw in 2012. That will be a stable to a slightly growth.</p>
          <p>Of course, the duty paid market, we saw that decline around 1% to 1.5% because fine cuts grew strongly in Europe, for example, and illicit trade in the global base was a little bit higher last year than it has been in previous years.</p>
          <p>So, in terms of volume trends, I don't see big change 2013 against 2012. But looking at the volumes on a quarter by quarter base, it is very difficult.</p>
          <p>In the case of Western Europe, how I see the evolution of Western Europe, I think that was your question. I don't think &#x2013; if you look at &#x2013; it's a very large region. And when you talk about the region, the reality is you have to take a temperature of someone that is maybe cold at his head and very, very warm at his feet. But I see that volumes, look at quarter-by-quarter in Europe, mainly the Southern European countries, is not getting any worse but is not getting any better. I see similar rates of decline that you saw in the first half of the year. You're having some places, of course, a slightly better trend and some other place a slightly worse trends.</p>
          <p>Our numbers in Europe, we declined less than the competition because we are growing share. We are doing very well in Western Europe, mainly driven and powered by Lucky Strike performance. That's why Lucky Strike, that is the strongest region for Lucky Strike in Western Europe. We grew Lucky Strike volume 11% in 2012. So, that is the situation.</p>
          <p>In terms of Asia Pacific, as I said, it's very difficult to analyze quarter-by-quarter. The region had an outstanding performance in 2012 in 8 out of the 10 top markets. The markets that we face some issues were Indonesia, in which we had some volume losses because of the introduction of the new excise structure but our &#x2013; the share has stabilized in the last four months. And also our strategic portfolio is much stronger. It's more than half of the volume now. And 12 months ago it's 20% of the volume. And also we had the issue in Korea that's a tough comparator against previous year.</p>

          <p>In terms of the &#x2013; how we should think about volume growth in Asia over the next couple of years? You had a few &#x2013; Japan and other things going on the last year or two. How would you think about that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that Asia is one of the regions that we should see volume growth. I'm talking about the region consumption point of view. Talking about BAT, I think that we have a very strong portfolio. We have very good plans in place, a very good pipeline of innovation and we expect to grow faster than the market.</p>
          <p>Rogerio, I think that you're on waiting list, just a minute.</p>

          <p>Nicandro, I think for you. Which markets among your top 15, which you are more optimistic about for 2013?</p>
          <p>And one question for Ben, I think you have a very good visibility I presume on, obviously, on the savings that will come from the SAP rollout in Australia and the productivity plans in place. Would you say that the amount of cost savings for this year in million pounds is higher than last year? Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your questions about the top 15 markets, the biggest markets in BAT, how do I see in terms of growth potential for 2013 and I think that you are talking about not volume but profitability, volume and share. And I think that, as I said in my statement this morning, we think that we are in a very good position.</p>
          <p>In some of the markets, I think that we have made some good inroads in those markets such as Canada, that we now see for two years in a row, BAT growing share, profit has been stable, so I see there's some optimism next year. In places like Mexico, we are back to growth. We have a very strong portfolio. But overall I'm optimistic about our big markets. And some others such as Indonesia, we are making the right calls to start growing. So I am optimistic about our top markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In terms of savings, obviously the nature of savings in BAT is changing, so it's sort of ending the closure of factory type savings. We're going through the collection of back-office overhead into shared service type savings. Once we've got SAP in we'll see further savings come in working capital. I'm not going to split those savings out between SAP and non-SAP savings or even within SAP. But they will underpin the growth in operating margin, so that's why we're comfortable sort of signaling a continual growth in operating margin for the foreseeable future, because the things we need to do to deliver those savings we're already doing, which is putting in a consistent set of business processes, backed up by a single instance of SAP around the group.</p>
          <p>It's a steady pace, yes. Remember the program will go on for four or five years, so this is not a sort of one-hit wonder.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. Can you talk about what's happening in Russia and in particular within premium, how Kent is doing? That is one question.</p>
          <p>The second question is how should we think about the innovation program? You're obviously rolling out natural around the world, are you still &#x2013; have you still got further to go on capsules? And is there anything else coming up shortly that we should think about even if you can't be specific as to what it is, that's meaningfully new or could be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's talk about Russia, first of all. In Russia, what we have seen in Russia, we had a large excise increase at the beginning of 2013 as you are aware. But more importantly than the excise increase, is how it's changing the dynamics of the market because the excise increase is moving low-priced brands up faster than premium brands, so it's compressing the gaps, price gaps.</p>
          <p>So we saw, for example, in the last 18 months, the low-priced brands in Russia going up in terms of pricing 40%, and premium brands 23%. If you look at January, for example, low-priced brands in Russia in December &#x2013; December-January, went up 20%, and premium brands went up 11%. And this plays quite well with our portfolio. We have 46% of the share in the premium segment in Russia. So this up-trading that you are seeing in Russia plays in our favor.</p>
          <p>Kent is doing well in Russia. It has &#x2013; we saw some growth of market share in Russia in Kent. I think that we left 2012 with a very strong position in terms of market share, as I said, driven by Kent, and the Rothmans launch that is doing extremely well in Russia. It's one of the best launches that we have seen in Russia in the last years. We have 0.5% market share December 2012 against December 2011, so exit, exit, so we are doing very well. But I think that the change in excise structure in Russia plays in our favor. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Your second question, Adam?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Talk about innovation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Innovation &#x2013; you have to understand first of all that you have to sweat our assets. There are lot of investment behind innovations, as I said last year. So I want to roll out innovation to the majority of our brands. Innovations account for 16% of BAT volume and 45% of the GDB volume. So there is a way to go. Our share of the capsule segment for example, that's the advantage of being the first mover, is 53%.</p>
          <p>So we have a long way to go in the current pipeline with all natural. And I can guarantee to you, we have a very good pipeline of innovation for the coming two to three years. We just have to be careful to &#x2013; as I said, it's a slight innovation because bringing an innovation to the market, it doesn't mean that the consumers understand the following morning. It takes one year. Eventually, some of the markets will take two years to get the awareness and the purchase that you expect. So that's the moment you come with a new innovation. So it's not about bringing innovation every year to the same markets.</p>
          <p>So we are trying to sweat what we have, to roll out, and we are being successful. Because 2011, volume of innovation against 2010 was 20% &#x2013; 25% higher. 2012, against 2011 was 20% higher. In a market that is declining between 1% to 1.5%, and I think that this is the reason that the GDBs are growing faster than the markets because the GDBs are the primarily vehicle to drive innovation, not only the brands that you drive innovation. We try to put in our premium portfolios and you have some very strong premium brands across the world.</p>
          <p>I think that you have a question, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. John Leinster, UBS. Just can you give us a &#x2013; looking back last year, going into 2013, can you give us some guidance in terms of cost outlook and whether the margins improved by <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:30)? And I think particularly over the last year and give us an outlook on 2013, and also whether the innovation is probably a little bit less this year, whether the marketing costs are going to...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, in terms of margin increase for last year, you've got a number of impacts on the margins, so you've got pricing, obviously which works in our favor. You've got mix because more of our growth is in lower margin markets. That's what you get for developing markets. You've got cost of sales increases and then you've got productivity savings. So, in terms of the overall margin improvement last year, the pricing benefit offset the volume and mix and cost of sales decline and the true underlying margin increase really came through from the cost saving program.</p>
          <p>In terms of guidance for next year, I couldn't possibly give you guidance on the breakdown of the margin increase next year. Remember, in terms of the SAP program, we only put in SAP in Malaysia in Q4 of 2012. We're doing Australasia and South Asia in 2013, but it's not until 2014 that the real industrialized rollout of SAP starts happening in BAT. So, more of those savings later on.</p>

          <p>Can you give us an idea in terms of leaf cost savings?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of leaf costs, leaf costs are going up by 5%. So, no real significant difference in leaf costs. Flue-cured leaf, which is our major leaf is slightly lower than burley. But they were all in the 5%, 6% region, so no real significant increase in leaf cost.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fulvio Cazzol from Goldman Sachs. I read in one of the interviews this morning that you passed on already 80% of price increases that you were planning for this year. Are those the absolute level of pricing compared to, say, last year, are you seeing the same level in percentage terms?</p>
          <p>And then my second question was on Brazil, its minimum wages are increasing 3.5% this year versus I think it was 7.5% last year. Do you think that pricing in that particular market is going to be a little bit more difficult in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with, I'd say, the second part of the question, the Brazil price increase. The price increase in 2013 is lower than the previous year. But don't forget that it's still a large price increase on top of another large price increase at the beginning of last year. And as I said, the impact in the market is pretty much dependent on the economics and it's about unemployment and disposable income. If unemployment in Brazil improves this year, and I don't think that there is any indication that the situation is going to worse there, and disposable income stays as it is or improves, I think that should be well absorbed. But it's very difficult to predict, to be honest, because there's large excise increase on top of another large excise increase. So, it's very difficult to predict how it's going to be the market reaction.</p>
          <p>And the first question, can you just...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I read this morning from one of the interviews...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About the pricing, sorry. Yes, as I said this morning, we have got already 80% of the pricing that we were expecting to have in 2013. It's just to highlight that we are in a very strong pricing &#x2013; a good pricing environment. When was I here last year, and I said that it was around 65% or even 70%, so it's slightly better. And I cannot unfortunately disclose the amount of pricing. But, as I said, we make our projections based on the targets &#x2013; financial targets that we have and we have already 80%. So, it's a very strong-price environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two things. First of all, on Des's [Des Naughton's] new appointment, I'm wondering how we should interpret that. Does that represent a step up in your efforts on next generation products? And is that mostly a UK effort for the moment or is it going to be a global thing?</p>
          <p>And then just quickly on the Philippines, I'm wondering what your ambitions are there. What's a reasonable goal for the next five years and are you going to have to spend a lot of money there initially to get the position you want?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with NGP, Next Generation Products. This is a natural development of our strategy. We have been working very hard in the last couple of years in the harm reduction. That's not a new thing in BAT. And the acquisition of CN Creative at the beginning &#x2013; at the end of last year is part of this program. They have a small innovative company developing novel nicotine devices. And we set up Nicoventures two years ago, also part of this strategy and we hope that we can bring to the market some products in the next couple of years. That's the reality.</p>
          <p>I thought and we thought that having a focus on all those developments under the same umbrella was the right thing to do. So it's something that we thought through and we are discussing for the last one year. It came to fruition. But to be honest, it was already working in that way. But going through one of our current board directors, we thought that we need a special focus on that. That's why he deserved a management board position for that.</p>
          <p>Regarding Philippines, we are extremely happy that now we have a level playing field in Philippines. Philippines is one of the top 10 markets from the volume point of view. So, of course we are going to invest in Philippines to grow. And how successful we are going to be is very difficult to predict. But are we going to investment in Philippines and are we going to invest behind our brands and trades in order to get our market share there? The answer is yes. But unfortunately it's very difficult to give you targets of where we want to be in five years' time. We want to be as high as possible. But we have a local competitor, a strong competitor there that has the majority of the market share is going to be tough. They have strong brands as well. But we are going to make the investments in order to grow there.</p>
          <p>Erik.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, with respect to Canada, quite favorable development the last two years. I'm wondering does that outlook change since it sounds like a number of provinces are taking tax increases or is it simply you're going to be able to price and offset the accompanying volume decline and perhaps increase in Illicit?</p>
          <p>The second question with respect to the regulatory outlook, does &#x2013; can you comment on what you see happening with the Tobacco Products Directive and also then the appetites of countries for plain packaging given what we know at this stage in the game? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, the first question is about Canada. Yes, I think that we are in a much better position in Canada than we were two years ago, three years ago. I always came here and said, it is one of the markets that we're ready to step up our games. We have done so. We have been growing share and we are in a very good position. The profitability has been declining for three or four years in a row. We have stabilized that.</p>
          <p>I don't think that you'll see large excise increases in Canada this year. As far as we know, those are excise increases, more or less, according to the inflation. That's something that the industry can cope. Illicit trade in Canada, to be honest, is slightly down in 2012, 0.4 percentage points only, but slightly down. Because we don't see huge excise increases and because the government has been focusing on fighting illicit trade, I think that we'll have good potential for growth in Canada in 2013, but we have to wait and see. It's still February, long way to go. But so far, it seems that we haven't seen anything that could disrupt the trend.</p>
          <p>Regarding regulation, and I think that your question is about the TPD and plain packaging. And I think that I'll start with the plain packaging. As you know, we introduced the plain packaging implementation in Australia, started in December. And as I said during my speech, we haven't seen any changes in the market. You have to consider that with display ban, the consumers had to ask for the brand anyway, so we haven't seen any change. But it's too early to call. We have to wait and see.</p>
          <p>Regarding New Zealand, New Zealand have listened to the arguments for and against this measure. And they have a knowledge of the importance of their trade obligations, and the WTO challenge that's going through against Australia. So, they had postponed the implementation until we have a resolution of the WTO challenge that we should see in 2014. So, we are glad that they made this call.</p>
          <p>And the third country which is analyzing it is UK, as you know. And UK we have a consultation. We have hundreds of thousands submissions and we should see the results of the consultation in the coming months. But, the facts of the life is that just three countries are moving to this direction. We have a lot of noise around before but we haven't seen any consultation or haven't seen anything to progress so far. I'm not saying it's not going to happen but the fact is just three countries are looking at that carefully.</p>
          <p>In terms of the TPD, we believe that a draft legislation contains provisions not based on science. We expect to see further amendments in European Parliament. They are going to analyze this at the end of the year. You know that they are measuring, packaging, ingredients and formats of packs and things like that, I don't think that any of those provisions are based on science. And we are against it. I don't &#x2013; I think that at the end of day it will bring unintended consequence if those measures are implemented.</p>
          <p>So we have to wait and see the European Parliament to debate it. It should happen at the end of this year, but my expectation is that there will be some amendments, if you ask me the question because it just &#x2013; measures that are not based on science are not going to meet any public health goals that they set by themselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Dirk Van Vlaanderen from Jefferies. Just &#x2013; I wonder if you could give your thoughts on CapEx in 2013 and beyond?</p>
          <p>And then also maybe just on working capital, is there a structural reason why it's an outflow and where do you see opportunities for improvement there and could SAP be the enabler?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just on working capital, the increase we faced this year was largely stock builds, so that happens every year in a sense that we have stock builds in Brazil this year, we have stock builds in Russia. So you're just seeing the natural flow through of those stock builds, nothing particularly unusual there, and much better than the position at the half year, of course.</p>
          <p>In terms of net CapEx going forward, we've got the rollout of SAP to do. And of course, as you roll out the innovation strategy, you're buying machines to put that volume onto as well. So you'll see CapEx staying at or just marginally above the current levels for the next year or two before coming down again once the SAP program is rolled out.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Martin Deboo with Investec. Ben, tax rate. I'm just trying to understand as to why the consumer sector is high for a business that doesn't have direct U.S. EBIT exposure. So the question will be broadly the whole value creation model. Do you see upside on that? Where is that on your to do list?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tax rate is largely the result of mix profits. So I don't see any substantial changes coming down to substantially reduce the tax rate, no. We do what we can. We're sort of conservatively aggressive when it comes to tax planning, that's the way we like to describe it. So we don't push the envelope in terms of tax planning but where there are established schemes that we tend to use them. So I see the tax rates staying at around the current level going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, one more question and Henry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Henry Davies, Merrill Lynch. Just on your reduced harm efforts, how do you view the size of the long term opportunity in e-cigarettes versus modified risk cigarettes versus some of the other nicotine delivery devices you have? And are you seeing any signs of governments or regulators become more accepting of the reduced harm approach to reducing smoking? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is a growing interest in terms of nicotine device, so the consumers are interested on that. And that's why we are stepping up our efforts in this area. We think that it can be an important category in the long term. I don't think that in the next five years you'll see big change of switching from combustible to non-combustible but mid long term it can be an important category. That's why we are stepping up our efforts with everything that I've just said.</p>
          <p>In terms of the regulatory bodies, we have been in contact with them, mainly NHRA in UK and I think that it's very difficult to predict how they react when you start having those products in the market. Nowadays excise, when exists, is very low. And I think that should be kept like that, if you think about the harming reduction strategy. The harm reduction concept should work and that is my expectations going forward.</p>
          <p>So we intended to develop a range of products inside the risk continuum, not only e-cigarettes that's why we are stepping up our efforts through Nicoventures, CN Creative and some internal initiatives.</p>
          <p>So thank you. The session is over. Thank you very much.</p>
