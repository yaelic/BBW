          <p>All right, Denita. Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. And welcome to this call. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss Potash Corp.'s fourth quarter and 2009 performance and our outlook for 2010. We appreciate the opportunity to share our views on a very difficult year, which is now behind us, and more importantly on our preparations for a new phase of growth in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>The challenges faced by farmers, distributors and fertilizer producers in 2009 have been well documented. The onset of the global economic crisis late in 2008 brought an overwhelming sense of caution to almost every industry. And ours was no exception. Farmers reduced fertilizer applications and distributors worked through their inventories, bringing producer sales to a virtual standstill. As a result, our 2009 potash volumes were the lowest in our 20 years as a publicly traded company. And average realized prices for all nutrients, especially phosphate and nitrogen, declined significantly from 2008 levels.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter earnings of $0.80 per share were down from 256 per share in the final quarter of 2008. This brought our full-year earnings to $3.25 per share, considerably lower than the record 11.01 per share earned in 2008. But it was still the third highest total in our history.</p>
          <p>Our quarterly gross margin of 279.6 million was well below the 873.1 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2008. While the full year total of $1 billion was down from a record 4.9 billion for the previous year, potash remains a key to our gross margin, generating 74% of the quarterly totals and 71% for the year. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and cash flow also declined on a quarterly and annual basis.</p>
          <p>While we did not meet the expectations established over the previous five consecutive years of record performance, we believe we made the right decisions to ensure long-term value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>We remained fully committed to our strategy of matching our potash production to market demand, which meant running at about 30% of our operational capability in 2009. In an environment of reduced demand, we chose to preserve our assets, confident that this approach will be rewarded as market conditions improve. The gridlock that tied up our industry through much of 2009 clearly began to lift in the fourth quarter. We recognized this would inevitably come to pass as our business is driven by a simple truth: Fertilizer use can be deferred, as we saw in 2009, but it cannot be ignored indefinitely without damaging global food production.</p>
          <p>The nutrients in the world's food supply come from the soil. And in 2009, farmers in many parts of the world harvested much larger volumes of nutrients than they replaced through fertilizer applications. This practice is simply unsustainable, especially in view of the long-term fundamentals that drive our business. Global population continued to increase, primarily in countries like China and India, countries that also demonstrated economic resilience and continued growth in 2009. With growing populations and more money comes increased demand for more and higher quality food. An increasing number of people in developing nations want, and can afford, better diets with more fruits, vegetables and protein from animal sources, which takes more grain to produce.</p>
          <p>No one should mistake a financial recession for a food recession. Despite the economic challenges of 2009, global grain consumption grew by another 2%, continuing the long-term pattern of growth that has been established over decades. Farmers now need to produce near-record crops every year just to keep pace with the world's rising food requirements. This cannot be achieved if they continue to draw nutrients from the soil without replacing them.</p>
          <p>In 2009, global crop production fell short of previous record harvests, a product of reduced fertilizer use and less than perfect weather in some parts of the world. As a result, prices for crop commodities remained substantially above historical averages, with corn, soybeans, rice, palm oil and other key food staples all improving during the fourth quarter. This had a significant impact in many countries, as food inflation continues to be a major focus for governments, farmers and consumers.</p>
          <p>Earlier this month, government officials in India raised concerns that average food prices increased more than 15% from one year ago, with some items jumping nearly 50%. In China there are indications the current corn crop may not be as large as initially expected, which could be a factor in rapidly rising corn prices in that country.</p>
          <p>Domestic production is generally more affordable than imported food, and to avoid greater reliance on imports, farmers in these countries and their governments must pay close attention to soil fertility. It is basic facts: When you grow crops, you owe a debt to the soil. In many regions, that nutrient debt grew larger in 2009. Now farmers must begin the process of replenishing nutrients to protect the most valuable asset on their farm: their soils.</p>
          <p>This is especially true of potash, the nutrient that has the greatest impact on food quality. Potash was historically under applied as developing countries were unfamiliar with the benefits of balanced fertilization and lacked the economic ability to address nutrient deficiencies in their soils. In recent decades, fertilizer education has improved and farmers can afford to purchase all three nutrients. Most importantly, people in developing countries have higher incomes and have an expectation of a more nutritious diet. More fertilizer, and specifically more potash, must be applied to meet the demand for high quality food.</p>
          <p>This is supportive to our business and gives us renewed optimism heading into 2010. We expect this year will mark the transition between the historically low levels of 2009 and return to trend line demand in 2011. However it is important to understand that global agriculture is a big machine and it takes time to get all the gears fired up after over a year at a near standstill.</p>
          <p>As farmers re-engage and focus on yields, they drive the need for distributors to access product. If their wheels get turning, they will look to producers with growing needs and we will be ready with our increased production capability. Right now, there are large voids in the nutrient chain, especially for potash. Filling the gaps in the soils and in the distribution system will take time.</p>
          <p>North American farmers took the first step, returning to the market in the fourth quarter of 2009 despite a limited window for fall applications because of the late harvest. With better crop economics and lower prices for inputs, including fertilizer, the caution that characterized the first nine months of 2009 was replaced by optimism. U.S. dealers are once again booking orders, and we anticipate North American demand in 2010 to be in the range of 8.5 to 9.5 million tons.</p>
          <p>In offshore markets, countries are reengaging according to their current needs and confidence in market conditions. With recent recalibrations in spot market prices and China's settlement with a major supplier on a new potash contract in late December, distributors see limited downside pricing risk and pent-up demand.</p>
          <p>In India, there's an increased need for potash because of poor nutrient balance in the soil and crop production that fell well short of anticipated levels in 2009. Given their low inventories, we expect Indian buyers to resume potash imports under a new contract in the first half of 2010, purchasing volumes of 5.5 to 6.5 million tons from international producers. Their volumes, however, are contingent upon their commitment to a new contract around or before the expiration of their current contract at the end of March.</p>
          <p>With support of farmer economics and depleted inventories, we expect Brazil to import 5.5 to 6.5 million tons of Potash, depending on economic conditions and access to credit, while Southeast Asia is expected to require four to five million tons.</p>
          <p>In China, the question is how quickly farmers return to the market. The risk related to production rice every planting season that potash is not sufficiently used relative to nitrogen, and soils there have already been depleted for two consecutive years. The need to increase crop production and return to proper application levels is clear. In 2010, potash consumption is expected to rebound from the low levels of the last two years. We currently estimate China will consume eight to nine million tons of potassium chloride and require 4.5 to five million tons of imports. However, if recent Potash price reductions lead farmers to reengage more quickly, buyers could come back to the market for additional volumes later in 2010.</p>
          <p>Combined, we estimate global potash shipments will reach approximately 50 million tons this year, up from less than 30 million tons in 2009. This increase is almost entirely related to required applications rather than a restocking of inventories. We expect demand to return to trend line in 2011, and could move even higher as farmers and distributors reach the stage of rebuilding reserves in the soil and distribution channel. When this unfolds, we expect to gain a disproportionate share of the demand growth for potash and capture higher margins.</p>
          <p>Customers have not forgotten that prior to the economic crisis, supply/demand fundamentals were extremely tight. In many markets, buyers were on allocation if the industry could not keep pace. Prices rose rapidly, and although they were reset in 2009, they remain at historically high levels. The experience of short supply and rapid price spikes helped fertilizer buyers, farmers and even producers gain a better understanding of the need for capacity reinvestment. That financial commitment, however, can only happen when returns support the cost of capital. Although a number of brownfield expansions were announced in recent years, the sharp decline in demand led some projects to be put on hold.</p>
          <p>At Potash Corp., we have continued work on all of our projects, in Saskatchewan and New Brunswick. And these expansions represent the largest portion of new global production scheduled to come on-stream over the next several years. When fully operational, we expect to have capacity of 18 million tons, roughly double our operational capacity when we started these projects seven years ago. Even with the resetting of potash prices in 2009, our brownfield projects remain economically attractive. Longer term, greenfield development will be necessary, but right now, we don't believe prices justify that type of investment.</p>
          <p>At the current time, we believe the best use of our capital is to invest in our existing operations, where capacity can be added more quickly and at a fraction of the cost of greenfield development. We also look for strategic opportunities to expand our global reach in potash. This week, we purchased an additional 1% of Israel Chemicals Limited, bringing out total interest in this potash producer to approximately 12.5%.</p>
          <p>We are committed to our potash-first strategy, and will keep our focus on maximizing long-term shareholder value. As we look ahead, we expect our 2010 net income to be in the range of four to $5.00 per share, including $0.70 to $1.00 per share in the first quarter. More importantly, we expect to see the efforts of farmers, distributors and our company aligned once again in 2010, returning the world's focus to the pressing issue of food production.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your interest in Potash Corporation. I'm joined today by members of our executive management team, and we would be pleased to answer any questions you might have.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First question today comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Bill, I'm wondering if you could give us an update on where Canpotex is with China in terms of its negotiations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Vincent. Canpotex will have its next meeting with the Chinese next week, and we don't know exactly what the outcome of that will be at this time. I could comment by saying that we believe that the BPC settlement with China was too low, in our opinion. To tie into this pricing level for the whole year would have been a mistake for us.</p>
          <p>This element definitely came as a surprise to use, because it was way below market and did not reflect the recovery that we see in 2010. If you look at BPC, their history, they've proved to be a bit of a panic seller. They are basically inexperienced marketers and they've panicked in both directions. They pushed the price too high in 2008, and now too low with this settlement. So we didn't think much of that, and that's quite obvious with our position.</p>
          <p>We do see our issues with China being short term in nature. China's potash consumption will start to recover this year, but it will grow considerably in 2011 and beyond. China will be at least 75% dependent on imports of potash going forward, and will need our new capacity to fill their needs in the not-too-distant future.</p>
          <p>The International Plant Nutrition Institute, by the way, forecasts China potash consumption to grow from the current normal level of what they say is 10 million tons a year, even though that's, it's been about half of that the last two years, to 26 million tons over the next 15 years; so a growth of 16 million tons from a normal consumption year.</p>
          <p>So part of our strategy, you've heard us talk about it before, is to transition to quarterly pricing in China, so that we won't have these annual contracts keeping the world with really a short breath. And we think that this is going to be much healthier for the market, not distorting of the market, and we do expect to sell China on this basis this year.</p>
          <p>So if you think about it from the BPC and maybe even the ICL Israeli point of view, I think they'll both come to regret their contracts with China by the time the second half of the year rolls around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. It's Joe Fischer sitting in for Bob. If you can just help me understand the $288 a ton price on the offshore side? And if we've seen prices clear at 385 or 400 in recent weeks, and if China was allegedly the floor at 350, can you kind of reconcile that number for me? Just maybe walk me through.</p>
          <p>And then just one other comment; if you could comment on the inventory situation in the three big countries, Brazil, India and China, that'd be very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Joe. I'll have David comment on the price first, and then I'll talk about inventory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the price in the fourth quarter was mainly attributed to a December inventory adjustment, price adjustment with the new settlement in some of the markets around the world, as well as we are under water on our freight management contracts for the year by about $65 million. So on lower volume, that's about a $20 hit there. In addition, we have, with our fixed costs for terminals and rail cars, that probably added another $20 to the lower net back realization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, in terms of inventory, Brazil, empty. They went out of 2009 with a 400,000-ton estimate of inventory, very, very low. I was on the phone with Brazil this morning and throughout the system there continue to be very low, and as we said, we think 5.5 to 6.5 million tons this year imports. So there's a long way to go in Brazil, and you're going to see that market heat up here. I should also say that the real, the weakening of the real, is very favorable for soybean producers, so that's also seen as a positive. And the change with Vale taking over the production assets of Bunge is seen by the market as positive that there'll be some growth there amongst retailers across the board. So it won't be so dominated by one retailer.</p>
          <p>In India, also extraordinarily low inventory levels. We wouldn't be surprised to see India conclude earlier than even the expiration of their contract in March. That's how tight the situation is in India. There's tremendous food pressure in India. I mentioned 15% in food inflation but as much as 50% for some items, and the government is very sensitive to this issue because it is life threatening for a politician. So I think you're going to see a very robust Indian consumption in potash this year. And they have the worst N to K ratio in the world and they need to bring up that potash application rate. So the next few years, India's going to be a very strong market for us.</p>
          <p>China, the inventory levels we think are somewhere in the range of 2.5 million tons totally, but that's coming down rapidly. As you know, they don't produce during the winter months; the Qinghai Salt Lake freezes up. And so as the prices, when you look at corn, you look at the prices for grain in China, of course they don't relate to Chicago Board of Trade prices or global prices. They are unique to China, and those prices are much higher than what we see around the rest of the world in terms of the government establishing higher prices. So I think you're going to see Chinese farmers re-engage.</p>
          <p>I thought it was interesting the profit warning signals were put out. They talked about the impact of the global recession on demand in China being so staggering, but they also indicate that there's going to be a recovery here in 2010. The big question is, how much is the recovery? You know, we say eight to nine million tons, but it could be, it could be more than that, you know, as these farmers re-engage; because the need certainly is there. And after two years of down, we think that China could definitely have a better year.</p>
          <p>So in our earnings forecast, what I tell you is that we call it as we see it all the time. And we deal with reality, and maybe after last year, the dog got kicked under the seat on the front porch, so we're going to be, I would say just maybe a little more reserved in terms of forecast. We're going to believe it when we see it. We're going to deal with it all year long, just call it as it is. But I do think that as these weeks transpire, I mean, if I had to tell you domestically within North America, our potash after three weeks of January, we had already sold more potash in North America than we did through August of last year. Through eight months, in three weeks. That tells you how sick 2009 was. But it should give you an indication that farmers are starting to re-engage throughout the world.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Don Carson of UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you; a little question on pricing. Contract prices appear to have bottomed with the Chinese settlement, but you've still got some pretty significant premiums in Brazil. And I'm just wondering how you sustain those premiums given that Brazil is importing as much, or more than China now. And China is no longer taking freight risk. What's your sense of sort of the spot versus contract spread as we look forward into 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Don, what I'd say is China doesn't have their whole order book filled yet. They've had some problems, as you know. We haven't done anything with them, and as far as I know, Germany hasn't done anything with them. And the Jordanians haven't done anything with them, and even IPC hasn't done anything with them. So they've got two contracts, which are BPC and ICL. But they're going to need a lot more than that. So it's a question of, how do they get that done. I think the rest of the players, they see it, the market through their eyes. We certainly see the market in a recovery mode in 2010.</p>
          <p>And as I said, we saw that Chinese price just too low, so we said, no. We're not going to supply at those levels. So Brazil is a spot market, and you know it's reflective of the current supply/demand situation. So even since BPC, they booked just before Christmas, they got some coal in their stocking I guess, but we see the market a month later here stronger than we saw it even before Christmas. And even then, our ideas obviously were quite different than BPC.</p>
          <p>So I think those settlements will go down as the low, absolutely the low point, but even then, how much follow-through China gets with that when everybody else sees higher prices, why would you sell at that price when you're getting even now $60 a ton more than that price? It doesn't make any sense. So I just think that there's some ferreting out there. I don't think that Brazil is the anomaly. I think China is the anomaly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Fai Lee of RBC Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Bill, BPC has suggested it wants to move to a spot market in 2011 because the growing domestic production makes it a less important market. And Mosaic also indicated it doesn't expect China to be as influential going forward. You seem to have a different view on China in terms of demand. If you're correct, would that make it more difficult to move China to a spot market, in your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I don't think so. And I don't think that Canpotex, when we talk about China, I don't think any of us disagree about the long-term importance of China. I think there may be some misunderstanding of comments made in the short term. And as I said, our issues with China are short term, because China is going to need us, and we're going to need them. And when you have 75% of your potash demand that's going to come from imports over the years, and that number is going to go from 10 million tons to 26 million tons, as I said earlier, they're going to need Canadian potash. There's just no doubt about that, and I just think that we all agree that these long-term contracts, as I said on the last conference call, I don't know what kind of contract it is when the customer doesn't take anything for a whole year. I mean, you've got a year contract and they didn't take anything. That's zero performance. That's not much of a contract.</p>
          <p>So let's try something different, and that's why we think spot, you know, when I say spot I'm talking quarterly pricing, much like we do in Brazil, I think it's better for China. I think it will be better for Chinese agricultural production, because Chinese farmers have been held up with this type of approach to the market and this nonsensical annual negotiation, which just leaves everybody exhausted and stupidly so, in terms of what it means for a serious issue like global food production. I mean this is too important to risk and we just think that spot pricing is coming, we think this year in China. And we have no doubt that 2011, China will be a spot market and a market just like all the other markets around the world.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Bill, following on that, do you expect the structure of the India negotiations to be different? You know, obviously you're not thrilled with the outcome at BPC, but you've tended to follow BPC, would you think about conducting parallel or leading those negotiations potentially? I'm talking Canpotex obviously. And secondly, do you see what you're saying on contract versus quarterly applying to India as well?</p>

          <p>I do think that India will eventually go to quarterly pricing as well, I just think that you get too many market distortions here for both sides, and I mean again, India, gosh almighty. They had this terrible monsoon last year, you saw what happened to their sugar crop and their grain production, and we get sometimes bureaucrats involved that worry more about ego than they do about taking care of food production in their country, and so it's, it really is not the greatest outcome. It hasn't been good.</p>
          <p>So I think India will make that transition as well. We'll see how soon India comes to the marketplace here; our guess is they're going to come earlier than normal because the inventory levels are low and there's pressure on food and they're talking about revamping the subsidy in India, but I can guarantee you the politicians are saying look, one thing for sure. Don't let us have another bad crop in 2010 because we were fooling around with the subsidy. I mean that would be suicidal for every one of those politicians. So I think you're going to see quarterly pricing be the way markets will unfold in the years to come.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I've got a couple real quick questions. One is, what is the current China split on imports versus produced product, and what'd they do this past year, for instance, and how fast do you expect to get to that 75% level that you're talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well if you look at last year, Charlie, the current split was very heavy on domestic because their consumption was so low. You know they were only consuming 5.5 million tons. So they were so far down for the second year in a row. So you've seen the domestic production take up more of the total. What we're saying this year is that China's going to be eight to nine million and we say that there's going to be four million tons produced in the country totally. And so that means if you've got nine million you're going to have five million tons' import. So it might change that balance here in 2010. And then we're going to be quite a different situation going out as demand returns to China and they start to adjust their N to K ratio.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Bill. You know it's increasingly clear that big mining's giants are getting into the business, with Vale buying Bunge assets and BHP buying I think Athabasca Potash this morning. So when you look at that, what do you think of the implications on the industry and its oligopoly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, PJ, well, I mean I did see the Athabasca Potash acquisition news this morning. And I guess my comment on that would be that it gives everyone holding a lottery ticket hope. It's quite perplexing. All of us that are in the business are scratching our heads with that one.</p>
          <p>But to talk about the big mining companies and Vale and BHP, it's pretty clear that a greenfield mine cannot be justified economically by anyone at the current time. I mean, there's just not sufficient return on investment to make it work. And these are capitalist companies as well, so I know that they're taking a look at that, and of course they haven't made their decisions. I mean heck, current prices barely justify brownfield expansions. So you can't make greenfield investment decisions currently.</p>
          <p>In the case of BHP, they've said publicly that they will not make an investment decision until November of 2011, and I know they're hoping for better prices by then to make that decision, because their board, it can't be any different than our board. If we took a greenfield mine to our board today and they said, well what's the return on this, and you said, negative, that wouldn't get a whole lot of traction with the board. And so I know that they're waiting to see what it looks like in November 2011.</p>
          <p>But if they made that decision to go ahead then, and let's say the economics were favorable, I'm not sure that they will be, but let's say that they are, then that would put the start of any meaningful production out of BHP in 2017 at the earliest, at the earliest. And you know, if they do decide, if BHP decides to get into the business, they're not going to do it just on the basis of greenfield. The greenfield route is too time consuming and expensive, it's an expensive project. You have to have a lot of expertise. The people issues are huge.</p>
          <p>But even if you read their own proclamations, they say that they would have this Jansen project up to eight million tons by 2026. That's a long time from now, 16 years from now. So I just don't believe that they'd follow just that route, and then at the end of that timeframe at best they'd be the sixth- or seventh-largest player in the world when they're used to being number one, number two or number three.</p>
          <p>And we do think some of the recent public pronouncements have been designed to drive down the share prices of existing potash players to make the potential acquisition more attractive. They're certainly not stupid, but neither are we.</p>
          <p>So the attention from the iron-ore miners reminds me a little bit of the conditions in the late '60s when the oil companies discovered fertilizer. You had Standard Oil at that time, get in the business, Gulf Oil, Mobile and others all investing huge dollars in fertilizer thinking easy returns were on their way. And they ended up losing billions of dollars, and they got out of the business just as fast as they got in. So a study of this history might be a worthwhile exercise for companies with no fertilizer expertise.</p>
          <p>And I guess my last comment would be that BHP doesn't walk on water. They have to go through the same high-capital expenditures, time-consuming route we would to bring on a greenfield property. At the end of the day they're going to have a much higher cost structure than we have. And I'm fully confident we will be able to compete against them or anyone else who decides they might want to enter this space. You know, PJ, no one should take us for granted. We can be very tough when we need to be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, guys. Quick question, Bill. Just going back to Canpotex in China. Can you give us an idea of how long you're willing to wait? And also, should we be disappointed if you don't succeed? And also, just wanted to see, given that the decline we've seen in corn prices since the January 12 USDA's report, are you sensing any change in behavior from the farmers since that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me tackle the first part of your question, and I'll have David Delaney talk about the second part.</p>
          <p>I don't know how long it's going to take for Canpotex in China to come to some agreement this year. As I said earlier, the issues that we have with China are short term. So this year, it might be the second half before we conclude. We did learn to live without China last year. That was instructive. And what I'd tell you also is that I look at the potash supply around the world and it's like a balloon. You squeeze it on one side and the air pops up in the other. So if BPC and the Israelis are occupied with China at low prices, we're going to take the business that they might have taken someplace else at higher prices. And I mean that's just the way it works.</p>
          <p>And so I don't think there's any disappointment. I think it sends a really strong message, as a matter of fact, to the marketplace that Canpotex hadn't agreed to that low price. And we see this market a little differently, I guess, than those two companies that took it, but maybe the same as the companies that haven't taken it, because if it was such a hot spit deal, these other guys would have jumped on it too, and they have not.</p>
          <p>So I think that China may well meet us this year, and if you start to look at the ice conditions in the Baltic right now. St. Petersburg is full of ice. They've got ice-class ships required there. The freight rate has jumped up there. I mean it's got to be really painful for BPC. We even have ice now in Vins fields, we haven't seen that in quite some time. So there's some pressure on the logistics. And it's hard to tell exactly what that will mean for China's supply. So there's a lot of moving parts here. But the issues, as I said, are short-term issues with China.</p>
          <p>David's answering the second part, Edlain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Edlain. Yes. I think we were all a little bit surprised by the USDA January 12 report with yield coming in at 165 bushels per acre. We hear there's still probably three to 500 million bushels that have not been harvested yet. That would take total corn production this year up a billion bushels, but what people tend not to get is the demand side is also up a billion bushels, so we need a big crop every year. And if you look at the next two or three years, we need to plant 88 to 90 million acres and grow 13 billion bushels just to keep up with demand.</p>
          <p>Corn prices are still very strong, farm gate price is 3.50, we think if you look at the futures price, December's around 3.93, and the next three years after that it's well over $4. Net farm income is still very good, averaging around $72 billion this year and forecasted at 70 to 80 billion the next four years. If you look at U.S. fertilizer cost as a percentage of corn revenue, it's right in line with a 10-year average, right at 18%, and we think the contribution margin for corn this year will average around 300 to $350 and that's basis 3.50 corn and $4 corn. We've seen great enthusiasm in the first quarter on our potash order book. The fall application was about 1.6 million tons of potash short of where it needed to be. We think on a fert year basis if we ship 4.8 million tons as an industry in the United States here in the next four months, that still leaves this crop, frankly, short of potash. Now on a calendar year we think we'll be closer to 995; on a fert year, this crop is still going to be short of nutrients after a huge crop this past year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. My question is, India is now the largest contract buyer in the world, so is it logical to think that their financial terms to buy Potash would be more favorable than the ones that China received? And secondly, can you talk about how much your distribution and transportation costs went up per ton in '09 versus '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. I'm going to have David talk about the second one. India's the largest contract buyer of two. You know, China and India, obviously we have contracts with Japan, Korea and a couple others that are much smaller and much more traditional, I would say. But when you look at contract buyers around the world that everyone supplies, in the past, it's been China and India. So in terms of favorable terms, the Indians have always been able to get favorable terms. Being a bigger buyer than China, that's a short-term issue too. China will be a much bigger buyer than India long term. India's going to be a big buyer, but China is going to grow much faster.</p>
          <p>Dave, do you have the second part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Jeff, the average T&amp;D costs from a railcar and terminal standpoint, costs are up $20 year over year; from a vessel-free standpoint, our freight-management contracts, as I mentioned earlier, we're under water by $65 million. Just to give you an example, the average market daily hire in '09 was about $17,000 a day, and our contracts were at 31,000. So that's why we're under water. Looking at 2010, we're in much better shape. We're not quite at market. The average hire is around $17,000 and our contracts are at 20. So we're still going to be under water, but probably only by $5 million in 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. What it says is obviously in a very, very lean volume year, as we said it's the lowest year since we've been publicly traded in 20 years, the impact on your distribution costs, your cost per ton, you're laying off a bunch of people, you've got all these shutdown weeks. It's a very poor comparison to what happens when we are operating with even one hand tied behind our back. This year we had two of them tied behind our back, and so you see some of these comparisons don't look so hot.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Elaine Yip of Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. Lower potash applications in the U.S. seem to have had very little impact on yields. Can you share with us on what you're seeing with regard to yields and other reasons, and what might have been the impact from lower fertilizer application?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, Elaine. I would tell you that lower application in the U.S., keep in mind U.S. starts out with a very healthy soil bank. U.S. is, and the agronomic practices in this country are amongst the very best in the world. And so what we had in 2009 is that that soil bank concept I've always liked because it's a very good metaphor to help people understand fertilizer, but in 2009 there were major withdrawals from that soil bank around North America. And what we're seeing in 2010 already just with the order book we have through the first part of January here, is there are going to be some pretty big deposits put in because you pulled off 165.2 bushels of corn, you harvested nutrients with every one of those bushels, and these farmers, especially with the economics that David just went through a little while ago, are very incentivized to fertilize.</p>
          <p>And boy, our domestic customer base, they're as optimistic as could be about what's going to happen. And of course we had a slow fall, so we're going to have a big spring here in 2010. So I don't think you can draw any conclusion from the U.S. being down one year as much as they were because of the nutrient levels they had going into the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of the rest of the world it's a different story. There you go in with very poor fertility levels, India poor fertility levels, China poor fertility levels, Brazil poor fertility levels. They don't have the history of the agronomic practices that the U.S., Canada, the developing, the developed agricultural world has. So they don't have much margin for error because they just don't have the build-up. And even this year with what we're forecasting, 50 million tons, as I said earlier, that doesn't have any inventory restock associated. This is just going to match consumption. And then you're going to have inventory restock for 2011, plus consumption. And that's where you'll really see a move back to trend or above trend, 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I had a question on nitrogen and phosphate, shifting gears for a second. I saw in your guidance that you're projecting a combined 400 to 500 million in combined gross profit. Just looking back historically, it looked like you've produced those results in '05 and '06 when corn was closer to $2.00 a bushel. You know, gas prices have gone up quite a bit, and the returns to nitrogen also look pretty favorable. Can you talk a little bit about why the guidance was, in my opinion, a little bit low? And with that being said, I do appreciate your giving guidance, and understand why you guys might want to be a little bit more conservative. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you, Michael. I'm going to ask David to speak to it, and then some of the rest of us might pipe in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, nitrogen prices have improved a little bit in the last two weeks. There could be some upside in our nitrogen forecast. Tampa was just settled at 365. We think world trade for ammonia could go from 17.5 to 19 million tons. Urea prices are strong at 325, and with the low fall application for ammonia here in this country, it's going to probably require more urea and UAN, which could improve that price even more as we go into spring. And if you look at import levels, on a fert year basis to date, they're behind historical levels. So nitrogen is looking a little better. You still have the issue of what the gas price is going to be in the Ukraine post-first quarter. Russian gas prices are up a little bit, European gas prices are higher.</p>
          <p>So again, with low beginning inventories around the world for nitrogen, and the need for nitrogen in this crop year basis, low crop yields that Bill just mentioned around the world, I think nitrogen could be a little bit stronger this year. And prices are starting to indicate that.</p>
          <p>Phosphate has moved up a lot in the last 45 days. Our DAP and MAP price from the trailing quarter could be up as much as $100, so we're seeing improvement there. Some of our industrial contracts had that yearly lag, so we will not see the improvement there as we did in '09. That will hurt us a little bit, but we do see our asset prices, for example, to India improving in some of our other product lines.</p>
          <p>What's hurting us a little bit in the forecast too is we've been, probably pretty conservative in our sulfur forecast. We have a high sulfur number in there, so that's probably pulling our phosphate margin down from what you think it should be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, I'm just going to, just to underline the sulfur point that David made, I'm going to ask Tom Regan who's head of our Phosphate and Nitrogen business, our operations there, to comment on physical availability of sulfur, the pricing tendency, where he thinks the thing is going. Tom, give us a little more color on that, would you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sure. One of the things we can say about the upcoming year is liquid sulfur supply is very tight. We've seen a bit of a change in the U.S. where both drilling and re-melting facilities have been added in order to give the liquid sulfur supplier the opportunity to service more than one market.</p>
          <p>And also with that, as I'm sure most of you know, we've seen a fairly dramatic increase in the Tampa reference price for sulfur, currently at $90 a ton. And that's indicative of this tight supply, that's indicative of choices that typically refiners that provide liquid sulfur have and what they do with that product. Now currently, we have a sulfur supply situation that fits our forecast for 2010. If that would move upward then we would be after additional supply and there could be increase in pricing. And that's basically where we stand for the upcoming year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're seeing sulfur around the world right now, people, Chinese, Middle East, people looking for sulfur and that's kept pressure on sulfur. That Tampa reference price also has transportation, you gotta add transportation to that, so you shouldn't just look at it as 90 bucks. There's a little bit more to it; so sulfur definitely is taking a whack out of the DAP margin, so that's reflected in our overall guidance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yes. Thank you. Just a quick question on the Vale-Bunge acquisition, and I'm just wondering in terms of the price that they paid and the EBITDA that they paid for that asset, do you have any comments on what this implies for rock prices going forward for the coming year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Hari, the price that Vale paid for the Bunge phosphate assets is very encouraging to us. We clearly realize that we're significantly under valued, because it's, I would say a fairly robust price, I would say. Rock assets are just going to be more valuable over time. I mean rock is the whole key, and you're just seeing a much higher bias to rock prices, especially from a quality point of view, distance from beneficiation plants, chemical plants. The permitting issues involved in phosphate rock are enormous and growing, the expense of permitting. Rock is the whole key to phosphate, and you're going to see higher phosphate rock price. You're already seeing higher rock reflected on the cost side, and we talked about sulfur and ammonia in DAP, but you've also got to think about phosphate rock. So the Vale price, that was an eye opener for us.</p>
