          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ford Motor Company fourth quarter earnings conference call. My name is Michelle and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We'll be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>And I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host Ms.  Lillian Etzkorn, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michelle, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for spending time with us this morning. With me this morning are Alan Mulally, President and CEO, and Don Leclair, Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room are Peter Daniel, Senior Vice President and Controller; Neil Schloss, Vice President and Treasurer; Mark Kosman, Director of Accounting; and K.R. Kent, Ford Credit CFO.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I would like to review a couple of quick items. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the slides that we will be using today have been posted on Ford's investor and media websites for your reference.</p>
          <p>The financial results discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our Form 10-K for the year 2007. Additionally, the financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call are reconciled to their GAAP equivalent as part the appendix to the slide deck.</p>
          <p>Finally today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here. Additional information about the factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors are also detailed in our SEC filings including our annual, quarterly, and current reports to the SEC.</p>
          <p>With that, I would now like to turn the presentation over to Alan Mulally, Ford's President and CEO.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Lillian, and good morning to everyone. We will begin by reviewing the key financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Don will take us through the details and provide our planning assumptions for 2008, then I'll come back and wrap up before we take your questions.</p>
          <p>As shown at the top of the slide, slide 2, vehicle wholesales last quarter were over 1.6 million units, up 75,000 from the same period in 2006. Total company revenue of 45.5 billion was up about 13% from a year ago. The increase primarily reflects favorable exchange and net pricing as well as higher volume. Pre-tax results from continuing operations were a loss of 620 million, an improvement of 1.3 billion from the same period in 2006. This includes a more than 1.4 billion improvement in automotive operating profits, partially offset by lower profits at financial services. Our fourth quarter net loss was 2.8 billion, this included 30.9 billion of pre-tax special charges. Don will take you through these largely non-cash charges shortly.  And we ended the quarter with 34.6 billion of gross cash, an increase of 700 million from 2006.</p>
          <p>Overall, as we've said before, our plan is working and we continue to show progress. For the full year we had a pre-tax profit of 126 million from continuing operations, an improvement of about 3.3 billion from 2006. Our net loss was 2.7 billion, an improvement of nearly 10 billion compared with 2006.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 3, we have continued to make real progress on our plan. We took restructuring actions in order to operate profitably. We reduced North American personnel by 32,800 during 2007, and reached an historic four-year agreement with the UAW. We also achieved a 1.8 billion of cost reductions last year. We continued to accelerate development of new products our customers want and value. We'll discuss our 2007 product highlights in more detail in a minute. We worked to finance our plan and improve our balance sheet. We completed several debt to equity exchanges, we sold Aston Martin and other non-core assets and are working toward completing the sale of Jaguar-Land Rover. And it is important to recognize that as we accomplished all of these actions we continued to improve quality, made great progress in working together effectively as one team across the globe leveraging our global assets.</p>
          <p>Our full-year results indicate that we are headed in the right direction. In North America, results improved 2.5 billion compared with a year ago. Ford South America, Ford Europe, PAG, Ford Asia Pacific and Africa and Mazda, all were profitable for the full year and all reported significant improvements compared with the same period a year ago. Ford Credit continues to be profitable. Although its results were lower than a year ago, it continues to perform in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 4, as I mentioned earlier, we remain committed to new products our customers want and value. In 2007 we had some great launches, including the European Ford Focus, the Mondeo and the C-MAX in addition to the North American F-Series Super Duty, Escape and Focus. Just last week, the Mazda CX-9 won the 2008 North American Truck of the Year award at the Detroit Auto Show, which is really special.</p>
          <p>Another boost to our line-up in 2007 was Ford SYNC, our in-car connectivity system we developed jointly with Microsoft. We are also excited about the two all-new vehicles coming this year, the Ford Flex, an innovative crossover, and the Lincoln MKS, the flagship of our Lincoln brand. That's in addition to the new Ford F-150, which comes in the second half of this year also.</p>
          <p>In South America, Ford retail sales were up 19%. In Europe, retail sales were up more than 5% year-over-year. In Asia Pacific and Africa and Mazda, full-year Ford China retail sales were up 26% year-over-year, outpacing the industry. We also opened the Nanjing assembly plant in China, which will allow us to grow even more this year in China.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 5, we're equally excited about Ford's progress in quality, safety and environmental innovation. In quality, we had five segment winners in the J.D. Power and Associates Initial Quality Survey, more than any other manufacturer. Our survey indicated that Ford's quality improved at the rate of 11% in 2007, more than five times better than the industry average of 2%.</p>
          <p>Turning to safety, this year Ford earned more Top Safety Pick ratings from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety than any other manufacturer. Ford has more NHTSA 5-star safety rated vehicles than other automaker. And in Europe, Ford was the most &#x2013; has the most vehicles on the Euro NCAP's Top 10 list for adult occupant protection.</p>
          <p>We continue to move ahead in environmental innovation as well. We announced a new engine family called EcoBoost, which will deliver up to 20% better fuel economy and reduction of CO2 by 15%, and we plan to install this new technology in 0.5 million vehicles annually in North America within the next five years. In addition to the improved fuel economy, EcoBoost improves driving performance as well. EcoBoost will debut in the Lincoln MKS next year. And our partnership with Southern California Edison will advance the commercialization of plug-in hybrid vehicles.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 6. Before I turn it over to Don, I want to make a couple of important announcements. With our UAW partners, we are announcing an enterprise-wide program to accelerate attrition. The enterprise-wide hourly buyout program for employees at select closed plants at Atlanta, St. Louis, Edison and Norfolk is now open and will close on February 28. Employees that accept the buyout during this window period will separate by March 1st. The buyout window for UAW employees at all other Ford locations will open the week of February 18 and will close the week of March 17. Employees that accept the buyout during this window period will be released beginning April 1, and while all of these separations will be completed by year-end, we expect most of these will occur during the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We also announced last night the sale of our driveshaft business to Monroe to Neapco. This is a major step in our plan to re-source and idle the Monroe plant this year.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn it over to Don.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alan. Let's go on to slide 8, which provides a few details on our results. Starting at the lower left, our net loss for the quarter was 2.8 billion, and this net loss included a 1.8 billion non-cash tax benefit largely related to Accounting Standard FAS 109, and we treated this as a special item. That was 1.5 billion out of that 1.8 billion. Adjusting for these items leaves a fourth quarter pre-tax loss of 4.5 billion from continuing operations and these results include pre-tax charges for special items of 3.9 billion, which we'll cover on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Excluding these special items, our fourth quarter pre-tax operating results were a loss of 620 million, and for the full year we had an operating profit of 126 million, and most of the following slides will focus on these pre-tax operating results. Also shown at the very bottom of the slide is corporate equity. At the end of last year, our book equity was 6.1 billion. This was 9.6 billion better than at the end of 2006, and the improvement reflected the changes in our pension and OPEB obligations as well as the effect of the debt/equity exchanges we've completed last year.</p>
          <p>Slide 9 covers our special items which were 3.9 billion pre-tax in the fourth quarter. And the two main items in the fourth quarter were both non-cash. First, on an annual basis we test for asset impairment, and as a result of our review this year we've recorded a charge of 2.4 billion for impairment of goodwill at Volvo. And this is because of the deterioration in Volvo's results during 2007, and this was primarily related to exchange rates, mainly the weak dollar with respect to the euro and the Swedish krona, higher incentives, mainly in the US, and lower than planned volumes, as well as the likelihood of lower than previously projected forward year volumes. And this in essence caused us to redo the business plan for Volvo. When you discount the cash flows from that and compare that to the book value, we end up with a write-off. And based on the accounting rules, we wrote the book value down to the fair value and the charge was 2.4 billion pre-tax. And no write-off was necessary for the Jaguar and Land Rover, which we also concluded our testing on.</p>
          <p>Now, we also took a charge of 1.4 billion to reflect the change in our business practice related to providing retail incentives, or variable marketing as we call it, to our dealers, which we discussed with you back in November. This change revises our process to commit to offering incentives on an annual basis. In addition to these charges we recorded a number of smaller pre-tax adjustments in the fourth quarter including a 120 million gain on the exchange of 560 million of debt for equity, the recognition of mark-to-market losses of 76 million on certain hedges at Jaguar and Land Rover that previously would have been deferred, and this is in line with our activity over the prior two quarters, and additional charges totaling about 120 million, mainly for personnel reductions at PAG in North America.</p>
          <p>Now slide 10 shows our pre-tax results by sector. You can see the 620 million loss in the fourth quarter on the left, that's 1.3 billion better than a year ago, including a 1.4 billion improvement in Automotive. The total company profit for the full year was 126 million, 3.3 better than a year ago, and that includes a 4 billion improvement in Automotive.</p>
          <p>Now over to slide 11, where we will spend some time on the Automotive sector. Slide 11 explains the change in the fourth quarter automotive profits compared with 2006. Again that's an improvement of 1.4 billion. Volume and mix was 500 million favorable, primarily due to higher volume and favorable mix in North America and South America, partly offset by lower dealer inventories in Europe and unfavorable mix at PAG. Net pricing was 1.3 billion higher, primarily reflecting improvements in North America. South America PAG and Asia Pacific also were favorable. Costs were about flat, and we'll have more on that later. The impact of the continued weakening of the US dollar against key European currencies also reduced profits by about 100 million. Net interest was 100 million unfavorable, and other factors were 200 million unfavorable, and that included the effects of the UAW contract.</p>
          <p>Now on slide 12, we explain our cost performance, which totaled 1.8 billion favorable for 2007. The fourth quarter was unchanged in total. Warranty expense was about 1 billion lower, and this primarily reflects the non-recurrence of unfavorable 2006 adjustments at Jaguar-Land Rover, as well as improvements in most operations, consistent with our overall quality improvement.</p>
          <p>Manufacturing and engineering costs were about 800 million favorable, mainly reflecting our restructuring actions. In the fourth quarter, reductions in manufacturing were offset by higher engineering expenses. Net product costs were 1.9 billion higher, more than explained by added product content, including diesel engine emission requirements in North America, as well as higher commodity prices. And these increases were partly offset by cost reductions, and a portion of the increases for product content was recovered in pricing.</p>
          <p>Spending-related costs improved by 700 million mainly due to the favorable effects of 2006 asset impairments, as well as lower depreciation related to having had accelerated depreciation in 2006 for plants that were to be idle. Pension and healthcare expenses were 800 million lower, primarily reflecting the 2006 implementation of our 2005 healthcare agreement with the union, as well as ongoing improvements related to curtailments and higher pension asset returns. Overhead costs were about 500 million lower than a year ago, mainly due to our restructuring actions, and advertising and sales promotions were up 100 million, consistent with our plan.</p>
          <p>Now slide 13 provides some detail on Other Automotive. In the fourth quarter, Other Automotive, which consists primarily of interest and financing-related costs, was a loss of 128 million. That is 69 million unfavorable compared with 2006. This was more than explained by higher interest expense. And for the full year, Other Automotive was a loss of 547 million. That is almost 800 million unfavorable compared with 2006. This primarily reflected the non-recurrence of last year's tax-related interest income of about 670 million and higher net interest associated with the financing we implemented during the fourth quarter of 2006.</p>
          <p>And to provide more insight into this area, we will provide a break-out between net interest and the fair market value adjustments that also are recorded in Other Automotive. As we are doing here for each of the quarters of this year, we will do that going forward. And during 2007, as you can see on the slide, the volatility in net interest was relatively small while the fair market value adjustments had significant volatility. And we expect the net interest expense element of Other Automotive to remain in the range of about 175 million to 200 million per quarter this year.</p>
          <p>For the next section of slides, we will cover each of the automotive operations, starting with North America on slide 14. Wholesales were up in the fourth quarter by 39,000 to 665,000. This increase is more than explained by the non-recurrence of the dealer inventory reduction in 2006. Revenue was 17 billion, up 1.9, increase more than explained by improved net pricing, higher volumes and favorable mix. And the pre-tax fourth quarter results were a loss of 1.6 billion. That's 1.1 billion better than 2006, and we'll cover that on the next slide. And the full-year loss was about 3.5 billion, which is 2.5 billion better than 2006.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 provides an explanation of the 1.1 billion fourth quarter improvement in North America. And volume and mix was 600 million favorable, more than explained by the non-repeat of the dealer inventory adjustment I mentioned, as well as favorable mix. Net pricing improved by 1 billion, primarily reflecting reductions in retail incentive levels, pricing for new equipment being added to our vehicles, lower daily rental mix and timing differences.</p>
          <p>In total, costs increased by 200 million. The increase was more than explained by higher net product costs, including higher regulatory and commodity costs as well as added product features. And these added product features were partly recovered by higher pricing. Engineering and advertising expenses were higher to support our new product introductions. And these increases were offset partly by improvements in manufacturing and overhead-related costs. Exchange was 100 million unfavorable and other factors were 200 million unfavorable, mainly reflecting effects of the UAW contract.</p>
          <p>Now slide 16 shows US market share for Ford and Lincoln Mercury. For the fourth quarter our market share was 14.1%, of which 9.8 was retail, and 4.3 was fleet. For the full year share was 14.6, including retail at 10.1 and fleet at 4.5. As previously indicated and in line with our plan, we continue to reduce our sales to daily rental companies, and therefore, our fleet share continues to decline. Our fourth quarter share was down 0.7 point from the same period a year ago, including a 0.4 point reduction in retail, and 0.3 point on the fleet side. And the retail reduction primarily reflected lower full-size pickup trucks and mid-size and large SUVs, and this reflected in part the weak housing market and higher gas prices.</p>
          <p>Now on slide 17, we track our progress in reducing our employment levels. We reduced our salaried positions to 23,700, a reduction of 7,800 since the end of '06, including 200 in the fourth quarter. And hourly employment was 57,900, a reduction of 20,000 from year-end '06, including 1,800 during the last quarter. And at ACH there were 6,100 hourly employees at the end of the fourth quarter, a reduction of 5,000 since the end of 2006, including 100 in the fourth quarter. As Alan mentioned, we announced that we reached agreement on the sale of the Monroe driveshaft business, and we expect additional agreements to be reached in the near future, and the bulk of the ACH employees are planned to be redeployed or separated by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 shows our assembly capacity in North America, and we've reduced our max installed capacity by 1 million units to 3.8 and our straight-time manned capacity by 700,000 to 2.9. As we discussed with you in November, assembly plant operating cost is largely related to personnel levels, and significant savings can be realized by reducing staffing levels to match demand. We plan to report our capacity in the future by measuring our manned capacity.</p>
          <p>Slide 19 provides a summary of our progress on cost reductions. In this year, we've made significant progress in reducing our structural costs, but much of this improvement has been offset by increases in product content, in large part to meet regulatory requirements, as well as higher commodity costs. We are committed to our goal of 5 billion June '06 to '08 cost reductions, and we will talk more about that later.</p>
          <p>Now onto South America on slide 20. The fourth quarter sales were 126,000. That's up 20,000, and despite the unit volume increase, our share declined because strong industry demand continues to outstrip our ability to keep up. Our revenue was 2.4 billion, up 700 million, mainly reflecting higher volumes, favorable exchange and net pricing. South America earned a profit of 418 million in the fourth quarter, 304 million better than a year ago, primarily reflecting favorable net pricing and higher volume. Full-year pre-tax profits were nearly 1.2 billion, an increase of over 600 million from 2006. The increase in profits is explained by favorable net pricing and higher volumes, partly offset by higher costs. And last year's results in South America were a record, but as we indicated last year, this level of profitability is unlikely to be sustained.</p>
          <p>Slide 21 covers Ford Europe. In the fourth quarter, wholesales were 487,000 units, down slightly, with the decrease more than explained by lower dealer inventories. Fourth quarter market share was 8.3% in the 19 markets we track, equal to a year ago, and for the full year our market share was up 0.1 point. Revenue was 10.4 billion, up 1.6 billion from 2006, primarily due to currency translation. Fourth quarter profits were 223 million, 5 million higher than 2006, primarily explained by favorable cost-performance offset by lower volume. And for the full year, profits were nearly 1 billion, that's 542 million better than 2006, and that improvement included continued progress on cost as well as improved volume mix and favorable net pricing.</p>
          <p>Slide 22 covers PAG. Fourth quarter wholesales were 204,000 units, up 4,000 from 2006, primarily reflecting growth at Land Rover, partly offset by lower volumes at Jaguar and Volvo. US market share was 1.1, in line with a year ago, and the Europe market share was 2.4, up 0.2 point. Those are for the fourth quarter. Revenue was 9 billion, up 400 million from a year ago, primarily reflecting the translation impact of stronger European currencies on European revenues as well as volume and pricing at Land Rover.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter results were a profit of 59 million. This is 115 million worse than 2006, primarily reflecting adverse exchange, product mix, and the non-repeat of one-time profit impacts included in the '06 results. Within PAG, Volvo is breakeven, with Jaguar-Land Rover accounting for the profit. And Volvo more than accounted for the decline from '06 to '07. The full-year results were a profit of 504 million, that's 848 million better than 2006. And the increase is more than explained by cost reductions across all brands as well as volume growth and favorable net pricing at Land Rover. These were partly offset by unfavorable exchange and adverse mix. And Volvo did incur a loss for the full year.</p>
          <p>Slide 23, we look at Asia Pacific, Africa and Mazda. And Mazda continues to perform well. For the fourth quarter, we earned 83 million from our investment in Mazda and associated operations, and for the full year we earned 204 million. Both were improved compared with 2006.</p>
          <p>On slide 24, cover Asia Pacific, where volumes were 145,000, an increase of 20,000 compared with 2006. That increase is primarily explained by higher volume in China. For the full year wholesales were up 18,000 units compared with 2006 and China's wholesale volume increase of 30% was partly offset by decreases in other markets, primarily Taiwan, South Africa, and Australia.</p>
          <p>Revenue in the fourth quarter was 1.7 billion, up 300 million, largely reflecting currency translation. Asia Pacific and Africa reported a profit of 10 million in the fourth quarter, 145 million better than 2006, reflecting favorable net revenue, cost performance and higher profits in China.</p>
          <p>Full-year results were a profit of 40 million. That's 225 million better than 2006. The improvement primarily reflected favorable cost performance and net revenue and higher profits in China. And those were partly offset by adverse mix and exchange.</p>
          <p>Slide 25 shows automotive cash and cash flow. We ended the year with 34.6 billion of gross cash, a decrease of 1 billion compared with September 30, but a 700 million increase compared with year-end 2006. Our operating cash flow was 1.2 billion negative in the fourth quarter including the automotive pre-tax loss of 900 million. Capital spending during the quarter was 200 million higher than depreciation and amortization. Changes in working capital were 800 million negative, mainly because of lower December production, and other operating cash flow was 700 million positive including 300 million of tax-related interest.</p>
          <p>Separation programs resulted in an outflow of 300 million for the quarter, and we contributed 200 million to our pension plans. In addition, we received a tax refund of 700 million related to prior year tax settlements, and as we discussed before, our performance in operating and total cash flow for last year was well ahead of our plan.</p>
          <p>Slide 26 summarizes our net liquidity at year-end. Gross cash was 34.6 billion, and this included 1.9 billion of our short-term VEBA. These VEBA assets and 2.8 billion of cash will be excluded from gross cash starting with 2008 reporting, and this is consistent with our recent UAW agreement. Total liquidity as of year-end '07 including available credit lines was 46.5 billion. And as shown in the memo, our long-term VEBA assets were 2 billion, and as a result of the UAW VEBA agreement these assets will not be a source of cash in the future. Automotive debt was 26.7 billion, and upon expected implementation of the independent VEBA on January 1, 2010, our debt will increase by 6.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Now slide 27 covers financial services, and as you can see there, Ford Credit accounts for most of that. So we'll go onto slide 28. And -- which slide 28 explains the change in Ford Credit's pre-tax profit for the fourth quarter compared with 2006. And the earnings were about 300 million lower -- sorry, were 300 million, about 100 million lower than 2006. And the decrease in earnings primarily reflected the non-recurrence of credit loss reserve reductions, higher borrowing costs and higher depreciation expense for leased vehicles. These were partly offset by lower expenses and non-recurrence of losses related to market valuation adjustments for derivatives.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter included a 55 million unfavorable accounting adjustment related to the valuation of certain interest rates swaps. Full-year earnings were 1.2 billion, down about 700 million from 2006. Excluding the impact of market valuation adjustments from derivatives, results last year were 1.3 billion. Not shown on the slide, managed receivables were 147 billion at year-end 2007, down slightly from the end of 2006. And as of January 2008 we've resumed the use of designated hedge accounting for derivatives at Ford Credit, which will reduce our ongoing earnings volatility. The quality of our portfolio is very good, and we are really pleased with our loss performance. We did see some deterioration in our key credit metrics in the second half last year, coming off the historical lows of the last couple years. We continue to monitor closely our key loss metrics and will adjust our plans appropriately to service our receivables.</p>
          <p>Slide 29 covers our funding plan for Ford Credit. Our funding strategy includes maintaining strong liquidity to meet near-term funding needs by having a substantial cash balance as well as committed funding capacity. The left box shows Ford Credit's committed liquidity programs in cash and the utilization of those liquidity sources at the end of 2007. And Ford Credit's liquidity exceeded utilization by about $28 billion.</p>
          <p>We will continue to expand and diversify our global asset-backed funding, renew committed asset-backed funding capacity including outside of the US and continue to access the unsecured market if and when it makes sense. Already in 2008, we have successfully completed a 2 billion public retail asset-backed securitization transaction in the US. And as we've done in the past, we will continue to consider alternative business arrangements to improve our funding capability, where it makes sense.</p>
          <p>Now we also plan our leverage, our debt to equity ratios, by considering the prevailing market conditions and the risk characteristics of our business. Based on our studies of the risks associated with our assets, we believe that our leverage on the basis of our managed assets could be in the range of 13 to 1 to 14 to 1. At the end of last year, our managed leverage was 9.8 to 1. In going forward, we plan to move evenly over the next four quarters to a managed leverage of around 11.5 to 1, and accordingly we plan to resume dividends from Ford Credit to the parent this year. And the 2008 dividends will reflect Ford Credit's 2008 after-tax profits plus a return of capital reflecting the planned increase in leverage as well as a projected smaller balance sheet. We expect to hit our new leverage target by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>In summary, we believe we have a prudent funding plan, and we will maintain a conservative posture regarding leverage at Ford Credit.</p>
          <p>Slide 30 provides an update on our pension plans. Our worldwide 2007 pension expense excluding special items was 800 million, and that's down 600 million from 2006, primarily reflecting lower service costs related to the 2006 separations and higher asset returns in 2006. At year-end 2007, our US funded plans were over-funded by 2.8 billion, and worldwide our pension plans were under-funded by 3.1 billion; both of these are significant improvements from the end of 2006.</p>
          <p>The long-term return on the asset assumptions is 8.25, and that's down 25 basis points from last year, reflecting the change in our asset allocation strategy to reduce risk and strengthen our balance sheet. As we shared with you last year, our plan over time is to reduce our equity investments, our public equity investments and increase our allocations to fixed income and alternative investments.</p>
          <p>Slide 31 provides an update on OPEB. Excluding special items, our 2007 OPEB expense was 1.7 billion, down 400 million from 2006, primarily reflecting the full-year effect in 2007 our 2005 retiree healthcare agreement with the UAW. Retiree benefit payments were 1.6 billion in 2007 and the VEBA balance was 3.9 billion at year-end 2007. And of this, as I mentioned, 1.9 billion was included in automotive cash.</p>
          <p>At year-end 2007, our OPEB plans had a funding shortfall of 24.2 billion, that's 1.7 billion improved from 2006. As a result of the 2007 contract settlement and pending court approval, Ford and the UAW agreed that the responsibility for providing retiree healthcare will permanently shift from Ford to a new independent VEBA trust. And after full implementation, which is expected to be completed by January of 2010, our OPEB funded status will improve significantly. And the lower initial trend rate in 2008 of 3% versus 6% last year reflects recent experience and planned cost efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Slide 32 shows where we finished up on our planning assumptions and operational metrics for last year. Total industry sales were equal to a SAAR of 16.5 million units in the U.S. and 18 million units in the 19 markets that we track in Europe.</p>
          <p>On the operational metrics we improved our current model quality, and as mentioned earlier, received favorable endorsements from a number of outside sources. Market share was down compared with last year in the U.S., share was higher in Europe but lower in South America and China due to capacity constraints. As a result of our share performance outside of U.S. was mixed.</p>
          <p>Automotive costs were reduced by 1.8 billion, and this was better than our plan. Absolute operating related cash flow was 400 million positive, significantly better than plan, and capital expenditures were 6 billion, lower than our plan, reflecting efficiencies from our efforts to leverage our global assets.</p>
          <p>Now on to slide 34 to talk a little bit about our 2008 automotive planning assumptions. We're expecting total industry sales to be about 16 million units in the US and 17 million units for Europe. These include light and heavy vehicles, and both are down a little from last year. 17.6 million units for Europe. On the operational metrics, we continue to expect to improve our quality. We plan to reduce our automotive costs by about 3 billion during 2008. And we'll talk more about the North American cost reductions included in this on the next slide.</p>
          <p>On market share, we anticipate that US share will be around the low-end planned 14 to 15% range during 2008, with further reductions planned on the fleet side. We continue to expect operating cash outflows in 2008, and these outflows will include about 3 billion related to the acceleration of subvention payments to Ford Credit as we discussed in November. Capital spending is projected at around 6 billion. This reflects lower capital expenditures because of the planned sale of Jaguar-Land Rover, offset by higher expenditures at the other operations, mainly Ford operations.</p>
          <p>Slide 35 provides a summary of past and planned cost reductions in North America. As shown previously, we achieved cost reductions in North America of 1.5 billion in 2006 and 600 million in 2007. And as discussed, 2007 included significant unfavorable cost performance related to product content, in particular increased costs to support diesel engine emission requirements, as well as higher commodity costs. We expect product content adds in 2008 to be about 600 million, and we also expect more moderate increases in commodity prices. In 2007, we achieved 2.6 billion of largely structural reductions and believe that we can achieve that much or maybe a little more this year.</p>
          <p>The key elements in our plan to achieve these structural cost reductions include the following items: another round of UAW enterprise-wide hourly buyouts, which Alan mentioned earlier and continued progress on reducing our manufacturing capacity; sale or closure of essentially all of the ACH businesses by the end of year, including as Alan mentioned earlier the re-sourcing of the driveshaft business from Monroe; continuing to reduce salaried employment in North America, primarily through attrition; acceleration of global product development initiatives to leverage our global assets, which will result in more efficient capital spending as well as product engineering; also efficiencies in advertising, merchandising, and other overhead costs; and acceleration of our complexity reduction efforts, and this will also assist our material cost reduction plans.</p>
          <p>Slide 37, shows our 2008 outlook by sector. We expect the automotive pre-tax results to be a loss, but they should be equal to or better than 2007 when you exclude Jaguar-Land Rover from the 2007 results. So on a comparable basis we expect our operations to be equal to or better than 2007 results.</p>
          <p>The financial services 2008 pre-tax results are expected to be about equal to 2007. And so the total pre-tax operating results excluding special items are expected to be equal to or better than 2007, again excluding Jaguar-Land Rover from 2007's results. We also expect special items to be less in 2007, and we project that these will include full year personnel-related restructuring costs of about $1 billion, and both total pre-tax results and net income are expected to improve from 2007.</p>
          <p>Now, I will take you thorough our production plans for the first quarter on slide 37. Our North American production schedule is 685,000. That's down 55,000 units from 2007, consistent with our previous guidance. For Ford of Europe we expect first quarter production of 530,000 units, up 7,000 units from last year. And for Volvo we expect first quarter production of 112,000 units, down 23,000 from 2007, largely related to lower US sales. Based on these production levels, which reflect anticipated industry weakness in the US and the fact that our major 2008 North American product introductions will not begin until mid-year, we expect that our financial performance through the first half of this year will at best be equal to last year.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn it back to Alan, who will provide more specifics on our progress on the plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Don. I would now like to turn to slide 38 and share with you our assessment of where we stand on achieving our key business metrics and our financial goals. We remain committed to our plan. The improvements we saw in 2007 give us added confidence that we will meet our 2009 profitability target. Don has explained our cost reduction plans in North America. I want to emphasize that we are committed to returning to profitability in 2009, and we see achievement of the cost target as a key element in that plan.</p>
          <p>We expect to make further cost reductions in 2009, and the benefits of the UAW agreement will begin contributing meaningfully in 2010. For U.S. market share during 2008, we expect to be at the lower end of the 14 to 15% range, and we are planning on a 12 to 14 billion cash outflow for 2007 through 2009 to fund operating losses and the restructuring of our business.</p>
          <p>And turning to slide 39. Our operations outside of North America are performing very well, and we have many new products in Europe, Asia and South America. In North America the U.S. economy is slowing, and the volume and pricing outlook for the automobile industry is certainly challenging. North America has outperformed its 2007 profit and cash targets and our 2008 plan is based on prudent assumptions. We have many new products beginning in mid-2008 including the new Ford F-150, all new Ford Flex and the all-new Lincoln MKS in North America. The Flex and the MKS will be in segments that Ford presently does not participate in.</p>
          <p>We also have aggressive plans in North America to improve our business structure including a strong focus on the structural cost reductions, continuing and accelerating the flow of the new products that people want and value, reducing our complexity, further we will continue to adjust production to the changing business environment as required. Overall, we will continue to monitor progress closely and react accordingly.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 40. As we take these actions we remain committed to the four key priorities of our plan. We are continuing the restructuring our automotive business. As just discussed in 2008 this will mean further progress on using operating costs, particularly structural costs. We will continue to focus on product development and manufacturing efforts. A top priority will be the development of a truly global product plan, one that takes full advantage of our global assets and resources and that strengthens our presence in key segments such as crossovers and passenger cars.</p>
          <p>As the company moves faster to build vehicles people want and value, we will reduce the complexity of our vehicles by having fewer engine and transmission combinations, fewer platforms, more top halves, and more volume per platform. We also are working to reduce the complexity of our series and options that our customers see in the order guide, and as we make our investments in new products we will continue to improve our production systems quality, productivity and our manufacturing flexibility. We have financed our plan and we will continue to improve our balance sheet, ensuring wise use of our capital. And finally we will remain focused on working together effectively as one team to leverage our global assets. With that we would like to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of quick ones. I know, Don, you ran through a number of items that go with that $3 billion of savings. What about the healthcare deal, I think when you did the conference call post the UAW contract you said you thought that the expense saving would kick in in Q3 of '08. Is that included in the 3 billion of expected savings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are not sure when it will get approved by the courts, so we're -- our plan is to do that, to get the structural costs, and then when the 2007 agreement kicks in, that should be a plus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so still not exactly sure on the timing, but are you still targeting Q3 of '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are targeting to do it as quickly and expeditiously as we can, and we're making good progress.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but to be cautious, it's not in the 3 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, you're guiding to flat financial services revenue.  Can you speak to maybe some of the risks to that, higher provisions, higher borrowing costs, maybe a smaller balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I said flat profits, relatively flat profits, probably a smaller balance sheet as we try and -- it will be smaller in part because of lower volumes here in the US. But what we're looking at are improved margins and improved operating costs. We went through a big transformation of our system here in North America, going from 150 plus branches down to about a half a dozen large service centers. So a large reduction in operating costs, and we think, we are not sure where -- we should see some improvement in -- on the lease residual side, because we built up our depreciation reserves throughout '07 as the auction market weakened. On the negative side, the volumes because of the lower receivables and perhaps credit loss. So we see all that balancing out right now. About the same in profitability.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned that you are still on track for the plan to achieve a North America and auto profitability in '09, but given the concern about the macro, I am just wondering how much margin for error there is? How low can your 16 for '08 go and still be on track? And what kind of recovery are you expecting in '09, because I know there are some out there expecting that '08 might be tough, but then we'll kind of bounce back up towards trend in '09, so I was curious what your thoughts and assumptions were there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think as you pointed out, our overall guidance is what we have noted on the chart, and I think our feeling is that the first half of the year could be a little bit worse and then our assumptions are that the second half of the year will be a little bit better and end up at that guidance. And of course we tried to plan this prudently reflecting what the real situation is, so we've accounted for that in our assumptions also, but the key, no matter what, as you all know, is to continue to size our production to the real demand and keep improving our productivity going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does achieving the target in '09, though, assume getting back to a trend level of demand in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just -- This is Don, our plans originally assumed that we were at trend, and clearly we are not at trend now, particularly in the first half. How quickly it returns to trend, we are not sure. So I'd say, I guess two things, one, there is probably a little bit less margin than there was, everything else being equal, but everything else isn't equal, because we are a little ahead of plan. So we still feel pretty good that we are on track, the business is improving, the fundamentals of the business are improving, and we will be -- we're still committed to getting to profitability in '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just two quick ones on the buyouts. Is it true that the terms of the buyout package will be more generous than they were in the last round? And then how many people can exit that don't need to be replaced, or would you anticipate that anyone who takes the buyout would be replaced just at the tier two wage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is a lot in here. Let me start from the back of that and go up toward the front of your question. We've got about, not quite 12,000 people that are retirement-eligible, about 22% of the work force, and we are going to go ahead and as Alan mentioned take the packages to the union. They are very similar to the packages, eight of them, that we had last time. And we have some reductions to get to achieve our productivity goals. We have to absorb and place the ACH people, and so just how many people end up in the entry-level wage is going to really depend on just how many people sign up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to be clear, the packages are actually very similar to those you offered last time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are very similar, there is 8 different packages, and they're tailored and we were very pleased working with the UAW on those last time, so we are continuing on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just finally, of the 700 million cash tax benefit or tax refund, was there any P&amp;L impact from that, or is that just cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was just cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your guidance for '08 is adjusted for Jaguar and Land Rover, which were profitable, can you just give us any color on what Jaguar and Land Rover did in '07?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rod, we'd rather not, but I will give you this. The PAG was profitable for the year, and we said that Volvo was a loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is at least that much of an indication there, but we'd really rather not. Come the first quarter results when we report those in April, we'll break out what Jaguar was, and it will be a lot clearer then because we will be reporting Volvo on a stand-alone basis, and we'll go back and show you the, what the numbers were.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And your comment on earnings better in '08 but cash flow deteriorates, can you just gives us, as production comes down, sort of the impact on managed working capital that you'd be assuming in there and how much restructuring cash are you assuming you are going to use?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we -- on the restructuring cash, we expect about 1 billion there. The profits will be slightly better, not a lot, but the biggest piece in there is the subvention payment, we are making the subvention to Ford Credit upfront, and the way we calculate or account operating-related cash flow, that would go into operating-related cash flow, and it's about 3 billion. That's really the biggest piece of the negative cash flow. Obviously that is a little things going on in net spending and working capital and other tiny things, but those are the biggest things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But the cash, you had a $2.5 billion impact in '07 from jobs bank people and employee separation programs. So I mean, is that a -- I would imagine that that goes down in 2008. Wouldn't it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but there is two things here. One of them is the operating-related cash flow, which is that subtotal, if you look at page, the cash flow page 25, the automotive operating cash flow, which was favorable 400 million this year, that's what we said would be negative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what we were referring to on slide 34. In addition, you were referring to cash impact of separation programs. That will be a little bit less than the 2.5.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just lastly, how much of that 3 billion in targeted cost savings or structural cost savings is cash? And is there some kind of assumption here for the number of people that will be coming back in at a entry level wage, or is that completely separate from these targets?</p>

          <p>There are assumptions that we've made, and, clearly about people &#x2013; salary, hourly and the ACH, but we'd rather not go into those, and we're not going to give any details on targets or anything for the buyouts until we've concluded the sign-up period, and that's consistent with what we did last time. And there will be elements of cash and non-cash in the structural cost savings, but it's mainly on the cash side.</p>

          <p>Hi Don. I had a question on slide 12. Net product costs for the full year, looks like it was a fairly sizeable amount. I know that includes commodity costs as well as content increases, can you just give us some directional flavor on what that bar should look like for 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can give you, I think, some pretty good direction. If you look at slide 35, this is the North American piece, and that's not all of it, because the bar you're talking about, which is on slide 12, includes product programs of a 2.5 billion increase, raw materials or commodity increases of 1.4 and cost savings of 2, and that adds to the 1.9.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the sort of moderation in the product adds, is that another way of saying that the level of content increases, is that going to moderate -- I mean, are you kind of done with the revamp of the interiors on a lot of the vehicles and should we think of the next few years as sort of in the 600 million range that you have in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think there is two things going on here. One of them is page 12, which is the whole company, and the other is page 35, which is just North America. The biggest thing that happened in 2007 was the diesel engine emission change. It happened for everybody, everybody had to implement it, and it was a big deal and so that was about half of that 2.5 billion of product programs. That's the piece that doesn't repeat. So what we'll see this year in North America is about $600 million of increase, is what we're saying. So we are going to continue to upgrade our products, add features that our customers want and value, and the same thing will happen in all our operations around the world. Does that help?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It does. And then a separate question. The F-150, are you guys able to give us a little bit more color now on the sort of more precision on the cadence of the ramp-up throughout this year, and how do sort of launch costs phase in over the course of '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we'd rather not -- we have our launch plans, and it's really best if we talk about those a little bit closer to the launch date.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In the '09 guidance, has your thinking on incentives and pricing, what is embedded in that, and has it changed over the course of the year versus what you might have originally thought for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it hasn't, and one of the reasons we have confidence in that going forward is the success we've had by matching our production to the fundamental real demand. And I think we are seeing that in the net pricing and reducing the incentives and the residual values increasing. So, we are assuming that we are going to continue with that assumption.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It'll be -- as we know, it will be different with different vehicles dependent on where we are in their cycle. But overall our plan is to continue to match the production to demand and keep getting the value for that.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And question for Don, can you maybe walk through a little bit how the T account is going to work for the change in business practice variable marketing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. There is really not that much -- not that much to it. As in the past we will continue to accrue incentives for vehicles we produce based on the programs we've communicated to the dealers. What's different is we're now communicating our incentives to the dealers kind of on an annual basis, and in the past we were communicating them quarter-by-quarter. So the accounting follows the business practice. Business practices change, we are now communicating incentives on an annual basis rather than a quarterly basis, the accounting conforms to that and actually the T accounts are actually quite the same, with just of course some different numbers on the debits and credits side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So why did that all hit fourth quarter '07 and is this a pull-ahead of marketing expense for '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not a pull-ahead of marketing expense for '08 by any means. The reason it occurred in the fourth quarter was because that's when we made the change. We communicated this change uniformly to the dealers around the world during the year &#x2013; the end of the year, I think was in the third week in December. And so it was communicated then, it was, all the field sales people were trained, and all the dealers received the communication, and that's why it happened in the fourth quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>No, there was no cash in '07, and there'll be nothing different in '08, because of what happened in '07. Clearly there will be some cash out the door for incentives as they occur, but it won't be any different than it would've been because of what happened in '07.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Alan, the price discipline in the quarter was really pretty remarkable, particularly given the sales environment. And I'm curious, if I were to think about a scenario that's downside risk your SAAR, your market share targets, if you saw the SAAR on a light duty basis trending below sort of the 15.7 or so that you are talking on the light duty side, or if the share slips a point or so below the 14.0 that you are targeting, how do you prioritize pricing in '08 versus some of those other targets? Can you maintain that level of price discipline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I -- clearly you hit the, you hit a really important balance, and we're going to watch that very carefully, especially during the first half. And we might adjust it differently in the first half than the second half, just because of our assumptions on the way the production and the sales are going to go. But it really is a balance, and we will really think about this for the first half and the second half probably a little bit differently depending on what happens. But it's a balance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then one quick follow-up and a big longer-term. We have seen in '07 that it's been very challenging for anyone to push through all the higher diesel emission costs. As you look towards the CAFE regulations over the next 12 years or so, the near-term results are suggesting that the consumer does not fully want to pay up for fuel economy or cleaner emissions. So how do you change that consumer behavior over the next several years, given that the economic of hybrids, the economics of diesel, at least in the very near-term, have proven to be more of a loss at the margin than an actual gainer to profits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, and understand completely. And I -- the way we're really thinking about this is, and we're just starting to communicate it at the North American International Auto show, and we got great response for this, was our EcoBoost strategy, which is fundamentally the foundation for our fuel efficiency improvement and CO2 reduction going forward. And the reason that it's very compelling to us to combine turbo-charging with direct fuel injection and combining with the rest of the vehicle integration, the weight savings, we think we can increase the fuel efficiency by upwards of 20% and reduce the CO2 by 15%.</p>
          <p>But the other neat feature about that is that when you look at that technology, on the torque versus RPM, that we get about a 30% improvement in the torque at the lower RPMs. So it just a wonderful improvement in driving and driving performance that combined with, either with automatic or with the 6-speed transmission, that consumers are really going to feel the difference in this as far as the driving experience.</p>
          <p>Another neat thing about this is that it's affordable, and we can get it in volume across all of our vehicles, and so from a contribution to fuel efficiency and CAFE and CO2 reduction, we are going to -- within five years we will be upwards of 500,000 vehicles in the United States that are equipped with this technology and nearly 750,000 vehicles worldwide. So from a base point of view for Ford, especially with the breadth of our family, it's going to really help us meet the fuel efficiency requirements going forward and get us off to a really good start.</p>
          <p>Now your other comment is also true that clearly our focus is going to be on improving not only the capability of the hybrids, whether they are diesels or petrol and, but also the fact that EcoBoost technology, no matter what the engine is, is going to allow us to have a smaller engine with the power required, but the real issue there as we all know is to continue to work the cost down to make the hybrids even more affordable, so we can get them in volume to contribute to the fuel efficiency going forward. So that's our basic strategy, and we feel really good about it, because we can get to the volume to really make a difference across all our vehicles in a very short time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have three questions. First, when you look at the profitability in North America from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, I know it's always tough to do a sequential comparison like that. But if we look at the cap used in the fourth quarter, it's probably close to about 92% versus 88% in third quarter, there was lower levels of staffing in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, what was the reason -- the big reason in that sequential deterioration in profitability? Was it mostly just mix or is there something else I'm missing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's a good question. Let me try to answer that in two ways really. In the fourth quarter we improved significantly year-over-year. In fact if you just jot these numbers down, in North America in the second quarter last year we improved 700 million, in the third quarter 1.2, in the fourth quarter at 1.5. So, we're getting better than last year. So, the fourth quarter is and has been lower from a seasonal profitability standpoint for a couple of reasons, and let me give you a few of them. Some normal seasonality on parts profits, on engineering, prototype development, and advertising. So, the costs are heavier there in the fourth quarter. But they were heavier there in the fourth quarter in '06. The contract, we had some costs that went into '07 in the contract that we didn't have clearly in '06. And then, oh, there was a mix change. There was somewhat of a mix change in the fourth quarter. Mix was a little bit leaner because we were producing more of the new Focus and relatively less of the big pickup trucks. And there are a couple of other smaller things, but those together can be upwards of $1 billion in terms of sequentially or rather from kind of the average of the first three quarters to the fourth quarter. I think the important thing is that we are continuing to improve year-over-year each quarter, and that those numbers are getting bigger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, in the future, from a seasonal perspective, we should just assume almost ipso facto that there is a $1 billion increase in fixed costs from the third quarter to the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know about that, but there are some cost increases. This year was abnormally large because of the union contract. So, maybe half of that much would be a good planning base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then the second question is if we think about the buyouts and what may or may not happen there, and put that aside for a second, but how many workers do you think you need right now to operate at your current size and -- based on your capacity actions in the next year or two? You are 57.9 right now. What would be your ideal level in employment if you could just white sheet take out as many people as you'd like to?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the way we think of that and the way we'd like to answer that is that we're going to continue to improve our productivity quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year forever. And that's the real plan. And we're making -- as you know, when you look at the data over the last two or three years and especially last year, we're making tremendous progress on that, while simultaneously improving the quality of our vehicles.</p>

          <p>I know you don't want to give a target, are you hoping to reach the 20% figure so you can maximize the use of the lower tier wage? And is the 20% &#x2013; that would just be the Ford number, it wouldn't be Ford and ACH combined?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had one question on pricing. I know you didn't, it was the operator. Just one question on pricing, when you look at the improvement we've seen in net pricing in the last two quarters, it's been very impressive. I was just wondering if the source of that is &#x2013; or majority of the source of that is coming from your increases in the rental car market as you are pulling back on supply there, if you're seeing big increases there, and really trying to figure out the big factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think the biggest factor is really sizing our production to the underlying fundamental demand, and we're seeing it, the success of that throughout the business not only on the incentives and the net pricing, but also on the residual values. And so that's why it gives us a lot of confidence going forward that if we get the content of the vehicles right, and we get the demand and the production right, that we'll continue to get the value of our products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So would it be fair to assume that it's coming in the rental market, but also in your lease pricing and even just your straight new vehicle pricing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there are several factors, John, including lower incentives on the retail side, but also on the fleet side, and that would not be entirely on daily rental, but across the range of commercial fleet as well, and also equipment pricing, and then also some small improvements in Canada, Mexico and other types of mix. So it's all of those, and it's not in any one area. It's kind of across-the-board as Alan was saying.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I have got two quick questions on the Volvo. Firstly, given the foreign exchange movements and Volvo's problems in the US, is there any consideration being given to assembling Volvos on this side of the Atlantic? And secondly, an impairment charge of course is often seen by people as a prelude to a sale. And I'm wondering whether you are reconsidering your views on Volvo at all. Have you decided to keep it for sure, or is there still a possibility that you might sell it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bernard, this is Don. First off, on your question about is an impairment a precursor to a sale, I think the answer to that is no. The impairment charge is a function of a sound view of the cash flows of the business and how the discounted present value of that compares with what's on the books. And when those two are out of balance, you have to make an adjustment. We do an annual testing of that for all of our operations. And it's just simply a fact of the poorer than planned performance of Volvo, mainly reflecting the exchange and the sales of vehicles in the United States and discounting, including higher incentives here in the United States. And then right now, there are no plans for assembly of Volvos in North America. We are, however, doing a comprehensive review of the business and Lewis Booth and Fredrik Arp are working on a plan to improve the business results. As Alan said in our conference call in November, that's the main focus of our effort right now is to improve the brand and to improve the business results.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Hi Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of things. First just a housekeeping item, can, I think this was in the slides, but can you go over the cash burn for '07 and your projected cash burn overall for '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You bet, we're finding the best chart here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the cash flow for 2007 was positive, both on an operating basis and on a total cash flow. So, it was 400 million favorable in '07 for operating-related cash flow and 700 million favorable in total cash flow. So in other words, we ended the year with more cash than we started despite all the restructuring that we did, and we feel pretty good about that. For '08, what we said was that the cash flow would be unfavorable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we said that a large contributor to that unfavorable cash flow is 3 billion of subvention payments from Ford to Ford Credit as we shift our business practice from paying them over time to paying them upfront.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay, then the other question is &#x2013; thanks for that &#x2013; is you talked &#x2013; you've got the buyouts coming, but with the down economy right now, are there other places in addition to the buyouts and just realigning the production where you think you can cut costs or where you might need to cut costs more in the coming year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might, that -- probably our best detailed explanation of that, which chart, let's see if we can find that chart &#x2013; on chart 35, Mike. And of course we are looking at all of the elements, sizing our operation to the real demand, the employees, the facilities, all our discretionary. We're getting -- making great progress on our productivity, especially in engineering and product development, and with Derrick's leadership worldwide getting more and better product development with less resources, and also working with our suppliers on the material costs and taking the complexity out of our products and working together on simpler designs and simpler manufacturing. So I would characterize it as all the elements, we are going to continue to focus on and make improvement in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you, and I guess you are saying a big piece of that is really just switching to the global design in platforms and trying to cut out the waste there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes that's really improving. It has really allowed us to improve not only the quality, but the reduction of parts and subassemblies and components as well as, you can imagine that when you -- as you start to do that, then the amount of effort it takes for each gets a lot less. The suppliers are dealing with a lot less complexity, and it is just a wonderful virtuous circle of continuous improvement.</p>

          <p>Hi, Sarah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question about retail market share. You've obviously dipped below your last forecasted targets at the end of '07. I wonder if you could speak to how important this metric continues to be in your ongoing turnaround plan, now that you've gone below, even if just for a moment. And do you still think you can stabilize at the levels you've previously stated? Or should we expect to see some lower numbers in the first half until F-150 hits later this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sarah, I think you really captured all the elements of the answer to that with the way you asked the question. We didn't really -- we haven't really set a specific exact number for a, the market share number. Clearly, throughout 2007 we were stabilizing around the 13% on retail over retail. And then things started to get a little bit worse and the big segments came down a little faster than we thought as the US economy deteriorated. And we ended up at that 12.8. But clearly the plan is over time is to continue to invest in the new products that our customers really want and value, have a more really competitive small and medium-sized cars and utilities to complement our leadership in the big SUVs and the trucks. And as we do that and we bring those products online, we will stabilize at whatever, and then we'll get a chance to earn our right to profitably grow again. So we haven't picked an exact number, but the most important thing is the focus on bringing the products out that people want, it will stabilize and then we'll start to grow again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In your UAW contract, you did decide to keep a number of plants open that you had previously said you would close to accommodate the lower demand going forward. And I wonder if you are going to stabilize at the whatever number, I mean how -- I guess when will we see capacity, manned or however you measure it, be what it needs to be or equal to demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's back to our previous conversation, too. We are going to match our production capacity to the real fundamental demand, which is new for many of the auto companies, because we are taking action to get back to profitability so we can continue to invest in the future. We have no other announcements about our production facilities in addition to what we've shared with everybody in the past. The thing that will determine whether more has to happen of course is what happens with the economy and the real fundamental underlying demand, and then we will take the appropriate action. But right now we have no additional announcements. Clearly as we bring -- as we stabilize and we start to grow again, our -- of course our number one goal is to increase the utilization and the productivity as we start to grow. So, no other announcements on production facilities at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One more final follow-up. Are you already making plans to in-source work into those factories you've decided to keep open?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, with respect to those, the way I would think about that, Sarah, is that what we agreed to is very, is completely consistent with our product development plan. And so it's good for &#x2013; I mean the agreement with the UAW clearly is allowing us to be significantly more competitive, we can operate here, and the facilities and the production that we've laid out, those capabilities are consistent with our cycle plan going forward. So as we further develop the cycle plan, then we will increase the utilization of all of our existing facilities.</p>

          <p>Michelle, we have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our question will come from Bill Koenig of Bloomberg News. Please proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a couple of quick clarifying questions on job cuts. On salaried you said attrition plus some selective beyond that. Would the selective beyond that be involuntary separations, or would those be some kind of salaried buyouts?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will decide that in the future.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just to sum up on the whole hourly thing, programs are going to be very similar, but some may be enhanced. You don't want to comment how they are enhanced until the workers, the bulk of the workers get the materials next week. And you don't want to give a target, but there are 12,000 retirement-eligible. Does that sum it all up? Sorry, there are three or four threads from the whole call, I just want to make sure I'm summing it up correctly.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh yes, and I think that's a good summary.</p>
