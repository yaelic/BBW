          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Eli Lilly Q1 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Phil Johnson. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking the time to join us for Eli Lilly &amp; Company's first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me are our Chairman and CEO, John Lechleiter; our Chief Financial Officer, Derica Rice; our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Dr. Jan Lundberg; and Ilissa Rassner and Travis Coy from Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.</p>
          <p>We're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2012. In the face of significant reductions in revenue and earnings due to the Zyprexa patent expiration, Lilly employees around the world have remained focused on execution. They delivered results that solidly position us to meet our 2012 financial guidance and that place us on track to meet or exceed our midterm financial minimum goals.</p>
          <p>Let's begin with a quick review of events that have taken place since our previous earnings call. From a commercial perspective, we're pleased that Jentadueto, the linagliptin-plus-metformin fixed-dose combination for treatment of adults with Type 2 diabetes, is now available in U.S. pharmacies.</p>
          <p>On the regulatory front, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare approved Zyprexa for treatment of depression in bipolar disorder, and Cymbalta for treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain.</p>
          <p>Amylin's Byetta received European Commission approval as an adjunctive therapy to basal insulin, with or without metformin and/or pioglitazone, for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes in adults.</p>
          <p>We received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for Erbitux in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb do not plan to pursue this FLEX submission, but will continue to market Erbitux in the U.S. for certain types of head and neck and colorectal cancer</p>
          <p>And lastly, the FDA approved Amyvid for use in patients being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive decline.</p>
          <p>In clinical news, we announced the results of the Phase 3 study that showed both Cialis and tamsulosin significantly improved scores on the International Prostate Symptom Score in men with signs and symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia.</p>
          <p>And we announced new Phase 2 data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, that showed ixekizumab, an anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody, met its primary endpoints in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis</p>
          <p>Now let's move on to discuss our financial performance. As we've done on previous calls, we'll focus our comments on the non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insight into the underlying trends in our business. This excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other special charges.</p>
          <p>Turning to tin come statement on slide six, you can see that revenue declined by 4% in Q1 to just over $5.6 billion. This decrease in revenue was due to the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in most major markets outside of Japan, partially offset by growth from other products. Excluding Zyprexa outside of Japan, the rest of our revenue actually grew 10%.</p>
          <p>Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 1.2 percentage points, from 79.8% to 78.6%. This decrease in gross margin percent was primarily due to lower sales of Zyprexa, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.</p>
          <p>This quarter's total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&amp;D and SG&amp;A, grew 3%. Within operating expenses, marketing, selling, and administrative expenses grew 3%, while R&amp;D expenses grew 2%. The growth in marketing, selling, and administrative expenses was driven by the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim and increased expense for newer pharmaceutical and Animal Health products, partially offset by lower administrative expenses. The growth in R&amp;D expense was largely driven by the Boehringer Ingelheim collaboration as well as other late-stage clinical trial costs.</p>
          <p>When thinking about our year-on-year growth in operating expenses keep in mind that in Q1 last year, we only had a partial quarter's worth of expenses for the Boehringer Ingelheim collaboration. The level of operating expenses in Q1 of this year is squarely in line with our expectations and our full-year guidance.</p>
          <p>Other income and deductions was a higher net expense this year compared to last year due to recognition in the first quarter of 2011 of a gain on an equity investment and an insurance recovery, partially offset by increased interest income in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Our tax rate was 24.4% this quarter, an increase of 3.5 percentage points from Q1 2011, primarily due to the expiration of R&amp;D tax credit at the end of 2011, as well as a discrete item that increased taxes in the first quarter of 2012 due to changes in estimates concerning certain prior-year tax items.</p>
          <p>At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS decreased 26% to $0.92 per share.</p>
          <p>Please note that as planned, we did retire the $1.5 billion of debt that came due this March and with no additional short-term or long-term borrowing.</p>
          <p>In summary, our Q1 results clearly reflect Zyprexa patent expirations outside of Japan as well as the additional operating expenses associated with the Boehringer Ingelheim collaboration. In the face of these known headwinds, we've continued to drive revenue growth from many products and prudently managed expenses in the rest of our business, putting us on a solid financial footing going forward. We will continue that same focus and we will rigorously prioritize investments to achieve our mid-term financial targets and position the company to return to growth post-2014.</p>
          <p>Slide seven shows our reported income statement while slide eight provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to Travis.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Phil.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide nine, the revenue decline of 4% for the quarter was driven by a negative volume impact of 7%, partially offset by a favorable 4% price impact. Foreign exchange had a negligible impact on worldwide revenue.</p>
          <p>By geography, you'll notice that U.S. volume decreased 16%. This was entirely due to Zyprexa sales erosion. In fact, excluding olanzapine from both 2011 and 2012, volume in the rest of our U.S. business was up 2%.</p>
          <p>Also of note is U.S. price, which increased 12% this quarter following an 18% decrease in Q4 of 2011. Both periods were affected by our authorized generic olanzapine agreement with Prasco. In this quarter, we recognized our share of Prasco's authorized generic olanzapine revenues with no corresponding units sold by Lilly. This serves to increase our reported U.S. price by nearly 3.5 percentage points. In addition, we had favorable adjustments to prior-period rebates and accruals that contributed roughly three percentage points to U.S. price.</p>
          <p>For Europe, the decrease in revenue was also due to the Zyprexa patent expiration. Excluding Zyprexa from both 2011 and 2012, the rest of our European revenue was essentially flat, with volume growth of 6%. That was offset by a price decline of 3% and an FX effect of minus 3%.</p>
          <p>Japan growth of 5% reflects a negative effect of the biannual price decreases. This includes lower prices on our sales in March, as well as lower customer buying ahead of the price decreases. Also, in Q1 2011 we saw precautionary buying as a result of the earthquake that increased sales by about $30 million to $35 million. Excluding the $30 million to $35 million of sales from the Q1 2011 base period, Japan sales were up 12% to 13% this quarter.</p>
          <p>As for emerging markets, which are embedded in rest of world, we began to experience the impact of generic competition that we discussed as part of our 2012 guidance. In terms of products, the largest impact is coming from Zyprexa, while in terms of countries, the bulk of the impact is coming from Brazil and Mexico.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, we anticipate <mark type="audio gap" /> (10:30)</p>

        <plist>
          <p>My apologies, we experienced a power failure in the studio. Not knowing exactly where we cut out &#x2013; this is Travis, by the way. I'll start from the beginning of the paragraph.</p>
          <p>As for emerging markets, which is embedded in rest of world, we began to experience the impact of generic competition that we discussed as part of our 2012 guidance. In terms of products, the largest impacts is coming from Zyprexa, while in terms of countries, the bulk of the impact is coming from Brazil and Mexico.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, we anticipate that generic competition will reduce our 2012 emerging market sales by roughly $250 million, which equates to 10% of our 2011 emerging market sales. This quarter the generic impact reduced sales by about 13 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Within emerging markets China continued to register strong growth, up 41%, or when excluding FX, 34%.</p>
          <p>Elanco Animal Health delivered another quarter of robust performance, with volume increasing 31%. Driving the strong quarter were continued growth of worldwide Trifexis sales, the inclusion of Janssen Animal Health sales, and a combination of strong demand and customer buying patterns. We expect Elanco to deliver double-digit income growth during the YZ years and beyond.</p>
          <p>Finally, the 26% increase in collaboration and other revenue is due to royalties from telaprevir as well as gross margin sharing with Boehringer Ingelheim for Trajenta, neither of which were present in the Q1 2011 base period.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement with and without the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. I'll focus on the second column since the numbers in the first column are the same as those on slide six.</p>
          <p>As discussed earlier, FX had a negligible impact on worldwide revenue. It also had a negligible effect on underlying foreign currency operating expenses. However, FX did have an impact on cost of goods sold through its effect on international inventory sold. Recall that this is an accounting effect only that has no impact on cash flow. This FX effect increased cost of goods sold in Q1 2011 while it slightly decreased cost of goods sold in Q1 2012. Excluding the FX effect on international inventories sold, cost of goods sold increased 10% and EPS decreased 30%.</p>
          <p>For your information, on slide 11 we've provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement, with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Next I'll provide a brief pipeline update before turning the call over to Derica. Slide 12 shows our pipeline as of April 18. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing attrition.</p>
          <p>As Phil mentioned, earlier this month the FDA approved Amyvid for use in patients being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive decline. Beginning in June, a limited number of radiopharmacies will be distributing Amyvid, with the goal of making the product available in more areas as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>When Amyvid becomes available in June, the scan will not be a covered service under the Medicare benefit. This is due to a Center for Medicare and Medicaid services policy which has been in place since December 2000. Lilly is working diligently with a broad group of stakeholders to explore and collaborate with CMS to define a path forward for coverage.</p>
          <p>You'll also see that we began Phase 2 testing of two potential oncology medicines: one, a hedgehog antagonist; and the other a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor. And we began Phase 1 testing of three new molecules spanning oncology, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. In addition, we terminated development of four molecules, three in Phase 2 and one in Phase 1.</p>
          <p>We now have 12 potential new medicines in Phase 3 testing, eight of which are biotech molecules spanning oncology, diabetes, neuroscience, and autoimmune diseases. We believe this pipeline positions us well for growth post-2014.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to Derica to cover some of the key events for 2012, our financial guidance, and some closing comments before opening the call for Q&amp;A. Derica?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Travis. I'll start with slide 13. While I'll focus my comments on events expected to occur later this year, we will now use this slide to report our progress on achieving key events we've highlighted to you for the year. Hopefully, this provides you with greater transparency on how we're doing.</p>
          <p>In the remainder of 2012, we anticipate a couple of FDA decisions. We'll continue to advance our pipelines and we'll generate and share clinical data that will help investors better gauge our growth potential post-2014.</p>
          <p>We anticipate FDA decisions on Alimta as continuation maintenance therapy for patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and Erbitux for first-line metastatic colorectal cancer. We anticipate beginning Phase 3 trials for evacetrapib, our CETP inhibitor. In addition, we could begin Phase 3 trials yet this year for our oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis in partnership with Incyte.</p>
          <p>We also expect to complete a number of important Phase 3 trials in 2012, including the EXPEDITION studies with solanezumab for Alzheimer's disease, the TRILOGY study with Effient in ACS-medically managed patients; and the PARAMOUNT and POINTBREAK studies with Alimta and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The overall survival data from PARAMOUNT will be disclosed at ASCO [American Society of Clinical Oncology] in June. In addition, we'll complete a number of the Phase 3 trials for dulaglutide and in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim for empagliflozin.</p>
          <p>We recently generated key data from two important Phase 2 studies and we plan to disclose these data at upcoming medical meetings. The first is a dulaglutide Phase 2 hemodynamic study. Our plan is to disclose data from this study at ASH, the American Society of Hypertension, in May. The second is a Phase 2b trial of the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor being studied for use in rheumatoid arthritis in partnership with Incyte. Our plan is to disclose three-month data at EULAR [European League Against Rheumatism] in June and six-month data at a medical meeting later this year. In addition, we'll disclose Phase 2 data at the ADA [American Diabetes Association] meeting in June for our novel basal insulin analog being studied for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to guidance, we're pleased with our solid first quarter results, and we're encouraged by the current trajectory of our business. Based upon this trajectory, we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS estimate to a range of $3.15 to $3.30. Now please note that we have now included EPS guidance on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis to reflect the charge taken in the first quarter. All other line items of our guidance remain unchanged.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2011 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2012 guidance.</p>
          <p>Now in closing, we knew 2012 would be a challenging year as we experienced the full effect of the Zyprexa patent expiration in most major markets, and we are well prepared for this challenge. For many years, we've had a relentless focus on executing our strategy: one, to drive productivity gains across all areas of our value chain; second, to drive growth in our on-patent brands and in the countercyclical growth areas of Elanco, Japan, and emerging markets; and third and most importantly, to replenish and advance our pipeline. We designed this strategy to enable Lilly to absorb the effect of our patent losses while funding the dividend at least at its current level as well as the R&amp;D that will drive our future growth.</p>
          <p>Thus far, we've had a solid start to the year. Our financial performance this quarter positions us well to continue executing our strategy and to meet or exceed our midterm financial projections: minimum annual revenue of at least $20 billion; net income of at least $3 billion; and operating cash flow of at least $4 billion.</p>
          <p>We remain committed to our innovation-based strategy. We'll maintain a productive investment in R&amp;D through this period of patent expirations, and we'll keep our focus on the keys to Lilly's long-term success, advancing our late-stage pipeline, and sustaining the flow of innovative medicines in the future.</p>
          <p>Now, as Travis said, we have 12 molecules in Phase 3 development and another 21 in Phase 2. They include a balance of small molecules and biologics and exciting potential new medicines in diabetes, neuroscience, oncology, and autoimmune diseases.</p>
          <p>We believe this pipeline will drive growth post-YZ. This year, we've already begun to generate and disseminate important data that will help investors and analysts better gauge our longer-term growth potential, with much more data to come over the course of 2012 and 2013.</p>
          <p>We're confident in our strategy and in our ability to successfully navigate our patent expirations and emerge with even greater strength and capacity to drive growth.</p>
          <p>This concludes our prepared remarks, and now I'll turn it over to Phil.</p>

          <p>We received some feedback that we have had some technical difficulties that have persisted, leading to some difficulties in people hearing the call well. There seems to be an echo that's quite strong on the line. You should be able to remain on the line. What we're going to do is reestablish a connection with a different phone to see if we can resolve this issue so that the Q&amp;A portion will be a little easier for you to follow. Just hold on, please, and we'll be back with you very soon.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question will come from the line of Jami Rubin at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Phil, maybe it's time to upgrade your technology. Anyway, I have a question related to gross margins. The gross margin this quarter came in well ahead of what we were expecting. And just in going back, when the company initially gave guidance for the year back in early January, the Street was at around $3.60; and you guided to $3.10 to $3.20, in large part because of generic Zyprexa which, of course, wasn't new. Now you're raising that guidance again by $0.10, and the gross margin came in well ahead of what I think people were looking for. So maybe, Derica, if you could just talk to some of the variables that have driven your guidance and help us to think about the evolution of gross margins. At least that's what we missed this quarter, but you're not changing your gross margin guidance. So would you expect Q2 and Q3 because of the onslaught of generic competition to be meaningfully below your average guidance of 77%, maybe if you could just add color there?</p>
          <p>And then just on another note with Animal Health, which performed very well, if you could talk about the variables that are driving that, and also if you could remind us what the Janssen acquisition provided for the quarter. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jami. Hi, this is Derica. Thanks for your question. In regards to gross margin, just a few things to keep in mind; one, as we move throughout the year with each quarter of 2012, we will have further declining Zyprexa revenues. So in 2012, we expect Q1 to have the greatest share of our Zyprexa revenue, and then with each subsequent quarter it will decline. With that decline, it has an increasingly negative effect on our gross margin, so that's going to be bringing our gross margins down as we move through the period.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you also saw that in the first quarter we had a slightly favorable impact just from exchange rates. So as the euro has been weakening against the dollar, and we've talked about this on past calls, you see that that has a favorable impact on our cost of goods sold of inventories during the period, which obviously has a favorable impact on gross margin. I don't know if that's sustainable.</p>
          <p>And then the third piece is, just when you look at the price effect element of it, we did see in the first quarter, as Travis said, there were some gross to net adjustments. So as we were looking at our A&amp;P calculations and based upon new insights, we made some adjustments to our gross to net reserves on the books, which turned out to come out as favorable in terms of price. Now that's what's highlighting and driving our gross margins as we look through the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>In regard to your second question around Animal Health and what are some of the key things that's driving our guidance and our increase, what we saw in the first quarter was very strong revenue growth relative to our expectation. Animal Health alone grew 33%, of which volume growth of that was 31%. Within that volume growth, it was primarily driven by both our companion animal business as well as our food animal business. In the companion animal segment, we continue to experience an outstanding launch of Trifexis. This is our flea and heartworm product. As well as we continue actually to have good sales of Comfortis. And then likewise, we've seen good performance on the food animal side as well.</p>
          <p>In regards to the Janssen acquisition as well as ChemGen, which we completed earlier this year, that contributed about one-third of that total growth. And so if you look at the 33%, two-thirds of that was organically driven.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jami, this is Phil. One thing I might add in terms of the gross margin percent, as you're aware, for a while now we've been providing a backup slide. This would be slide 18 in this quarter's deck that strips out from each of the quarter's results this FX effect on international inventories sold. These are the two lines of numbers at the bottom of that chart. What that will show is actually in Q1 of last year, we had nearly a one percentage point reduction in the gross margin percent due to FX. So our true underlying base was 80.7%.</p>
          <p>When you look at this quarter, we're actually seeing a 2.4 percentage point reduction in the gross margin percent, so it's very substantial. It seems to be in line with what people had been expecting. And I'm wondering actually if people as they were looking at the base to figure their decline off of, and they had been looking at the base that included the negative effect from FX last year, that wouldn't necessarily have been the appropriate base to take it down from. As Derica mentioned, we do expect to see further deterioration through the year, particularly given the Zyprexa erosion that we anticipate largely here in the U.S. We've now entered I think as of today or yesterday the period where multiple generics can now come to market, and that will bring a different dynamic than we saw in the first quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last think I'll review, Jami, is that we were able to drive outside of the Zyprexa patent erosion and the remaining elements of GEMZAR good volume growth across the other elements of our business. So in addition to Animal Health, we saw good growth in China, 41%; as well as key brands like Cymbalta, 23%; even in insulins which grew. Humalog grew 12%. So that was always part of our strategy in terms of those three strategic levers, making sure that we were driving growth in those areas where we weren't experiencing patent expirations.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, a couple questions. First, can you just tell us what were the key products impacted by that gross to net adjustment? Second, Alimta OUS looks like it flattened out, and I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit of insight what was going on there. And then third, I get this question, so I figured I'll ask you is, if solanezumab ends up being positive data later this year, what do you do differently as a company with respect to R&amp;D, SG&amp;A? And if it fails, what do you do differently as a company with respect to spending? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Marc, this is Phil. I'll take your first two, and then maybe Derica will want to take a crack or Jan with the last one.</p>
          <p>So the products on the gross to net adjustments, it really was across the board. It's a phenomenon, Marc, that we've seen each and every quarter. Sometimes it's a slight benefit. Sometimes it's a slight headwind. This quarter it was a little larger benefit than we've had in some prior periods due to the size of the adjustments, and would have contributed about three percentage points of growth that shows up in the price column to our U.S. sales.</p>
          <p>Excluding Alimta OUS, the primary driver compared to the prior quarter really is FX. If you go back to mid-last year and you had FX contributing double digits, I think in Q2, for example, it peaked maybe at 11% contribution to overall growth, whereas it actually reduced sales by one percentage point this quarter. We also have seen the volume growth in percentage terms begin to decrease somewhat as we have a larger base that we're comparing against.</p>
          <p>The last thing I'd highlight is we did have price reductions that go in effect for the public April 1, actually go in effect for us in sales to wholesalers as of March 1 in Japan as part of their biannual price adjustment process. And Alimta had a substantial price reduction on an order of magnitude of 25% so we saw one month of that in the quarter.</p>

          <p>Marc, in regards to your question around solanezumab and how does that affect Lilly in terms of its potential outcomes, in terms of our overall strategy, it doesn't affect us significantly at all. We've stated all along that solanezumab was not the home run bet for Lilly, and it's one of 12 molecules that we have in Phase 3 development. So therefore, if we're unsuccessful at solanezumab, we continue with our action plans as stated. We will continue to progress the remaining 11 molecules that we have clinical development in Phase 3 as well as the other 21 in Phase 2, and we'll continue to try to invest to drive the growth in our key growth opportunities. Obviously, if it's successful, given the low probability of technical success, it represents upside for the firm. But R&amp;D innovation is still going to be the cornerstone of our strategy, so it doesn't lessen our focus still on those remaining 11 molecules in Phase 3.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks very much. First question was just with regards to your JAK potentially moving into Phase 3 later this year. Could you just elaborate a little bit about how you see that product differentiating from Pfizer's product? And just maybe more broadly the evolution of the RA market, how do you see oral drugs playing here? I guess you think maybe it's a positive that you could be the second JAK in the market over time given how slow this market seems to evolve over time.</p>
          <p>The second question I have is maybe just following up on the expense structure here. Beyond solanezumab, you obviously highlighted a number of important pipeline data releases this year, more coming in 2013. Does there come a point where you do a broader strategic review of the overall spend level relative to new product opportunities? Basically, should we expect at some point you take a broader look at the pipeline once all this data comes in, or is this really an evolutionary process, as individual data points come in, you evaluate and go from there? Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the overall JAK class is an interesting new opportunity then for oral agents in autoimmune disease, and the interesting piece coming up here will be how differentiated will these different JAK molecules be. They do have differences in their selectivity versus various members of the JAK family, at least then in pharmacology in-vitro, and I think it needs to be determined what type of clinical significance do these differences have.</p>
          <p>We know that our inside molecule is more JAK1/JAK2 selective, whereas the Pfizer molecule is more a pan-JAK molecule. We also know our molecule is likely to be once daily, whereas the Pfizer molecule is twice daily. We need to see now in our bigger expanded trials what happens in relation to efficacy and also, in particular, safety, if there are any differences versus the Pfizer agent. And as stated here, we will communicate our three-month data as well as six-month data this year, so you will see more data from our agent. And we're also eager to see what the outcome which still needs happening then for the Pfizer molecule will give us in relation to additional information in this important class.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chris. Clearly, we have plans in place in terms of how we saw navigating our way through this period of patent expiries, and that was all centered around driving growth, where we said which would create the capacity to fund R&amp;D in our pipeline as well as sustain our dividend.</p>
          <p>Now as those cards began to be turned over and as we see data unveiled from our pipeline, our plans are not static, and so obviously we will adjust along the way. Now our expectations are that we believe we should be able to yield enough positive outcomes for our pipeline that it supports our long-term strategy. If the result ends up being different than that, then we've thought through what the implications of that are. And obviously, we'll go and begin to pull some of those levers. But at this stage, we put forward to you guys in our call text as well as in the slides, we tried to lay out in as transparent a manner as we can what are the key events we're monitoring both internally and hopefully you're tracking externally. And we're trying to highlight there in those key events as those cards unfold and turned over, what's the outcome?</p>
          <p>So in each one of those checks, we were very encouraged here both with the approval of Amyvid this quarter as well as what we believe to be exciting data that we unveiled on IL-17, ixekizumab, for the treatment of psoriasis in moderate to severe patients. And as we continue to see data like that, that gives us even more encouragement about the future prospects of Lilly.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I have a couple questions on the pipeline for Jan. The first is, Elan was discussing recently, very recently, pre-specifying additional analyses for bapineuzumab for Phase 3, such as mild patients and maybe trying to pool the data on mild patients from the two different trials that they're running in the U.S. and file for approval on that. I'm just curious about whether Lilly is pre-specifying additional groups for the analysis of solanezumab, or whether essentially all the weight is on the primary endpoints in the studies.</p>
          <p>And then my second question is, with respect to the ImClone pipeline assets, Jan, if you could please update us on the timing of the key readouts, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. If you look at the solanezumab primary endpoints, it's really about cognition and also activities of daily living. And we want to see positive responses here from both trials on both of these parameters. In relation to types of patients, we have both mild and moderate, and we have <mark type="ph" /> APE (39:50) types as well, so it will be an opportunity here to discuss with regulators then what are the outcomes based on the data that we get.</p>
          <p>The ImClone pipeline, as we know, is focused very much on ramucirumab in Phase 3, which has five different trials then ongoing in different cancer types, which will start to read out next year and in the coming years. And we also have necitumumab for lung then, squamous non-small-cell lung cancer indication which also we will complete their studies most likely next year, but it's event-driven, so that will be dependent on that.</p>
          <p>And before these two agents, there are a number of other antibodies then which are tested in different tumors. And here I think it's still early to say when these will progress further then into late-stage development. We need to generate more data in our signal searching.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, this is Phil, just a couple other things. For ramucirumab, I believe the current expectation reflected on ClinicalTrials.gov is that both the first of the two gastric answer trials as well as the cellular trial would produce results next year, with other indications to follow subsequently. Necitumumab, the other Phase 3 asset from ImClone, likely we're into early 2014, I believe, for the data readout on the squamous non-small-cell lung cancer trial. And also keep in mind we're awaiting word from the FDA on the first-line metastatic colorectal cancer indication for Erbitux as well. Keelie, next caller please.</p>

          <p>Thanks. On your proprietary basal insulin, if I remember right, you said you need to see differentiation to really take that through full development, and I'm wondering if you can call out where you hope to see differentiation based on the early work that you've done. Is it something like dosing flexibility or flatter PK/PD profile, or what exactly?</p>
          <p>Then on solanezumab, if I can get an update on timing; you said in the past it would not make the late July meetings. I think it used to be called ICAD [International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease]. What would be the next logical medical meeting after that? Because there doesn't look like there's much in the second half of the year; AMA is in October, but that's not typically an Alzheimer's meeting. And it begs the question of is your goal still to present results for the first time at a medical meeting versus top-lining them in a press release?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If we look at the novel basal insulin, we are looking there to differentiate with some clinically meaningful outcomes for our diabetes patients. And this could be, for instance, less hypoglycemia versus lances. It could be differences in body weight changes versus lances, and potentially could be even effective glycemic control. We know from our earlier studies that this agent has a very flat profile with very small inter-individual variations, so we are very hopeful about the types of differentiation we can see from this agent. And we will report at the ADA in June our data from both Type 1 and Type 2 studies comparing with lances.</p>
          <p>The timing for solanezumab communication et cetera is as follows. The first EXPEDITION trial has completed last patient. This is now in April. The second one, we'll do it in June.

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I really appreciate it. I wanted to ask about something that I think is &#x2013; personally I think is Lilly's most important commercial business, which is the insulin business. I haven't heard any questions on this from the analysts. Over the last year, it has looked like you guys have done a good job of stabilizing the share losses to Novo. So I was wondering, Derica, and I'm not sure I should direct the question to you, but if you could give us an update and reflect back on 2011 what you did to stabilize that share and how as analysts, as investors, we should be thinking about share in the U.S. and in Europe for the insulin franchise versus Novo. And then the corollary to that is if you could update us on what's going on in the emerging markets. I know in the emerging markets in the insulin business right now, you trail Novo quite a bit. But in a sense, that's all room for upside. Maybe you could give us an update on share and how that market overall is growing.</p>
          <p>Then the second question I had was I think this is the last conference call we're going to have with you guys before the Supreme Court has its way with the healthcare law. And I was just wondering in general over the short term and over the long term if the mandate is struck down and if the overall law is struck down, what impact you see to Lilly's short-term business and also the long-term. I'd appreciate any comments you'd have around that. Thanks a lot.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Great, Mark. Thanks for the comments and questions. Let's go ahead and have Derica take the insulins. We'll probably have Travis and Ilissa help, who followed that business with the team over the last quarter; and then, John, if you'll comment on the Supreme Court ruling. Derica?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mark. In the U.S. if you look at our insulin business and specifically Humalog, we've had a number of interventions I think that has improved our performance there. If Enrique Conterno, the President of that unit, was here, he'd probably say one was we obviously have gone back and upped our game in terms of our medical reps and the quality information they're bringing.</p>
          <p>With that, it was accentuated through: one, the launch of the 3ml vial in the hospital setting, and that has allowed us to gain much greater traction there. Third, we've been able to really leverage the launch of Trajenta on our insulin business. And so therefore, we're bringing more comprehensive meaningful solutions to the customer, the physician in this case. And then last but not least, obviously we have also had some impact in contracting. What you'll see is that year to year, that's going to ebb and flow. So last year in 2011, we benefited from some of the contracting work that we have done. And as you look at our Q1 results and you're tracking the shares of Humalog in the U.S., you'll see in the first quarter we've lost some share, and this was essentially due to us losing the CVS contract to Novo. But still the underlying performance has gone quite steady and we see improvement, including in our key markets outside of the U.S., where we continue to gain share as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, this is Travis. The only thing I'll add to Derica's comment around the Caremark formulary is that there were really two parts of that that impacted our business, one being the Medicare Part D part, and then the other part being the commercial part.</p>
          <p>With respect to erosion of share based on loss of that formulary, we do expect that that is largely behind us on both of those parts. It is worth noting that the custom plans which are part of the commercial part, we did not see share of market erosion. So I just wanted to leave that point with you as well.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of emerging markets in diabetes, diabetes is an area of great importance for us in emerging markets, and our goal is to regain market leadership in diabetes. This quarter we saw strong growth in Humalog. In terms of how we perform against Novo, we have approximately a 15% share. This is something we're going to grow over time, but it will take time. One thing that's of key importance is access. We've made significant progress on this front, and it has now put us on equal footing with Novo.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of growth, just to put some numbers around that, if you look at the last trailing 12 months, the latest data we have as of January, the meal-time insulin market in China was growing around 17% and change; and our growth, Mark, was over 60%, six-zero percent. John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Everybody else has commented on diabetes, so I've got to get my two cents in. You're right, Mark. We view diabetes as being figuratively and literally the heart of our business, and insulins and continued competitiveness in insulins is the key for our success in this therapeutic area.</p>
          <p>I think looking ahead, what are the levers that we have? And what are the things that we think will amount to critical success factors? Certainly the BI partnership, which is global in reach, gives us not only additional coverage and presence in key markets, but also access to new molecules. We're focused on increasing the competitiveness of our manufacturing process and the competitiveness of the delivery devices that more and more are key determinants of patient choice in terms of people starting on insulin therapy. And of course, innovation; we have a pipeline today in concert with BI that includes DPP4, Trajenta, currently the fastest growing class; empagliflozin now completing Phase 3. We have dulaglutide, rGLP, and of course two insulins. So I think all of this augurs well for us being able to offer a broad range of products to the dietologist, to the physician to really focus on what the patient needs and not just on what we have to offer.</p>
          <p>With respect to the Supreme Court, obviously if the law is upheld, we keep on keeping on. Last year, to put this in perspective, we paid about $586 million out of our treasury as a result of the Affordable Care Act. That was partly the fee, partly the increased rebate on products sold into Medicaid, and then the additional money needed to help Medicare patients bridge the donut hole. If the law is overturned, obviously, we would not have that short &#x2013; we would presumably regain what we essentially paid out in 2011, at least going forward. On the other hand, until something comes along that can replace the ACA, I don't think any of us believe there is a "status quo". It will be unclear how we address the very real needs of 50 million people in this country who are uninsured and who therefore presumably have less access or no access to products like the ones that Lilly offers.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter. The first one, the first couple are just pipeline related for Jan on solanezumab. Can you give any commentary on the dropouts or dropout rate out of the clinical trials that are currently ongoing? Second question on the pipeline has to do with the BI deal. There certainly is the prospect for attractive combination products. Are you and BI exploring a combination of Trajenta with empagliflozin going forward? It would seem that the hemoglobin A1c lowering effect of that combo could potentially be pretty compelling.</p>
          <p>And last question for John; just on the political scene if we could possibly just get an update there, in particular on how PDUFA is being shaped. And also, do you see potentially there being any risk to higher discounts or rebates on dual-eligibles and any additional give-backs on Medicare Part D? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the dropout rate for the sola trial, it's a different pattern than we saw for semagacestat. For semagacestat, there were many more issues with patients dropping out because of side effects. For solanezumab, there is a small dropout, but that has mainly been to practical reasons with infusion centers, et cetera. So I think we are quite encouraged by this and also by the follow-on trial, where 95% of the patients have continued actually with solanezumab infusion, so I think that tells about the safety profile of this agent.</p>
          <p>I agree that to have both a DPP4 and an STLT2 in the pipeline is great, and we have opportunities which we are pursuing there of combos between these two agents.</p>

          <p>John, this is John Lechleiter. I think on PDUFA, we're pleased at this stage at the way in which the PDUFA V has been received on Capitol Hill. Certainly, we've engaged in a lot of dialogue with legislators there. And we believe that we're making good progress toward the passage of that, including the reauthorization of the pediatric extension or pediatric exclusivity provision.</p>
          <p>With respect to some of the issues that we've wrestled with, certainly in the last year, in the context of deficit reduction and other things, the higher rebates for the duals, or other changes to Medicare Part D, I expect these are going to continue to be discussed. I don't expect in light of this being an election year that there's going to be action one way or the other. But obviously, awaiting us as a country is wrestling this long-term deficit and the consequences of that to the ground. And I expect we're going to have to continue to stay very attentive to this issue and tuned into this and to continue to make the case that Medicare Part D is not only working for seniors, it's wildly exceeding anyone's expectation in terms of its effectiveness and its cost.</p>

          <p>Thank you, a couple for Jan; first, anything to update us on the timing and design of the evacetrapib studies? Secondly, on your GLP-1, given that you have results in-house, can you comment on your confidence in the safety profile of your drug versus the class or in any way that you feel comfortable disclosing the bigger picture confidence there? And I guess lastly for John, I can't let you off the hook on Washington matters here. Which way is the wind blowing on taxation and repatriation, and when might we see action on those fronts, if ever? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Let's start with evacetrapib. As you know, we communicated our very promising data in the fall, and we have been doing extensive planning then for the Phase 3 trial, including then interaction with regulators which we are close to completing. We have also being preparing the CMC material for the trial, so we feel very good about the options we have to start this trial before the end of this year, as we have communicated.</p>
          <p>In relation to safety of dulaglutide, Enrique presented some data last year about this agent. And as we said, we have completed the large hemodynamic study, which was originally a potential Achilles heel for this agent. And we will now present this data very soon at the American Society of Hypertension meeting, which I think will clarify the situation for this agent. But we are very confident.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Gregg, obviously there are discussions and debates that continue. Given this is an election year no one anticipates that there's going to be any resolution on the tax front. And likewise, the same thing is true in terms of repatriation. I think everyone is gearing towards that. Obviously, there are multiple proposals out there depending upon what member of Congress you're talking to or of the Senate. So this is just a space we're going to have to continue to watch. We continue to engage. From our position, our focus is on, obviously, if we can go to a territorial tax system, we believe that will be best for all. And if we can get repatriation relief, that would be outstanding, but that's not our number one priority.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much, just a quick question on the Alimta patent situation. Can you update us on progress both in Europe and the U.S. with regard to the patent that could potentially extend the life of Alimta to 2021 &#x2013; 2022 and how that might bake into your long-term expectations for the business?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is really on the evolution of the potential insulin portfolio. Can you just give us again not just the thoughts on how the COGS could improve from the development or successful development of both the novel basal insulin and the biosimilar, but how do you envision the market evolving with both of those products potentially available? Thanks a lot.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Seamus, thanks for your question. We'll have Ilissa, I think, tackle the Alimta patent question. And then I think Derica may want to chime in as well. Ilissa?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, Seamus. The patent for Alimta that you're referring to covers the administration of folic acid and vitamin B12 prior to treatment of patients with Alimta. In terms of an update, there was a Markman hearing that occurred yesterday, and that case was to determine the meaning of two disputed claim terms, vitamin B12 and patient. That hearing happened yesterday. The judge did state that a decision is expected within 45 days. Other than that, the case is still in early stages of fact discovery, and a trial date has not been set. Obviously, we're not able to speculate on what the outcome will be, but we're prepared to continue our vigorous defense of this patent. And as you mentioned, it would extend Alimta exclusivity through May 2022 in the U.S. and 2020 in Europe.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in our first instance overseas in Europe, Seamus, we had prevailed. That's now in the process of appeal. I don't know that any hearings are scheduled to occur again in that particular proceeding until potentially into next year. Derica, do you want to comment at all on how this might play into our planning going forward if it's upheld or if it's not upheld?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Seamus, if this is upheld, then this will be upside for us. And clearly we would reap the benefits of the continuing revenue stream and, obviously, cash flow from that.</p>
          <p>In regards to your next question in terms of the evolution of our insulin portfolio, we actually are very excited about the breadth of portfolio that we have in the diabetes space, going from our presence now in oral to our presence in GLP to now with the two basal insulins that we have in development to the basal space as well as the meal-time. So we believe on the competitive front, we'd be the only big pharma company that would play in all of the diabetes segments.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the insulin portfolio in particular and focusing more on the basals, we believe &#x2013; just look at the basal space. Clearly, lancet or <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:01:40) has become the standard of care there, and we believe we'll have a continuing presence there. So when we look at the market dissection, we believe lancets will retain at least about a third of the basal market. We believe that biosimilars, including our glargine-like product, will occupy about that second third. And then we believe there's space for new innovation in that basal space, and this is where we look to play with our novel basal insulin in the last third.</p>
