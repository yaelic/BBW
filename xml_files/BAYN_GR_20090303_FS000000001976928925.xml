          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Full-year and Fourth Quarter 2008 Results Conference Call of Bayer AG for investors and analysts on the 3rd of March 2009. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alexander Rosar, Head of Investor Relations of Bayer AG. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pat . Good afternoon everybody. Also on behalf of my colleagues, I'd like to welcome you to our Q4 Full-year Earnings Results Conference Call. With us today on the call are our CEO, Mr. Werner Wenning; our CFO, Klaus K&#xFC;hn; and the CEOs from our subgroups, Arthur Higgins from HealthCare; Friedrich Berschauer from CropScience; and Patrick Thomas from MaterialScience.</p>
          <p>Before handing over to Mr. Wenning for his introduction, I'd like to draw your attention to the forward-looking statement wording which governs our call. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Mr. Wenning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. 2008 was an outstanding and the most successful year yet for Bayer. We increased sales, further improved performance and achieved our earnings targets. We created value for our stockholders with a cash flow return on capital invested reaching a new height. Our pleasure with these results would, without any doubt, have been greater if MaterialScience had not seen such a fallback in business in the fourth quarter as a result of the economic and financial crisis. We have never experienced such a fall in demand in such a short period of time. Ladies and gentlemen, in difficult times particularly, it is essential to pursue a business strategy that is oriented towards long-term, sustainable success. It is especially important to hold costs, and not destroy long-term revenue with shortsighted measures.</p>
          <p>We therefore reiterate our successful long-term business strategy. But until further notice, we will give priority to safeguarding our liquidity and earnings rather than seeking further significant external growth. There is no doubt at all that 2009 will be a tough year for our MaterialScience business. However, as a result of our successful long-term strategy, the life-science businesses now account for 70% of sales and almost 85% of underlying EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Therefore we are relatively confident with regards to our earnings outlook for 2009. We expect continued growth in sales and earnings at HealthCare and CropScience. At MaterialScience, we expect a severe drop in sales and earnings. In this negative scenario for MaterialScience, we are nevertheless confident of limiting the decline in Group-underlying EBITDA to about 5%. Should there be a tangible recovery in demand in the short-term, underlying EBITDA could match 2008, or even post a slight increase. We hope for a better picture of the underlying demand trends by the time our Meet Management conference takes place in June.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, now let's take a brief look at our Q4 figures. In my comments, I will concentrate on the data adjusted for portfolio and currency effects. Our Q4 business development was characterized by strong growth in our HealthCare business, solid performance by CropScience and an unprecedented decline for MaterialScience. Group sales dropped 4%, and underlying EBITDA 5% compared to the previous year quarter. Core earnings per share matched last year's level at $0.71.</p>
          <p>HealthCare had a strong finish to a very successful year. Q4 was the best quarter ever in terms of sales and underlying EBITDA. At Pharma, sales improved by 7%, driven by the strong performance of our key brands. The top 15 Pharma products collectively grew by 9%. The YAZ product family advanced 11% and Mirena 30%. Nexavar sales advanced 48% and Betaferon 13%. Kogenate sales were basically flat. Growth in the US and Europe was offset by a somewhat weaker business in Canada. Avelox was down 1%, mainly because of a soft business in Europe.</p>
          <p>Our OTC business expanded 8% with growth in all regions. Diabetes care generated solid business gains in Europe, whereas business in North America was down. The slowdown in the United States was caused by the economic crisis and retail inventory reductions. HealthCare's underlying EBITDA advanced by 19% to almost &#x20AC;1.1 billion. Both Pharma and our Consumer Care business contributed to this increase.</p>
          <p>To further improve marketing efficiency, we have implemented a number of organizational changes. The dermatology business of Intendis will be run by the Consumer Care unit. The MEDRAD and former Possis businesses have been assigned to our Diabetes group.</p>
          <p>The new pro forma segment figures for 2008 were mailed to you with the briefing documents. HealthCare's consistently strong showing makes us confident of sustaining performance improvements in the future. This year, we are targeting above market growth in all divisions, and an improvement in the underlying EBITDA margin towards 28%.</p>
          <p>CropScience saw a slight expansion of business in all units in the fourth quarter of 2008. At Crop Protection, sales in the quarter improved by 1%. The strongest growth was achieved in Latin America, where business advanced 14% driven by our fungicides and insecticides. In Brazil, business advanced 17%. Our business in Asia-Pacific grew nicely with sales up 10%. Sales in North America were basically flat, whereas business in Europe was considerably weaker. Sales in Europe declined by 10% mainly due to the shifts in the business, which was impacted by bad weather, lower fungicide sales in France and decreased corn seed treatments.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with the performance of our BioScience business. The unit recorded a sales improvement of 34%, due to higher cotton seed sales in the United States and Brazil, and expansion of our vegetable seed business.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBITDA at CropScience improved 3%, broadly in line with sales developments. We remain cautiously optimistic for 2009. We are targeting further growth, and aim to maintain the underlying EBITDA margin at the high level of 25%.</p>
          <p>At MaterialScience, we were facing an unprecedented drop in demand. Volumes declined by almost 30% over the quarter across all businesses and all regions. Underlying EBITDA fell by 85% to just over &#x20AC;50 million. Major customers have sharply reduced their inventories in anticipation of prolonged slump in demand. The lead time to order which typically is four to six weeks, collapsed to almost zero. Many of our customers only placed orders on confirmed sales, which creates volatility in the order flows. As a consequence, we have adjusted our production levels across the world to reflect the new demand situation. We will use the coming weeks to further maintenance works, and are accelerating our savings initiatives. However, before taking even more drastic action, we want to have a better understanding of how underlying demand trends will develop. This will probably not be before the middle of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, business started weaker than Q4, and that's weaker than we anticipated a few weeks ago. We expect sales and underlying EBITDA to show a further decline compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, which included a comparatively steady October. For the full-year, we predict a severe drop in sales and underlying EBITDA at MaterialScience.</p>
          <p>Gross cash flow increased by 13% to &#x20AC;1.51 billion, thanks to the gratifying business trends at HealthCare and CropScience. Net cash flow, however, declined by 35% due mainly to a significant increase in cash tied up in working capital. The main reason for this was the order &#x2013; the other working capital. In essence, we paid out significantly more for existing provisions, and we booked fewer new provisions for future payment obligations. Contributing was also a higher level of receivables and inventories at HealthCare as a consequence of business growth. At CropScience, we used the off-season months to rebuild our inventories to normal levels after experiencing double-digit volume growth in 2008, and in anticipation of a good 2009 season.</p>
          <p>Net debt at the end of the year amounted to 14.2 billion. The reason for the increase included the rise in working capital and currency effects and the announced investment of 0.3 billion into our pension asset scheme.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, overall 2008 was a successful year for Bayer. We have achieved our earnings target. And without a fall in demand due to the financial crisis, we are -- would also have achieved our sales objectives. HealthCare and CropScience both improved their performance to new record levels and generated underlying EBITDA margins of 27 and 25% respectively. This is exactly on target. This is also clear evidence that the integration of Schering was well managed, and that our HealthCare strategy for growth is really working. CropScience achieved the highest turnover and underlying EBITDA ever, and the profitability is probably one of the best in the entire industry. We are also pleased to report that we have achieved our 25% margin target one year earlier than originally anticipated. We can also rightly claim that MaterialScience generated well during 2008. The underlying EBITDA margin of 11% corresponds to a cash flow return on investment of 10.1%, which is above the cost of capital and assets reproduction. Overall, a positive upward trend. We have registered since the initiation of our transformation process continued in 2008.</p>
          <p>Since then we have consistently improved performance. For the Group as a whole, we have great underlying EBIT by a factor of more than five, and improved the EBITDA margin from 12 to 21.1%, an increase of nine percentage points. This upward trend was driven by the strong improvement of our HealthCare and CropScience businesses. Based on 2008 figures, these two businesses contribute more than 85% to Group underlying EBIT.</p>
          <p>Last year, we earned record returns for our cost of capital. The cash flow return on investment came to 13%, 80 basis points above the previous year. This slide demonstrates the minimum returns required to cover the cost of capital and <mark type="audio gap" /> with the CFRoI hurdles shown as red dots. Each column represents performance in the respective year, with the darker part of the columns symbolizing the premiums earned over the minimum return required. In 2008, the Cash Value Added amounted to more than 1.2 billion, with all subgroups contributing to this value generation. We have thus established the sound basis and remain committed to continuing our successful long-term strategy, focused on delivering performance, improving the portfolio and developing new growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>We confirm our dividend policy of paying out between 30 and 40% of core earnings per share, and we remain committed to our target of A rating category. For the time being, we prefer to execute this strategy with somewhat more caution.  It will focus more on organic growth and with greater attention to cash performance and debt reduction. In light of the considerable uncertainty caused by the economic crisis, we are convinced that this more cautious approach is appropriate.</p>
          <p>In this context, we have already started a new working capital project with the aim to significantly improve working capital performance over the next two years. At constant volumes and prices, we are targeting a free &#x20AC;1 billion of cash from funds tied up in working capital by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> now, our complete financial plans for 2009. As already mentioned, for HealthCare and CropScience, we expect a gratifying trend in 2009, with growth in sales and EBITDA before special items. In MaterialScience, we anticipate an extremely difficult year with a severe drop in sales and earnings. In this negative scenario for MaterialScience, we are confident of limiting the decline in Group EBITDA before special items to about 5%. Group sales would probably then be in the region of &#x20AC;32 billion. Should there be a tangible recovery in our MaterialScience business in the short-term, Group EBITDA before special items could match the very high level of 2008, or even post a slight increase. Our planning is based on the US dollar of 1.35 to the euro.</p>
          <p>The tax rate is anticipated in the range of 28 to 30%. Our capital expenditure budget for 2009 is &#x20AC;1.5 billion. Research and development expenses are planned to rise to about &#x20AC;2.9 billion. We expect to reduce net debt towards &#x20AC;10 billion in 2009, helped by the conversion of the mandatory convertible bond and an improvement in net cash flow. This forecast does not take into account any possible portfolio changes.</p>
          <p>We expect important news flow to emerge from our Pharma pipeline in the course of the year. Today I would like to draw your attention to the publication of the Phase II Riociguat results in May, and the planned presentation of Xarelto Phase III Einstein-extension study in secondary prevention of VTE towards the end of the year. Additionally, we anticipate approval of Nexavar for HCC in Japan still during the first half of this year. And the approval of Xarelto for VTE prevention after hip and knee replacement surgery in the US still this year.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, following the most successful year yet for Bayer, there is no doubt that 2009 will be a tough year. However, we believe we are well placed to monitor the situation as approximately 70% of our business are clearly less affected by the economic crisis. We will systematically implement all necessary measures. Bayer's management is experienced in mastering major challenges, and we are confident of exiting this crisis in a stronger position.</p>
          <p>That concludes my remarks. Now, we are happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And the first question today comes from Sachin Jain. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. It's Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. Thanks for taking my questions. A few financials, and then just one for Pharma. Firstly, in your worst-case scenario of a 5% fall in Group EBITDA, do you think you would still be in a situation to be able to grow your dividend by increasing the payout ratio? Secondly, just wonder if Klaus would comment on expectations of non-operating results in '09, and any impact from increase in pension expenses? Thirdly, you've commented on a one billion cash release from working capital assumptions. I was wondering if you could just provide some more color on exactly what you're putting in place there? And then just one question on the Pharma side. Wonder if you could comment on the Xarelto launch, where you've got reimbursement to date, just very broad comments there? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much for your questions. I will start with your question in regard to dividend. I can only repeat our guidance that we are going to pay between 30 and 40% of our core dividend &#x2013; of our core earnings per share also in the future. This is, this was and still is our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin, okay. Let's start with the guidance on the non-operating results. Please, always let's say, take into account volatilities this year are very high. So therefore at least some caution. But our best estimate for the overall non-operating results for 2009 would be between 1.1 and &#x20AC;1.2 billion. That will include a financial or an interest result of roughly &#x20AC;650 million. So somewhat lower than this year. It also includes an increase that refers to the pensions due to the increased net pension liabilities. Also the interest results on our pensions will increase from a negative let's say 300 plus to a negative 400 plus. So roughly a burn of 100 million. That will be the impact of the financial results, with regards to the pension.</p>
          <p>Coming to the cash flow and our initiatives there, you should take into account that our working capital performance suffered from two sides. One was, let's say, mainly let's look at the second -- at the fourth quarter. It was from higher inventories, here due -- and somewhat also receivables in HealthCare -- due to a stronger business at the materials and inventory, because we prepared this year better for the new season because we encountered shortages last year. So that should have also a positive, let's say, working capital impact for next year.</p>
          <p>Overall, we still want to improve &#x2013; that's what we call working capital in the core sense, and also with regards to a better performance. And that's what Werner Wenning said is that we want to improve the days really by roughly -- with an impact of &#x20AC;1 billion if volumes would stay the same. So if growth picks up, usually you need additional let's say working capital, but we advised that taking volume growth constant, then we would aim at improving this year's working capital in the core sense by one billion. But let me stress another point. The majority of the working capital deterioration in the fourth quarter was in so-called other working capital. And other working capital mainly deals with changes in provisions. And that meant that we had a negative swing in the fourth quarter. So we paid out more for already accrued obligations, for legal settlement for instance or also for rebates, and this you can see like the legal fees are kind of one-off. And secondly, we lowered also the new provisions for obligations in the next year. That means that we have also, that is lower prepayments and also lower personnel provisions for instance for variable payments. That means that is not only a one-time effect, but it is also even a reversal effect in the other working capital. That's why we say we expect a significant improvement in working capital next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The start of Xarelto, Arthur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sachin, I'd like to take this opportunity to first of all remind people that in the first indication, VTE prevention, this is really not about sales. I think we've made this very clear. This is the pre-marketing of the product. The big opportunity here is the chronic indications. The VTE prevention opportunities globally we estimate have a market of less than &#x20AC;300 million. Having said that, I'm pleased to report that the product is now launched in 40 countries. We're getting very good formally up-tick. We already have pricing -- in Canada, Germany and the U.K. But again, maybe to help people and to make sure we don't get our messages crossed here, if you're looking at an outlook for revenues this year, it's in the 20 to &#x20AC;30 million range for Xarelto. Again, putting this very much in context, what we're using the VTE prevention indication to do is to train the market for the chronic indications. And so far the reaction from formularies and physicians has been excellent.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you sir. The next question comes from Jean De Watteville. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes. Hi, Jean De Watteville from Nomura. Thank you. Just a couple of questions. First of all, just a follow-up on the working capital guidance for the one billion inflow that you're guiding in '09. Just -- first of all, does that include the reversal in the other working capital? And is that consistent with the pessimistic scenario, where I assume you will enjoy favorable working capital inflow in MaterialScience? So that's the first question. The second question is a specific question on seed care. I'm &#x2013; the trend has been pretty negative in H2 and also we know DuPont, one of the largest seed producers in North America, signed a very large agreement with Syngenta. And I just would like to understand if the negative trends seen in H2 is related to that signature between Syngenta and DuPont? And what's the impact going forward and what's the size of the business you were doing with DuPont? And the third question is on your guidance in Crop Protection. You talk about cautious -- cautiously optimistic view for the market in 2009 and you've built up inventories. I'm just wondering if you've seen any evidence in the start of the year that volumes are actually higher than last year? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let's start with working capital again, Klaus K&#xFC;hn. And Friedrich Berschauer on seed care and the guidance also at Crop Protection.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jean. So the one billion relates only to the normal, that's what I call the core working capital. But taken like we said on constant volumes. Take also into account that we still intend to grow in HealthCare and also in CropScience. And if you look at year-end numbers, we probably also intend to grow compared to December '08. So this will be eating up into the one billion, if you look at the absolute number in the core working capital. And the other working capital which contributed to the increase over the last year of, I -- by 800 million, this will &#x2013; on top be reduced significantly, but we are refraining from giving here a specific guidance because it is very difficult really to manage this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The seed treatment, you're absolutely right.  Our performance in the fourth quarter was clearly behind last year. There have been two reasons. One was indeed the deal Syngenta Pioneer as you pointed out. Details are not disclosed, so I can't comment further. And the other aspect was that we had a temporary suspension of the Clothianidin, registration in Italy and in Germany, with an impact of around about 15, one-five, million in 2008. We are hoping that to get to registration either in 2009 or 2010 in Germany and in Italy. So we believe that we can recover this business.</p>
          <p>In terms of the US seed treatment business that the impact that discussed last year, we are cautiously optimistic that we can regain some business with our partners in the States this year or next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The start in 2009, we are pleased. January and February are basically in accordance with our expectation.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. UBS in London. I've got three boring questions as well. First question, just trying to, if you could help us build a net debt bridge -- obviously, the 10 billion at least on my numbers looks aggressive or ambitious. Are you planning any top-ups to the pension funds again in 2009? And what are you targeting in terms of restructuring cash outflows for 2009, and also if you could give that equivalent number for 2008 that would be helpful. That's to question number one. Question number two, we've -- we had the question from Sachin on the non-operating result. Can you just fill us in on the last element, the joint venture, especially the polyols joint venture with Lyondell? And what your situation regarding the Lyondell Chapter 11 situation is for those joint ventures, and what we should expect in terms of earnings development? And the last one is also housekeeping. I was just wondering if you could provide the amount of the purchase amortization related to the Schering acquisition that you booked in 2008 in the P&amp;L? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start with Pat, Patrick, you will talk a little bit about the Lyondell JV and the consequences of Chapter 11. And then we will come to the net debt related question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Thomas. The JV that we operate is actually operated physically by Lyondell. So they have the right to choose whether to run the physical asset or not run the asset in Europe. We're in continuous contact with Lyondell as they go through their protected spaces under Chapter 11. And we're obviously taking appropriate measures to protect our cash position opposite Lyondell, and helping support them as they go through their difficult restructuring under protection. Beyond that, we don't have any special privileged information or special knowledge of their situation beyond what is published by the court.</p>

          <p>And now, and your -- how we are going to reduce net debt? That's, Thomas -- okay, I cannot give you the full details, but we start with 14.2 billion debt at the beginning of the year. A significant contribution will be the conversion of the mandatory convertible towards the middle of the year. And the remainder for the reduction will come from the gross cash flow and from the fact that we do not expect that a significant reduction between gross cash flow and net cash flow. So that there is a contribution and that's what we mentioned on the working capital initiative. Thirdly, we said that we want to decrease the CapEx number by roughly, say -- whereas the HealthCare and CropScience will be roughly in line with a slight increase maybe -- what we see is somewhat 30% decrease, 200 million-plus, 250 million, as we see it currently in MaterialScience. So that will also play a positive role there.</p>
          <p>The part with regard to pension funding, yes, we had already pension fundings in 2008 of 300 million, and we have put in also that we expect some fundings in 2009. However the amount will be, let's say, depending on the overall performance in the capital market, but maybe a similar ballpark number can be expected for next year.</p>
          <p>The cash relevant extraordinary items this year, we think that the vast majority of these exceptions will be cash relevant to 250. And last year, roughly, maybe 450 to 500 million were cash.</p>

          <p>Thank you, sir. Your next question comes from Michael Leuchten. Please state your company name followed by your question. Mr. Michael Leuchten?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry, it's Michael Leuchten from Deutsche Bank. A couple of questions please. One on HealthCare, there's a comment in your annual results that the SG&amp;A was pumped up by investments in the emerging markets. Arthur, could I get you to comment on how much of that was really one-off, how much is ongoing? And maybe tie into that an update, what you're seeing in the emerging markets, or have seen in Q4? Your performance is very strong. I think that's maybe a little different with other companies. Maybe just an update, what you see -- where you see weakness or not? Secondly, you've been very kind in giving an FX impact in Q3 as to what the margin was pumped up in HealthCare, or suffered, until September. Could we get an update for that for Q4? And then lastly for Arthur again. The restatement of Pharma and Consumer Health, I guess that's a reflection of structural changes within the Company. Is that going to have any operational impacts, and are you expecting any efficiency resulting from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Michael, just would you mind repeating the middle question. We couldn't get it precisely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. It's the financials. So the foreign exchanges that you were kind enough to provide the impacts on the margin in September, what the margins suffered in the nine months. I was just wondering whether you could give an update in Q4 for HealthCare, what currencies did for the margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question will be answered by Klaus Kuhn. And Arthur, you would, you will start with ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Michael, let me answer the question on SG&amp;A. In the fourth quarter, total SG&amp;A for BSP [Bayer Schering Pharma], which is probably the lion's share where we spend, or certainly in general admin, was actually 1% lower than the fourth quarter of last year. One of the things we've been trying to do, Michael, is smooth out our SG&amp;A expenses, particularly the P&amp;I expenses. One of the things you've seen historically is we've had a very strong expense in the fourth quarter, in P&amp;I in particular. We're trying to smooth that out, and I think we achieved that in the fourth quarter. The reason I mention that is you've got to then assume that P&amp;I for the first quarter may be a little higher than you would have seen in the first quarter of last year. As to where that P&amp;I is being spent, you're correct, it is in the emerging markets. When we look at the increase in Selling and General Admin, I would say 80% of our total increase we expect in SG&amp;A next year is coming from emerging markets, which really reflects a very strong growth. And I think in reality, our performance in the full-year and the fourth quarter reflects that we're getting a very good return in that investment.</p>
          <p>So first, we'll be a little more cautious this year as we try and anticipate how these emerging markets will perform. As you will be aware, we've mentioned in the past we are very strong in emerging markets with approximately 22% growth last year, and almost 50% growth in China. So we don't want to do anything that damages the investments we've made over the previous five years. But in light of the current economic downturn, we'll probably be a little more cautious in the first half of the year in investing in new sales force in these countries. So that help gives you a little bit of color to what we're doing. It's somebody balancing the P&amp;L spend, spending 80% in emerging markets. We're getting a very excellent return on that.</p>
          <p>On your third question, which was relating to the restatement of structure, this is not just an accounting change. This is really putting the businesses closer to where we believe the best that -- taking for example, MEDRAD. MEDRAD is a medical device business. It really had very little synergies with our Pharma business. In fact, it was probably suffering a little bit as a result of that. So we've moved that into what we now call Biomedical Care along with Diabetes Care, which is another device business. And I think that signals our willingness to continue to strengthen our medical device business. Last year, we acquired Possis, which was a mechanical thrombectomy company. And I am very pleased to report that that acquisition is already ahead of its financials. So that was a very strategic move. The same is true for Intendis moving to Consumer Care. In Consumer Care, we already have a pretty substantial over-the-counter dermatology business. And as the type of products we're bringing to the market in Intendis are essentially off-patent products -- and essentially they're being brought based on formulations -- bringing these two centers of excellence together mean that we can leverage our formulation and development expertise. So I think, whilst there's not a lot of direct financial benefit, strategically we've now put these businesses closer together. And we do expect to see improvement in both businesses as a result.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and the third and fourth quarter currency impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Michael, for the fourth quarter the currency impact, it was almost negligible. You could say that the EBITDA impact in the fourth quarter for the Group was plus 21 million, and the margin impact was diluted by 0.1 percentage point. And that is basically a similar number for HealthCare, also diluted by 0.1 percentage point.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, from Societe Generale. A couple of questions please. The first one is on Xarelto. I was just wondering if you have any more clarity from the FDA on the timelines for the outcome? And also whether you have any more clarity on the actual timeline for these studies and the long-term indications actually weeding out. I know you're looking to file in 2010, but it would be great to get a feel for when exactly they might be weeding out? And the second question refers to your guidance. Thank you so much for giving us a floor for EBITDA for this year. It was very helpful. I was just wondering if you could walk us through conceptually some of the assumptions you've been making behind that in terms of demand decline, potential contingency measures and basically how confident you really are that this is the floor? Or whether there is a chance that if by middle of Q2 we don't see a rebound in demand that you could be guiding down further under a worst-case scenario? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, with regards to Xarelto, we actually have a firm date Marietta for the outcome. It is March the 19th. We are in preparation with our partner J&amp;J for this meeting, Andrew that's all I can say. As to the Xarelto studies, again without giving specifics, let me just say that all of the studies are recruiting at or ahead of schedule. So we remain very much on track for 2010 submission. So really good progress, reflecting the high level of interest in this product.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is there actually any chance that we could see any data from the long-term indications in 2009?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We expect to, later on this year, update you on the Einstein-DVT treatment. The, there's several elements of that, but the prevention arm we expect to present results on that later on this year. So that'll be the next data point you will receive, which is in the Einstein-VTE treatment and secondary prevention. We'll give you an update on the secondary prevention study cohort in the latter part of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Coming back to our annual guidance, the corporate guidance, you can imagine that the actual situation of BMS, MaterialScience, influenced a lot in our, the corporate guidance for the whole year. But let's assume that HealthCare and CropScience will achieve their targets, what of course we expect, we project an EBITDA contribution of BMS in the range of 200 to 300 million to match that, the guidance range. So that is -- and of course if we will be able or that the markets will recover in the remainder of the year, as I said too in my presentation, we will be able to match last year's or -- to do better compare to last year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But is there any chance at all that the contribution from BMS could become negative if there is no rebound in <mark type="inaudible" /> --</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, it's JPMorgan. A couple of questions, please. Herr Wenning, you mentioned in your statements that you wanted to wait until later on the year for BMS before you decided to take even more drastic action. I wonder what you meant by that? Whether that meant deeper cost cutting or something more strategic? I wonder if you could perhaps touch, fill us in there? Then on the CropScience business, in terms of the portfolio, I see the comments on Bloomberg this morning that you're -- and from what you said earlier, there really aren't major acquisitions, but are there any pieces within the Crop Protection area either geographically or products where you would like to strengthen perhaps with bolt-ons &#x2013; just wondered if you could talk a little bit about that? And then back to MaterialScience. TDI prices, you have &#x2013; have unsurprisingly, I suppose, finally cracked. Do you view that as a new trajectory for those prices or a step downward and perhaps expect some level of price support looking forward? I'll leave it at those for now. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to address your first question, what means later on? I said this morning and I reconfirmed it during our conference this afternoon that, of course, we are constantly monitoring the development of our different markets. And we still do not know do we have, really touch bottom now, or what will happen on the inventory adjustments by our major customers. So I believe that we will be able to get a better understanding about the markets, about the future market trends, after we have analyzed carefully the first quarter. That's the reason why I talked about middle of the second quarter. And what will happen, of course, and I explained it this morning, that our polycarbonate plants are running actually on 50% capacity, and TDI and MDI of around 70% capacity. And if we will stay long-term on actual demand levels, of course, we have to adjust our worldwide production network accordingly. That's the consequence which we have to address again in -- during the next couple of days and weeks. And entirely depends, first of all, when we get a better understanding about the bottom. And secondly, when we get a better understanding about the future demand. But the consequences are quite clear: adapting capacity to the future demand in each and every business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Crop Protection, that was another question, yes? I got the question this morning, what about Dow CropScience business. First of all, we do not know if this business is for sale or not. Normally, we would not like to speculate about market rumors. But I stick to my statement this morning, and what I said during my introduction speech that first priority has liquidity &#x2013; first quality of costs has the, our net debt reduction, which Klaus K&#xFC;hn talked about. So this is first priority, and that means that we are not prepared for the next foreseeable future to invest into a major acquisition. And one comment in regards to Dow's <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because you also asked in terms of our portfolio of possible weaknesses in terms of regions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Crop Protection, we have almost a complete portfolio. Our pipeline is really very good. So in Crop Protection, we do not have significant weak spots. In terms of countries and regions, we are also in a very good shape. We expanded our business significantly, for example, in India, where we have been five years ago rather weak. So, and we also strong now in China. So also regional wise in Crop Protection, we are in good shape. In BioScience, it's a different picture. We are strong in canola and cotton, in hybrid rice and in vegetables. But of course, we are not in the big crops like corn and soybean. So that's basically strategically considering our portfolio that would be the &#x2013; there we really would, could strengthen our overall situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>Very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Neil, the question on TDI prices picking up, the point that was made earlier is it's driven entirely by supply and demand. During the first half of last year, the market was very tight or balanced, and that kept very high pricing levels. TDI is essentially a one or two product family. So it is more in the commodity end of polyurethanes isonate. The market went long in quarter three after the Olympics, primarily because there was a lot of stock built up, particularly in Asia during the transportation ban because the plants were still running, the material was going into stock. So with the decline in November and December in terms of demand from the furniture industry, the market was heavily over-supplied in quarter four. And the volumes in quarter four were something like 23% below the volumes in quarter three. Full year, it represented only 2% reduction versus the prior year. So this is primarily an overstocking situation. We have responded by mothballing one of our units in the US, in Baytown, which is about 100,000 tons of capacity. The total of just under 0.5 million tons. And other people are adjusting their capacity it seems, and there is quite tight inventory control. There is clearly a lack of demand in the furniture industry, the main consumer of TDI, and the automotive industry. Both industries are down severely. And the next major expansion that was planned, which was in Hungary, has now been postponed until the beginning of 2010.</p>
          <p>So there's a whole series of dynamics going on here, which are reactions to this sharp decline. So the prices have dropped significantly. There will be continuous price pressure during 2009, but typically TDI performs almost a price switching. It goes between a premium price when it's tight, and a standard price when it's long. And you don't get deep discounting because of the inevitable raw material and conversion costs. So the price dropped close to the cost of the highest cost producer, and that's fairly normal economics I think. So I think that answers your question about the dynamics of TDI. I'd expect to see prices continuing at this level throughout 2009.</p>

          <p>Thank you sir. The next question comes from Andreas Heine. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andreas Heine from UniCredit. I'd like to follow on the question before in MaterialScience. Do you have any sign of any change from January to February, looking forward to March in any of the industry where you see some kind of end of the inventory cycle? And what is your own inventory? Do you feel comfortable with the current situation, or is it also that you have to run down inventories even further throughout the second quarter? That's the first question. The second question is on the R&amp;D budget, which is 2.9 billion, almost 10% higher than what you had in 2008. Could you elaborate it a little bit? I guess most of that goes to Pharma, what the intention is, where it will go mid-term? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let's start with the BMS-related question Mr. Heine. Patrick --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Andreas, the -- your question about inventory insight is interesting, because I think during the latter part of last year, particularly November and December, there was a strong inventory effect in the reduction in demand, as we saw people de-stocking. To a large extent in isocyonates, people are fully de-stocked. There are no obvious ways in the automotive industry, particularly in handling isocyonates, of storing large quantities at any of our customers. So most of that inventory is being worked out of our system now. And we are as a matter of course running for low working capital. So we are trying to reduce our inventory, and we are idling certain assets because of that. I think the inventory cycle has taken its toll. But if I talk about the year-on-year effect at the beginning of this year, let's say January, the automotive market in terms of order entry is down about 47%, the construction industry is down about 23%, the electronics and electrical appliance industry is down 35% and the furniture industry's down 48%. And I think those are pretty much close to real demand numbers. And there's not much difference between the sales values that we're seeing, or the sales volumes we're seeing coming through, through December, January and February. The only market where there's been some increase has been after the end of Chinese New Year, when China's domestic demand has picked up. And I think it's fair to say of most customers in China, they mostly say the same things to us, which is that their export demand is dropping by 15 to 25%. But their domestic amount is dropping by only five to 10%. So the domestic market in China is not as &#x2013; not damaged as badly as some of the other industrial markets around the world.</p>

          <p>In regard to your question, Heine, about R&amp;D expenditure, last year, that means 2008, HealthCare was 1.742. Budget this year is 1.915. In CropScience, 649. This year is close to 700. MaterialScience was 220. It's now close to 240. And we are spending in our expenditure  in reconciliation, that means for BTS and Bayer Innovation stayed around 50 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the European Crop Protection market was quite weak at the back end of the year. And you did give some explanation, but I didn't manage to get it down. And also the Environmental Science area has been challenging for you. And can you talk about what you're doing there? In the Consumer Care side, one or two products like Aspirin, Aleve seem to be quite weak. Can you just explain? That is, is that a general consumer issue? Is that a generic issue? And how do you intend to manage the HealthCare business in an environment potentially at the end of the year, where we get perhaps great budget constraints and a tough, if you will, a purchasing environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Andrew let's start with Crop and the development of the European Market. So Friedrich Berschauer...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, in terms of the European market, I mentioned we're not concerned. It's correct that the first quarter was a little bit weak. But overall our performance in Europe was counted or it basically is <mark type="inaudible" /> 14% this year in 2008, which was really very, very good. The fourth quarter was a little bit weak. Two reasons or three reasons. One was rather weak multi-zone farms. Secondly, weather situation in Europe was honestly lousy, specifically in U.K., where the application of herbicides was really very, very difficult in the fourth quarter. And the third aspect was Clothianidin, which I mentioned already. But there is clearly no weakness in Europe seeing the full year, and I'm very optimistic in terms of 2009.</p>
          <p>While in Environmental Science, business was down last year. Main reason was the professional business in US, building, <mark type="inaudible" /> business was lousy, was bad. Also golf course, for example, due to the economic crisis was down. Our consumer business overall outside of US did very well. We have been very pleased with this performance. So we hope that we have reached the bottom now in 2008. And our plan is to do at least a little bit better in 2009.</p>
          <p>Next we have taken in US, we reduced head count significantly. We reduced our P&amp;I spending significantly. So I think we did what was the right thing to do in US, to at least restore the EBITDA, having not such a dramatic impact on our EBIT in US.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, how the Consumer Care, Aspirin/Aleve, and budget constraints --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah let me, yeah, first of all, I will remind you that our Consumer Care business had an excellent full-year with sales up close to 9%, currency adjusted. When we look at Consumer Care OTC business, almost a 10% growth. So it's very important that we understand we had a very strong year in our consumer business. When you identify the two brands you're discussing, first of all Aleve, really that's the impact of the fact that in 2007, we launched the new Aleve Liquid Gels. And that was a pretty significant stock-in. So that created a negative year-on-year comparison. We believe we have good underlying growth on Aleve. As to Aspirin, the issue really relates to Aspirin in the pain indication. Whereas Aspirin Cardio is doing well. And what we did was we shifted some P&amp;I. In 2009, we intend to look again at how we can strengthen Aspirin in the analgesic or pain segment. But again, I would remind you that's the smaller part of our business. The fact is that the largest partner is Cardio Aspirin.</p>
          <p>As to budget constraints, I think a general statement is we do expect to see softening in healthcare markets. But we're in a very, I think, strong position compared to many of our competitors. We finished obviously the year in a very good shape. And if you look at the US where many people are concerned about the impact of the Obama measures, particularly in terms of Medicaid reductions, we have less than 30% of our pharmaceutical business in the US, compared to most companies that have 40 to 50%. And we know that was a conscious decision we made several years ago, because we were concerned about the dominance of the US market. That means that we have a very limited exposure to the US. And in fact when we look at Medicare (sic) [Medicaid] , Medicare combined in the US -- so start with our business is less than 30% in the US, the Medicare Medicaid in the US is also less than 30% of our business. So we're actually quite insulated from any negative effects that could happen in the US. Having said that, globally we do expect that healthcare systems -- trying to balance budgets, having bailed out the banking system and other industries, we look to the healthcare budgets as a way of cutting costs. And if that happens, I think as we've demonstrated in the past, we have the resilience to cut our costs accordingly, and take the necessary contingencies.</p>
          <p>So I think in general, I would summarize that we expect some softness in the healthcare markets overall. We expect to grow above market, and that we have enough, I believe, flexibility in our variable cost to respond and ensure that we deliver on our targets. Okay?</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Matthias Cornu. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Matthias Cornu from Exane. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions, one follow-up on BMS and one on CropScience. First, follow-up on an earlier question on Bayer MaterialScience. If I understood correctly in your floor guidance of 5% decline in EBITDA, you mentioned a corresponding EBITDA contribution of 2 to 300 million of BMS. In this scenario do you expect to be cash positive for this business, thanks to working capital inflow, CapEx cut and despite probably restructuring costs? And the second question on CropScience, are you still comfortable at this level with the three to 5% price increase you mentioned last year? And can you comment maybe if this increase has been already negotiated with distributors, and are they included in your two to 3% market growth guidance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with your question about CropScience.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, correct, I addressed this topic during our last call. And our target was surprisingly 3 to 5%. Negotiations are done. We managed overall, over our full portfolio last year, a price increase in Crop Protection by 3%, over full portfolio. And these 3% price increases are reflected in our budget this year, full-year. This means this two to 3% market growth which we expect for 2009 includes this price increase. Of course this would mean volumes would be more or less flat. But this overall can't be a huge surprise because you should remember that last year we had to change-up, set aside policy in Europe. So there has been additional eight, which is moved to agriculture production. This effect is done. We also have to take into consideration that last year we had really, and I mention this quite often, above average weather conditions for our business. So okay, if we would have the same weather conditions this year. But if we do the budget of course we have to assume normal average weather conditions. So wait and see how this market performs. So our assumption is more or less, volume might be flat, and we should have a positive impact on price increases which have been implemented in the last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, coming back to your question about our guidance. I like that, I believe that we have been or we are as precisely as possible with our Group guidance for 2009, we clearly defined our targets for HealthCare and for CropScience. And you know that how difficult and how volatile is actually the BMS business. We also gave you an indication how much EBITDA of, for, from coming from Bayer MaterialScience is included in our guidance: 200 and 300 million. And please understand that I, we are not prepared to give further details today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But could we have maybe an idea of the potential costs for restructuring in that business, cash costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On restructuring for next year, we've accelerated some of the programs that we communicated before. And I think we expect around about 60 million of special items restructuring costs during 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one calling on cash. One of the things we managed to achieve last year in our polycarbonate business was a positive cash flow even with a very limited performance in terms of EBITDA. And even in the fourth quarter, our working capital performance was good. So I think, from a point of view of cash management, even at 200 to 300 EBITDA, we will be trying to achieve a positive cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very clear. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Christian Faitz. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Christian Faitz from Oppenheim. I have also question on MaterialScience, and then one on CropScience. In MaterialScience regarding polycarbonates, what is your current assessment of the future for the ODS market? And how is the pricing behavior of one of your major competitors, which I guess posted a problem for you in the past two years or so? And then in CropScience, in your assessment how is the current situation in Brazil? Are farmers there still doing okay financially? And in general, given the worse off commodity prices throughout the world, do you see any impact for your own business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First BMS, Patrick</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah BMS certainly in the optical day storage market CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray and so on has been pretty disappointing. And I think you'll see from Time Warner and the other major publishers that they're quite disappointed by sales in Blu-ray over the Christmas period. I would say that that market has flattened certainly, and is probably now in decline with the current lack of consumer confidence. We have reduced our exposure considerably. In a normal portfolio, this would be around about 30% of the polycarbonate in the market.  And for us it represents the low 20s of our total business at the moment.</p>
          <p>In terms of pricing behavior, you can imagine with various plants, mothballed at the moment, we've taken six of our lines and mothballed them and which take 300,000 tons of capacity out of the market, which is significant. And of our remaining units, they're running at a lower capacity rate, which means compared to nameplate, we're only running 50% of our total capacity. There's a reasonable amount of discipline in pricing at the moment. And certainly things, I think, have got slightly better than we experienced during the last couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Brazilian Crop, the situation in Brazil, Friedrich?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The situation in Brazil is as following in terms of business: January is, due to the seasons, still is a very important month. January was okay. In terms of our business, the low season starts in February. So it's &#x2013; February, March, April it's not so important for us. So far we have no significant negative impact in Brazil. But we will watch the situation very, very carefully as we will watch the situation in Ukraine and Russia for example, and some other eastern European countries. So in Brazil, we need to be -- again we need to watch the situation carefully. We are very pleased with the credit collection situation, which is really good presently. So, so far so good. But again, we will watch Brazil very carefully.</p>
          <p>And in terms of commodity prices, okay, there is of course a high volatility. Nobody knows where the commodity price will be in mid or end of the year. What we believe, what we expect that commodity prices on average in 2009 will be clearly below 2008, but significantly above the level we have seen in 2004, '05, and '06. This would mean that agricultural production's still effective for farmers if they are willing to invest into high value seeds, into high value crop protection products. And considering this situation, that &#x2013; this is our assumption that -- why we believe that we can achieve the targets which had been discussed quite often now today for 2009.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Merrill Lynch. Couple of questions, please. CapEx side, I missed the comments. So I just wonder if you could repeat them, specifically if you would have any guidance for CapEx for '09 for both CropScience and MaterialScience, thank you? And the second question was just going back to CropScience, how do you think from what you're hearing in the US market the farm economy will react to Obama's budget proposals for the billion cut to the subsidy regime? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I -- we'll start with our CapEx. CapEx Bayer HealthCare, CapEx expenditure were 395 million last year. This year budget is 424. In Bayer CropScience, 283 last year. This year budget 310. And as Klaus K&#xFC;hn said in BMS coming from 810, going down to less than 600. So that is more or less the details of our CapEx. The US market budget cuts...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course there are plans to reduce or cut the subsidy significantly, plans to reduce the subsidy significantly in the United States. Our organization in US is believing in our customers are believing that implementation this year will be very, very difficult. So we believe that this year should be still okay. And then we need to watch how this situation develops in US. But we do not expect that will be a significant impact on 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Florent Cespedes. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Florent Cespedes speaking from Exane BNP Paribas, Paris. A quick question on Xarelto. To come back on the interesting data that you're planning to release towards the end of this year, can you be more specific? Are you planning to present the data during a Scientific Congress? And at the same time, will you also provide the comprehensive data on the safety of Xarelto? I also have another question on Xarelto. Could you give us a flavor of the perception by the medical community on Xarelto for it's first indication in Europe? And the last one, could we have an update on your view on Betaferon performance for 2009 and 2010? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me start with Xarelto. The data will be presented at a Congress. We have yet to decide which Congress, but it will be at a Scientific Congress. If we have not provided any public data update on patients in terms of exposure, we may well take that opportunity. However, I'm sure that following the outcome that you will get a little bit more information as to the total exposure. And by that I mean number of patients treated and for how long. As I &#x2013; as regards to the reaction to Xarelto and prevention, as I mentioned earlier, we've been very encouraged by the formulary uptick. The general reaction of the medical community is this is first and best-in-class. But again I would remind you, we are using this as an exercise to gain familiararity. We're keeping it very much to the labeled indications. And it's really about giving physicians confidence in advance of the product being available for chronic indications.</p>
          <p>As for Betaferon, we had a very strong year on Betaferon with almost 15% currency adjusted growth rate. As for the outlook for 2009, as you're aware, we will face competition from Extavia, the biosimilar that we have licensed to Novartis. And for that reason, we are giving guidance for Betaseron that sales will be in line, roughly in line with 2008, despite the launch of Extavia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very clear. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Michie Yana. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Michie Yana, ECM. I'm wondering if you can just go back to about -- what you mentioned about the working capital, reduce one billion thereby. is this something that'd be more evenly split throughout the year, or would that be more of a front-loaded, especially if you're adjusting provisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think usually the working capital performance is back-loaded. So the first half with regard to working capital is more difficult due to one, the seasonality of our CropScience business, where we first build up the receivables in the first half-year and then collect in the second half. Secondly, we have the payouts, the accruals for our variable interest payments -- variable incentive payments, which are also due in the first half. So that usually means that the major benefits in working capital usually appear always in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a follow-up question on overall liquidity situation. As of year-end, you had about 2 billion cash and, if I remember correctly, you had about 3.5 billion undrawn facility. And considering you had some debt maturity earlier in the year and have probably some more in first half, is there something you would just use bank facilities or do you actually still have access to debt market to issue bonds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have -- so far we have absolutely no constraints of accessing the debt markets. We are also -- we have tested the commercial paper market, which is available to us. We see the bank markets are open to us. We see all, we see so far all credit placement markets open to us. So actually we see currently no major market which should not be available to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one quick question on the MaterialScience, which seems to be a de rigueur questions today. But Patrick, you mentioned about TDI supply/demand situation in the price projection. I'm wondering, can you comment the same thing for MDI, if you see -- where do you see the price coming this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we see -- the pricing is under pressure at the moment because of capacity level. Although the full year volumes year-on-year were not down by that much in 2008. It was only about 4%. So we brought on a new plant in China, which is 350,000 tons, which clearly contributed to the capacity overhang at the point where the market slowed down. So we don't actually have any unit multiples in MDI yet. But we will take that decision as we see what happens to the growth over the next quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you see any reason to become more cautious in terms of where the volume is trading?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think one of the upsides on the MDI side of the business relates to the stimulus packages in China and in America, both of which specifically fund projects which have high levels of insulations for environmental reasons. And certainly there's a fair degree of construction activity associated with both programs. And if they really kick-in in the second half of the year, I think the MDI situation will be easier to deal with perhaps than the TDI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. It's Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst. Looking at Kogenate, obviously it was a weak quarter. I just am interested if there's any CSL shipping impacts in -- or was really the Canadian business so weak here? Obviously also you guided usually for seven to 9% currency adjusted increase. You just made good, say with seven. What is here your outlook for 2009, still this kind of high single-digit or almost double-digit growth? Second question is regarding Bayer MaterialScience and very specifically regarding lower raw material costs. Obviously you still potentially have to work down your high priced raw materials on your inventory side. The question is when do you expect that, your lower raw material costs will give a benefit to your business, to your margins? And the second question, it's also regarding Bayer MaterialScience ... sorry where...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No. Inventories, when they are worked down at your level?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Let's start with K&#xF6;hler with Kogenate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The key issue was the Canadian market, where we had lost a tender and started an impact throughout the year, but we saw particularly in the fourth quarter. As far as our outlook for 2009, we remain targeting a small, a solid single-digit growth. I think originally our &#x2013; what, did you say seven to nine. I think if you gave yourself a range of six to nine, we'd feel pretty comfortable with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And work down on raw materials, Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the low raw material costs are clearly starting to come through at the moment. We've seen -- we have the opportunity to lock in benzene for first quarter and second quarter at fairly low prices, often at or below the naphtha prices. Our overall average crude oil assumption for the year is about $52 a barrel. And so in quarter one, we expect relief coming from that. For the full year, if you were to take that $52 assumption, that would be a benefit of greater than &#x20AC;1 billion below 2008 in terms of total raw material spending including energy.</p>

          <p>Okay. And that's actually the add-on question. Historically you spoke that 30% of your business is not very price and commodity-price driven, meaning obviously in the upturns you lost always on the margin side. Do you believe now you can perhaps benefit on the downturn here if the raw material costs probably 30%?</p>

          <p>Yeah, in some respect, yes. It depends upon the end-use market. In the coatings market where it doesn't relate directly to the furniture industry or the automotive industry then that is true. And for the specialized systems where they do not relate to the automotive and furniture market that is also true. So it's roughly half of that 30% is more secure than the other half. But that's because the other half is specialties that go into the furniture industry and into the automotive industry.</p>
