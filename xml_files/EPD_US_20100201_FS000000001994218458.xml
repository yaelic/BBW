          <p>Thank you, Celeste .  Good morning, and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners and Duncan Energy Partners conference call to discuss fourth quarter earnings. Our speakers today will be Mike Creel, President and CEO of Enterprise's General Partner, followed by Jim Teague, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Then Randy Fowler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will follow Jim, and then Hank Bachmann, President and CEO of Duncan Energy Partners General Partner will be our last speaker. Also in attendance for the call today is Dan Duncan, our Chairman, as well as other members of our senior management team. Afterward, we will open the call up for your questions.</p>
          <p>During this call, we will make forward-looking statement within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company as well as assumptions made by information currently available to Enterprise's management team. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, they can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer our latest filings with Securities and Exchange Commission for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike Creel.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Randy. Good morning and thanks for joining us today. Being mindful of your time and your interest in the current business environment, as well as our growth opportunities, we're going to limit our discussion of items that are covered in detail in our earnings press release this morning. If you have questions on these items, obviously we'll be happy to address them in the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>We're pleased to report another quarter of strong operating and financial results supported by record NGL, crude oil and petrochemical transportation volumes; record equity NGL production and fractionation volumes and increased natural gas transportation volumes. We continue to benefit from our large geographical footprint and our diverse portfolio of integrated businesses that generated record gross operating margin and distributable cash flow for 2009. Based on our continued strong performance, the Board approved an increase in the quarterly cash distribution rate to $0.56 per unit, a 5.7% increase over the rate paid with respect to the fourth quarter of 2008, and our 22nd consecutive quarterly distribution increase.</p>
          <p>Enterprise generated distributable cash flow of $570 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, providing 1.5 times coverage of the distribution declared with respect to that quarter. We retained 164 million, or 29%, of the distributable cash flow for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Distributable cash flow for the year was a record $1.6 billion and provided 1.2 times coverage of the $2.20 per unit declared with respect to 2009, allowing us to retain $264 million for the full year for reinvestment in our business.</p>
          <p>Since our IPO in 1998, we've retained over $1.1 billion, or approximately 15% of the partnership's distributable cash flow. This compares to 783 million paid to our general partner over that same period. I'm not aware of any other MLP that has retained more cash than they paid to their general partner over such an extended period of time.</p>
          <p>We had a record gross operating margin of $865 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. This is a $214 million or 33% increase over the fourth quarter of 2008. Our NGL Pipelines and Services business was responsible for $157 million of this increase. This segment benefited from record NGL pipeline and fractionation volumes and record equity NGL production. Higher natural gas processing margins, increased demand for NGLs as a petrochemical feedstock over more costly crude-oil derivatives, profits from NGL sales that were completed in the fourth quarter and the settlement of the Mid-America rate case and demand for our NGL export facilities were among the key drivers.</p>
          <p>Fundamentals continue to be strong for this segment as we begin 2010. Industry NGL inventories are low, particularly ethane, and demand continues to be high, resulting in strong natural gas processing margins. Jim Teague will discuss this in more detail a bit later.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin for the Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines and Services segment declined $27 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to our Natural Gas Marketing business and lower gas gross operating margin from our San Juan, Val Verde and Carlsbad systems due to lower volumes and higher operating expenses. Our Natural Gas Marketing business was primarily impacted by demand charges for transportation and storage capacity in combination with unusually tight basis of natural gas prices across the country. Some of this will be recouped in the first quarter of 2010 as we deliver gas volumes we own from storage and recognize profits.</p>
          <p>Our Texas Intrastate System benefited from the Sherman Extension being in full service for the quarter, but this was partially offset by lower pipeline volumes. Gross operating margin for the Offshore Pipelines and Services segment increased by $44 million or 81%. This included $22 million of insurance recoveries related to hurricanes and the flex joint repair at Independence Hub and a $28 million increase in gross operating margin from our offshore crude oil pipelines. The improvement in the results of our offshore crude oil pipelines was primarily attributable to the Shenzi Pipeline which began operations in April of 2009 and the restoration of service by crude oil pipelines that were negatively affected in the fourth quarter due to Hurricane Ike.</p>
          <p>The Petrochemical and Refined Products segment reported a $25 million or a 30% increase in gross operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2009. Our Refined Products Pipelines and Octane Enhancement business were responsible for most of this increase. Our Butane Isomerization and Propylene Fractionation business has also had solid quarters.</p>
          <p>The integration of the former TEPPCO businesses has gone well with almost all of the management and organizational changes being completed within a week of the merger. We previously stated that we expected about $20 million of immediate synergies almost exclusively from the elimination of redundant public company costs. In addition, we have taken action to capture approximately $35 million per year of opportunities to either increase revenues or reduce expenses that had not been previously identified, including revising tariffs on the Enterprise Refined Products Pipeline System, electing to process certain volumes of natural gas on the Val Verde system and realizing lower interest costs on the $1.1 billion of debt we issued in October of last year.</p>
          <p>We believe there are more commercial opportunities available to us than would have been &#x2013; that would have been difficult to capitalize upon prior to the merger. We also believe that TEPPCO assets will provide additional growth opportunities as we seek to expand their scope and scale.</p>
          <p>Combining our $164 million of retained distributable cash flow from the fourth quarter of 2009 with the proceeds from our equity offering in the first week of January, we're in a strong position to begin funding our capital investments in 2010 with approximately $2 billion of liquidity.</p>
          <p>Our Board adopted equity ownership guidelines effective January first of this year that require our directors and executive officers to own significant amounts of Enterprise common units within three years. Most, if not all of our executive officers, probably already meet this requirement, but the Board and management felt it was important to show our commitment to our continued ownership of equity in the partnership to reinforce our alignment of interest with those of our public unit holders.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Jim, I'd like to say once again how pleased we are with the strong results for the quarter and for 2009. Our employees have done an outstanding job in a stressful business and economic environment, and the Enterprise management team has done a remarkable job of quickly and efficiently integrating the TEPPCO businesses within Enterprise.</p>
          <p>We believe for the foreseeable future we have great opportunities to deploy capital to expand our integrated midstream system, including 48,000 miles of pipeline, through organic growth. We believe organic growth will continue to offer greater returns on capital than acquisitions of discrete assets. Recently we were told there are 24 private equity teams chasing acquisitions in the midstream space. It sounds like the acquisition market is going to be expensive again and probably will rely on leveraged returns. We believe our focus on the organic growth available to us around our system and managing our cash cost of capital will continue to enable us to provide our partners with growth and distributable cash flow per unit.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike. What a difference a year makes. This time last year, when we were reviewing December 2008 and the fourth quarter of 2008, we were faced with a WTI crude price of $41; Henry Hub natural gas at 5.80, or 81% of crude, on a BTU basis. In December of 2008 the annualized production of ethylene from U.S. ethylene producers was 34 billion pounds, as low as I've seen it in 20 years. They were consuming 546,000 barrels a day of ethane, a total of 700,000 barrels a day of total NGLs. Ethane was selling at $0.355 a gallon. Our processing margin was &#x2013; at Meeker was $0.04 and were in rejection much of the month of December of '08 and ethane inventories were growing rapidly.</p>
          <p>As we come out of December of '09, we came out of a period where natural gas was selling relative to crude oil at 41%. Ethylene annualized production the month of December was at 51 billion pounds. And ethane use in petrochemicals was 840,000 barrels a day. Total NGL use almost 1.3 million barrels a day. Our processing margin at Meeker on ethane was $0.50 a gallon and ethane inventories were being drawn dramatically reflecting the fact that petrochemicals were consuming more than the U.S. NGL business could produce.</p>
          <p>We believe changes in the price relationships of crude oil, crude oil derivatives, natural gas and NGLs in the past year have led to a long-term structural change in the petrochemical industry. Natural gas and NGLs enjoy a significant price advantage over more costly crude oil derived feed stocks. This has been driven by a decline in global crude oil production, more acreage being off limits to the private E&amp;P sector, geopolitical risk, growing demand for crude by China and other developing nations, the globalization of natural gas prices and more LNG facilities becoming operational, and in my mind, most importantly, the technological breakthroughs around the development of natural gas shale plays in the U.S.</p>
          <p>For U.S. producers, this has meant that ethane and propane were their most consistently profitable feedstocks in 2009 and are forecasted to be so this year. The feedstock cost advantage and a weak U.S. dollar provided U.S. ethylene producers with a competitive advantage globally, especially relative to naphtha crackers in Europe and Asia. According to CMAI, approximately 24% of 2009 production, domestic production, of high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene and PBC were for the export market.</p>
          <p>U.S. ethylene producers responded. They rationalized some of their facilities and invested capital to modify their traditional naphtha crackers &#x2013; cracking furnaces, to crack more NGL feedstocks. We estimate that domestic crackers are in the process or have added approximately 100,000 barrels a day of new capacity to crack ethane and propane through modifications to their traditional naphtha cracking furnaces. We work closely with these customers to provide them with incremental supplies of ethane and propane and related logistical services.</p>
          <p>In addition, the international ethylene crackers have reacted to the NGL feedstock cost advantage by importing LPG to traditional NAFTA crackers. Since July of last year, our LPG export terminal in the Houston Ship Channel has been fully utilized, exporting approximately three million barrels per month of LPG, primarily propane, that either directly or indirectly supplied a portion of traditional NAFTA crackers use or substitution of LPG to other parts of the world.</p>
          <p>Export ethylene derivative demand remains strong in early 2010, but as Middle East production increases, U.S. export volumes are expected to slip. Chemical margins in the U.S. are forecast to compress due to increased competition, but overall demand for domestically produced ethylene is only expected to slip about 1.5% in 2010, according to CMAI, and then increase almost 2.5% back to 50 billion pounds a year or greater in 2011. With the global recession abating, domestic demand is forecast to increase, consuming the production that was going overseas in 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p>The new ethylene capacity in the Middle East has received a lot of attention due to the low-cost feedstock advantage over production in other regions. Along with a low-cost stranded ethane however, a significant amount of propane and heavier feedstocks, primarily natural gasoline, will also be used by the Middle East crackers. Those feeds are actively exported and are valued to those Middle East crackers based on international pricing. As a result, Middle East propane feedstock costs are significantly higher than cracking stranded ethane and are nearly at parity with U.S. ethane cracking economics, according to CMAI. Middle East production will undoubtedly affect U.S. crackers, but we believe the cost advantage of cracking light feedstocks, the return of domestic demand growth and our continued competitive position in the international market place will keep U.S. ethylene production steady to growing over the coming years.</p>
          <p>We at Enterprise are well-positioned to help the U.S. chemical industry remain competitive by providing reliable NGL feedstock supplies and services. We are planning for the future by increasing our frac capacity, expanding our natural gas pipeline and processing infrastructure and growing our distribution networks.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, ethylene plants operated at an annual on-production rate of approximately 52 billion pounds, which equals the average production rate for the last five years. Ethane demand was approximately 860,000 barrels a day for the fourth quarter, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2000. We project daily ethane volumes could be up to 900,000 barrels per day, and we've already seen it happen a few days in January. We think there is a 30 to 40,000 barrel per day shortfall between current NGL production and cracker demand. Consequently this is pulling ethane inventories down rapidly.</p>
          <p>Fractionation capacity remains tight. Our fractionators at Mont Belvieu and at Hobbs are running at full capacity, with overflow volumes going to our Louisiana fractionators. Our fractionation volumes have increased by more than 50% over the last three years, and additional capacity will be needed to accommodate NGL volume growth expected from emerging shale plays.</p>
          <p>We announced construction of a new 75,000 barrel per day fractionator at Mont Belvieu, similar to one we build at Hobbs in 2008. Construction of that fractionator should be completed this time next year. Additional capacity may be needed to accommodate incremental volumes that we see from production out of the Eagle Ford Shale play in South Texas.</p>
          <p>A question we've frequently gotten from our investors over the last nine months has been, "What have you done to hedge natural gas processing margins for 2010?" The issue that has frustrated our efforts for 2010 is that forward natural gas prices have typically been in contango, while forward NGL prices have been backwardated, which compresses that forward processing spread. Then when the production month arrives, the natural gas processing spread increases, either because natural gas goes down or NGL prices go up.</p>
          <p>We made the decision that we were going to be patient, waiting for opportunities to hedge. That patience has begun to pay off. Recently we took advantage to hedge approximately 28% of our 2010 equity NGL production at attractive levels. Most was for this first and second quarters. Approximately 25% of our Rockies Key Hole production has been hedged at a gross margin of around $0.60 a gallon. About 43% of our percent of liquids production has been hedged at NGL prices averaging between $1.25 and $1.30, with about half of those barrels being hedged being butanes and natural gasoline. We're going to continue to be patient, continue to look for opportunities to put on additional hedges.</p>
          <p>We're also excited about our Haynesville extension pipeline we announced last October. Originally it was designed as a 36 inch, 1.4 Bcf a day natural gas pipeline to extend our Acadian system into the Haynesville Shale play in North Louisiana. However the amount of long-term commitments we received exceeded the capacity of the 36-inch line. So in December, we announced we would increase the size of the extension up to 42 inches, with an ultimate capacity approaching 2.1 Bcf a day.</p>
          <p>With the Haynesville extension serving as a backbone trunk line through the heart of the play, we believe more producers will come to us to provide them transportation, gathering and treating services. We also have the flexibility to provide producers northbound capacity on the 42-in extension to reach the corridor of competing pipelines going east to Perryville, on which many producers have commitments.</p>
          <p>More importantly we provide producers with exclusive southbound capacity to get them to the Perryville pipe as well as other pipe in South Louisiana such as Florida Gas, Transco, TEPPCO, as well as in-use markets in South Louisiana. We think this will provide producers with higher net-backs because we think there's going to be a glut of gas at Perryville. We also believe producers like the flow assurance offered by this pipe by directly connecting to the Mississippi River corridor industrial market. We expect to complete this pipeline in September of 2011.</p>
          <p>Another exciting area is the emerging Eagle Ford Shale play in South Texas. We have an extensive network of natural gas, NGL and crude oil assets in this region, including pipe that goes through the heart of the play. Our goal is to participate in all aspects of the Eagle Ford, rich and lean gas, crude oil and condensate. We have already completed approximately $60 million of projects that will bring 300 million cubic feet a day of Eagle Ford natural gas into our system and top off our South Texas natural gas processing plants.</p>
          <p>We're now proceeding with a 34-mile, 24-inch diameter pipe, which is the first segment of a major east-west Eagle Ford Shale mainline. The Eagle Ford is more than a natural gas play. It'll produce NGLs, crude oil and condensate. Some of the gas will be extremely rich, averaging four to nine gallons of liquids per Mcf. This gas will need to be processed and NGLs will need to be fractionated and transported to market. We will be incrementally expanding our system to provide midstream services. They key will be to stay ahead of the producers who have had early success, and in some cases, are accelerating their drilling programs. We're evaluating the needing and timing for additional NGL gas pipeline and processing and NGL pipeline infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Earlier Mike mentioned the commercial opportunities from the integration of the TEPPCO businesses. We hit the ground running after the merger closed. We incorporated our value chain philosophy around TEPPCOs businesses and assets. As Mike mentioned, we have had early success, but we believe there is much more to come. We realized as we put this together that we needed additional expertise to run and expand some of the TEPPCO businesses.</p>
          <p>In January, Mark Hurley has agreed to join us as senior vice president of our onshore and offshore crude oil transportation and storage assets, as well as our offshore platforms and natural gas pipelines. Mark has a great reputation in our industry and he's going to fit in great with our team of result oriented culture. Mike has served &#x2013; Mark has served as President of Shell Pipeline Company from 2005 to 2009. His understanding of all aspects of the crude business and his knowledge in natural gas, NGLs, petrochemicals and refined products will be important as we look to capitalize on new opportunities. Mark will be on board March the 2nd. As you can tell, we're pretty excited about our prospects in continuing to grow Enterprise.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to Randy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim. I'll briefly discuss some noteworthy income, liquidity and capitalization items. As Mike mentioned, I will skip items where we provided detail or variance analysis in the press release. If you have any questions, we'll cover those in Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A expense for the entire year of 2009 increased by $35 million to $172 million on a recast basis. Approximately 28% of this increase was merger-related costs incurred by both Enterprise and TEPPCO. The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2009 was a benefit of $1.5 million compared to a tax expense of $11 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Accruals for the Texas margin tax decreased by $11 million this quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 due to less earnings being attributable to Texas.</p>
          <p>We expect to invest approximately $1.5 billion for growth capital expenditures and another $250 million on sustaining capital expenditures in 2010. Some of the larger approved capital projects for 2010 include the Haynesville extension, the Mont Belvieu NGL fractionator, the Trinity River Basin lateral and projects in the Eagle Ford. We expect sustaining capital expenditures will be abnormally high in 2010. This is mainly related to some larger pipeline integrity projects including $17 million for the Tri-States NGL pipeline and as well as $6 million to build a new substation in Baytown. We expect 2011 sustaining capital expenditures to return to a more normalized level of 210 to $220 million. Of note, if you look at Enterprise and TEPPCO capital expenditures in 2008, sustaining capital expenditures, they were approximately $235 million.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ended December 31, 2009 was $2.7 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA less equity earnings plus actual cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates. Our consolidated leverage ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA for December 31, 2009 was 3.9 times, with debt being adjusted by 50% for the equity content in the hybrid junior subordinated debt securities. Our floating interest rate exposure was approximately 12% at the end of the fourth quarter. This is a little lower than our typical high teens to 20% level due to the application of proceeds we received from our recent equity offering and working capital that was returned to us in the fourth quarter as forward sales of natural gas liquids were settled.</p>
          <p>The average line of our debt was nine years which incorporates the first call date for the hybrids, and our effective interest cost of debt was 6.1%. We have $554 million of debt maturing in 2010, which include a 54 million 8.7% note due March 1, and a 500 million 4.95% senior note due in June 2010. As Mike mentioned, we had liquidity of approximately $2 billion to begin 2010.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Hank Bachmann to discuss Duncan Energy Partners' quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Randy. I'm pleased to report record results for Duncan Energy Partners in 2009, our second full year of operation, supported by yet another quarter of strong operating and financial performance from our businesses.</p>
          <p>At the time of our IPO in 2007, we told prospective investors that we expected our annual cash distribution growth rate to range from two to 3%, and a year later, at the time of our second dropdown transaction in December 2008, we stated that we expected our annual distribution growth rate to be around 3%. This year we were able to exceed both of these goals by increasing the cash distributions declared with respect to 2009 by 4.3% over those declared for 2008.</p>
          <p>In 2009 our partnership benefited from cash flow generated by the DEP II businesses, which we acquired from Enterprise Products in our second dropdown transaction in December 2008. In 2009 these businesses generated $86.5 million of distributable cash flow, or an average of $21.6 million per quarter based on our 11.85% preferred return in 2009, which will increase by 2%, 12.09%, for 2010. As a result of our increased preferred return in 2010, on our $730 million investment in the DEP II midstream businesses, we expect to receive distributable cash flow from these businesses of at least $22 million each quarter in 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning to our fourth quarter 2009 results, we reported net income attributable to Duncan Energy Partners of $23.2 million or $0.40 per common unit on a fully diluted basis, compared to $10.7 million or $0.39 per common unit on a fully diluted basis for the fourth quarter of 2008. The DEP II midstream businesses contributed earnings of $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. It should be noted that the fourth quarter 2008 results for the DEP II businesses included only the 24-day period from the closing date of December of the DEP II dropdown transaction, December 8, to December 31, 2008.</p>
          <p>Distributable cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased to $34.5 million from $15.6 million for the fourth quarter last year, again resulting primarily from the $16 million increase in cash distributions received from the DEP II businesses, which we owned for the entire fourth quarter of 2009 versus only 24 days in the fourth quarter of 2008. On January 12, 2010, the Board of Directors of DEP's general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution rate of $0.445 per common unit, which represents a 4.1% increase from the $0.4275 per common unit paid with respect to the fourth quarter of 2008, and represents the fifth consecutive increase in the quarterly cash distributions paid to our partners. Distributable cash flow for the quarter provided 1.3 times coverage of this increased cash distribution.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to briefly discuss the performance of our segments in the fourth quarter of 2009. Gross operating margin from our onshore Natural Gas Pipeline business segment for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 16% quarter-over-quarter to $38.7 million from $33.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. The partnership's Texas Intrastate System contributed $3.4 million to the quarter-to-quarter increase, primarily as a result of higher firm capacity reservation fees from the Sherman Extension pipeline, which began full commercial service in August 2009. This was partially offset by lower revenues from a decrease in firm and interruptable transportation volumes on the remainder of the Texas Intrastate pipeline.</p>
          <p>Earlier, Jim mentioned the Haynesville Extension pipeline and the increase in the pipeline's capacity to 2.1 Bcf per day. We're very excited about this project and the fact that we are the only natural gas takeaway route south out of the Haynesville Shale play. This extension of our Acadian system will provide shippers access to the end user markets along the Mississippi River corridor and into nine other intrastate pipelines. Natural gas being shipped on the Haynesville extension pipeline will also have access to Acadian's rapid-cycle salt dome storage cavern located near Napoleonville, Louisiana and can be physically delivered into the Henry Hub via our Acadian pipeline system. We believe that this pipeline extension project will help to continue our growth for years to come.</p>
          <p>Our NGL Pipelines and Services business segment reported gross operating margin of $30.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $25.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. After adjusting for measurement gains and losses associated with the partnership's Mont Belvieu NGL and petrochemical storage complex, gross operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased to $30 million from $28.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase is primarily attributable to higher fees and volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, operational measurement gains and losses at our Mont Belvieu storage complex are allocated to Enterprise and are reflected on our financial statements as an adjustment to non-controlling interests.</p>
          <p>NGL transportation volumes decreased to 110,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2009, from 124,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2008, and NGL fractionation volumes were 4,000 barrels per day lower for the fourth quarter of 2009 versus the same quarter of 2008. These decreases were primarily associated with production declines from conventional natural gas production in South Texas. We believe these declines will be short-lived as rich Eagle Ford Shale volumes begin to ramp up.</p>
          <p>Our Petrochemical Services business segment reported a slight increase in gross operating margin to $2.6 million for the fourth quarter. General and administrative expenses were $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, $1.8 million lower than the G&amp;A expense reported in the fourth quarter of 2008. This was primarily due to higher costs for outside professional services in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the drop-down transaction that we did in December of '08. Sustaining capital expenditures were $11.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $15.7 million spent in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year we spent $48.4 million in sustaining capital expenditures compared to $54.2 million spent in 2008. Approximately $35 million of the $48.4 million was for the DEP II businesses, and as a result, had less of an effect on our distributable cash flows because of our preference return.</p>
          <p>For 2010 we expect sustaining capital expenditures to be approximately $55 million, with the split between the DEP I and DEP II businesses being approximately $20 million and $35 million, respectively. We had total liquidity of approximately $120 million at December 31, 2009, which includes cash and availability under our revolving credit facility.</p>
          <p>In closing, we were pleased with the performance of our businesses and the record distributable cash flow generated by the partnership, which provided solid coverage of the cash distributions declared in 2009. We are excited about the prospect of additional cash flows being generated from our Haynesville Extension project pipeline &#x2013; pipeline project beginning in 2011, and continued strong performance of our existing assets in 2010 to support future increases in the cash distributions to our partners. And as I've said in the last few quarters, we are pleased to report yet another quarter of solid results and strong coverage of the cash distributions paid to our partners.</p>
          <p>Randy, we are now ready to take questions on Enterprise or Duncan Energy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Very solid quarter. The Eagle Ford Shale appears to be developing in a very favorable way, and I was just wondering what additional investment opportunities you see developing in that region beyond the projects that you announced. For example, do you see many opportunities to expand the crude oil infrastructure? Or is it mainly natural gas and NGL?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as Jim said, we see opportunities in all areas including the dry and the rich gas, and we're looking at developing our system into a dry system and a wet system to accommodate both streams, but also crude and condensate to the extent that we can attract producers. We certainly have assets that we think are in the right position. We're ready, willing and able to spend money to expand the system to accommodate their needs. Jim, anything else to add?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then second, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on, kind of provide an update on the Acadian gas pipeline, how that project, the development and the financing is being shared between say Enterprise and Duncan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, at this point in time, we're still evaluating that split. I mean Duncan Energy owns 66% of Acadian, and EPD owns 34%. So I mean it's a good project, and we think good projects are easy to finance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, one of the things that because of the ownership of the pipeline between Duncan Energy Partners and Enterprise, it's one of those where we will likely get the audit committees of both partnerships involved to make sure that we get the unit holders are protected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly, the 1.5 billion capital budget for 2010, I was just wondering if you're able to kind of break that out in a little more detail by project and then how that will be spent over the next 12 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't break it out by project. We have in a couple of the press releases talked about some of our chunkier projects, but the capital will be spent fairly ratably over that time period. Maybe a little bit more in the first and second quarters than in the third and fourth. But I'd caution you that that $1.5 million that we refer to is really our projects that we've already approved and that we're committed to. That does not include new projects that we may find over the course of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Seems like you're making good progress with the TEPPCO integration. Can you give a little color as to what kind of commercial opportunities do you see? Is it in crude oil marketing and storage? Or can you provide a little more color?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let me let Jim answer that, but I'll just say on the front end that, from our standpoint, TEPPCO was a bit constrained because of their lack of financial wherewithal to grow their businesses. And, as we've said before, we have that value-chain approach, and we're looking to apply that to all of the TEPPCO businesses, including the crude oil and refined products business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you said it; we see opportunities for growth in the refined products sector. We've brought some people in. We mentioned, Mike, earlier that we brought in in crude oil, but we've brought in some people on the refined products side working for Lynn Bourdon to take a look at that and try to extend that value chain. We see crude as an area that we want to grow. We see some opportunities to tie in what Enterprise has with what TEPPCO has to create more of a value chain. So we're going to be pretty focused on the crude section as well as the refined products area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And looking at the Haynesville Extension, is the cost estimate still what you believed originally? And can you give a little detail as to what kind of contracts you have with your contractors? Are they fixed-price contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll jump in. The cost estimate and everything, we haven't given out a firm number, but we're still on target and plan with where our original intentions were. All the contracts that we have in place with the seven different producers are 10-year agreements, all demand charges with very little commodity, more of the inter-state model. It's about 98% demand, one or 2% commodity related, but they're all 10-year firm agreements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But your costs for steel and labor, are those, your agreements with the contractors, are they fixed price or are they to control your costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as controlling the costs, we have all the steel bought at this point in time. We just bought the last segment of steel here last week, in fact. Prices came in surprisingly under what we expected, even in the AFE. So our steel prices are all locked in, and we're very happy with what our price of steel is. We've got the engineering contractors and right-of-way contractors in on the project as it speaks. We have not yet bid out the actual construction and instillation. We'll be doing that as the year goes on, and obviously trying to get some fixed price costs on those.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, at the moment we're still seeing volumes which are running about 700 to 15 million cubic foot a day. The anticipation is from the producer that there's continue to work over a couple of wells after the first quarter, so it should be second quarter to mid year. And hopefully they're still looking at developing a few wells that they have development plans on toward the end of the year, but our anticipation is that it should stay around the 700, potentially declining a small bit toward the end of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot, Jim, for the detail on NGL. That was much appreciated, and I have a question on that. I thought you talked about at one point chemical margins possibly compressing a little bit this year, and then I think you said demand slipping a little bit in 2010 on ethylene of 1.5%. I guess my question is am I right on that? What is driving that? And what do you think the impact if any on NGL price is for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You're right on that. And that's according to &#x2013; Steve, that's according to CMAI. We subscribe to them as do most of the petrochemical industry. CMAI is forecasting that you will see some compression on things like low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene as Middle East crackers come on-stream that are scheduled to come online this year, but that the impact on the U.S. will only be about a 1.5% shrink. In terms of NGL prices, the fact is the petrochemical industry has been drawing inventory pretty dramatically, primarily on ethane, because they're using more than we're producing.</p>
          <p>We still think that they're going to use north of 800,000 barrels a day as long as ethane is preferred and we expect it to continue to be preferred. Use of that level of volume &#x2013; they're using what we produce. And we really don't see a heck of a lot of downside on our ethane margins for the balance of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Switching quickly to the Onshore Natural Gas Pipeline segment, you saw a little bit of volume growth during the quarter, but obviously operating margins slipped a little bit. Can you just elaborate as to why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The volume growth was up in more of the White River Hub and due to the stuff out in the Rockies related to &#x2013; which is a very low margin- oriented business. It's a $0.015 kind of throughput rate. With regards to South Texas, we experienced some pretty good declines down there in the conventional wells, as Hank talked about in his comments &#x2013; close to 15 to 20%.</p>
          <p>So what offset part of that in Texas was the expansion of the Sherman lateral coming on service and getting the flows and the demand dollars coming in from there. So that didn't volumetrically flow as much, but we got the demand dollars coming in off the Sherman.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've not announced how much of that's submitted. We do have contracts with seven chippers. We have some capacity left. Frankly we're not in a rush to sell that. The project's not scheduled to go into service until September or so of 2011, so we think we're in a great position.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. Just a couple quick questions, the first for you, Jim. On your 2010 equity NGL hedges, you mentioned that you don't see a lot of downside on ethane margins this year, and we tend to agree with you, if NGL frac volumes and NGL production continue to run at record levels. How do you balance layering in additional hedges versus keeping spot exposure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll look at Dan and if he winks, I hedge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Darren, I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that we're pretty conservative by nature. When we see spreads that we think are attractive, we're going to take advantage of that to reduce volatility in the partnership's cash flow. We hedged in 2008 and 2009. We did not hedge at the peak of prices for those years, but we think we're doing the right thing by our unit holders by taking a conservative approach and not trying to guess where the peak is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Jim, you mentioned about 100,000 barrels of capacity that is moved over to crack the light ends. How much incremental capacity, do you think from this point forward, can convert from cracking heavies to lights?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I did &#x2013; I saw something that InVantage put out recently, and that's a consultant we use pretty often. And I think what they said is that of the say 60 billion pounds of ethylene producing capacity, about 53 billion pounds had the wherewithal to use some NGLs. I mean some of them can use normal butane. Most of them can use ethane and propane, but there's probably about, what is that, seven billion pounds a year of additional capacity that's still restricted to naphtha type crude oil derived feed stocks.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I appreciate the color. And then just one final question more housekeeping in nature. Similar to what was realized in the fourth quarter, have you taken ownership of any NGLs and sold them forward for delivery? And if so, how much?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, going back to your comments on looks like you're going to be favoring organic growth over acquisitions. Can you just talk about overall the portfolio what types of the returns you'd expect on your organic capital? And then contrast that with what you're seeing in the acquisition market in terms of EBITDA multiple?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's kind of hard to say what the current acquisition market's going for, but with 24 private equity players and a lot of MLPs that don't have a lot of organic growth prospects, you'd think it would tend to get kind of frothy again. Just in terms of the returns that we expect to see on our projects, probably no different than what we expected over the last several years. When you have a regulated pipeline that is contracted, stable cash flows, you're going to be looking in the low double-digits. Some of our processing and fractionation assets discreetly might be in the mid-teens, but again, when you couple that with our downstream assets, then you can get some pretty robust returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question was just on the Marine Transportation business that came along with the TEPPCO assets; the fundamentals have obviously been under pressure in that business. Can you just talk about your thoughts longer-term and is that a business you look to grow, shrink, maintain, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is definitely an area that we expect to grow. I think under TEPPCO, again, they were a bit constrained by liquidity. Our view is, again, trying to integrate that into the Enterprise businesses, including those TEPPCO businesses that we acquired, we think that it could be a very interesting fit for our NGL marketing business, for our crude business as we continue to expand that, as well as refined Products. We are looking at ways to integrate that and to create more value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, this is Dan, I'd like to comment on the TEPPCO deal too. The people in TEPPCO, along with the offshore side of the deal in the question that you just asked, they were not only restrained in their ability to raise capital, but their cost of capital was a good bit higher in the 10, 15, 20% more cost of capital than the Enterprise cost of capital is. So that was another big difference that restrained TEPPCO.</p>
          <p>Even with exactly the same people, Enterprise would have a bigger growth area to grow into and get a better return than TEPPCO would have had. And that was one of the reasons for the merger being put together is to capture the cost of capital at the lowest cost of capital of all our products. And that's the same reason that DEP was formed is to be able to have a lower cost of capital than most of our peer group, if not the best cost of capital of anybody in the peer group deal because of our high spreads cut-off at 25%, because of DEP has no high split at all. So we look at our total cost of capital on determining what asset goes where and how do we capitalize that asset and especially the returns.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. The question relates to DEP, just looking at the maintenance CapEx guidance for next year, can you just comment on the increase for DEP I?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I guess just looking at the distribution growth at DEP, you have a pretty strong coverage ratio. What are your thoughts in terms of accelerating distribution growth? Or are you comfortable at the three to 4% range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think to be honest, I think right now we're comfortable with the three to 4% range. We do have some small capital projects that we need to use some of our excess distributable cash flow for, so again we want to run a conservative model and make sure that we have liquidity to be able to pay for our capital projects, which again will be helped I think also by our distribution reinvestment program, which comes into being this month.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe it's about $15 million, $16 million this year, primarily in NGL Pipelines and Services segment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Dan Duncan again. I would like to also comment on our distribution policy that we kind of set up with all the companies. We look at, we're always looking three, five, 10 years out, and we want to make sure that we hopefully never have to cut our distribution. We're looking for long-term growth deals, and basically, we are conservative on the amount of cash that we put out for distributable cash flow.</p>
          <p>And it's the usual deal that we've talked about over the last 10, 11 or 12 years, that if we can hold, if we're consistent with our distribution increases on all of the Enterprise companies, and if we can hold those to a consistent increase every year, which is what we've tried to do, then we feel that long range, if people, the unit holder that stays with us long range, rather than one or two years, will come out ahead by us holding back some of the distributions that most other MLPs distribute out, mainly because they want to put as much as they can into their general partner MLP side rather than going back into the unit holders. And we have no problem with their concept. We just operate with a different concept.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the, if maybe Jim could give a little more details on the Eagle Ford Shale opportunity as far as NGL volumes? About what you expect to get out of it and as far as timing goes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things we have here is we have a reservoir group that frankly, are quite conservative, and I've been a little bit surprised that they seem to have lost some of their conservative nature as it relates to the Eagle Ford, so in that respect we're pretty excited. We know exactly what we want to do in the Eagle Ford as production develops. We know, for example, that market is well-served on liquids. Liquids aren't going to stay down in South Texas; they're going to have to be moved out. We know exactly what we need to do to move that out, if the production reflects the need to do that or supports that.</p>
          <p>On the crude oil side, we know exactly what we want to do. We're in active negotiations with producers, and we expect some of those projects to come to fruition. We think if what we see developing materializes, you could very well have another frac expansion at Mont Belvieu supported by Eagle Ford production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the key is, that it's not entirely up to us, it's up to the producers that own the production, and it's our job to build the facilities and be the best service providers so that we're the logical choice when it comes to servicing their production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I understand. We're just trying to do more &#x2013; a job, a better job of modeling it out. I realize it's a bit of a moving target here. Okay. And then for Randy. You mentioned floating rate debt is &#x2013; it's only about 12%. You're normally about 20. So do you expect an increased amount of floating rate debt, I guess particularly when some of these issues are coming due this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, I think just as we spend capital this year and certainly with the small note issue that comes due in March, we'll just finance that with borrowings on the credit facility and that will increase the floating exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The real question I've got here is it looks like you're using some of your Louisiana fractionation capacity as excess capacity when things get full in the Gulf. If you can speak to what kind of capacity utilization you are on the Louisiana fractionators. How you kind of think about that business. And second of all...</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're breaking up a little bit, but are you asking what our capacity utilization is on our fracs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in Louisiana. And also how Haynesville Extension might impact any of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the Haynesville probably won't impact it, because it's dry gas. So there's not many, there's not liquids that come out of that. I don't know. We're moving, I guess I can say what we're moving. We're moving on average probably &#x2013; what is it, Randy &#x2013; 50,000 barrels a day to Louisiana that we're primarily topping off Promix and Norco with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you got plenty. I mean do you have plenty of capacity in Louisiana to continue to do that on an as-needed basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We're in pretty good shape.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For now. I mean we do have some projects, the Anaconda Extension, that we're looking at, and depending on what happens with McMoRan and their production, we could be seeing some big changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've got some things going on. I guess it's, yes, we're in pretty good shape. We twitch every once in a while. But we manage to get it done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ross, this is Dan again. We feel, and Jim and them feel and his people feel along with Rudy Nix who's in charge of that particular phase of the business, that in the range of 50,000 barrels a day will keep our Texas, all of our product from the Rockies, South Texas and all of the rest of Texas for this year.</p>
          <p>We think by, hopefully, January or late, early February, we'll have the 75,000 or really an 80,000 barrel a day fractionators, new fractionators at Belvieu, and that gives us an additional &#x2013; at that time we back all of the product back into Texas, and we still have the 50 to 60,000 barrels a day fractionation that's available in Louisiana.</p>
          <p>On top of that, if we need to, we can go into Dow Chemical's 50% of Promix and pick up another 20 or 30,000 barrels a day by using Dow's portion of the Promix field. So theoretically, we feel that we can go through this year and through the next couple of years, and we're also expanding our Texas to Louisiana pipeline of what, Rudy, by 25,000 barrels a day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we went from about 65,000 barrels a day; now we'll be doing about 83 to 87,000 barrels a day by late March.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we feel definitely this year and the forward year, we can stay ahead of the game on the fractionation. We also have heard that Targa is expanding their fractionator to take care of some one-off volume coming down from Oklahoma. So we think the industry is in real good shape to handle all the new volume coming on.</p>
