        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ken. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on US dollar growth rate, unless otherwise stated.</p>
          <p>This quarter, foreign exchange rates were not much of a factor in our overall results compared to our guidance of a 3% benefit to new license revenue and a 4% benefit to total revenue. Even with the currency tailwind being less than anticipated, we were at the high end of our guidance range for total revenue and we beat our guidance ranges for new license revenue and EPS with record earnings per share this quarter. On a constant dollar basis, we beat our guidance ranges for new license revenue, total revenue and earnings per share. In short, Q4 was an excellent quarter for Oracle.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, new software license revenues were $3.1 billion, up 14%. The Americas grew 28%, EMEA was down 3% in US dollars and up 4% in constant dollars, and Asia was up 15%. Our results continue to underscore the strength, balance and diversity of our business; and the quarter was not dependent on any unusually large deals.</p>
          <p>Technology new license revenues were $2.3 billion, up 18% as the Americas grew 34%. EMEA was down 1% in US dollars and up 6% in constant dollars, and Asia was up 19%. Applications new license revenues were $855 million, up 6% from last year. The Americas grew 16%, EMEA was down 7%, and Asia was up 2%. Our software license updates and product support revenues were $3.5 billion, up 13% from last year. Customer support attachment and renewal rates continue at near record levels.</p>
          <p>Revenues from our hardware systems products were $1.2 billion, while revenues from hardware system support were $688 million. Our services revenues were $1.1 billion, up 4% as we continue to manage this business to profitable margins.</p>
          <p>Our total revenues were $9.6 billion, up 40% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.4 billion, up 26%. The non-GAAP operating margin was 46% for the quarter. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 27.3%, as we saw some one-time benefits to our tax rate.</p>
          <p>Our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.60, $0.04 above the high end of our EPS guidance range of 52 to $0.56. Earnings per share were up 30% from last year.</p>
          <p>In Q4, we repurchased 10 million shares at an average price of $24.94 per share, for a total of $250 million. For the full year, we repurchased 43.3 million at an average price of 22.94 per share for a total of $993 million. As we have previously discussed, the rate of our stock buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account alternative uses for our cash and our stock price.</p>
          <p>Now, turning briefly to fiscal 2010 full year results. New software license revenues were $7.5 billion, up 6% for the year. The Americas were up 15%, EMEA down 5%, and Asia grew 4%. Technology new license revenues were $5.4 billion, up 6% while applications new license revenues were $2.1 billion, also up 6%.</p>
          <p>Software license updates and product support revenues totaled $13.2 billion, up 10%. Our total revenues were $27.0 billion, up 15%. Non-GAAP operating income was $12.5 billion, up 15%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 46%. Our fiscal 2010 non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.67, up 16% from last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, we have $18.5 billion in cash and investments. Our days sales outstanding improved again to 53 days compared to 58 days last year. And as a testament to the quality of our receivables, the quality of our customers, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. Finally, we generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow during the last four quarters, up 9% from last year.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to Safra.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. I'll briefly comment on our non-GAAP results for Q4, I'll then review guidance for Q1 and turn the call over to Larry. Obviously we're very pleased with our Q4 results and with our outstanding performance throughout the year. Our business is extremely healthy with substantial strength in database, middleware, apps and hardware. Our tech business highlighted by database was spectacular this quarter, with growth of 18%, including 34% growth in the Americas.</p>
          <p>Our applications business was also strong, with 5% growth over the last 12 months on a constant dollar basis, versus a negative 24% for SAP's four most recent quarters. Sun hardware systems revenue came in well, taking into account the fact that we already ended Sun's reselling of other company's products which had historically accounted for hundreds of millions of dollars a year in sales. This quarter we saw sales growth for Sun hardware products. In addition, our estimate for the Sun business contribution to operating income comes in at over 400 million for our first full quarter after the merger. This compares with a loss in Sun's quarter ending June of last year when Sun was an independent company.</p>
          <p>Now to get to that number, we've done some allocations for the quarter. And because a lot of our back office and software R&amp;D and software sales operations have already been integrated with Oracle's pre-merger teams, now in the coming quarter, some of the expense estimates may really be too difficult to make, but we will break out the revenues and the segregated expenses whenever possible for the remainder of this year. Clearly we continue to expect Sun's contribution to meet or exceed 1.5 billion for non-GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011, and 2 billion in fiscal '12.</p>
          <p>We've also made excellent progress with our supply chain efficiency efforts, as the non-GAAP gross margins for systems was 46%, much, much higher than the 33% we reported last quarter. And as a reminder, Sun's product gross margin, which included software margins, was 38% last year.</p>
          <p>In addition to our strong top line performance, we delivered very strong operating margins. With Sun included for the full quarter, our operating margin was 46%, substantially higher than our peers including IBM and SAP. Our 46% operating margin remains much higher than SAP's even though we are also selling hardware. Fiscal 2010 again demonstrates the strength of our diversified portfolio of enterprise products, the breadth and loyalty of our huge customer base and the strength of our operating model. The fact is we have a lot of company-specific momentum. We really executed well throughout the year and exceeded our own expectations quarter after quarter.</p>
          <p>Now before I turn to guidance for the upcoming year, let me just remind everyone that our plans for Sun is based on a more profit-aware model. As we've said a number of times, we are no longer selling products at a loss as Sun did. We are now compensating our sales teams on margin, not just revenue and this has the effect of changing the sales mix from systems where Sun lost money to value-added systems where Sun's differentiation is clear to our customers. These changes are allowing us to form a baseline for our hardware revenue and profitability at a level from which they can grow.</p>
          <p>So, let's get to the guidance. And we do believe that the guidance I'm giving today is conservative. I want to emphasize that our pipelines are very strong in both software and hardware. For the coming quarter, assuming the exchange rates remain at current levels, which right now is a negative 2% currency effect on license growth rate and a negative 3% effect on total revenue growth rate. With that, our guidance for Q1 is as follows.</p>
          <p>New software license revenue growth is expected to range from 4 to 14% in constant currency and 2 to 12% at current exchange rates. Hardware product revenues are expected to be around 1 billion in constant currency; that doesn't include the hardware support revenue. Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 44 to 48% in constant currency and 41 to 45% in current exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue from 42 to 46% in constant currency and 39 to 43 at current exchange rate.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be 36 to $0.38 in constant currency, up from $0,30 last year and from 35 to $0.37 assuming current exchange rates. GAAP EPS for the first quarter is expected to be 18 to $0.19 assuming constant currency and 17 to $0.18 using current exchange rates. This guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 33.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 28.5. Of course, it may end up being different.</p>
          <p>And lastly, the board again declared a dividend of $0.05 per share. With that, I'll turn over to Larry for his comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Safra. When we introduced the Exadata database machine, it really was focused on data warehousing and our primary competitors were companies like Teradata and Netezza. When we introduced version two of our Exadata database machine in partnership with Sun and then we bought Sun, we really focused not simply on data warehousing performance but also on online transaction processing. And our current version of the Sun Exadata database machine substantially outperforms IBM's fastest computer in both data warehousing and transaction processing. As a result, in our previous quarter in Q4, some of IBM's largest customers began buying Exadata machines rather than big IBM servers. And the 2011 Exadata pipeline continues to grow and is now approaching $1 billion, making Exadata fastest growing new product in Oracle's history.</p>
          <p>Now back to Q4. Again, I said the competition has really shifted from companies like Teradata and Netezza to big IBM machines. And the Q4 results bore that out. We beat IBM 30 times in Q4. We beat Teradata 9 times in Q4 and we beat Netezza 7 times in Q4 and we sold the Exadata machine into some of IBM's largest and bluest accounts, including Bank of America; Carrefour, the second largest retailer in the world behind Walmart; and Thomson's Reuters. Alternatively, Charles will give you a broader picture of how our other products did in Q4. Charles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Larry. We really had good teamwork across all the account execs by product family. It was really a good quarter as you can see. North and Latin America were strong results. They exceeded plan as they have all year long. EMEA in particular did a great job of delivering results against a tough comparison, especially in the context of the change in the UK government, financial instability in Greece and Spain while integrating an acquisition. So with all those headwinds, they delivered good results and Japan saw rebound from a rough start to the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>What I'm seeing in the field right now, is we have many more touch points with our accounts, so our visibility and understanding of customer requirements is significantly improved. And right now almost any decision they make in the data center could potentially involve Oracle now. So we have deployed a cadre of technical advisors that we call client architects that essentially act as dedicated CTOs for our large customers who want to stay tightly aligned with Oracle's strategy. And these client architects are more in demand as we become more important to our customers, as we advise these CIOs on how to invest and shape their architectures in concert with Oracle's investments.</p>
          <p>We're improving the attach rate on deals to drag along multiple products up and down the stack, and we just continue to get better as the products get more integrated. We also sell partners in particular the systems integrators and even some of the hardware companies make a concerted effort to reinvigorate their Oracle partnerships close to Sun acquisition, which may be counterintuitive, but I think they see the momentum in the market and want to align themselves accordingly. It's also reflected in the amount of companies signing up as sponsors for Oracle OpenWorld by the way.</p>
          <p>So product comments, Fusion Middleware 11g, upgrades to 11g from 10g are off to faster pace. Keep in mind that we already had most of the customer base on 10g, 88% were on 10g and now they're moving faster than the 10g customers moved. We have several new options around 11g, which means about 70% of the installed base is a candidate for add-on product modules once they upgrade.</p>
          <p>WebCenter within the Fusion Middleware suite did well in the quarter. Just wanted to point that out because with the enterprise support and content management under that product, we replaced SharePoint at Airbus and McAfee. Also wanted to note that one of the recent acquisitions, GoldenGate, which is the leader in data replication across heterogeneous databases, got off to an extremely bad start with wins at Sun and other large companies, but more importantly is getting us into accounts who are using non-Oracle databases since they're replicating across databases.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we released enterprise Linux version 5.5. We now have over 5,000 Linux customers on our enterprise Linux, over 400 added in the quarter. We are making investments around Oracle VM, our virtualization product, working on ways to leverage virtualization across our entire product line. Just one small example, we are working on an Oracle VM machine. It's a Sun server with an integrated network switch, storage away, Oracle VM, VM Manager and VM Templates, preconfigured and our ready-to-deploy RAT. And we can package this technology in ways that most people can't and adds a lot of value. Our competitors are trying to mimic it right now.</p>
          <p>We also released Enterprise Manager 11g in the quarter. That's our systems management product. That's a milestone release, because it's the first to manage applications down to storage which is kind of what we're been talking about for quite a while, was the single management platform to monitor that entire stack.</p>
          <p>In the applications area we had a very strategic and large win at Merck across multiple pillars. It also included some <mark type="inaudible" /> products from the vertical in the GBU. And in CRM, I've talked about ADP in the past. They expanded their CM footprint both on-premise and on demand CRM with their standard there now. Agile PLM, we had a large win at Foxconn, a large contract manufacturer that makes the iPhone. Although they're using an SAP back end, they're using Agile now for products life cycle management. So our Edge applications continue to do extremely well in SAP accounts.</p>
          <p>I mean in financial services we had a good win with Mantis and Reveleus, our risk management anti money-laundering solutions at PNC Financial Services group. And we won two large banks in China with our FLEXCUBE core banking platform and they're working with us to build out the localization, which is important for future wins.</p>
          <p>And lastly, just to give you &#x2013; let me give you a sense of the types of hardware purchases on the Sun SPARC pack. We are seeing momentum there as you saw in the numbers. Types of companies that are committing to the M-series or the T-series: International Paper, Thomson Reuters, Amtrak, Cummings, P&amp;G Procter &amp; Gamble, Qualcomm, eBay, PayPal, all in this quarter and that's just a small sampling. And with that I will turn it back over.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. Safra, I was wondering if you could share with us your views on Europe, and what you're seeing with sell cycles in that region now versus say a few months ago and I guess in particular your view on whether or not you're starting to see this impact deal signings? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's really a question for Charles. I think we're actually, we're very, very strong in Europe. By the way, they had a pretty tough compare actually because they had a reasonably good Q4 last year and so far we're actually out to a very good start. But there's no question that the UK government and a number of our big customers have been impacted by different things in Europe. But we have so many products and we have such diversity in our European base and that things have been going very well for us so far.</p>
          <p>Charles, do you want to comment on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you summed it up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The operating margins were obviously terrific in the quarter. You beat consensus by over 400 million. Safra, I believe you talked about the gross margins in the hardware business. Where else did you see the key contributors to the margin upside in the quarter? And as we look into next year, do you feel like we've reset at a higher level heading into fiscal '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course, you all have become accustomed to the fact that we sell a lot more software, but we don't increase our cost structure very very much. And Sun and our own business generated a lot of new software sales. I mean, so that on its face, ignoring hardware would lead to higher, to improved operating margins. And then we have hardware business, which is clearly, we're making it at the gross margin line, we're making it at the operating expense line, we're making it all around. But this is a scale business. And the more we grow in scale as a software business and frankly the more we grow in scale as a hardware business, our operating margins will improve. You just need a, you just need to look at our history for the past few years, and it shows up sort of all around hardware and software business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terrific. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>We'll go next to John DiFucci with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Safra, you have been very clear about focusing on profit as it pertains to Sun and actually as it pertains to any business. But looking forward into this business, as on the hardware top line, can you give us a little more general guidance on how we should be thinking about it going forward? Coming into this quarter, obviously it's your, end of your fiscal year and it was close to what Sun's fiscal year would have been. And perhaps maybe the hardware business looked pretty good and perhaps there could have been some pent up demand too, to show that.</p>
          <p>But I'm just wondering if we should be, given the guidance for next quarter and looking forward, if we should be just maybe not too aggressive on the top line for the hardware business going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well there's no question we need to get some sort of a baseline for the hardware business. But you need to understand that we are also selling differentiated products. We have a lot of new differentiated products both out and coming out. And Exadata is one of those kinds of products. So obviously I'm not going to recommend you get ahead of my guidance, but it's a reason that I'm giving you guidance, it's what we actually think we're going to do.</p>
          <p>But we will need a year to understand the amount of seasonality that there is in the hardware business. We don't have full visibility and as I did mention, we are no longer reselling other, some products that were other people's products, which Sun sold for hundreds of millions of dollars a year. And so that has to be &#x2013; we need a year without that for you to get a baseline.</p>
          <p>But in general we feel that we already see it, customers are buying a lot of hardware now. They are very, very loyal to technology that they love. And now that they know that it has a future and that we are investing an enormous amount in continuing these lines and in enhancing them, they're much more comfortable making those investments again. So as you can see, sequentially we're not projecting a very large decline which in our software business, we usually are between Q4 and Q1 because we have some hardware-specific momentum we're very upbeat about. But we will need a year to understand pipelines and conversion rates, etcetera, and see how we come out, as well as to be able to measure some of these new products and how they're taking off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. If I might, just a quick follow-up for Larry to that and the hardware business. Did the Exadata product, both OLAP and OLTP solutions and people are used to buying analytics in a appliance fashion or appliance form function. I'm just curious how much are you starting to see customers get as far as their comfort level of buying transaction processing solutions and in buying Exadata?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think as long as we can demonstrate, the Exadata version 2 is relatively new product. As long as we can demonstrate and benchmark that we are a lot faster than IBM's fastest computer, the appliance is particularly attractive in OLTP, because since OLTP is mission critical and all these pieces fit together, our architecture is not only faster than IBM's, it is much more reliable. Exadata has a fault-tolerant architecture. There is no single point of failure, which is much more important in OLTP than it is in data warehousing. So we're faster and more reliable.</p>
          <p>Now we have, people are skeptical about any new product. They buy a couple of machines and they test them and then they put them into production and if we're successful then they start making standardization decisions. But I think the combination of much better performance and the fact that it's appliance, where all the pieces are, you know fit together, engineered to fit together and tested together and the fact that it's a fault-tolerant architecture gives us a huge advantage over IBM in the OLTP space. So again each customer will take their time in trying it and then making a decision. But we are making really good progress.</p>
          <p>I also want to add on to what Safra said. She forecasts hardware at 1 billion dollars for Q1, but the guidance is the guidance. However, you should know our plan is to dramatically grow the Sun sales organization and strongly grow the Sun business. Your early question, are we just focused on profitability. We are focused on growing the Sun business and growing it rapidly. We're being very conservative in our guidance as we should be, but we are adding a lot of sales people. Maybe Charles can comment on just how quickly. I know it takes them a while to get productive, but maybe Charles can comment on just how quickly we are adding distribution capacity to the Sun sales organization so we can grow that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Yes, as you probably know, we made a big public announcement that we are hiring and so that generated a lot of momentum. But what I've been impressed with is the quality of the people who are coming because they're excited about the differentiated message they see what Sun is doing. They see Exadata, they see the investment that we're making, so the quality senior people who want to come here from our competitors has surprised me and we're signing them up as we speak and now that the quarter is over with we have a little more time to focus on it. We're ramping up, but the pipeline is there, people to hire.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question, we'll go Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terrific, thanks for taking my questions. Just first on Sun maintenance, where it feels as if you still have a lot of low-hanging fruit. Now that you have the quarter under your belt, what are you seeing in terms of trends in pricing on maintenance and then attach rates and then I have a very quick follow-up afterwards if I may.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sarah, you have kind of a funny line so we couldn't quite hear you. But you are asking about Sun support? Support on Sun?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes exactly, Sun maintenance, so what you are seeing in terms of pricing ability and then attach rates, which I think were quite weak before you took on Sun.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well we announced new pricing, which was very, very well received. Gartner wrote an excellent report on it and customers have sort of adopted it very much. It's considered extremely competitive. A lot of customers that had not been on support from Sun have come to Sun, have come back to Sun and the attach rates are increasing. So there's definitely value to Sun support for hardware and software and customers are recognizing that and attach rates are increasing. And we expect them to increase even further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then if I could a follow up, just very big picture. You are clearly one of the big tech bellwethers. Your views on the environment hold a lot of weight. Are you seeing any change on the margin, not even just Europe specific but just on the margin in terms of customers' willingness to spend today versus a month ago, versus maybe two months ago? Because clearly the market is saying they are very concerned right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, for us as I said before, it's very hard for us to parse the line, to make a line between Oracle's company-specific momentum and the overall market. Our customers are very, very sort of happy right now, and they're showing that by investing in more and more of our products. This is sort of a consistent message. We got the exact same question a quarter ago and a quarter ago. And there's no question that the quarter started off very well for us already. And I think that, you know we're not economists here, we just sell software and hardware. So, so far our customers are making very significant investments. And there are a lot of customers looking at our products right now very, very seriously and making buying decisions literally as we speak. So, I don't know if anybody else wants to take a stab at the economy question, but things are going well here, guys, which I think is clearly obvious.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well the perspective is great. Thank you.</p>

          <p>We'll take our next question from Joel Fishbein with Lazard Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, can you please give us some more color around the change or the elimination of the Sun channel and how that has the impacted or the impact it's having on the operating margin line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me correct that. We didn't eliminate the Sun channel at all. So that's not exactly what we're doing. What we said was, over time there would be a gradual shift to a more direct mix of business that Oracle normally sees. So pre-Sun, anywhere from 40 to 43% normally in a given quarter of our business goes through indirect channels. So we've had a strong channel for many, many years and it's important to our business. Sun was much, much higher than that. For our large customers, we want to service them directly. So there will be a shift toward our number over time, but nothing dramatic in one quarter, nothing to disrupt the flow of business. So that shift has started, but again it will take some time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding the margins, obviously this will lead to actually higher revenues for the company. And because of our really massive scale, it will actually also lead &#x2013; revenues will increase a lot, expenses will not increase as much, which means that overall operating margins will improve, consistent with really the leveraging the massive scale we have here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the takeaway is that it really wasn't an impact in this quarter because it's too early to impact. Is that the way to look at it, so it's eventual?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct and any of those partners are adding value and we want &#x2013; the ones that are adding value, we want to continue to work with for many years.</p>
