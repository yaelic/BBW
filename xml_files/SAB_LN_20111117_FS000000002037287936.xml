        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, operator. Good morning to everyone in New York. Good afternoon to everyone in London and South Africa. I'm Gary Leibowitz, Senior Vice President of IR for SABMiller. This is our results presentation for our six months ended September 30, 2011. That's our F '12.</p>
          <p>Thanks to all of you in New York, who've managed to make it through the dislocations in downtown and midtown. We'll continue on just a little bit late now for those that were delayed in coming on to the call.</p>
          <p>As usual, our presentation will contain forward-looking statements, which reflect the current best judgment of management, including risks and uncertainties. The company disclaims any obligation to update these statements outside of our normal reporting and seminar routines.</p>
          <p>I'm joined today by Jamie Wilson, our new CFO, here for his first set of results, and he'll join in a few minutes. So let's get started. We believe the results we've reported this morning are strong, considering the persistent economic weakness in many parts of the world and the impact this is having on consumer confidence and spending.</p>
          <p>Top and bottom line growth has been robust in most of our developing market businesses, driven by our application of our organic growth strategies and returns on our investments in brands, sales and distribution capability and production capacity. However, demand in our more mature markets is still weak, impacted by the lack of recovery at most beer drinking demographic groups.</p>
          <p>The group's organic lager volume growth of 3% reflects this mixed picture, with Africa and Latin America growing at 15% and 8%, respectively, while Asia has slowed to 4%. Europe and South Africa are level with the prior year, and MillerCoors' STRs were down 2%.</p>
          <p>Group profitability has remained resilient, with organic constant currency EBITA growth of 6%, despite the U.S. volume weakness and negative sales mix. Our developing market businesses have delivered not only strong volume growth, but also healthy margin gains, as you'll see. And we're excited about the growth opportunities afforded by our recently announced Foster's and Efes transactions.</p>
          <p>Now first, a quick look at our divisions. In Latin America, our commercial initiatives have driven strong volume growth, resulting from brand and pack enhancements and our drive for greater consumer affordability in Colombia and elsewhere. In Colombia, lager volumes grew 7%, benefiting from our price restraint, new creative platforms and more focused trade execution.</p>
          <p>We've begun year round distribution of the previously seasonal Club Colombia Roja, which has attracted new consumers to the category, while upper mainstream Aguila Light continues its rise, up nearly 50%, and enhancing profitability.</p>
          <p>The introduction of a smaller Pony Malta pack and extended distribution drove double-digit volume growth for the brand. And we have recently launched a new refreshing "good for you" malt brand, Maltizz.</p>
          <p>Peru delivered robust volume growth of 11%, driven by our marketing and sales success and resulting in a further gain in beer market share. Cusque&#xF1;a volumes were up 25%, capitalizing on its Peruvian heritage and the centenary of the discovery of Machu Picchu.</p>
          <p>While in Ecuador, our return to growth in the second quarter followed the cycling of government restrictions on the sale of alcohol on Sundays and our successful rollout of a direct service model. Despite relative price restraint, we grew EBITA by 16% in organic constant currency and raised our margin by over one percentage point.</p>
          <p>Positive sales mix, as I've mentioned, had an impact, given our growth in premium and upper mainstream volumes of over 20%, up three points to now 27% of regional lager volume. And this was accomplished by better operational leverage and continued cost efficiency improvements.</p>
          <p>As regards MillerCoors in the United States, industry trading conditions have remained difficult and we're seeing a polarization in consumer groups and product segments. Premium Lights are still hampered by unemployment among key beer drinkers, but Coors Light is continuing its share gains in the segment. Consumer uptrading is affecting premium light volumes as a segment driven impart by a reduced price gap to imports and crafts with little or no pricing being taken by brewers in those segments.</p>
          <p>The underperformance of Miller Lite is being addressed with new work, and we're optimistic about the prospects for the newly re-branded Miller 64 in the ultra-low calorie segment that we just announced to you on our MillerCoors call couple of weeks ago.</p>
          <p>The Tenth and Blake division has led the growth in the rising crafts and import segments with the Blue Moon and Leinenkugel's franchise is gaining further strength and breadth with very successful seasonals. MillerCoors is also selectively expanding Peroni Nastro Azzurro.</p>
          <p>Perhaps most notably, MillerCoors' investment in category management is paying off with supplier recognitions from key chains such as Target, 7-Eleven and Outback Steakhouse. A key independent retailer survey recently rated MillerCoors as the leading beer supplier, and distributors rated MillerCoors number one for category management in the well known Tamarron Survey.</p>
          <p>At MillerCoors' inception, it was category captain for 24% of its chain volume. This is now 35% and climbing. And there's evidence that this is benefiting retailers as the beer volume trend in retail accounts, where MillerCoors is captain, beat the trend in those led by our principal competitor by nearly three percentage points.</p>
          <p>Profitability at MillerCoors benefited from gains in price and mix, but these are more than offset by the effects of lower volumes, higher commodity costs and higher fixed costs, including further investment in systems.</p>
          <p>In Europe, as has been widely reported, very poor weather with unusually high rainfall cast a pall over beer volumes in July and early August. The effect was especially pronounced across Central Europe. Apart from that, the trend was for low single-digit volume growth in the region.</p>
          <p>But a broad pattern of competitor actions across most of the region is reducing industry profitability as you've heard us describe over recent months. These actions include permanent price reductions and moving brands, in some cases, flagship brands down between segments with price reductions of 10%, 20% or more.</p>
          <p>Significantly deeper modern trade discounts are being made as well as unprecedented efforts to list branded beer in the discount channel and price tiers once occupied only by minor private label products, and some of our peers have undertaken major marketing and investment in economy brands, further encouraging down-trading in an environment of soft consumer confidence.</p>
          <p>The latter point is particularly concerning as driving consumers into economy brands compromises the brand equity structure and profitability that we worked to create over many years. And the impact of negative mix on industry profitability can be very significant.</p>
          <p>In this context, we are maintaining our focus on the protection and growth of our leading brand equities in the local mainstream and local premium segments. We're optimizing revenue to limit the impact of competitor actions on our profitability, balancing volume and value share and limiting discounts. There is evidence of this approach in our revenue per hectoliter and EBITDA margin performance in Europe, both of which are better than the peer group.</p>
          <p>We also have good commercial success to report in Russia and Hungary, where we've gained market share, and in Czech Republic led by the strong brands; Pilsner Urquell and Kozel.</p>
          <p>Turning to a very different context now in Africa, our African businesses, comprising a broad portfolio of markets, have continued to deliver strong growth. Intensified market execution, initiatives and in-trade investment are bringing new consumers into the beer category and resulting in share gains in competitive markets such as Tanzania and Ghana and broader increases in share of alcohol for beer.</p>
          <p>Our strategy of extending our price ladder up and down, reaching more consumers on more occasions continues to bear fruit. In the premium segment, our Castle family grew 34% and lower down the price ladder we've expanded the Eagle franchise to a total of five countries and extended the reach of our traditional beers like Chibuku, pictured here on the slide in the carton, with availability now in nine markets.</p>
          <p>Strong operating leverage, as well as price and mix improvements resulted in pleasing growth in profitability and margins for the half year. Further expansion is now underway in Nigeria and South Sudan and soon in markets such as Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, the consumer economy was soft during the period as the early recovery stalled. Last year's World Cup boosted the prior year comp while buying power among poorer consumers has been affected by disproportionate rises in the cost of fuel, food and electricity. Strong revenue growth was delivered with price increases and improved mix, driven primarily by excellent growth in Castle Lite gaining share within the premium segment. Our other focus brands have also shown better competitive performance, contributing to an overall stabilization of our market share in the 89% to 90% range within beer and our share of overall alcohol. Revenue growth management, variable cost savings and fixed cost productivity once again enabled increased investment in market-facing activities, while also driving reported margins up by about 0.5 point.</p>
          <p>And in Asia, revenue growth for the half has once again accelerated and operating margins are rising. In China the summer peak was marred by persistent flooding in the central provinces, but price increases have held up well this year and sales mix was enhanced by improved distribution of Snow's premium brands now over 20% of CR Snow's volumes. Therefore, revenue per hectoliter, which is still very low in China, was up 14% in organic constant currency. Snow market share continues to grow organically while at the same time CR Snow continues to lead the overall industry consolidation with bolt-on M&amp;A.</p>
          <p>In India, we're concentrating efforts in states where our brand and pack innovation and commercial capabilities can drive profitable growth. This approach has delivered growth and higher profitability despite a market decline due to large and unforeseen increases in excise in some states.</p>
          <p>And in Australia, we delivered excellent growth led by Grolsch brand, Peroni Nastro Azzurro and Bluetongue, the local craft with strong sales execution and the Warnervale brewery is now in full swing in advance of the Foster's transaction.</p>
          <p>Our strategic priorities remain consistent for the Group as a whole and we continue to make good progress against each of these. We've made clear progress in furthering our balanced and attractive global spread of businesses. The proposed Foster's transaction will provide us with the leading position in the attractive Australian beer market and with it the opportunity to deploy our commercial capabilities to enhance the category Foster's portfolio and its operations.</p>
          <p>At the same time our proposed new partnership with Efes will provide us with excellent exposure to growth in Turkey across central Asia in beer and soft drinks, and a much enhanced beer business model and position number two in revenue terms in Russia.</p>
          <p>We continue to develop strong relevant band portfolios around the world that enable us to win in our local markets. We illustrate a few examples here in the upper right hand corner of the slide, Cusquena in Peru up 25%, Blue Moon in the U.S. as I mentioned, Castle Light across Africa and South Africa and the Safari brand in Tanzania for example up 23% and gaining share. All of these connecting deeply with targeted local consumers, based on local insights and portfolio structures.</p>
          <p>We continue to raise the profitability of local businesses this year led by our emerging market divisions. As you can see in the lower left Jamie will return to this. And finally we're further leveraging our skills and global scale most clearly illustrated in the extension of our global procurement platform to new categories.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Jamie to take you through our financial results, Jaime over to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good day to everyone. My presentation will focus on results on an organic constant currency basis as this reflects our underlying performance and profitability before foreign exchange translation impacts.</p>
          <p>The Group has delivered good adjusted earnings per share growth in terms of all of our major currencies in the first six months. Adjusted earnings per share in our reporting currency of U.S. dollars, was up 11%. The interim dividend is US$0.215 per share, which represents an increase of 10% over the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Organic group revenue growth of 6.3% was driven almost equally by volume and price and mix benefits, reflecting strong volume growth in our developing markets and firm pricing in South Africa, North America, Africa and Asia.</p>
          <p>In addition to these pricing benefits, favorable mix benefits were generated across all divisions, except for Europe, reflecting the strength of our local and international premium brand portfolio. Revenue from our premium brand portfolio grew 9% constant currency basis, driven by a strong growth from our local premium brands in a number of key markets.</p>
          <p>Reported group revenue also benefited from the strength of the South African rand and the Columbian peso, the currencies in Central and Eastern Europe against the dollar compared to the first half of the prior year.</p>
          <p>Group revenue per hectoliter grew 3% on an organic constant currency basis, and all regions other than Europe achieved revenue per hectoliter growth over the period.</p>
          <p>Latin America benefited from selective price increases and favorable brand mix. Local premium brands grew strongly across the region supported by good growth in Club Colombia in Colombia, Cusque&#xF1;a in Peru and Club in Ecuador.</p>
          <p>In Europe, revenue per hectoliter was in line with prior year with moderate price increases taken where possible, largely offset by tactical discounting in response to competitor price reductions.</p>
          <p>In North America, MillerCoors has benefited from the firm prior year pricing and favorable brand mix. The Tenth and Blake craft and import division exhibited strong growth supported by Blue Moon and innovative seasonal brand extensions of the Leinenkugel brand.</p>
          <p>Africa grew 8% overall, with growth of 11% in our African subsidiary businesses, assisted by price in both the prior and current year and positive mix benefits. Mix benefited from strong growth in our local regional premium brands, in particular, the Castle brand portfolio, which grew over 30% in the period.</p>
          <p>In Asia, revenue per hectoliter grew double-digits as a result of price and mix benefits in both China and India. China's mix benefited from increased presence in the premium segment and on-premise channels through the continued expansion of Snow Draft.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, the performance was underpinned by robust pricing taken in both beer and soft drinks in the fourth quarter of last year, supported by positive brand and pack mix driven principally by the continued growth in Castle Lite.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBITDA grew 5.6% in the first half of the year, largely as a result of the volume and revenue benefits previously mentioned. Cost of goods sold were adversely higher in brewing and packaging raw material costs and increased fuel costs.</p>
          <p>Marketing spend increased in line with revenue as we continue to invest behind our local and international brands, particularly across our strong growth markets of Latin America and Africa. And in South Africa, we continue to intensify our market-facing investment, which was partially offset by savings in other areas.</p>
          <p>Fixed costs increased reflecting additional spend to support market-facing and systems capabilities across a number of our operations and the corporate center. Higher corporate center costs included incremental costs associated with our capability program. Overall, however, after adjusting for inflation, real fixed costs were broadly in line with prior year on a constant currency basis per hectoliter.</p>
          <p>All regions other than Europe and North America increased their EBITA and with particularly good growth from Latin America, Africa, South Africa, Asia. Organic EBITA grew 10.1%, reflecting the favorable currency moves of some $112 million.</p>
          <p>Margin in Latin America benefited from the year-on-year total volume growth of 9%. Mix benefit and real fixed costs productivity, which more than offset higher raw material costs and marketing spend.</p>
          <p>Encouragingly, Africa delivered EBITA margin growth following a number of years of margin decline, as the business more than fully utilized its new capacity footprint and benefited from price increases in favorable mix benefits.</p>
          <p>Asia's EBITA margin improvement was driven by the combination of volume growth, mix benefits and price increases. And in South Africa, pricing benefits coupled with lower overall raw material costs contributed a return to EBITA margin growth.</p>
          <p>Group margin was impacted by trading and economic conditions in North America and Europe, together with an increase in corporate costs as previously mentioned. The EBITA margin in Europe was also adversely affected by increased discounts and higher cost of goods sold, partly offset by lower marketing and fixed costs.</p>
          <p>The raw material input costs for the half year were up low single-digits versus the prior year on a constant currency basis &#x2013; per hectoliter basis in line with our previous guidance. Most regions experienced an increase in brewing raw material costs following higher barley and sugar prices together with an increase in the number of packaging raw materials. Foreign currency benefits have partially mitigated these underlying commodity price increases in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Higher fuel costs drove distribution costs higher and total cost of goods sold increased low single-digits. Our business capability program continues to progress with cumulative of net operating benefits worth US$60 million in the first half of the year. These mainly reflect an expanding range of procurement initiatives together with efficiency gains and cost savings from the European manufacturing project. These benefits are net of higher IT-related spend.</p>
          <p>We continue to make progress in developing process and system changes. The template implemented in South Africa and corporate last year has tended to cover a much fuller scope and has gone live in Ecuador at the start of this month.</p>
          <p>During August and September, Romania and Poland treasury activities were transferred to our European Treasury Centre. Exceptional costs for the first half have reduced due to the last year's rate and will fall further in the second half as the central program structure starts to be scaled back.</p>
          <p>Preparation for rollout of the global template has involved some build-up of IT capability as global and regional structures are put in place. IT management has been strengthened to ensure that that we get full value for these product charges.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA comprising EBITDA before cash flows from exceptional items together with dividends received from MillerCoors increased 7% on the prior year, as a result of the increased operating profit, partially offset by lower MillerCoors dividends and lower cash exceptional items. We have continued to generate further working capital cash inflows in the first half, building on the significant working capital cash inflows achieved over the last two years.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure of $680 million was $146 million higher than last year, following the continued capacity investments in Africa and Latin America in particular. Free cash flow continued to improve, up $235 million in this year, principally a result of higher EBITDA, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditure.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net finance costs decreased 19% to $229 million, predominantly due to reduction in net debt. And, the group's effective rate of tax of 25 &#x2013; 28.5% was 50 basis points lower than the rate for the first half of last year as a result of general tax efficiencies throughout the group and our successful appeal against &#x2013; of Russian royalty cases.</p>
          <p>Our net debt position at 30th of September has decreased over the last six months as a result of our strong cash flow as well as benefiting from depreciation of certain currencies in which a portion of our debt is denominated against the U.S. dollar. Up to July we repaid a $600-million bond from our cash resources.</p>
          <p>Our financial structure continues to strengthen with gearing falling to 28.9% and net debt to adjusted EBITDA down to 1.1 times. Our access to liquidity remained strong, with committed headroom available to the group of approximately $3 billion U.S. as at 30th of September. This does not include the $12.5 billion facility put in place in September of this year for the purpose of the acquisition of Foster's.</p>
          <p>Our weighted average interest rate as at 30th September has moved slightly to 6.1% from 5.9% as of March of this year. It has been driven in part by an increase in rates in Africa as well as the repayment of low interest rate short-term floating rate debt from our strong cash flows.</p>
          <p>And, now moving on to our financial outlook, which excludes the impact of the potential Foster's and Efes transactions, we expect the mixed trading conditions experienced in the first half of the year to continue throughout the remainder of the year. We anticipate that growth in the consumer demand will continue to be driven by most of our developing market businesses, while economic and trading conditions in the U.S. and Europe are not expected to improve over the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>As indicated earlier in my presentation, reported results are expected to be affected by adverse currency moves in the second half of the year given the recent weakness in a number of our key operating currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>Full-year raw material input costs are expected to be higher than last year, up low single digits, with cost increases across a number of the key brewing and packaging raw materials. Favorable currency hedging positions are expected to partially mitigate these commodity cost increases. These commodity cost pressures are expected to continue into the following financial year.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on all components of working capital but expect working capital cash inflows to be moderate over the full year given the significant benefits delivered over the last two years. Capital expenditure for the full year is expected to amount to approximately $1.7 billion, up some $200 million on our last preliminary announcement guidance of $1.5 billion. Additional capacity-related capital expenditure in a number of markets in Africa accounts for the bulk of this increase, including a new malting plant in Uganda, significant capacity expansion at an Anadolu brewery in Zambia and further capacity expansions at Tanzania breweries.</p>
          <p>Full-year finance costs, excluding the possible impact of the Foster's acquisition, will be lower than last year, as a result of a lower net debt position, and second half finance costs will approximate to those of the first half. Finally, our effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be in line with the half year rate of 28.5% compared to the prior year full-year rate of 28.2%.</p>
          <p>In September, we were pleased to reach an agreement with the Board of Foster's on our recommended proposal to acquire Foster's at an acquisition enterprise value of A$11.5 billion, based on estimated net debt on completion and adjusted for the present value of historical losses. The proposed acquisition is to be implemented by means of a scheme of arrangements and subject to receiving all necessary regulatory and court approvals and the approval of Foster's shareholders at meetings, which have now been convened for the 1st of December. We expect to complete the acquisition on 16th of December. We've obtained committed financing for the acquisition. Based on our currency and interest rate risk management policy, we expect the blended cost of incremental debt to be around 5% on a pre-tax basis.</p>
          <p>In October, we announced our intention to form a strategic alliance with Anadolu Efes. We will transfer our Russian and Ukrainian businesses to Anadolu Efes, and we will take a 24% equity stake in the enlarged group, which will be the vehicle for both our groups' investments in Turkey, Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, Central Asia and Middle East. Subject to finalization of the definitive legal agreements and relevant regulatory approvals, we expect to complete the transaction before the end of the financial year.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Jamie. And so to conclude before we just take your questions, we expect the mix trading conditions experienced in the first half to continue through the remainder of the year. Economic and market environments in the U.S. and Europe remain difficult, even as robust growth continues in Latin America, Africa and parts of Asia. But overall, our revenue and profitability have proven to be resilient, growing despite the headwinds and benefiting from the consistent application of our organic growth strategies.</p>
          <p>Price increases will be taken selectively and initiatives to reduce costs and increase efficiency will continue, mitigating the effects of rising input costs and funding increased investment in brands, sales capabilities and systems.</p>
          <p>We look forward to completing our acquisition of Foster's and finalizing our alliance with Anadolu Efes. Our underlying financial position, as well as our medium-term outlook for growth in volume, revenue and profitability remains strong.</p>
          <p>And with that, operator, Jamie and I will be glad to take some questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I was just wondering if you could speak to potentially when we could see you start terming out some of the interim financing that you have in place for Foster's, assuming the closing date of December 16? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. Well, we obviously are in the process of the first round of syndication of the loan into a wider range of banks. But then as you rightly say, we'll be taking the first tranche of that financing, which is the short-term part of our financing, and be seeking to raise a bond in the first half of next year to actually transfer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. And would you be able to provide us a little bit of color around the structure of your interim financing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can do. We effectively raised $12.5 billion in four tranches, the first tranche was an $8 billion tranche, which was a short-term one-plus-one financing. We then raised two further tranches one over three years, one over five years and then we had a $1 billion revolving credit at the end of that.</p>
