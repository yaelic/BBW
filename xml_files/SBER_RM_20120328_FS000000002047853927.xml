        <plist>
          <p>Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Sberbank's Annual Investor and Analyst Call, where we'll present the results of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards for the year of 2012 &#x2013; sorry, 2011. We are in 2012, but the results <mark type="ph" /> are of 2011 (00:25).</p>
          <p>We have published the results this morning on our website, www.sberbank.ru, in the usual section for Investor Relations part <mark type="ph" /> part (00:41). And there is a presentation that is going to be there as well that would assist you <mark type="ph" /> in the perception (00:53) of these numbers. Also, the press release has been issued during the day to highlight the main numbers and the main results.</p>
          <p>I will spend a couple of minutes accentuating some of the key points in terms of the data, but then as in accordance with our tradition, we will spend most of this call answering your questions. We are expecting this call to last just under an hour and a half. We will need to be finishing in 5:30 PM, Moscow Time, which is 2:30 London Time.</p>
          <p>The highlights are that we continue to enjoy solid loan growth with gross loan portfolio up year-on-year by 35.4%, which was reasonably balanced between corporate and retail lending. Corporate has grown 35%, retail 36.8%. Similarly, our customer deposits have grown <mark type="audio gap" /> (02:05-02:12) full year with retail growing 18.4% and corporate 21.4%.</p>
          <p>Our net profit for 2011 reached RUB315.9 billion, which is a 74% increase on the preceding year and most of our revenues continue to come mostly from core banking. 94.5% of our revenues are net interest income and fees and commission income.</p>
          <p>Our margin for 2011 was very close to the level of 2010, which is approximately 6.4%. There is a little bit of a classification clarification that I need to make. For convenience of perception, we are showing the cost associated with the national deposit insurance fees that we pay on our retail deposit &#x2013; we are showing that within net interest income to make sure that they reflect the same nature of income and expense that relates to those interest-bearing deposits that we raise.</p>
          <p>And therefore, on the comparable basis &#x2013; I know when we were reporting the margin last year, it was 6.6%, but if you recalculate it on comparable basis with this cost shown within the net interest income, you'll come up that 2010 was a similar 6.4%, as we're showing now.</p>
          <p>Our return on equity has improved and reached 28% versus 20.6% last year. We have shown 31.5% on the basis of nine months of 2011, but this, of course, was a little bit of a one-off experience.</p>
          <p>Our market shares have continued to be stable, with some reduction in retail deposit market share, but that was a conscious decision that we have taken.</p>
          <p>Some of the other highlights I would like to make is that our provisioning for impaired assets has come out at approximately the guidance that we were giving before, which is very close to zero P&amp;L impact, just over RUB1 billion.</p>
          <p>We have, in accordance with our accounting policy, re-valued our premises, our branch network of offices, which we do regularly every three years. Last time we've done it was at the end of 2009. And have recorded it on our P&amp;L and balance sheet. And I'll just make a few comments &#x2013; because this item appear only once every three years &#x2013; for clarity, how this needs to be perceived.</p>
          <p>We have shown a gain &#x2013; the gains and losses on these revaluations are under IFRS required to be recorded on individual asset by asset, property by property basis, and therefore, the net losses associated with revaluation of the certain properties are not offset against the gains that were recorded on some other properties.</p>
          <p>Of course, with our branch network of over 18,000 properties some of them are owned, some of them are rented, this is quite a meaningful number. So the gains on those properties that were revalued upwards has reached roughly RUB36 billion. The losses on those that had to be revalued down were just over RUB11 billion, almost RUB12 billion. So all in all, it is around RUB25 billion positive impact on us.</p>
          <p>The gains were recorded in the comprehensive income statement whilst the losses of 2011 have been shown in the P&amp;L as a cost. This is exactly how IFRS accounting rules require this to be shown. So this is what we have recorded.</p>
          <p>Our cost has continued to grow in accordance with what we have guided for 2011 &#x2013; came out with 31% year-on-year growth in nominal terms, and that is split between employee compensation-related costs that has grown at 26.4% and 38% growth in other non-compensation related costs.</p>
          <p>The main drivers continued to be the same as we've always described on <mark type="audio gap" /> (07:50-07:55) &#x2013; personnel, IT investments and reformatting of branch network and anything that is related to depreciation of fixed assets. Our cost income ratio therefore has remained kind of close to mid-40s, which is 46.9% for 2011 versus 40.9% back in 2010.</p>
          <p>Our securities portfolio continued to reduce somewhat so that we were bringing our loans-to-assets ratio a bit closer to the more natural kind of low 70s in accordance with the plan as we were using that liquidity from the security portfolio to fund the healthy loan growth.</p>
          <p>And the Group's equity attributable to the bank shareholders amounted to RUB1.2 trillion as at the end of the year, which is a 28.6% increase as compared to the preceding year. And our total capital adequacy ratio Tier 1 plus Tier 2 calculated under Basel I was 15.2%, which is well above the 8% minimum requirement. And the Tier 1 ratio was 11.6%.</p>
          <p>I guess, I will conclude my introductory remarks with this and open it up for your questions. Excuse me. We are open for questions, if you could.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Sam Goodacre. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Sam Goodacre from Morgan Stanley in London here. Just a couple of questions from me, please. Firstly, on capital, so your Tier 1 has declined by sort of a little &#x2013; a little bit Q-on-Q, obviously driven by the high pace of RWA growth. Going forward, what is your sort of view around capital and what sort of further RWA growth in the next two years, say, would you be happy with? So that was the first one.</p>
          <p>And then the second one, actually just on your cost of risk, because obviously it's zero at the full year, but we have seen an increase in your sort of specific impairments in the 4Q sort of approaching up to sort of normalized levels again. So what have you perhaps been seeing in the first few months of this year and where are you guiding for your sort of cost of risk for the full year? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you for the question. In terms of capital, I think, as you would've seen the reduction in the &#x2013; somewhat excessive capital adequacy ratios that we've seen earlier in the previous years have come mostly from our acquisitions. The outlook is that we would like to keep the current level of capital adequacy ratio stable mostly throughout the coming year or two. That doesn't rule out that we may not necessarily be finding the uses of capital through either organic growth or M&amp;A, but we're roughly intending to stay where we are, because we like it.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost of risk, you have asked more specifically about what we see in the first months of 2012. The results, as they have been reported under the Russian Accounting Standards, which we publish every month, have been more or less stable. The thing is that, as on every call, we guide not to be judging provisioning and the cost of risks on the short period such as a month or two or sometimes even a quarter, because the recovery process that largely drives the provisioning &#x2013; provision releases, as well as the creation of provisions, because they are kind of specific rather than portfolio based, is very lumpy and uneven. So it would be wrong to generalize two months into a year.</p>
          <p>However, the overall comment is that we are comfortable with the pace at which we have been recovering our problem loans and with the pace that any new impairments have been appearing on our balance sheet. And we believe that these &#x2013; both of these paces are well controlled and manageable by ourselves. I suppose, I'm quite restricted with forward-looking statements based on the fact that our major shareholder is still keeping the intent at some point sell part of its stake on the market. Therefore, I cannot be specific with more guidance at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Rustam Botashev. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Rustam Botashev, UniCredit, Moscow. My first question is about the cost. I remember somewhere in the middle of the last year you said that you're pretty much done with increase in compensation for your employees and thus do not expect the cost to keep on growing at such a high double-digit rate.</p>
          <p>I'm just wondering, probably <mark type="ph" /> you've (14:51) restricted as well, but do you expect the operating costs for this year to &#x2013; the growth in operating cost for this year to slowdown or would you say it's going to be approximately the same as it was in 2011? That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, the compensation cost drivers, we have been saying that, yes, the effect of the catch-up to the market levels is going to be fully seen throughout 2011, which you are seeing. Of course, there's some seasonality in that which makes the fourth quarter higher than most of the &#x2013; than the three preceding quarters, because you adjust you accruals by having the variable part of employee compensation, because you're much closer to the end of the year and you can see with more certainty what kind of profits the bank is making. And therefore, you're adequately reflected in the variable part of the compensation.</p>
          <p>Some of the cost growth in the employee related line is going to continue obviously. Not only because the markets levels are continuing to develop and we have been catching up, but also because of the fact that we continue to improve the levels of quality of the personnel, middle and senior management that works in our team, as well as we invest quite a lot in training the people on the ground from the lower level of seniority who do most the front office work and the bank office work.</p>
          <p>So we have been previously saying that we do not expect that the costs for 2012 are going to grow at the same nominal pace. As in 2011, we still stay by this outlook &#x2013; stand by this outlook and not changing it. The first two months that you see on our Russian accounts are not indicative there's some seasonality again that's somewhat inflated. The run rate that we should be normally operating within any given year that is not kind of ridden with one-off events is close to low to mid teens in terms of the growth of the cost.</p>
          <p>Also, I have &#x2013; to the previous question that was asked on the capital, I would make couple of kind of smaller comments. You could see from our reporting that the full financial impact of Volksbank International purchase has not yet filtered through the capital adequacy ratio calculation. And, also, there will be some further Russian regulatory requirements with respect to how you recognize the operating risk in your capital adequacy ratio that are going live from August, in the next stage of going live from August 2012.</p>
          <p>So this full effect of the two events that kind of already known to happen that hasn't yet filtered through the calculation may change our capital adequacy ratio by not more than about 50 basis points. So that's the minor changes to the capital adequacy ratio that we're expecting this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. That was first question. Second question in terms of funding, I see big jump in terms of interbank <mark type="ph" /> warrants (19:03) in the fourth quarter. Could you please tell me is it &#x2013; like, what's the maturity, the average maturity on average duration of the funding?</p>
          <p>And do you expect &#x2013; this is first time you have such a huge interbank <mark type="ph" /> warrant (19:23) I think. Do you expect this level to stay or is it short term and you will pay it in the couple of months or quarters? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question. The nature of the somewhat explosive demand for loans in the quarter four was such that they were kind of very heavily skewed to just a few particular dates within December, simply out of the coincidence that quite a number of &#x2013; large number of borrowers were particularly geared up to certain <mark type="ph" /> decades (20:09) within the month in December.</p>
          <p>That has been well reflected and reported in our monthly December Russian accounting reports on the balance sheet, which has resulted in the &#x2013; for us, in the need to borrow for a few days some bigger amounts from the market, including interbank market and some of the auctions that the authorities like &#x2013; the monetary authorities were holding to make the short-term liquidity available.</p>
          <p>So that was all done in the course of the regular business. If you track the same numbers through the monthly reports under Russian accounting that we have published for January and February this year, you will see that the amounts that we have borrowed from the interbank and the regulatory deposit auctions have decreased dramatically as we &#x2013; again, in the normal course of business &#x2013; have been able to fund the spike in the loan growth through more traditional regular sources such as our retail deposit base and our corporate deposit base.</p>
          <p>So there was some seasonality. We usually see similar things at every year end, in about December, and then the following January and February dynamics. But it's just that this time, they were a little bit more pronounced. And one of the reasons is actually &#x2013; and they were more pronounced in all segments from SME to medium-size to large and largest.</p>
          <p>One of the many factors that have driven this is that the Russian good quality credit, the blue chips, have come back to us in the fourth quarter and said, look, the quality of our credit remains very high, but we cannot refinance some of our syndicates that we've borrowed offshore, some of the bonds that we've issued internationally that mature in the fourth quarter, simply because banks outside the Russia have just run out of money.</p>
          <p>So we had to step in and provide liquidity. We were quite happy to do that for the good names, because, again, the credit quality of the big Russian borrowers, if anything, have been improving this year, this past reported year. We have enough limit capacity for those good credits. This helps us competitively. And from the standpoint that we were able to negotiate reasonable pricing that was favorable for us and favorable for our clients on mutually agreeable terms.</p>
          <p>So that's how the story goes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And just the last one follow-up in terms of this kind of lending, it's mostly for refinancing in the end of the last year. Was it mostly short-term loans within a year of maturity or is it longer-term loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. One cannot generalize. They were whatever regular loans that any particular client may have needed at that point in time. Some of them were long term, some of them are medium, some of them are short term.</p>
          <p>From the standpoint of treasurers of our corporate clients that were planning the cash flows, we didn't see any unusual patterns. People were financing their regular business activities like working capital loans, as well as funding their investment programs or CapEx, acquisitions and various other types of projects.</p>
          <p>So it's a broad mix. There isn't a single trend in terms of the maturity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kantarovich. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It's Alex Kantarovich from JPMorgan. Anton, looking at the question of net interest margin &#x2013; and I presume that you didn't include those deposit insurance costs in the previous quarter NIM calculation &#x2013; it appears that your NIM actually expanded by around 20 basis points. Once again, if one excludes this deposit insurance cost.</p>
          <p>And I just want to confirm with you that you indeed saw a positive dynamic in Q4 on a comparable basis. And if so what was driving it? This is my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If you look at the quarter, the margin dynamics have been positive. There is some seasonality in that. We do not see repeating that much in the following quarters for a number of reasons.</p>
          <p>We have got good asset growth at good prices in the fourth quarter, but also &#x2013; which would be margin positive. But also we have spent some of that improvement on the pricing &#x2013; enhancing our pricing power in deposit attraction from the market. So therefore, on a long term basis, our margin remains &#x2013; our margin outlook remains stable, because these two trends are compensating one another so far.</p>
          <p>Some of the indication of support in what I've been saying can be seen in the first two months that we report on under Russian accounting standard. But again, there were some other kind of statistical distortions due to seasonality there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Jason Hurwitz. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. This is Jason Hurwitz from Alfa Bank. I just have one question, though it's I guess you could say in multiple parts.</p>
          <p>Could you please discuss your expectations and &#x2013; for state-related funding in the banking sector, including from the finance ministry as well as from the central bank? And as part of that, do you believe that the comments from the central bank that seem to suggest almost that Sberbank and VTB needed to raise capital, which I would say didn't seem to make sense at least in the Sberbank case, where actually more of a response to the pleas from Mr. Gref and Mr. <mark type="ph" /> Kostin (26:51) for more CBR funding?</p>
          <p>And as part of that, could you explain why you think that Mr. Gref was asking for longer duration of CBR funding? That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there is now quite a constructive dialogue between the sector and authorities as to ensure the optimal use of government resources to be applied to certain key points in the real sector through financial sector, which will ensure the right direction in the infrastructure reform in the economy, the investment into areas which will provide sustainable growth in the economy, et cetera.</p>
          <p>And part of that discussion is also how do you provide the state support to the sectors where it's needed, and that also involves in what form and at what duration.</p>
          <p>What we have seen is that the Russian Monetary Authorities and the Ministry of Finance have been pretty good in keeping the stability of the banking sector throughout the autumn of 2011 so that the market didn't skip a beat, regardless of the fact that it, at some point in time, needed quite some injections of short term liquidity.</p>
          <p>So this makes us comfortable at this point in time that however many external shocks that could be outside of Russia in the markets, Russian banking sector is very stable from the standpoint of short term liquidity, and therefore, working regularly as kind of business as usual, because there's enough short-term liquidity, and there's a well-armed &#x2013; in terms of various ways to inject it &#x2013; well-armed and very vigilant monetary authorities who do their job well.</p>
          <p>Now, the next question is, okay, how do you stimulate the growth and what kind of longer term liquidity you may need &#x2013; may be needed for it. And how do you provide it through banking sector or directly to the real sector? You do both. But what are the right proportions?</p>
          <p>Now, these discussions are not yet over. We will see where the final decisions are going to be coming out. However, we sense that this will impact the pace of growth, but availability of this money, whether they come through banking sector or outside of the banking sector directly, this is &#x2013; there's no question of any kind of fundamental threat. It is just what gear the economy is &#x2013; chooses to kind of &#x2013; to be grown at.</p>
          <p>I guess this is as much as we can say. The discussions are not yet over.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Simon Nellis from Citigroup. Can you just indicate what the impact of Troika was on profits, assets and capital adequacy, and just walk us through why the capital adequacy ratio went down over the quarter? That would be my first question.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of assets, I think it's less than 1.6% of total group assets. In terms of P&amp;L, of course, it's been just a month or two. I think we are not seeing much impact as yet.</p>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; let me just dig out the numbers from the table in front of me. Just one second. Again, simply because the numbers are so small, we're having to dig them up from quite detailed spreadsheet that we have to support our accounting. <mark type="audio gap" /> (31:40-32:15)</p>
          <p>Yes, the main proportion is that, look, we have bought in for the first part of the payment at about <mark type="ph" /> a billion bucks (32:35). And then in the disclosure, you'll see that there's some expected demands that should the business plan work in accordance with the original plans, that are kind of expected in the disclosure, overall, it's about &#x2013; it's $1 billion &#x2013; $1 billion to $1.5 billion, over RUB1.2 trillion capital that comes at about 0.31% in terms of capital adequacy ratio.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. It's Mikhail Shlemov from VTB Capital. Two questions from my side, please. The first one comes from the treasury stock, which you have acquired along with Troika, as far as I understand. What are your plans regarding ords and preference shares?</p>
          <p>And my second question is rather a follow-up on the capital adequacy. You're mentioning 60 basis points effect from the changes in the regulation in Russia and also VBI acquisition. I assume that was to the Basel Tier 1, if I'm correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you are. You are.</p>
          <p>And coming back to the treasury stock that we started showing, yes, this is the inventory for regulator client flow trading that Troika as one of the largest kind of client-driven brokers in the country, normally carries as a regular amount to support whatever client services on our stock, which is obviously &#x2013; in terms of the daily trading volumes, is the largest share in the Russian market.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the inventories are relatively high for Troika's business. So it just got consolidated directly as we're consolidating the Troika's balance sheet. There's nothing else in that. There's no treasury shares sitting on the balance sheet of the bank itself. We haven't been doing any buybacks.</p>
          <p>So we expect this kind of an inventory to sit there on Troika's books, plus, minus, whatever regular fluctuations that you would expect from a similar type of liquid positions from them. So it's kind of business as usual. There's no particular plans to do anything else with this.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. This is Dmitry from Goldman. Just following up on the capital, you said 30 basis points on Troika and 60 basis points on VBI or 60 basis points together?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:55) has happened already, because we have recorded Troika.</p>
          <p>We also said that 60 basis points is something that we're going to see throughout 2012, because of the two anticipated events. They're quite certain, so it's not &#x2013; the situation is that the impact of Volksbank International and the impact and the changes of how much federal bank requires us to allocate capital to operating risk. Because as you know, Russian Central Bank step by step rolls out the way you account for operating risk in capital adequacy ratio.</p>
          <p>So the next step is in August 2012, and we've already calculated what the impact of it is going to be. Which is giving you guidance on how this will impact our capital adequacy ratio in 2012.</p>
          <p>So 0.3% is already in. 0.6% to be expected.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Svetlana Kovalskaya from Renaissance. Just a follow-up question on your margins. So could you please update us on what trends you're seeing now in loan and deposit pricing? What do you expect for the next few quarters and what do you think is going to be the indication for your yield on earning assets and your cost of funds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, we've been very generic in saying that overall we see margins as stable on the horizon this year. However, I cannot be more specific in the forward-looking statements for the reasons that I've already mentioned. However, what we see in the past two, three months suggests that in terms of retail deposits costs, the kind of competitive growth for cost of the deposits is slowing down. We see it as a good sign. However, this doesn't actually mean that this will change. But that is the situation that we see kind of in terms of how the competitors are behaving themselves now.</p>
          <p>Now, if you look at how the first quarter is going to stack up on our books, because there's obviously time lag in recognizing whatever marketing moves you do through your P&amp;L, because we started re-pricing, we, as well as the rest of the market, started re-pricing retail deposits from sort of the fourth quarter, and we made a move to in January or February. Therefore, in terms of the P&amp;L costs, because you asked for the impact, it is going to be felt in terms of the increasing interest expense.</p>
          <p>So in terms of asset pricing, there has been pronounced growth in loans interest rates over the past 10, 12, 15 months in everywhere except the blue chips, the biggest kind of 500 companies in the country where the rates have remained competitive and therefore relatively low, because these guys are referenced against the cost of funding globally, which has been reducing. So that's the dynamics.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Maciej Szczesny from Merrill Lynch. I wanted to ask about the coverage ratio. You seemed to be guiding for relatively low loan loss charges also in 2012, and I was wondering if that can be achieved with fairly similar coverage or do you expect to achieve it at the expense of coverage? I mean, obviously, coverage is currently higher than what you have stated in the past as the intended range for the NPL coverage. So just curious on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, you're operating with the constructs that suggest that we actively manage the coverage. Intended coverage at the expense of coverage, this is pretty much on every quarterly call in the past six or eight quarters we repeatedly say. The coverage ratio is not what we manage. We manage the risk and the adequate provisioning of the risk on a specific loan-by-loan basis. And therefore, the provisioning cost is a result of two things; new provisions created because some of the situations, both corporate and retail portfolios decrease in quality and require more provisioning against them, and provision write-downs if the loans are kind of beyond recovery, which is the tiniest part of ours in our case.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, of course, the recoveries when you get the cash back or the loan gets back into fully normal and you're confident that you can release the provision back to P&amp;L. All the three processes are separate. They're totally bottom up. They are stacking up at the current levels, because, well, this is just the way our portfolio has been behaving.</p>
          <p>What I can comment separately on is the three components. The new provision creation have been more or less regular and normal. It has &#x2013; it is speeding up, because we are lending faster and therefore the bigger your loan portfolio at the same quality in terms of percentage of that situation that you get from it, the absolute numbers have been growing in ruble terms. So we're seeing no surprises here.</p>
          <p>Write-offs is a very small number. We're normally very good at recovering things and we never let go until it's fully hopeless and therefore since the past crisis it's only &#x2013; year got three, four after May 2009. So it's too early to give up on most of the situations that were created on the wave of that crisis.</p>
          <p>And normal recoveries, we have been working towards plan. Our plans are very aggressive. Our recovery rates are very much comparable to what you will get in developed banking sectors with more sophisticated legal environments and more efficient judicial systems.</p>
          <p>So we pride ourselves on the recovery levels that are better than anyone else in the market in Russia. And that is going in accordance to plan. We have very, in our recovery strategies, we have very conservative assumptions in the financial models that actually imply quite negative scenarios on a macro basis. Therefore &#x2013; and the market situation is currently better than those assumptions. Therefore, we're quite comfortable that our pace of recovery is more or less sustainable unless there's something really negative happening to the country in the nearest term, which so far, no one is observing that.</p>
          <p>So that's just the way it works. We're not going to be doing something at the expense of the coverage ratio, because that would imply that we try to manage it down and therefore manipulate our P&amp;L. But, we're not in the business of doing that. We're in the business of earning money.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Olga Belenkaya, Sovlink. Could you clarify &#x2013; do you retain the plan to increase the land bank portfolio in about 25% this year that was set in December meeting in corporate segment and retail too. It's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the other, some &#x2013; your possible highlights on VSPO, the placement of the central bank stake and do you have some intentions on raising fresh capital in one or two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of loan portfolio guidance, we believe that the sector, the banking sector overall is expecting to grow at kind of below 20%. We have always historically shown growth above the sector outlook. However, again, I am restricted in how much guidance I can have. We're not standing by the 25% number, if at all it is going to give you somewhat lower. We &#x2013; that was question number one.</p>
          <p>The second was VSPO. Of course, I'm even more restricted to comment on that one. So, I guess, the general stance remains the same. Once the market conditions are favorable and selling shareholder sees that they are favorable for such a transaction, it is ready to happen at any time and I'll just refer to what our CEO said two weeks ago speaking to the press after the supervisory board meeting. When he said, well, there's equal probability it was happening before summer, after summer or maybe even 2013, depending on the market conditions.</p>
          <p>The third question was on fresh capital on the horizon of the year two. Well, so far, we see ourselves adequately capitalized. As I have mentioned answering earlier questions, we don't see major things in terms of the use of our capital hitting us immediately. Well, whether we may need to on the horizon of as long as two years, I think it's a bit too early to say depending upon on how the business grows. So whether there's any other potential uses that we might find.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Mark Rubinstein from METROPOL in Moscow. Thanks for the results rundown. Just a question on what do you see as major growth points in 2012? Any particular products, let's say, any particular products on the retail side? I know you started doing credit cards. That's been growing very fast. Any other? Do you have products that you can mention that would be a major growth points this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far we have been showing pretty healthy dynamics in retail lending and within that the biggest and the &#x2013; actually, the most lucrative in terms of the margin products are plain vanilla consumer unsecured lending. Secondly, it's credit card, as you have mentioned. Mortgages as well, actually. But, credit cards, we started from zero a couple of years ago, we're really beyond 5 million cards as of February, which is &#x2013; to put it in a perspective, this is in 140 million-populated country therefore, there's quite a bit of penetration that the whole sector needs to be doing there, but we're number one with 5 million at the moment.</p>
          <p>Also, to put it into context, we are, I think around 70 million debit plastic cards. We're the biggest issuer of debit plastic cards in Europe since 2008, actually, of all the European banks. So the &#x2013; retail is healthy. So far similar dynamics are shown by SME sector in terms of lending. We also sense that large and largest lending in corporate segment is going to be quite healthy, although not maybe as fast as the ones that I have mentioned.</p>
          <p>We continue to put a lot of effort into non-interest fees and commission business and that includes transactional stuff like online banking and electronic transactions, et cetera, and earning money from using our distribution network &#x2013; branch network for distribution of third-party products like insurance, which have been yielding us relatively good results or quite healthy results in the past couple of years.</p>
          <p>Now, there's one comment I would like to make vis-&#xE0;-vis with respect to non-interest income fees and commissions. Because the dynamics of the situation are such that we are getting quite successful in transferring a lot of the kind of plain vanilla transactions from physical branch execution into remote channels like online banking, telephone banking, Internet banking, terminals and cash machines and ATMs. The dynamics are such that we have put up some prohibitive tariffs on doing those transactions in physical locations and branches where the alternatives are available online.</p>
          <p>And therefore, these high tariffs have been contributing quite positively, but as our client base have at a very good pace been converging to online banking and to other remote channels. Those yield, of course, much cheaper tariffs and much less of a cash inflow in terms of the growth of the fees and commission.</p>
          <p>However, that is &#x2013; in nominal terms a reduction in the fees and commissions income line or rather slower growth, I mean, it has been growing double digit quite comfortably, but a slower growth, which is compensated through other lines because that means that we use the people who are processing those robotic type transactions. To retrain them and to start using them to cross sell other products to the retail and corporate clients and to generate us more top line business. And that effort has only been starting in the past year or so, but the full &#x2013; positive impact of that we're going to see in the coming years as we continue to grow the business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, guys. Sorry, because I assume to be disconnected the first time. I just wanted to ask you a few things just following up on the capital.</p>
          <p>So it feels that you will end up with around 11%. Are you comfortable being around 11%, because clearly your growth accelerates, you may be in the territory where you would not have the usual surplus. I mean, what is the threshold? I mean how do you feel about that? Because clearly getting from 13% to 11% is quite a big move.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Firsthand, look, Dmitry, you need to take this into consideration. When you ask us a question, you need to take into consideration within the context of what's going elsewhere in the banking sector in Russia and outside. If you ask about our kind of psychological comfort level, yes, we are comfortable, because 11% and a bit is hell of a comfortable capital adequacy ratio that probably not that many banks in the world are showing.</p>
          <p>Yes, it was a move downwards but it was planned and executed in accordance to that plan. I don't think we are going to be doing similar big steps on top of that as I have mentioned before. But I don't think I have much to add to that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also &#x2013; sorry, Dmitry. One thing is that again, as we have been demonstrating in the past two, three years, our capital generating capacity is quite healthy and fast as well. Look, we're a $10 billion a year company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in the fourth quarter, the risk weighted assets actually grew faster than loans and assets. Why is that? It's just because the loans and percentage of assets were going up or what? Shall we expect these dynamics to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is actually, I think, rather &#x2013; I may need to recheck some of the calculations, because you're asking really sophisticated things that we may not necessarily have here in front of us and we need to check within our models, but I think most of the impact is actually due to the factor that I've already mentioned, that the recognition of operating risks in risk weighted assets due to the step changes that Central Bank introduces requires us more higher risk weights on our assets, hence there's a bit of different dynamics there.</p>
          <p>But, I'm actually &#x2013; I may need to come back to you on this. This is kind of the main factor that <mark type="ph" /> were now, given how (55:46) precisely &#x2013; that count a dozen numbers and whether maybe some other smaller factors that contribute to that, we may need to recheck.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If you don't mind, because what I'm seeing right now in my number is at credit risk on risk weighted assets was up 17% Q-o-Q and the assets overall were up 13.5%. So clearly the risk weight within the assets was going up. So it's either because your loans were growing faster or maybe some other things, which I'm not aware of.  <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:17) come back on that, that would be good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you can check that during the usual channels with our Head of IR <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:25).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And the very final one is loan to deposit ratio. So loan to deposit ratio went to 106% and I think in the past you're obviously were even higher than that and some point you were 110%. You do not want to move higher than one plan or you actually would be comfortable with even higher ratio if you need to. How do you think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly, we measure it actually not in the gross terms like you just mentioned, but in net terms. I mean, in net, it is below 100%. I think the ones that we're showing in on our presentation on the account, it is from 92%, 93% to 97%. And to us, there is no particular magic whether you are 99% or 101% actually or around 100% plus, minus 5 percentage points is not particularly critical, because the thing is that the scale of the deposits franchise that we got allows us to do much bigger things in terms of growth that we have been doing in the past couple of years.</p>
          <p>Also, our ability to keep harmonious growth in assets and liabilities and in retail and corporate deposits is kind of very strong. We have barely started using our pricing power on deposits really. We've just scratched the surface. We may not necessarily even go much further to make sure that our pace of growth in retail deposits and corporate deposits is very close to what it &#x2013; what we're showing loan growth.</p>
          <p>But, should we need to, the depth of a gap between us and the rest of the competition is so enormous that we were not particularly worried that we will have to go to loan to deposits ratios very far away from 100% to sustain the growth.</p>

          <p>Hello. This is Olga Veselova from Merrill Lynch. I have a couple of questions. My first question is about corporate credit demand this year. If you could share with us your view in which sectors you see the demand, where you start to see deceleration if any really. And what trends in the demand you would highlight if borrowers ask for more refinancing or more specialized loans, so any color would be very good. And I'm not asking to compare with the spike of demand in the fourth quarter, but with the normal period. That's my first question. And second question is...</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Yes, yes. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The demand is healthy. It is pretty well spread across all sectors and segments. We don't see any particular unusual patterns in the demand behavior as compared to what you would see normally, again not comparing to the spike as you have asked. But normally on the backdrop of the Russian economy growing at about 3%, 4% GDP growth year-on-year relatively low inflation as we see now.</p>
          <p>People are much more prudent in the way they borrow from the corporate <mark type="ph" /> kind of real sector side (01:00:26). Because following the crisis, let's say, in 2008 and 2009, people are no longer trying run that big liquidity gaps. And all those <mark type="ph" /> certain (01:00:42) funded five-year investments of CapEx spend with just one year, rolling, short-term cheap bank money.</p>
          <p>Besides even if they would have wanted to do that, I don't think the banking sector is that naive anymore and they're not accommodating that type of request anymore. In terms of the balance of &#x2013; so that in fact, the balance of how much short on working capital demand is there and the long-term capital demand. I think the proportion is quite healthy.</p>
          <p>We said that the supply is not particularly healthy because, of course, short-term money <mark type="ph" /> are being (01:01:23) better accessible by the banking sector than the long-term money, as we've discussed earlier in some of the earlier questions. But then the situation is not necessarily kind of extremely critical. It just relates to a bit faster, a bit slower pace of growth for the sector, retail sector or the banking sector.</p>
          <p>So, other than that, we don't see anything particularly unusual in the behavioral patterns of loan demand. Retail, of course, continues to grow quite nicely, we're pretty happy, but that's it.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Alan Webborn from SocGen. You mentioned earlier in your presentation that you're able to do some business with big Russian corporate from the basis that foreign banks were not able to achieve the refinancing that these banks wanted. Could I just ask you two things about that, one, whether that's contributing to the higher margins on your overall corporate business or you just happy to get that business on board?</p>
          <p>And do you think with a temporary phenomenon at year-end, or do you think that that's going to persist? And the question is does LTRA1 and LTRA2 give some of the foreign banks, the European banks, for example, a better opportunity to compete with you again or do you think that there's a structural trend in terms of there being less banks able and willing to finance large Russian corporates from abroad?

I am hearing that now, the bonds that, for example, the Russian government is trying to close &#x2013; I haven't checked the situation since the morning, but I think I have heard from the market that it was going pretty well. So the feedback from the syndicated banks that we're talking to in the market was that the market is kind of in risk-on mode, and maybe rather than risk-off. And maybe the fact that the longer term money are being available to European banks is contributing to that is standing true.</p>
          <p>But equally so, look, for very little fundamental reason and much more for emotional reasons, the market in the autumn was risk of Russia was fundamentally -- they haven't been changing really that much in terms of Russian macro or fundamentally even in European banking sector macro. I think most of the things that were happening in European banking sector are again more sentimental and emotional nature.</p>
          <p>The situation was pretty grave fundamentally, but it hasn't really changed much lately. People were just recognizing, oh, it really isn't that bad. So the access through external market is a bit of a fickle thing in the recent six months to nine months. And therefore, it will be not wise to make any specific projections on that.</p>
          <p>But overall, we &#x2013; coming back to the very first part of your question, we <mark type="ph" /> have assured (1:05:18) some positive impact on pricing. If not, that just we're blindly getting for market share in good, large Russian big credits.</p>
          <p>Firstly, because we already have a good share of the wallets, we believe, historically we've always had. So what is the question is a few percentage points on top of the average that we're getting besides competitively the situation is such that there isn't much competition, not only externally but domestically.</p>
          <p>So yes, the pricing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:05:52) on our part, of course, but there were some favorable impact.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. It's Ronny here from Keefe, Bruyette. Most of the questions have been answered, so just a quick follow-up on the regulatory changes. You said it's going to be phased in. What is going to be the full impact of the regulatory changes ahead? And secondly, just whether you could confirm any thoughts on your dividend. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The full effect is actually somewhere between 0.3 and 0.6 of a percentage point and that's operational risk. I think this is kind of public data -- can be easily triangulated and re-checked. This is our assessment in terms of the calculations.</p>
          <p>The dividends we have proposed as the management to the supervisory board a payout ratio of 15% &#x2013; actually 15.3% this year on the results of 2011. The supervisory board has agreed with us and has taken a decision to recommend that level of the payout to be approved by our AGM, which is going to be early June.</p>
          <p>Also I would like to say one thing. The lady that was asking the question, two questions before. I said two, but we've only given her a chance to ask one. I think it's from Merrill Lynch. So if Mrs. Veselova, so, if you could please plug her back in so that she could ask the second question.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My second question was about outlook on asset yields. I assume the fact that there was a seven &#x2013; small 7 basis point decline of asset yield in &#x2013; of loan yields in the fourth quarter. I mean, is that &#x2013; your increases of interest rates on asset side and loans were not really material. And my question is, when you would expect the increases will start to materialize and we'll have stronger and more visible asset on loan yields this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a question we were anticipating and there's the magical statistics that you need to be taking to account. The yields are calculated on the basis of the balance sheet that has had a very unusual high spike in the fourth quarter. Therefore, if you average the yield out, because it's a formula, the denominator has grown that high so that the P&amp;L effects from all those nice assets that we've got in very close to the end of the year, in fact most of them in December, has mathematically resulted in an effect as if the yield has fallen on the fourth quarter but actually it didn't, so we will see in quarters one, two, and then a little bit in quarter three that the yield bouncing back if you calculate that on the same basis.</p>
          <p>So we're therefore saying, yes, the overall interest rate differential has been stable to positive. So it is just a bit of statistical glitch because of a so sharp spike in the volume in December.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Ivan Kachkovski from Aton. Couple of questions, probably quick questions from me.</p>
          <p>First one, cost of risk on loan book, I understand, obviously, the reluctance of any guidance going forward but what if we take a look, say in the last six months to nine months, what's the average, I mean, cost of risk on your new loan books, on your new loan issuance on retail side and on corporate side. That's the first question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually difficult to generalize because different segments and sectors in corporate generates different numbers. In terms of retail, it is quite low. It's, again, less than &#x2013; cost of risk is less than 1% on retail portfolio. It remains to be of a quite high quality.</p>
          <p>Also, the thing is that, for corporate sector, loans issued in 2010 and 2011 are particularly peculiar ones because they're just after the very tough years in the cycle of 2008 and 2009, and therefore we did have very conservative underwriting standards and quite conservative risk appetite back at that period because the macro situation was a little bit kind of transitional. Does it go up, does it stay there, will it get back to the bad times. So therefore it is a bit too early to generalize the cost of risk on that vintage of corporate loans, 2010, 2011 specifically. It will see &#x2013; it will show itself through in the coming year or two.</p>
          <p>It is not that we sense that the situation is kind of a bit more stable than that and also we have accumulated since then a bit better data through the cycle and post-crisis years that allow us to be kind of accepting higher-levels of risk at &#x2013; and therefore compensating it with the right pricing of risk that would in nominal terms kind of increase the cost of risk, but over the right credit premiums that we're going to begin.</p>
          <p>So this is a bit of a dynamic parameter. I'd say we, you and us, the investor community, analyst community and us, are going to start to have meaningful conversation, whilst in terms of through the cycle, cost of risk and how do we manage it quarter-on-quarter only after more or less the end of 2013, because by the end of 2013 we will recover pretty much everything that was there to recover for us in material terms on the vintage of loans that may have become problem loans back in 2008 and 2009, because that will finally remove any statistical assumptions from our final losses model. Hence the recovery cycle is really three years or four years after the crisis and in the first couple of years, you recover much easier money.</p>
          <p>Therefore anything that we recovered in 2009 &#x2013; 2010 and 2011 is much easier money to recover because they're kind of first two years after the default. And then years three and four, which is 2012 and 2013, you'll recover big money but they are much more difficult to recover because the time, it kind of takes longer. Therefore it's only once you're done with that, you can say, okay, I now fully understand what is my through-the-cycle cost of the risk, and not having some of the assumptions on how those recovery strategies are working.</p>
          <p>So I can only give very general kind of color like I have done by now and then from 2013 we will be talking real stuff, the formula stuff.</p>
          <p>We actually have about five minutes left till 5:30 Moscow time. So we probably have time for either two short questions or one kind of longer one.</p>

          <p>Yes, hi. Alexander Rozhetskin, HSBC. First of all, thank you very much for the presentation. I have just one question. Hopefully it will be fairly brief. Given that you issued a Eurobond and given your current prepayments for 2012, do you have any plans tapping the Eurobond market anytime this year? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we may do that. I will confirm that we will stick to our priorities that pricing is the highest priority. Volume may be secondary. And therefore timing is the derivative <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:16:02)</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Bob Kommers, Deutsche Bank. Hi. I have a question regarding the privatization. I would like to quote the CEO graph a few months ago saying that the preparations for the privatization will start when we're getting at RUB100. We're now at RUB96.6. So I just wanted to have your word on this. I mean, are you reiterating the statement of the CEO and consequently, is the privatization not going to happen at the current share price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We all know our old friend, Bob, who is asking provocative questions every now and then. Look, we have already been at RUB100 per share about three times in the past three months. But that doesn't imply that all of a sudden we start our preparations and then stop them as it gets lower and then start them again. Look, we were not in &#x2013; less jokingly, no, we're not going to be making any specific outlook as to what will be the kind of the market conditions that would trigger the shareholder, the selling shareholder to get out to the market.</p>
          <p>Again, the fact that we already touched RUB100 and a few rubles above, it's just going to prove that. So please don't make us &#x2013; make any other statements that would potentially mislead people about that.</p>
          <p>Okay with that, we're at 5:30, however, don't get disappointed if you didn't get to ask your question. Our investor relations team stands by. They're here around this table fully represented to have taken in everything that is of interest to you. They will labor to have more details handy to answer any questions that you may direct to them via telephone or e-mail or usual contacts that are on our website.</p>
          <p>Again, thank you for all your attention, for your knowledge of our numbers and the depths of your analysis. We hope it has been useful and we wish you all the best and we'll meet you on the subsequent calls. Thank you very much.</p>
