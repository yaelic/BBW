          <p>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Enel Nine Months 2012 results. This is Luca Torchia speaking, Head of Investor Relations. Here with me, we have Mr. Luigi Ferraris, the Chief Financial Officer. We will start this event with the usual first nine months results presentation and then we will head into Q&amp;A session. I remind you that we have colleagues of yours who are connected from the web or logged in on a conference call basis. And we also have media operators who are connected to this call just for the listening purpose.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and let me hand over to Mr. Luigi Ferraris.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luca, and good evening again, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our nine months 2012 results presentation. First, as usual, I would like to start by providing a quick overview of the electricity demand evolution in the areas in which we operate. Electricity demand evolution during the first nine months of the year, excluding adjustment for working days and temperatures, continues to be weak in Italy and Spain, resulting in declines of 2.3% and 0.7% respectively. Whilst on the other hand, the electricity demand in Latin America continued to show an increasing in the region of 4.8%, or 1.5% if we look at what is going on in Slovakia.</p>
          <p>Let's now start with the presentation on the financial results with our key financial highlights on slide number four. Group EBITDA decreased by 3.9% versus the same period of 2011. This is an improvement versus the trend shown during the first half 2012. This improvement takes into account the positive contribution of Iberia and Latin America, Russia, as well as the Infrastructure and Network division. The latter also includes a net positive impact related to certain regulatory items recorded during the third quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Let me also highlight that the nine months 2012 numbers include the perimeter effect on Generation and Energy Management, Infrastructure and Networks, and the International division by a total amount of &#x20AC;121 million.</p>
          <p>In addition to this, during nine months 2011, we recorded some positive non-recurring items for a total amount of about &#x20AC;400 million. Net of this adjusted recurring EBITDA is substantially unchanged versus last year. Group net income amounted to &#x20AC;2.8 billion or down 19.6% versus nine-months 2011, mainly as a result of the above-mentioned lower EBITDA and higher tax rate.</p>
          <p>Group net ordinary income equals to &#x20AC;2.6 billion and takes into account the capital gain on the disposal of our stake in Terna for a total amount of about &#x20AC;180 million. Net debt has increased during the nine-months 2012 by about &#x20AC;1.8 billion to &#x20AC;46.5 billion versus the end of December 2011. I will provide more details on this later on during the course of the presentation.</p>
          <p>Now moving to slide number five, EBIT decreased by about 9% mainly due to the combined effect of lower EBITDA and higher depreciation and amortization versus 2011. Our net financial charges stand at &#x20AC;2.3 billion, registering a slight decrease of about 0.5% versus last year. This variation is mainly the result of a decrease of other items of &#x20AC;107 million mainly related to the pre-tax capital gain from Terna disposal, partially offset by the revaluation of retirement and other funds, and the positive non-recurring item tax resolution in Endesa recorded during the course of 2011.</p>
          <p>This has been partially compensated for by higher interest charges of &#x20AC;95 million, mainly as a result of keeping higher cash available during the periods according to our liquidity policy. Our average cost of gross debt stands at 4.9%, substantially stable versus last year. Finally, group's tax rate increased to 38.9% in nine months 2012 versus 33.8% in nine months 2011.</p>
          <p>Let's continue with an update on forward sales on chart number six. In Italy, we have hedged about 95% of our 2012 production at an average base load price of &#x20AC;75 per megawatt hour, and about 80% of 2013 production at an average base load price of &#x20AC;74 per megawatt hour. In Spain, we are fully hedged for 2012 and 45% for 2013 at an average price of about &#x20AC;58 per megawatt hour when it comes to 2012 and &#x20AC;56 for 2013, excluding ancillary services and capacity payment. In Latin America, we are 80% hedged for 2012 and 70% for 2013. In Slovakia, we are 100% hedged for 2012 and about 85% for 2013 at an average price of &#x20AC;55 per megawatt hour for 2012 and &#x20AC;52 for 2013.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at our overall EBITDA evolution on slide number seven. I will go through the EBITDA of each of our divisions in detail, starting as usual with Generation and Energy Management Italy on slide number eight. Overall, divisional EBITDA in the nine months 2012 was about &#x20AC;1 billion, declining by &#x20AC;630 million or 38% versus nine months 2011, excluding perimeter and revaluation effects of about &#x20AC;265 million, EBITDA decreased by 22%. This was mainly the result of a decrease in the Generation margin of &#x20AC;162 million, mainly caused by lower hydro production and a combined effect of lower clean spark spread in CCGT volumes, partially compensated for by higher margins and volumes on coal, the positive results in trading and gas margin, and a decline of other items for &#x20AC;260 million, in which the positive contribution from ancillary services has been more than offset by some positive operating non-recurring items which affected nine months 2011.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the EBITDA evolution analysis of the Market division on chart number nine. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;494 million, an improvement on the already strong level of profitability over the last year. This has been possible, thanks to an increase of &#x20AC;32 million in the free markets in which lower electricity margins had been more than compensated for by higher volumes sold in electricity, higher gas margin and a more competitive product mix. An increase of &#x20AC;16 million in the regulated electricity market, mainly thanks to higher margins partially compensated for by the ongoing reduction in volumes sold on the regulated markets related to the liberalization process.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide number 10, on domestic Infrastructure and Networks division. EBITDA in the nine months 2012 amounted to &#x20AC;3.335 billion, increasing by 6.6% versus last year. This is the net effect of the following: the positive effect of &#x20AC;84 million in the energy margin, mainly thanks to the tariff review and higher number of clients, partially compensated for by some negative regulatory items; lower connection fees by &#x20AC;79 million; and an increase in other items of &#x20AC;200 million, mainly thanks to the positive one-off impact of some regulatory revenues related to the reimbursement of past pension funds contributions, partially compensated for by the positive one-off effect related to a personnel provision release recorded last year in the first half of 2011 and some other provisions.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide number 11 on International operations. EBITDA decreased by &#x20AC;96 million versus 2011, taking into account the perimeter effect of the assets sold in Bulgaria during the first half 2011. Excluding this effect of &#x20AC;82 million, EBITDA remains largely unchanged. In particular, Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne recorded a decrease of &#x20AC;12 million as higher unit margins were more than compensated for by the positive effect of CO2 rights sold last year.</p>
          <p>Southeastern Europe recorded a decrease of &#x20AC;90 million explained by the above-mentioned perimeter effect on Bulgaria and low results in Romania mainly related to foreign exchange translation effects. France and Belgium decreased &#x20AC;21 million versus last year, mainly related to lower margins in France partially compensated for by Belgian operations' performance.</p>
          <p>Finally, Russia increased by &#x20AC;27 million as a result of higher volumes sold in generation activities, thanks to the two new CCGTs commissioned in the second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>Let's now focus on Endesa's results on slide number 12. First as usual, let me remind you that the numbers we report in this slide and in the following one are the results of the application of Enel Group's accounting principle, which might differ from Endesa's principles due to local standards. The Iberian division has recorded an EBITDA in line versus last year. This has been the outcome of an increase of &#x20AC;156 million in the liberalized business mainly explained by higher unit margins, thanks to better prices to final clients and higher generation output with a better energy mix, partially offset by a decrease in the last-resort tariff. Regulated business decreased by &#x20AC;200 million mainly due to lower distribution revenues after the recent changes of the regulatory framework. And finally, other items for &#x20AC;69 million mainly related to lower operational costs.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to Latin America on slide number 13. EBITDA in Latin American division remains unchanged versus 2011. This has been mainly the result of a decrease of &#x20AC;176 million in the Generation business, mainly due to lower margin in Chile, which is still suffering from the slow recovery of hydro, and Argentina, which has been effected by lower output, higher fixed cost and no extension in 2012 of some regulatory agreements. This has been partially compensated for by higher volumes in Brazil and Colombia supported by higher hydro output, and higher sales prices and capacity payments in Peru.</p>
          <p>We also report an increase of &#x20AC;122 million in the Distribution business, following higher volumes distributed in all the countries in which we operate and 377,000 new customers added during the first nine months of the year; and finally, a decrease of &#x20AC;59 million of other items.</p>
          <p>Let's now review Enel Green Power on slide number 14. EBITDA decreased &#x20AC;59 million or 5% versus last year, taking into account the fair value revaluation of net assets in <mark type="ph" /> Sehaza (13:39) and the Star Lake plant expropriation, which positively impacted nine months 2011 EBITDA by total amount of &#x20AC;181 million. Excluding these effects, EBITDA increases by about 12%. In particular, Italy and Europe increased &#x20AC;42 million, thanks to our higher volumes in Europe despite the shortfall in hydro production, in particular, in Italy. Iberia and Latin America increased &#x20AC;61 million mainly as a result of higher volumes in both areas. North America increased &#x20AC;21 million, thanks to higher volumes.</p>
          <p>As far as our net debt is concerned, you see on slide number 15 that net of discontinued operations, overall net debt stands at &#x20AC;46.5 billion. The &#x20AC;1.8 billion increase during the period has been mainly affected by the payment of the Robin Hood Tax for &#x20AC;600 million and by the foreign exchange effect for &#x20AC;300 million. Net of these items, the increase in net debt is substantially in line with the seasonality typically seen during the first nine months of each year.</p>
          <p>Also, our liquidity profile is more than adequate. During the first nine-months of 2012 we have been able to raise total funding for about &#x20AC;11 billion at an average weighted cost of about 4% and an average maturity of more than seven years. We can now count on about &#x20AC;21.4 billion of available liquidity, including the latest bonds issuance made in October for &#x20AC;2.4 billion, which already covers existing debt maturities throughout 2015.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of the year, we expect to benefit from the usual operating cash flow improvement, which coupled with a positive contribution coming from the ongoing extraordinary activities will improve our net debt position, thus confirming our target on net debt at about &#x20AC;43 billion.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and now let's open the Q&amp;A session.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We are ready to start the session and we have people who posted their question on the web and I understand the first one in line is Alberto Gandolfi from UBS. So please, Alberto, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi, good afternoon, Luca, Luigi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have three please. When it comes to your debt, can you please elaborate what you're going to see in terms of working capital improvement in Q4 versus cash flow generation? So basically can you elaborate a little bit the different bits and pieces what you think CapEx is going to be in Q4, and what is going to come from working capital?</p>
          <p>Then it's actually similar question looking at 2013. What are you going to see &#x2013; what are you seeing right now in terms of investments for next year? What is the level of change in working capital we should be expecting? Because in the past few years, it was about negative by &#x20AC;1 billion but you have been suggesting that this might improve. And therefore, what you think you can generate organically in terms of net cash flow generation next year.</p>
          <p>And lastly, it's a little bit more like a directional question on earnings. Next year, you have fiscal measures in Spain. Power demand most likely negative again or anyway, quite weak. Prices, the hedging prices you have explained very clearly in your slide are below the 2012 levels and yet some of the divisions grow, but those are smaller parts of the business. So should we correctly assume an EBITDA decline versus this year and what type of offset can you implement to try and avoid that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Alberto, as you can imagine, I cannot answer the second and third question. I can only tell you that, of course, we are waiting for the final law in Spain regarding the major change in the regulatory framework. We are, of course, discussing and acting also legally in order to improve the current draft law. We have to wait the finalization of this law and after that, we can be more specific about &#x2013; on the impact on our group.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the trend of the electricity demand, well, you have seen in the number, Italy is worse than originally planned. But the numbers that we are reporting here net of some</p>
          <p>recurring items are showing, I would say, a resilience and when it comes to 2012, I am confident that the target that we placed, which was equal to &#x20AC;1.3 billion in the Generation business should be there.</p>
          <p>With regards to the 2013, I'm sorry but you have to be patient in waiting for our presentation in March. Let's talk about 2012. We are going to reach the target at the end of the year. Well, first of all, let's not forget that we have already finalized and closed the disposal of Ireland, plus some other minor disposal for a total consideration of &#x20AC;400 million. On top of this, as usual, our working capital at the end of the year is going to improve because we are going to see an acceleration of the CapEx activity as we have done last year in the previous year as well, but the payment will fall into the first quarter of the following year. This is the normal dynamic.</p>
          <p>And on top of this, we are going of course to take advantage of the winter season in December in terms of cash incoming from our invoicing activity. So what we should expect by the end of the year is, for sure, a reduction in our CapEx program versus what we have already declared, to take into account, of course, the change in the economic environment and the electricity demand evolution for few hundred million euro and we expect to reach a level of working capital negative, which means that is funding us in line with 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Luigi, forgive me, this follow up, but to turn the question slightly differently, if I see slide 15, cash flow from operations, CapEx and so on, before dividends and before disposals in nine months, you generated less than &#x20AC;300 million. And I know there was tariff deficit in Spain, but that's mostly going to disappear because of taxation and fiscal measures. So what I'm trying to assess is that should &#x2013; for &#x2013; I know you're not going to comment on next year, we need to wait for your industrial plan, but basically, how come you think &#x2013; or what can you do to generate more cash organically and deleverage organically faster than you have been doing in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we look at the end of this year, we are going to be cash positive in terms of our operating cash flow. Why that? Because of the EBITDA that we are going to generate in the fourth quarter because of the dynamic of the working capital that I mentioned to you, because this &#x20AC;8.4 billion taking into account a deterioration in the first part of the year of the working capital because of the dynamics of the CapEx and payable &#x2013;  the accounts payable evolution. By the end of the year, we expect to be positive in terms of net cash flow from operation. So we expect a slight contribution to net debt reduction which is coming from the operating cash flow from the disposal program. And also, let's not forget that in the fourth part of the year, we are not going to pay anymore the dividends as last year, so we should be in a position to cover accordingly all the cash out.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Antonella Bianchessi, Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good evening. Just a few more questions. First of all is on the gas contract renegotiation, we have seen everyone renegotiating the contracts, can you just update where you are and when we can expect some news from this front? The second thing is on the securitization of the tariff deficit in Spain, can you just provide your view on the timing if you are confident that there is a commitment from the government to do something by the end of the year?</p>
          <p>The last question is really on the full year guidance, you are talking about &#x20AC;16.5 billion of EBITDA, but this of course would imply a hugely weak Q4. So is this because you are too cautious on the guidance or there is something happening at year end? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Antonella, let me start talking about the first question which regards the renegotiation with our gas supplier. Of course, those renegotiations are in process. I cannot be, of course, specific about the outcome of that. So what I can tell you that we are seeing some positive impacts on the price with one of the biggest supplier. We are getting more flexibility in terms of take-or-pay conditions. But I mean we are, of course, negotiating with all the three, four major supplier of ours. We are proceeding quite well, it's too early to provide a number, but what I can tell you that for now, we expect at least some improvement in price from one of the big supplier. And we expect to gain more flexibility in order to manage the current low level of demand.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the securitization of the tariff deficit, well, I can only report a news that I read before entering this call in Reuters, if I'm not wrong, which is saying that basically the FADE has authorized a possible issuance in these weeks or the following weeks, depending of course on market condition for a total consideration between &#x20AC;500 million up to a maximum of &#x20AC;1 billion. So we are talking about an institutional issuance, which has a higher size than the private placement that we have seen in the previous days. I think it's a positive sign in the direction of finalizing the placement of the &#x20AC;3 billion that we have already, as you know, presented to the FADE, they have been fully approved of so they are ready to be placed on the market. So we think that this is a first step in starting again to place on the market. We'll see in the coming days, I think it's a positive sign.</p>
          <p>Full-year EBITDA, &#x20AC;16.5 is the target that we do have. I told you, of course, I do confirm it, I told you that our Infrastructure and Networks division took advantage of a very positive regulatory item, which we have negotiated with our authority, which allowed us to receive the reimbursements of all the extra personnel costs that we had to pay in the last 10 years to fund the famous electricity specific pension fund before it was merged into the INPS, the unique institution that we do have today. So this is not going to be repeated in the fourth quarter. We are talking about something in the region of &#x20AC;400 million, &#x20AC;500 million. I don't think &#x2013; it's not going to be repeated, &#x20AC;16.5 million will be reached probably. We are not &#x2013; but I don't want to say that we are conservative, but for sure, &#x20AC;16.5 million is the minimum that we'll expect.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Philip Gottschalk Exane BNP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one was just to come back on this Networks division in Italy, am I understanding right that now you have some upside for the guidance for this segment for the full year, which is &#x20AC;3.9 billion? And second thing was on the net debt guidance, Finmeccanica has recently warned about difficulties in collecting receivables from the Italian government. To what extent are you exposed to government receivables and do you see their risk for your guidance possibly? And finally, then following the National Energy Strategy, what evolution in Italian power prices do you expect and what timing? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, please. Well, let me start with the first question. Of course, thanks to these regulatory improvements, we should expect an improvement in the Infrastructure and Network division for the remaining part of the year. So the answer is that the guidance should be higher than what we have originally estimated.</p>
          <p>Let me also tell you that we are working in preparing some efficiency program for the coming year, so it might be necessary during the fourth part of the year to place some accrual to serve these efficiency programs. But I will be of course more specific during the presentation of the full year results. But anyway, the Infrastructure and Networks definitely is going to do better than originally planned.</p>
          <p>When it comes to our working capital position, receivable for &#x2013; invested with the Italian or the Public Administration is very limited. We are not very much exposed to the Italian Public Administration. We have already managed to some factoring activity, so we already sold, as we say, pro soluto, so on a definitely basis in the past, and therefore, the size that we still have to cash-in is definitely negligible, and is not going to influence our working capital optimization action that we put in place to reach the target in the fourth part of the year.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the third question, so if I understood correctly, you're referring to the Italian National Energy Plan, what should we expect in terms of the electricity power prices. Well, I mean we have been talking about this item, I think, many times in the past. You know that the Italian system is still a system gas-driven. So in other words, more than 50% of our installed capacity is still based on gas. In these days, we see power plays which are lower than they should be according to the current level of the Brent price and the gas price because of the weakness in the electricity demand. But we do not expect in the short term, that this is going to change.</p>
          <p>Because again, if we want to have a structural change in our market, we need to &#x2013; the system need to again more flexibility and more capability of storage in the gas. And therefore, you can reach this through two possible measure. One is the regasifier &#x2013; increase the number of regasifier, and the other one is increase storage capacity of the system. And this is going to take time. So I do not expect that this is going to impact the power prices in the next, say, five years. The electricity power prices will be definitely driven by the market dynamics, that is the level of demand, the overcapacity that we are facing in these days, and the price of the gas.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Just one follow-up question. Given that you increase your guidance for the Networks segment, are there any other segments except or on top of Enel Green Power where you turn more cautious?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me be very specific about that. I said that thanks to this regulatory item, for sure, we should expect an improvement of the division in terms of reported results versus the budget. I have not given any guidance, therefore, I can only tell you that the group EBITDA, &#x20AC;16.5 billion, is definitely a target that we do confirm and we also &#x2013; I also said that that this is going to be a floor.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good evening. This is Javier Suarez of Nomura. I have three questions too. The first one is on this morning, we have seen E.ON doing a significant profit warning on talking about the significant transformation of the European energy market. I just wanted to hear your view of how the, for example, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:24) the demand destruction, significant opening of renewable energy capacity is affecting the profitability of conventional technologies. And you mentioned during your presentation that you have seen obviously lower clean spark spreads, can you quantify for us that level of clean spark spreads that you see in Italy these days?</p>
          <p>And a more strategical question is, if the situation continues to deteriorate or a threatening environment for integrated utilities in Europe, how the company could react. Do you see the necessity of &#x2013; you mentioned, for example, efficiency programs, reducing cost, reducing CapEx even further or could you consider to increase your &#x2013; some additional disposal of asset?</p>
          <p>Then I just wanted to have your latest update on the status of the capital increase at Enersis, still the range that has been proposed by the board of Enersis is higher than the proposal put out by the Chilean pension funds, and I just wanted to have your latest view on the capital increase there. And just a final question on the details, in the slide number 10, again, on these &#x20AC;201 million of positive impact under the umbrella of other, can you breakdown all of the impacts here? Because I think this is not only one, you kindly can provide us with all the breakdown for this number. Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Javier. Thanks. So &#x2013; well, as I told you before, I'm not going to comment or giving any guidance with regards to 2013 because we have a meeting in March as usual. I mean I can only tell you that when it comes to the general outlook regarding Europe, well, definitely we are facing a weak level of demand, which has been a factor in our numbers. When it comes to Spain, we see Italy which is struggling more than originally expected, but let me talk about Italy with a specific zoom about this country.</p>
          <p>When it comes to us in general, what I think I would like to remark again, one of the key area that we need to &#x2013; or item that we need to clarify is what is going now with the third regulatory wave in Spain. And therefore, we need to wave &#x2013; wait the final approval of the change in the regulation in Spain before definitely understanding what is the final impact on us and this is something that is going to take place by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Italy and when it comes specifically to Generation and Energy Management, the results that we have reported today are in line with our budget expectation. We have already factored in our number a decline in the spark spread and that's what we have seen at the end of September. We have reported in our house a spark spread, which is region of &#x20AC;3, &#x20AC;4 per megawatt hour and we foresee something close to zero in the near future.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand, we have seen an improvement of our clean dark spreads, which is the results of the CapEx program that we have instigated in the past and in particular due to the contribution of Torrevaldaliga Nord, which now is fully up and running, and the spark &#x2013; the dark spread at the end of September was in the region of &#x20AC;45 per megawatt hour. Whilst we see next year something close to &#x20AC;30, even more, this is very much depending on the level of the CO2 impact, which is, as you know, still under discussion. So the negative of &#x2013; on the CCGT has been, I would say, balanced by &#x2013; compensated for by the positive on the coal production.</p>
          <p>And I would like also to highlight the negative impact of the lower hydro production. In the first nine months, we have generated in Italy something like 3 terawatt hour &#x2013; 3.7 terawatt hour less than what we have generated last year &#x2013; sorry 3.1 terawatt hour, which I think is a huge number. If you convert this number into EBITDA, we are talking about something close to a couple of hundred million euros. So if we look at the hydro condition of today, after unfortunately the disaster that we have seen in Italy, I can tell you that we are definitely in a better shape and we have our hydro basis reservoir fully full and ready to generate additional electricity.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the second question, capital increase in Enersis. Well, as you said, we had, if I'm not wrong, on the 6th of November, the Board of Directors which called a shareholders' meeting on the 20th of December, the Board of Directors identified a range of value of the asset contributed by Endesa Latin America. Now, the discussion has to be managed and performed by the shareholders. So therefore, Endesa Latam &#x2013; Latin America is a major shareholder as long as the other minority shareholders has to find an agreement in due course before the shareholders' meeting in order to have a green light to proceed in this rights issue.</p>
          <p>It seems to me that things are getting better. Of course, the final price to be attributed to the size and therefore the final size of the capital increase will have to be negotiated among the shareholders, and this has to take place, of course, before the shareholders' meeting or during the shareholders' meeting. I can also &#x2013; I like that &#x2013; what I see that there is full agreement about the strategy &#x2013; the fact that this deal is strategic for Enersis, and seems to me that the consensus around this is &#x2013; now is there and I think this is very positive for the success of the deal as a whole.</p>
          <p>Slide number 10. What do we have in the other? We have the positive impact of this regulatory revenues related to the reimbursement of past pension funds for something very close to &#x20AC;450 million, &#x20AC;500 million, which are being compensated as I told by some other provision that the Distribution business has done in order to take into account the evolution of possible litigation in Italy, or also the evolution of some regulatory calculation regarding, for instance, some mechanism of the &#x2013; some equalization mechanism, which normally takes place the follow year and therefore, there is always a margin of uncertainty, positive or negative. In this case, we have made an accrual to take into account a possible negative impact of this. And then also there was in 2011 a release of a personnel provision, which has positively impacted 2011 results, but of course, has not been repeated during the course of this year.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Enrico Bartoli, Fidentiis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening. A few question on my side as well. First of all, clarification on the slide number eight. The &#x20AC;260 million that you reported as others, could you clarify what types of items are there? And if I'm right, you mentioned also some one-offs, could you give some more details on that, the part, obviously, on the effect of the perimeter and revaluation?</p>
          <p>Second question is related to the guidance for the net debt at the end of the year. Just to be clear, do you expect to have some additional disposals during the fourth quarter in addition to Endesa Ireland or not? And a question on the tax rate was around 39% in the nine months. I guess you guided around 36% in the previous conference call, could you give us a hint for the full year?</p>
          <p>And finally, on the Enersis capital increase, do you expect giving the price range set by the advisors to have a capital gain in Endesa from the disposal? And in case this is a yes, if the capital gain could be added to the Endesa dividend policy? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start by your first question, slide number eight. What do we have in other words, other, &#x20AC;260 million. Well, let me remind you that during the course of 2011, we have received the free allocation of CO2 emission credits for the new entrant Torrevaldaliga Nord, and therefore, this is something that we received last year for &#x20AC;145 million just for one year. And we have sold to the market at a different price that we can see today and we took advantage of that for &#x20AC;145 million, as long as we took advantage of the optimization of our green certificate portfolio through some sales activity for another &#x20AC;90 million. Those are the two major items which have been partially offset by the positive contribution of the ancillary services, which I think is worth to mention.</p>
          <p>Today, we have seen, after nine months, an improvement in the ancillary services versus last year of &#x20AC;75 million, which means that we are in the region of &#x20AC;420 million as a margin at the end of September versus &#x20AC;346 million last year. I think this is something positive to take into account also in the future.</p>
          <p>I think when you mentioned one-off item, I think I answered your question. Of course, the effects of the perimeter and the step-up of the asset because of the change in the perimeter has been already mentioned also during the course of the first half. So I'm not going to repeat it.</p>
          <p>Third question, net debt. No, I'm not planning to cash in any additional disposal. I have already cashed in at the beginning of October, the sale of Endesa Ireland, and I have something close to &#x20AC;100 million to be cashed in by the end of the year. So those are the items that I have considered as asset disposal cash-in. Of course, we still have in place a program. Let me remind you that we have committed ourselves to sell something close to &#x20AC;1.8 billion in two years. We have done Terna, we have done Endesa Ireland, we have done some other minor disposals, so basically, we still have to go for &#x20AC;1 billion and we are working on that. But the cash-in of these deals is not included in our target.</p>
          <p>Tax rate. Well, tax rate is affected by the well-known introduction of the Robin Hood Tax in Italy, but also by a change in the tax rate &#x2013; in the corporate tax rate in Chile, which has been increased from 17% to 20%. If we put it all together, those are basically the reason why we have increased our tax rate guidance.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the contribution of our assets to Enersis, we do not expect any capital gain because we are talking about a contribution of asset in kind inside our group. So there is no change in consolidation. We are taking about a contribution of assets which are already consolidated. So this is not going to generate any change at the Enel level.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Anna Maria Scaglia, Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good evening. The first &#x2013; I've got three questions, if I may. The first one is regarding the guidance on the full year, can you just comment on the net income guidance, particularly in regard of this one-off in the Infrastructure and Networks division, is that going to be accounted in the net income for the dividend?</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding the Sonatrach gas contracts renegotiations. I understand you're not commenting on that in details, but do you have &#x2013; do you expect to have a lump sum compensation beginning of the period like others have been reporting, or rather how this renegotiation is going to affect future cash flows?</p>
          <p>The third question is regarding the goodwill at Endesa. I'm wondering if this regulation gets approved in the form it is, are you going to &#x2013; do you have expectations that the goodwill could be impaired or impacted there? And finally, if you can comment eventually on forward sales in 2014. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Anna Maria. Well, the guidance of net ordinary income for the entire year, which I remind is &#x20AC;3.4 billion is confirmed. So it's not going to change. So this is for what I intend when I say that we confirm the targets.</p>
          <p>Gas contract, we do not expect in the fourth quarter any lump sum or any impact from this negotiation. We expect improvement in the gas price and the condition, which will have effect during the course also in the following years. But in the fourth quarter, there is nothing factored in our numbers.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the goodwill, well, first of all, as I told you at the very beginning, we need to wait for a final approval of this project of law. And again, it's very important to wait for this final approval because even if it stays as it is, there are some margin to recover, a huge portion of this charge by passing these costs to the final customer. But this again, is very much depending on the way we are going to nominate and call each &#x2013; charge, each tax that is included into this law. So I think that before talking about implication on our goodwill, we need to wait for a final approval. After that of course, we will examine very deeply what are the impacts and with the consequence on eventually on our accounts.</p>
          <p>The fourth question was about forward sales 2014. Well, we have &#x2013; I mean if we look at the forward market, it's not very liquid. If we look at our customer base, having a 24 months contract, of course, we are building up our position in particular on the small office and office segment and the retails. So we have not yet seen any material price indication. We have, of course, already started to cover 2014. We are talking about 15%, 20% coverage but the price are still the old one. So the renegotiation with the existing customer has to start. It's too early to say what are the price indication for 2014.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify, sorry, on the net income, &#x20AC;3.4 billion, that includes the one-off from the Infrastructure and Networks division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The one-off in Infrastructure and Networks division has been a regulatory item. So as long as all the other regulatory items that we do have, you know that we like or not, this is our business, so we have basically every month, somebody taking decision in each part of the world where we are. In some cases, they take decisions strictly refer to what you have in that month, but in most of the cases, they take decision regarding past events. So we have always considered such type of revenues as ordinary.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Alberto Ponti, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. It's Alberto. Thanks, Luca and thanks, Luigi. I will just &#x2013; going back to Enersis. So you're doing this &#x2013; Enersis is doing this capital increase and the stated objective is that of buying some of the minorities there. But the minorities that will be bought with the capital increase are indeed a small part of the overall minorities. So I was thinking whether &#x2013; I'm not asking you &#x2013; to pin you down on a single number, but is there a bigger project behind just the capital increase of Enersis, because in the end, there's a lot of fuss about the capital increase to only maybe integrate $200 million more minorities out of more than $1 billion. So I was thinking is there more to it that once the capital increase is concluded you are thinking of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, Alberto, you're right. There is more to it. So we are not talking about just buying some minorities. We always said that we consider Latin America strategic in our business plan. We consider this part of the world, one of the few parts where we can see growth &#x2013; we see growth now and we do expect additional growth in the coming years. So we believe that Enersis, after the capital increase, will have all the tool and means to support an additional growth which is coming not only through the acquisition of some minorities, but also to the valuation of some potential M&amp;A opportunities, or also to the acceleration of the construction of the already existing pipeline of organic projects.</p>
          <p>So we believe that strategically, this is a move which goes in the direction of enhancing our presence in Latin America through the Enersis vehicle, is going to consider Chile our headquarter for the entire Latin America and therefore, we expect that there will be additional growth for us. I cannot tell you more because, first of all, this is something that has to be decided by the Board of Directors of Enersis once the capital increase is approved. But strategically, you're right, we are not talking just about minorities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Luigi, sorry. Just a quick follow-up. When I look at the web of subsidiaries of Enersis, Endesa Latam, Cono Sur, in fact, or Endesa Chile, it's a very complex structure. And so far, what has been discussed also in the Endesa presentation and Enersis presentation is the acquisition of some of the subsidiaries. Would you also consider, in some cases, selectively to sell some of the subsidiaries if you don't deem that &#x2013; those strategic for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the answer is, no, because I mean even if we talk about Argentina, which we are all aware that is not in a very good shape, we believe that the assets that we have today is, anyway, a good portfolio of assets. Therefore, our management team in Santiago in Argentina is filing in order to get some improvement in the regulation, to have decent return for these assets that are strategic for the country as well. So we believe that really, we have the right size, the right portfolio, we are not planning to sell assets in that part of the world. It's the other way around, I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Roberto Letizia, Equita SIM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sorry, if I go back to the issue of the guidance of the full year, but it's a bit upsetting me because we're in the middle of November and you have a very positive one-off of &#x20AC;400 million in the Network division. But with this positive items in the middle of November, you are just saying that you are going to do more than &#x20AC;16.5 billion, I would have expected at least a minimum of &#x20AC;16.8 billion, otherwise that means you're not going to match the guidance. And that's the same at net income level, and I guess it's the same at net debt levels, because you usually consider the regulatory receivable already in the net financial position. So if you can, sorry, additionally clarify this point again.</p>
          <p>And my second question is if you can give me more details like you do for the forward sales in electricity, on the percentage of forward sales in gas that you already got in the Market division. Just to have an idea of what could be also the impact on the gas renegotiation on the 2011-2012 price you can communicate to us as hedging for the gas. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when it comes to the full year, I understand your point, but you do not have to be upset. You have to appreciate the fact that the company today, first of all, is confirming &#x20AC;16.5 billion target in such an environment. Second, I told you that we are also &#x2013; the reason why I'm just saying that is going to be a floor, because as you know, this company is putting in place efficiency program. We have the One Company Project and we expect to get from that project &#x20AC;400 million at regime. So we need to make some reasonable accrual to support such efficiency programs. And I'm not in a position today to tell you how much we are talking about and that's the reason why I have to be a little bit vague when it comes to the possible upside.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the forward sales strategy, we provide you normally the forward sales on the electricity because this is a natural instrument of hedging our production output. Having said that, the same strategy is applied to the gas customer, in particular because we are talking about mainly residential customer and the residential customer are served through 24 months forward sales contract. So I can tell you that we are hedged, more or less, in line with what you see in the electricity segment. And on top of this, most of the gas activity is also performed in order to serve the gas combined cycle as well.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. First question, which is the contribution from dispatching activities in Italy in the first nine months of this year? Second question is on the TAP pipeline. Mr. Conti confirmed its interest for the acquisition of a minority stake, but at the same time, I understand that Enel is called on the Galsi pipeline, if you can clarify the position of Enel on this issue. And last question on the capacity payment, which is your position and if you see some improvements in the regulatory framework in Italy showing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let's start with the first question. What is the contribution of the MSD or the ancillary services? I think you referred to the ancillary services. In the first nine months, we had a contribution of &#x20AC;220 million with an improvement of &#x20AC;75 million versus last year, which I think is positive news.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the capacity payments evolution in Italy, well, as you know, the authority has already taken a decision at the end of 2011. We expect in 2013, there should be the first auction of the new mechanist. Clearly, it's something that we are encouraging and we think is very important for the system as a whole, given also the volatility, which has been introduced by the increase in the renewable installed capacity. So we are definitely in favor also to protect our existing installed capacity, mainly gas combined cycle &#x2013; open gas combined &#x2013; gas open cycle and some old power plants that by the way are also used to serve this market of the ancillary services.</p>
          <p>I mean, when it comes to the TAP pipeline, the project up and the Galsi project, well, we are of course interested in entering as a minority stakeholder in such a type of project because it's a natural way of hedging and protecting our role of consumers at the end. Because we use gas for our thermoelectric installed capacity and also for our final customer. So we are in some way gaining flexibility. We are keeping optionality since the Galsi project is not showing a quick start or increase in the activity, it's better to have more than an option. Of course, this is something that we will value at the right time.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Just to clarify one thing, on the non-recurring element in Distribution, can you tell us the net for the positive but also the negative that affected the nine months results?</p>
