        <plist>
          <p>Reed, thank you. And, good afternoon, everyone. As you all have seen in today's earnings release, our second quarter reflected continued solid growth at our Cable Networks. <mark type="ph" /> Retrans led (1:58) growth at our Television businesses and overall improvement at our Publishing segment. Our earnings contributions from these segments were partially offset by declines in SKY Italia and slightly lower profits at Filmed Entertainment.</p>
          <p>The current quarter's operating income result also includes $26 million in costs related to the proposed separation of the company's entertainment and publishing businesses, and a $56 million charge related to the ongoing investigations in the United Kingdom as compared to $87 million in the second quarter a year ago. Excluding these charges from both years, second quarter adjusted total segment operating income of $1.66 billion increased 5% from the year-ago adjusted result of $1.58 billion.</p>
          <p>Second quarter reported revenues were up 5% highlighted by strong Cable Network increases of 18%. All segments reported higher revenues with the exception of SKY Italia, where local currency revenues were essentially unchanged but reported U.S. dollar revenues declined due to the strong dollar. Our share reported results from our equity earnings of affiliates was up $32 million in the quarter. This increase primarily reflecting this quarter's higher gain from participation in BSkyB share repurchase program partially offset by one-time costs at Hulu resulting from their purchase of Providence 10% ownership stake.</p>
          <p>Also included in this quarter's result is $1.4 billion of income, which is included in Other, primarily from non-cash gains related to our acquisition of the remaining ownership stakes in FOX SPORTS Australia and the ESPN Star network &#x2013; Star Sports rather. These gains were partially offset by $65 million of pre-tax restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>Reported net income in the quarter was $2.38 billion, with reported earnings per share of $1.01 as compared to reported earnings per share a year ago of $0.42. Excluding the net income effects from both years of one-time items, primarily consisting of the items I just highlighted, second quarter adjusted earnings per share this year of $0.44 compared to the year-ago adjusted result of $0.39, a 13% earnings per share improvement. Our press release includes a reconciliation of our GAAP results to these amounts. The reduction of shares outstanding versus last year accounted for a $0.03 per share contribution to adjusted EPS this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to provide some additional context on the performance at a few of our businesses. And let's begin with the Cable Networks. This segment continues to drive overall company results, generating 60% of News Corporation's total segment operating income. Second quarter Cable segment results were driven by an overall 18% revenue increase reflecting organic domestic and international channel strength as well as inclusion of new international sports networks in Latin America and Asia. Similar to our first quarter, this quarter included the planned increase investments both in sports rights in the United States and India as well as the ramp-up of international sports channels. These investments are in line with our strategy to create new strong cable sports franchises that will provide the foundation for a whole new level of long-term sustainable earnings growth.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the current quarter also includes a net negative $45 million impact related to the NBA lockout in the prior year and NHL lockout in the current quarter. As a result of these investments in the lockout impact, this quarter's operating income growth moderated to 9% domestically and 3% internationally.</p>
          <p>Reported affiliate fees at the Cable Networks increased 20% over year-ago levels. Domestic affiliate revenues increased 13% over last year with particular strength at Fox News and at the RSN. While reported international affiliate fees were up 42% after stripping out the effect of the new sports channels and foreign exchange, the affiliate fees increased 17% reflecting comparable strong local currency organic growth at both Fox International Channels and at STAR.</p>
          <p>Second quarter advertising revenues for this segment were up 16% over year-ago levels with domestic ad growth of 8% and reported international ad increases of 29%. Excluding the new sports channels and foreign exchange, local currency organic advertising growth of our international channels is approximately 20%. Excuse me a second.</p>
          <p>Total Cable segment operating expenses increased 20% over the second quarter a year ago with one-third of this increase related to the additional consolidated international sports businesses and the net increase from timing differences associated with the NBA and the NHL lockout. Another one-third of this increase is due to expanded football coverage and Ultimate Fighting Championship rights in the United States and the launch of our BCCI cricket broadcast in India. As a result of these planned investments, our operating profit margin declined slightly in the quarter as compared to last year.</p>
          <p>At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $224 million increased 19% versus the second quarter a year ago, due to more than doubling of retransmission revenues from higher political advertising at the stations. Political advertising was strong with approximately $70 million of political advertising revenues received in the quarter, bringing the fiscal 2013 total to over $100 million. These gains more than offset lower national advertising revenues due to weaker network ratings and three fewer World Series games this season as well as higher costs associated with the expanded college football coverage on Fox.</p>
          <p>At our Film segment, second quarter operating income was $383 million, a very solid result, which is roughly in line with the $393 million generated a year ago. These contributions include the successful theatrical release of Taken 2 as well as two late quarter releases, Life of Pi and Lincoln, which are up for the Best Picture.</p>
          <p>Turning to our DBS segment SKY Italia, SKY generated an operating loss in the quarter of $20 million as comparing to operating income of $6 million in the second quarter a year ago. This decline was driven by higher program expenses, including nearly $30 million of increased costs primarily associated with expanded UEFA Champions and Europa League coverage. The current challenging economic environment in Italy continues to negatively affect subscriber additions with SKY reporting a net loss of 28,000 subs in the quarter, bringing the quarter-end total subscribers to 4.83 million. Local currency revenues were essentially in line with the second quarter a year-ago with a &#x20AC;1 increase in ARPU being offset by the reduced subscriber base.</p>
          <p>In our Publishing segment, operating income of $234 million increased 7% compared to a year ago. This improvement result was primarily due to higher U.K. newspaper contributions from the Sunday edition of The Sun that launched in February of 2012, improved profits at News America at HarperCollins. These improved results were partially offset by continued lower advertising revenues at the Australian newspapers.</p>
          <p>And our Other segment reported a second quarter segment operating loss of $186 million, a slight improvement from the $191 million in the same period a year ago. This quarter result includes $56 million of costs related to the ongoing investigations in the U.K., $23 million of costs related to the proposed separation. Additionally, this quarter includes $20 million in contributions from the consolidation of FOX SPORTS Australia, although all these earnings contributions are largely offset by higher development costs at the company's education business.</p>
          <p>Before I turn to guidance, let me comment on our buyback program. As you have seen, we have been purchasing shares at a $3 billion annual pace while we work through the details of the separation process. Through February 5th, we have spent 1.63 billion repurchasing approximately 68 million shares during this fiscal year.</p>
          <p>And finally let me address our guidance for fiscal 2013, total segment operating income. And as a reminder, we measure this guidance excluding from fiscal 2012 the $224 million of charges related the ongoing investigation in the United Kingdom resulting in a base of $5.6 billion in segment operating income for comparative purposes.</p>
          <p>Since our last call with you three months ago, we've updated our operational assumptions to reflect our second quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. And Chase will expand on this in a moment. While our Cable and content production businesses are all on plan, three businesses, SKY Italia, the Fox Network and Australian newspapers will under-deliver against our original expectations.</p>
          <p>As a result of this underperformance and after excluding the full year's effect of the U.K. investigation costs and separation costs and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we expect that our total segment operating income percentage growth rate for fiscal 2013 will now be in the mid- to high-single-digit range above the $5.6 billion fiscal 2012 segment operating income base. This outlook also now reflects the consolidation of Sky D's reported operating results from mid-January, although this factors &#x2013; this does not materially affect the impact of the company's growth rate.</p>
          <p>Before turning the call over to Chase, I'd like to give you a brief update on our plans to separate our publishing and entertainment businesses into two distinct publicly-traded companies. On December 21st, we filed a preliminary proxy statement, an initial Form 10 registration statement with the SEC. We plan to file amended documents which will include additional financial information in the next month or so. We have also applied for certain regulatory approvals and tax rulings required to enable the transaction to be completed as envisioned. At this time, we believe we're on plan for the separation to be completed around the end of the current year.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Chase for his comments.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. It was a busy quarter as we closed a number of important transactions, including acquiring all or part of CMH in Australia; the YES Network; ESS, our Asian sports business; EMM, our new Dutch sports business; and a Regional Sports Network in Ohio.</p>
          <p>We're also making great progress in the planned separation of the company which is on track for the end of this year &#x2013; this fiscal year. Each of these acquisitions positions us for further growth. More importantly, we feel good about the momentum in most of our businesses and excited about the progress on our new growth initiatives. However, as David noted, issues at three business units have led us to come up a bit short on expected results this year. While disappointed, we are aggressively pursuing steps to address these issues while ensuring we continue to drive our other businesses forward.</p>
          <p>I'll address the three business units with shortfalls in a minute. Let me start with what is going well. Our domestic cable business continues to hit every target we set and execute superbly. FX, which is experiencing wins at multiple levels, just finished a record setting month in January. And last week's premiere of our newest series, The Americans, had the most total viewers of any drama premiere in FX's history.</p>
          <p>The National Geographic Channel has made real progress and Fox News continues to be a juggernaut. At our Regional Sports Network business, we believe we're making the right decisions in navigating this invaluable yet complicated business. Our new agreement with YES adds America's premier RSN to our portfolio, while our Ohio sports deal further strengthens our hand. Both businesses will generate significant profits and returns that succeed our hurdle rates. Both profits and returns look even more attractive when you look at the recently announced Dodger deal, which was too rich for our blood. We have a strong Southern California RSN with four great Pro teams without the Dodgers and our overall RSN portfolio is materially stronger than it has ever been. Beyond our existing U.S. channels, we're preparing for some exciting additions to our portfolio and those efforts are on plan too. It is a testament to the strength of our U.S. cable business that will deliver solid double-digit growth while absorbing over $50 million in costs for new initiatives.</p>
          <p>Our international channels unit, Fox International Channels, or FIC, is pretty much the same story of across the board strength and growth while investing to add new dimensions to the business. In fact, our growth rate at FIC will exceed our domestic channel growth. That growth is helped by couple of acquisitions but that is &#x2013; that benefit is largely offset by some adverse currency fluctuations at the same time. Among our newer initiatives, the ESPN branded channels in Asia that we bought out last fall were rebranded Fox Sports last week. Fox Sports Japan is on track to launch at the end of this quarter. And in Latin America, the Fox Sports business we took over a year ago, the highest rated regional pay sports channel.</p>
          <p>At STAR, our results in our historical entertainment businesses are ahead of target and growing this year, again, in spite of currency headwinds. However, as planned, our overall results at STAR this year will be down due to our investments in building a robust Indian sports business.</p>
          <p>Our content businesses in film and TV have both continued to be industry leaders. On the film side, Life of Pi is a film we are proud of both creatively and financially. We are excited about the upcoming Die Hard release and the slate we have as we look toward the summer looks great.</p>
          <p>On the TV side, we have about 40 scripted entertainment series on broadcast in cable this season with 18 new pilots picked up today for the upcoming broadcast season across all four networks. Our satellite and cable platforms in the U.K., Germany, Australia and India continue to operate well and build on their leadership positions.</p>
          <p>Germany, in particular, has been an area of focus and we're excited about the recent restructuring that gave us the majority position there. This business has just gotten stronger and stronger in the past few quarters with key content and distribution agreements. It is truly establishing itself as a premier video platform in Europe's biggest market, Germany.</p>
          <p>On the Publishing front, Dow Jones, our U.K. newspapers and HarperCollins have all made progress this year. Navigating the evolving digital age is still priority one and we're energized about new initiatives like our agreement with the Premier League for U.K. video clip rights. These businesses have big agendas and are on target in spite of tough economic conditions.</p>
          <p>As noted earlier, there are three business units not on target and each warrants discussion. At SKY Italia, our problem is top line shortfalls, primarily in subscribers due to the economic crisis in Italy, particularly during the recent holiday season. We now expect this business to be about $100 million below target this year, around $150 million off last year's results. We do not expect the economy to improve in the short-term so our focus is reducing the cost base, particularly programming costs. We plan to take over $200 million out of the cost base over the next two to three years by not renewing some agreements and modifying others. We believe this business should and needs to get to a double-digit profit margin with no improvement in the economy. From there, we can improve the margin and profitability as the economy recovers. A key positive to our Italian situation is that our competitive position is stronger than ever, which bodes well for our medium- and long-term future.</p>
          <p>At the Fox Network, it has been no secret that we have a tough fall. We hoped X Factor would grow as it moves into the competition phase, but it didn't happen. Our challenges in entertainment were exacerbated by a sports schedule that just didn't bounce our way with a four-game World Series, NFL post-season off double-digits from last year and late season college football match-ups that didn't pan out. American Idol is just ramping up and our new drama, The Following, is off to a promising start. Nonetheless, the year will fall well short of our expectations.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, our retransmission results are slightly ahead of target. The growth in retrans will enable us to have a broadcasting business, network and stations combined, that is significantly up on a year-ago but it will still be well short of our target.</p>
          <p>In Australia, we have been hammered by an economy that we keep hoping has hit bottom, yet seems to continue to find new lows. This was clearly evident during the holiday season where we were unable to benefit from the seasonal advertising lift as we had in prior years. As stated before, we're actively working to restructure this business for the future.</p>
          <p>We're highly focused on addressing these challenges. However, at the same time, we don't want to lose sight of the greater &#x2013; great momentum in our broader businesses. We remain more excited than ever about our opportunities especially as we get closer to the proposed split, which we're confident will position us to unlock even greater value for our shareholders. Thank you.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back to Reed for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions. I'd love to get James' thoughts on BSkyB now that we have this transaction in the U.K. with Virgin and Liberty and what that might mean for that business and how he thinks about broadly the satellite platforms in the U.S. as they continue to battle with &#x2013; in Europe &#x2013; excuse me &#x2013; as they continue to battle with cable properties. And then, Chase, on the broadcast network, is there anything on the cost side you're thinking about? You outlined some initiatives at SKY Italia but I didn't know if you had a view on what might &#x2013; if anything you might do on the expense front at the network moving into the latter parts of this calendar year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James, do you want to talk about the U.K. and the satellites in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ben. I think really just with respect to the transaction that was announced with Virgin Media, I would just say that across Europe particularly in Ireland and in Germany we compete as well as work with Liberty Global in Germany where Liberty Global through Unity and KBW distribute a lot of our programming for Sky Deutschland. And in Ireland, SKY and Liberty have been competing for some time. So I don't think there's really a big change to the landscape there. I think Chase spoke about the progress being made in all of the pay TV businesses and the platforms in Europe in his remarks and I don't think I have much to add to that. We're pleased with momentum and pleased with the strategic position of the business, notwithstanding some of the sort of short-term issues and current issues that we have in Italy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think on the broadcast network, I mean we're always focused on costs and I think it has to be part of in some ways your DNA in managing the business every day. I don't think there's anything dramatically that we would be doing, realistically our core problem was the net rate fall. I mean you look at the ratings and the shortfall we had in the fall and clearly that was disappointing to us.</p>
          <p>We've had &#x2013; The Following is off to a really good start, Idol is in very early stages so very much a work in progress but it's not that costs aren't important but we need to create shows that our franchise shows for us to build the business around. And we're focused on that. We need to have shows that break out. We need to have shows that &#x2013; I think The Following is, again, the type of show that can be a signature you build a night around. And so, yes, we're focused on cost but I &#x2013; and I think we always are.  But I think that's the core challenge for us as we go forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks very much. Two questions. I guess the first one was, I was wondering if you could update us on any developments you might see on the creation of a Fox national sports network given a bunch of the rights you have acquired on the MLB side and some of your rights to distribute college, what you think the outlook is for that? And the second, I guess for all of you guys there's been reasons why you've probably been a little bit less active on the buyback front but could you kind of update us with your long-term perspective in terms of return of capital and capital allocation? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess on sports, we haven't &#x2013; we haven't made up an announcement about a national sports channel I guess it's what you could call it the world's worst kept secret. But we think there are opportunities for us to add real dimension to the business. We think sports in a huge arena that has room in it to build really attractive businesses. And we obviously have a lot of assets in that place that we think we can utilize in terms of trying to build the business. Certainly, the regionals we think are up &#x2013; are a real business for us.</p>
          <p>We do want to be focused on building businesses as opposed to &#x2013; as I said before, as opposed to acquiring businesses. And we think that's an important part of the portfolio as we look at our &#x2013; as we look at that, our bundle of cable channels that really cover the spectrum of the four arenas of entertainment, news, non-fiction and sports. We want to continue to be opportunistic at finding things that where we can build real value. We can build businesses that capitalize on the other assets we own and we do think sports is an opportunity there. We recognize the challenges in terms of dealing with the cost of sports but we just think sports &#x2013; in a world of increasing fragmentation, we think sports continues to be a more and more important and unique part of that overall landscape.</p>
          <p>In terms of that capital question, again, in some ways as we head towards the split, which is what we've said, you obviously have two companies that probably are each going to have to have their own, so it's a little difficult to get too long-term on capital allocation because you're &#x2013; again, you're going to have two businesses and with different outlooks and at different places and I think each has to sort of determine its own path and then come forward and set out a vision for what it intends to do.</p>
          <p>We're committed to finishing the buyback we have announced so that &#x2013; we've said we're going to buyback $3 billion to $4 billion this year. We will do that. We will finish the $5 billion that we've talked about. But I think the company has to get split to then come out with an appropriate sort of &#x2013; each company then has to come out with its own vision for how it deals with it. We think it's an important part of how we manage the business for shareholders. I mean I think we certainly know the importance of returning capital &#x2013; returning capital to shareholders. We want to make sure we continue to fulfill opportunities to grow the business but we believe fully hopefully our actions recently in the last year plus have indicated that. The return of capital to shareholders is an important part of it. But again, I don't want to get too specific because I think you've got to get each company to sort of provide its own vision.</p>

          <p>Hi. Couple questions. One, Disney &#x2013; just to follow on, on that question about Europe &#x2013; Disney made comments about looking to exit the U.K. given what's happened with ESPN and losing sports rights. Wanted to get your perspective on kind of what that means for SKY and just as you think about the sports rights situation overseas now that you control SKY Deutschland, how you think what's happened at ESPN in terms of your ability to continue to manage sports rights costs as you look out over the course of the next few years. And then moving over to the U.S. for a second, with the loss of the Dodgers, you've now lost the Dodgers and the Lakers. Can you keep your two RSNs going in Los Angeles and will that ultimately lead to higher profitability because of your affiliate fees being long-term in nature? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:49) can add something if you want to. I guess &#x2013; I don't think &#x2013; again I have a great respect for ESPN and what they build. I don't think ESPN's plans would end up saying &#x2013; would have a significant impact on what we're doing in Europe. I mean, they &#x2013; we had a relationship, but there are a lot of other players there so I don't think ESPN's announcement on the U.K. I'd say is an event that's essentially would say, changes our outlook or our plans much one way or the other. I think they will be out there against the other players that compete for rights.</p>
          <p>James, do you want to &#x2013; do you have any...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, I would just say, it's a super competitive sports market across Europe and in the U.K. obviously we had a new entrant with BT very recently. And really &#x2013; and that package of SAPL rights or those rights had been ESPN's core offering earlier. So &#x2013; but it doesn't really change very much as Chase said. I don't think &#x2013; I think there's a lot of players over there, it's very competitive. But their plans in Europe one way or another haven't really &#x2013; haven't been and won't be a big changing factor.</p>
          <p>And I think over there &#x2013; to your kind of second part about managing costs, I think it's about making choices. And deciding what you have to do, what you would like to have, what's nice to have and what you can stretch for. So across the whole sports portfolio, it's about making choices about where you want to invest and where you want to prioritize. So &#x2013; and that's why we make those choices every day in a lot of different places.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think as it relates to the LA kind of market, don't want to get too far into the weeds on numbers of channels &#x2013; our goal is to maintain the profitability of our business in LA &#x2013; in Southern California. We've got a number of sports franchises that we have long-term agreements in place, we feel good about our place, we feel our business is going to be more profitable given the path we've chosen than any other path out there and we'll determine how we deal with our existing assets to best achieve that profitability.</p>
          <p>And again on another level, I think we do &#x2013; look, we like each of these regional businesses but in some ways we look at them individually and then we look at them as a portfolio. And there's no question we are in a much stronger place than we were with Ohio and then particular yes than we were a year ago. So as a &#x2013; from an overall perspective, we are stronger than we've ever been and we feel on the more local level that we can &#x2013; we've got a combination of enough assets that we can continue to have a very healthy and vibrant Southern California business.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. Two quick ones, if I may. So back to the best kept secret in media. I'm sorry to probe a little further on that, but in terms of the idea of a national cable sports network, do you think if you put together the various rights that you hold for national cable rights right now or could be reframed in that way that it's enough for 24/7 sort of proposition or do you think you would need some more? And if so, what could that possibly be?</p>
          <p>And then the second quick one, I know you just took us through a great presentation on Amplify not too long ago, so I know you said a lot about that. I guess I'm left wondering, if you just comment, do you think that if you continue to spend a couple hundred million dollars a year pursuing that opportunity that that's enough to compete with the big incumbent competitors or would you be prepared to spend a lot more than that if necessary? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we haven't announced, so I'm not going to get too far into rights. I mean we believe we have a unique combination of both rights and assets that we can use to potentially build a very attractive business. And I'm not going to get into a right by right analysis to some degree, there's always &#x2013; with rights become affiliate fees, we're navigating a path where we think we have &#x2013; if we launch a channel, we're going to launch a channel that we think will excite people, will interest people. Clearly, a 24-hour channel is rights as well as programming you create to &#x2013; in that content genre to &#x2013; that will excite and interest people.</p>
          <p>We think we have proven a unique capability in the sports business to really do unique and exciting things that excites &#x2013; that excite people. We certainly greatly expanded the portfolio of rights we've got across an array of sports from NASCAR to baseball to college football, college basketball, soccer, UFC and the likes.</p>
          <p>We have a broad array of rights as well as the regionals as I touched on to deal with. And clearly look to create again, distinctive content that we create that goes with it that would be interesting and valuable to customers. And go out with it &#x2013; on a set of economics that enables it to be an attractive business for us. And that's the plan we're on and that's what we're planning to execute and we will provide more details as we go forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of Amplify, look, we really think we're going to be a disrupter. We're not trying to be the guys that are in it. I mean to some degree that's what we have said is we're not planning to go toe to toe spending. I mean in some degree, it's taking advantage of guys that are encumbered by decades of having built a business on historical practices and we're going to come in using digital technologies, which the education business is sort of been completely left out of and innovate and then create a completely difference approach that we think will prove to be uniquely successful in the education arena. We think we can do it cost effectively. It doesn't regardless, we're not trying &#x2013; any plans to go spend toe to toe with the old brick and mortar guys. And in some ways, it's great.</p>
          <p>The greatest advantage &#x2013; biggest advantage we have is, we don't have to worry about an incumbent business and what do we do <mark type="ph" /> channel (34:20) what do our digital technologies do in terms of cannibalizing an historical business. We can just go out and build a digital business and it's really built, taking advantage of today's technologies and deliver a great product. We put a great team in place with unique expertise and we think we can be a true disruptive force for good in the education space.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have two, one would for David or Chase and then second for Chase. So, David or Chase, on the last call I remember asking about the ratings of Fox Network and they start off really weak, we all saw that, and asking about guidance and how that was incorporated. So from November until now, what really get worse, was it weakness in the ad markets, did you count on the second half of the season launching better? So that's something that we all were aware of, so I wonder what changed versus the last time you guys updated us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think we've really &#x2013; yeah, I mean we were only halfway there. I mean I guess most particularly with X Factor, we had really obviously went into the competition round which is really where we were headed, that we could &#x2013; we could get a fresh energy and a fresh momentum and clearly X Factor was a disappointment for us and that didn't occur. So I think probably the first factor would be that.</p>
          <p>I think the second would be, we had a very choppy October. We were just coming out of October, we had had the election, baseball, the hurricane, we had an array of disruptions and again, we were hoping to relaunch some other shows that really had gone off and subsequently some other new shows, Mob Doctor, Tuesday night, and get some traction. Weren't expecting to be raging successes, but hoped through those disruptions we could bring them back to a better place. And that didn't occur.</p>
          <p>And then in sports, we actually were doing &#x2013; the NFL is fabulous, but sometimes just the way sports work, really the regular season was great for us. Unfortunately the post-season didn't fall our way and we were down double-digits. And that's a lot of money. So double-digits in the NFL post-season, those are three-digit millions ad sales and then on top of that some of the, I guess, probably in college football particularly, the two championship games. When you start off at one point hoping you've got a USC Oregon top-five matchup and you don't get that and you end up with a top-five team in the Big Ten that can't play in a championship game in Ohio State so sort of ended up with signature games that didn't pan out.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; yeah, just seem to where every one of those where maybe we had been because it's early in the year, a little too optimistic and sort of challenging people to sort of achieve, I mean, in sports I think we did, so sports I think is more just sort of that's the way it fell. I think in entertainment we really believed we could &#x2013; we had an opportunity to get some of those programs to a better place and really it just didn't go &#x2013; it just went the other way as we went through the fall.</p>

If we're launching something next month, we'd have to announce it. We're not, and so we'll keep &#x2013; we'll continue to build up pent-up demand.</p>

          <p>Hi.  I guess one last question on sports then a difference topic completely. Just in general can you give us any sense of what the incremental sports costs will be worldwide over the next two or three years? It seems like there was really big step-up this year. And then how quickly would you expect to start to see the flow-through via revenue? How quickly will advertising growth accelerate and affiliate fees? So that's one question. And then the second question is you do have a lot of hidden assets, one that comes to mind is The Simpsons, can you give us any sense there of when second cycle syndication might happen and what the economic impact of that would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on sports, and I guess if you're talking of worldwide, it's tough to make a general statement, and I am not sure I can do the math in my head to go add up the pieces. I guess &#x2013; but I guess just touching around the world &#x2013; look, I mean in some places you ought to &#x2013; I guess got to remember particularly in a number of the international markets what we've done is take businesses that we owned a piece of and taking control of.</p>
          <p>So in Latin America we had a minority stake, we took control of it. In Asia, we had a 50/50 partnership, we have taken control of, so a lot it. In Australia, we owned half of Fox Sports and we've taken control of it. So in a number of these initiatives, some of them are new. Fox Sports Japan is new. The Dutch initiative is new. And they're in very different places. I mean Latin America, which we took control of a year and a half ago, a year plus ago, is actually ahead of schedule and has turned profitable and significantly &#x2013; generated significant profits on course. I think in India this is a significant investment year and that should be &#x2013; we'll have a significant uptick as we go into next year on sports there. The rest of Asia, that's probably more of an ongoing build that is actually in the black today, because it didn't have quite the same costs that you had in India's, it's a more competitive market, there were some more costs to digest in India this year on some key rights and we're just getting that up. Actually I think very quickly essentially in the Netherlands that's going to be a profitable business almost after a very quick turn.</p>
          <p>I think in the U.S., to the degree we take on a new initiative, I think launching a channel, we don't &#x2013; we're not starting from square one, if we do something. It's still probably a couple of years to get us to a place so I think getting &#x2013; there's always going to be an investment phase to building <mark type="ph" /> within our (41:45) goal. Really in aggregate, I think as you look at our cable business has been to maintain a very healthy growth rate that has a degree of investment that after that investment lets us continue to have that &#x2013; the type of growth rate you have seen. Obviously if we did nothing new then the growth rate would be a couple of points higher. We think it makes sense for us that if you did that at some point your business is going to mature in a way that we don't think is right in terms of building long-term value. So our goal is to say how do we take a small portion of that growth and reinvest it in building businesses and again, we want to build, and still be able to maintain a very healthy growth rate.</p>
          <p>If you see this year, we're building India &#x2013; this year, we're still building in a number of places. So, India will mature. And it's not just sports. Look, in some ways we built the Fox business, which turns profitable this year. It's been &#x2013; Fox News as we have been investing in, it turns profitable this year and takes another jump next year but I think that's a &#x2013; that is the philosophy. Clearly, sports has a more significant cost, just &#x2013; again, because of the importance of sports and the uniqueness of sports that it has a larger cost. Again, I couldn't pull it out of all those territories and stick it together without doing a little homework. But sports we think is going to be a force second to none and really almost everywhere we've invested in sports around the world it has been not just important, in many ways it has been the cornerstone to our ability to grow and build the businesses we've built including here in the U.S. in many ways.</p>
          <p>In terms of The Simpsons, it's &#x2013; we are &#x2013; they're still ongoing. We are working hard to get to a place, I wouldn't speculate on a &#x2013; because I wouldn't think any probably just sort of speculate ahead of time what's it worth. It is obviously as unique a franchise as exists in television world. I don't think there's anything else out there that has, whatever it is, 500, 600 episodes and is headed towards its 25th year. Animation is great because nobody ages. But it's a fabulous franchise but &#x2013; and I think we're getting &#x2013; we're hopefully getting close to a place where we can sort of try and add a dimension to it. But we still got, I guess I would call it a couple of Is to dot and Ts to cross to try and get there so I'm not going to get ahead of it.</p>

          <p>Thanks so much. Two questions. For Chase and/or Dave, given the nature of the guidance and the fact that you provided a range, can you talk about what you would see as the swing factors that would push you to the high end or the low end of the range these last five months of the year? And then I guess sort of for Chase, with regards to the not yet announced U.S. sports network, any thoughts around the NFL Network's package of games and whether you'd pursue those games or the foundation of that network at some point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the ups and the downs, I guess first you always get sort of the &#x2013; just the built-in uncertainty in a content business, we have &#x2013; where do films perform? I think on the network, as I said, we're early days on Idol in the spring season as a whole. And I think you go to some place in a place like Italy, what we're assuming is we can sort of stabilize subscribers, we've got a couple of initiatives we're trying to do. And I think that's sort of the outlook in the short-term is stabilize subscribers. They've obviously been &#x2013; the last 12 months are down.</p>
          <p>And we've got a couple of initiatives continuing to add new dimensions to the product. We just launched a bundle with broadband so some things we think that we can use to stabilize that market, we don't expect the economy to get better in the next &#x2013; certainly in the short-term, next couple of years, so we are planning the business for an economy that won't be, but we'd love to get some traction, we're not planning on that. But again, we're looking to not &#x2013; we're looking to stabilize it as opposed to the last 12 months where we have been &#x2013; we have had subscribers declining so I think that's still is something that we are focused on. And again, it made some headway in the last month but it's too early to make any &#x2013; to have any real strong feelings about where it is. I mean, I will not dwell on Italy.</p>
          <p>I mean I &#x2013; the one thing I do &#x2013; as we look at that business that I feel good about is it's a pretty clear path how to get the business to where it should be. You got program contracts that end in the next 12 months, the next 24 months and some we won't renew and some we'll modify and it's pretty structural. And I think we do those things we get the business stabilized on the top line, take those costs down, get ourselves to a double-digit margin and then we'll go from there as the economy evolves.</p>
          <p>But back on that, so I started to say the content businesses, the content-driven businesses as those pan out, film, network, I think the cable businesses probably don't have that type of volatility. The Publishing businesses &#x2013; it's pretty tough around the world, a pretty tough advertising market for Publishing. We certainly experienced that first and foremost in Australia. We're not expecting it to get better but we're &#x2013; we're not expecting it to get substantially worse. I mean as I said in the call, we have &#x2013; we had hoped the Christmas season which is usually a good season for the newspapers in Australia, would have given us a bit of a lift and just didn't happen. But I guess I would say those things, and then there's &#x2013; we're assuming the world itself is reasonably flat. We're not assuming &#x2013; we're not assuming there are wonders out of Washington or other things that would sort of give us great momentum but we're assuming the world sort of muddles along. And so that's sort of from a macro perspective.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks. Chase, just going back to Fox for a second. How do you see programming expense ramping there to try to drive the ratings growth and does the retrans revenue allow you to take more risk or be more aggressive? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Retrans certainly, I don't know that it makes &#x2013; it makes it a healthier business. I don't &#x2013; I think we &#x2013; I wouldn't necessarily say it gives us license to go spend more money, I think we ought to be taking intelligent shots to try and create unique hit programming. Look, content is the heart of this business and there's no question in this digital age you see it time and time again, great content is invaluable and it's what you want to create. And I think we need to invest, we need to invest smart and intelligently in creating great content whether it's at the studio or at the network or at our cable networks. And we will continue to do so.</p>
          <p>I mean the reality of retransmission is it enables the broadcast business to be a healthy business. As I said, we have had a very disappointing year ratings-wise but our broadcast business is up profitability and that's because we are building it into a dual revenue business, dual revenue and again I put stations in there because it really to me is one business, stations and network combined, it's a dual revenue business, that can be a very exciting healthy business and &#x2013; and a platform on the network really is our ultimate platform to launch franchise entertainment shows and franchise content, and really be a platform to market and sort of build all of our franchises in Television.</p>
          <p>And we need to continue investing in content, we need to do it smart and intelligently. I think we have &#x2013; and I think we have, I think, done a pretty good job of investing intelligently in content. We just went through a fall where unfortunately the volatility of the content world didn't &#x2013; didn't work our way. We feel good about the management team out there; we feel they're doing a good job. This isn't a business you can measure in a couple of months and sometimes you're going to have a tough &#x2013; you're going to have a tough three months. That's the nature of the content businesses. But we feel we got a really good team that has &#x2013; is focused on trying to cost-effectively invest, we want to &#x2013; we want to invest aggressively in content but build unique, distinct contents that can really be the type of franchises that have an ever increasingly unique value in this digital world.</p>

          <p>Thanks, John. Ryan, I think we have time for one last question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That comes from the line of Alan Gould with Evercore. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Yes, thank you very much. A question for Chase or James. Chase you have been trying &#x2013; you have been doing a good job at rationalizing a lot of these assets, selling some, buying some. The one giant asset that stands out there is BSkyB. From our appearance, it looks like it's too cheap to sell but sort of too hot an issue to buy. Is there anything you can do to recognize the value of BSkyB, which I think is probably not fully recognized in your stock?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll give you my two cents, James can add his two cents; hopefully they're not wildly diverging four cents. But the &#x2013; I mean first, your last comment I agree with wholeheartedly, it's not &#x2013; I think it's true with all our off balance sheet tests, it's the biggest, you're right, and I think there's a question of we don't get &#x2013; we don't get value or certainly fair value for it.</p>
          <p>And I think it is incumbent for us to continue to wrestle with that. And it certainly is something we will, but that being said, I think right now we're doing what we sort of have talked with in the past. We went through the process we went through the last couple of years. We've have made a determination today that we're going to stay the course we're on. It's a great business. Our focus in the short-term is to make sure we continue to make that business as strong as it can be. But I think over time we need to &#x2013; but I think it's not &#x2013; it's over time we need to figure out how do we wrestle that question to the ground. And there obviously &#x2013; I'm not going to get into speculation. There obviously are things we could do depending on the direction we want it to go, to capture more value out of the business, and I think well aware of those.</p>
          <p>But I think those are things we want to &#x2013; we want to wrestle with carefully because the saying once you head down a path, it probably precludes &#x2013; can preclude other options on the path. So I think we're going to be patient on &#x2013; patient with BSkyB. We're thrilled with the business, we're thrilled with the business's prospects and where it's going and we are very comfortable where we are. And so I agree with the issue but I think it's something we'll continue to wrestle with internally and decide what's right as we go forward. James, do you want to add anything?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have anything to add to that but I guess I would say just the one thing is that across the whole portfolio it is true that over the last couple of years we have really strived to simplify the operating model to deal with joint ventures, minorities, et cetera and there continues to be a lot of work in that area. And we continue to stay very focused on it and the recent transaction with Sky Deutschland is another good example of that as well as all of the &#x2013; as many of the things Chase mentioned earlier. So these are things that are across the whole business, we continue to be very focused on in terms of simplifying the operating model of the portfolio and having something that makes sense for the future.</p>
