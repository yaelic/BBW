          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to the Canadian Natural Resources First Quarter 2008 Conference Call.  I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Langille, Vice-Chairman of Canadian Natural Resources.  Please go ahead, Mr. Langille.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and good morning or afternoon as the case may be.  Thank you for attending this conference call giving us the opportunity to review our first quarter results for 2008 and review the development our projects.</p>
          <p>Participating with me today are Allan Markin, our Chairman; Steve Laut, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Doug Proll, our Senior Vice President of Finance; and R&#xE9;al Doucet, our Senior Vice President of Oil Sands.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would like to refer you to the forward-looking statements contained in our press release, and also note that all dollar amounts are in Canadian dollars and production and reserves are both before royalties unless otherwise stated.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Allan, Steve, R&#xE9;al, and Doug, I would like to make a couple of initial comments.  Our cash flow was very strong in the first quarter, as we saw a number of things.  Firstly, our production volumes were all within our budgeted guidance in all segments of our business.  The sale price of oil remained strong throughout the quarter.  The sales price of natural gas began to show a strong recovery.  And both the price of oil and natural gas have continued their strengths beyond the first quarter, resulting in very beneficial strip prices for our commodities going forward.</p>
          <p>The differential of West Texas intermediate price for heavy oil narrowed as crack spreads were at a level to influence the demand for heavy oil, and we continued to control our costs.  This resulted in our first quarter cash flow almost equaling our CapEx, which is not usual in the first quarter of the year as we direct more CapEx to our winter-only drilling areas.  As a result of this strong cash flow, our balance sheet continues to improve and we ended the first quarter at a debt-to-book capitalization back within our targeted ranges.</p>
          <p>Early in 2008, we made the decision to increase our total forecasted CapEx on the Horizon Project to protect the targeted completion data of Phase 1.  The project continues to target first oil in the third quarter of this year.  Realizing that target, of course, will result in very strong future cash flows from the sale of synthetic crude oil from this mining project.</p>
          <p>Allan, would you like to make a comment or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Thank you, John.  Good morning, everyone.  It has been a good start to the year for Canadian Natural.  Operationally, we had an efficient and well-executed winter drilling program that was completed well in advance of spring break-up, with all budgeted wells drilled and all planned tie-ins completed.  The continued benefits of our high-graded natural gas drilling program were seen as expected as we maximized the value of every dollar spent with focus placed on efficiency and execution.</p>
          <p>Our crude oil drilling program also produced good results, particularly at our Pelican Lake operations.  And our heavy oil projects continue to be some of the highest returning projects within our portfolio of assets, and we look forward to the development at Primrose East, the next step in our thermal expansion plans.</p>
          <p>Overall, our conventional operations produced to our expectations within original budgets.  All went as planned.  We were faced with some weather-related challenges during the first quarter with several weeks of extremely cold weather conventionally and at our Horizon Project site.  But once the weather became warmer, efficiencies improved as expected and the project continues on schedule for first oil targeted in the third quarter of this year.  We are mindful, however, that a significant amount of work remains before first production.  That being said, I have the confidence in our team's ability to work through these remaining challenges and any new ones that may arise.</p>
          <p>Our long-term objectives have been changed &#x2013; or have not changed.  The first quarter of this year was a good example of that.  We are committed to consistent value creation for our shareholders through efficient execution, long-term growth opportunities, and capital discipline.  We have the people and the projects in crude oil, natural gas as well as the oil sands that once again affirm that we are the premium value defined growth independent.  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Al, and good morning everyone.  As both Al and John have pointed out, the first quarter was a strong quarter.  Production was at the midpoint of guidance for gas and near the top-end for oil.  Costs in our conventional business are on track, within budget, and Horizon &#x2013; at Horizon we are tracking well within our revised cost estimate.</p>
          <p>Also at Horizon, we are making good, steady progress with start-up targeted for Q3 2008.  I think that's the third time you've heard it already, you will hear it a couple more times before we're done.</p>
          <p>Briefly updating you on each of our products starting with gas.  Our gas assets are strong and our production rates are &#x2013; look good.  Our Q1 program was right in line with our expectations both on the rate and cost side.  Considering we drilled only 161 gas wells in Q1 versus 201 gas wells in 2007 Q1 and 462 gas wells in Q1 2006, our gas volumes have held up remarkably well.  Our Q1 gas drilling in 2008 is actually only 35% of the wells we drilled in Q1 2006.  With the recent increase in gas prices, the relative economics between gas and oil has improved, particularly in BC.</p>
          <p>In Alberta, it's a different story.  The provincial government will receive 75% of the price increase is for a normal conventional gas well in 2009.  In other words, as gas prices have gone from $6 to $10, $3 of the $4 increase will be paid to Alberta in the form of royalties.  The message here is although the gas prices have gone up, the price increases producers see at the wellhead is significantly less in Alberta than in BC.</p>
          <p>As you know, Canadian Natural has a deep inventory of gas locations, a dominant infrastructure and a very strong technical and operational teams to add significant value from our gas assets in a relatively quick and effective manner.  Clearly, this turnaround will be delayed in Alberta until significantly higher prices are realized.</p>
          <p>Fortunately for Canadian Natural, our asset base is well balanced and our inventories in oil are as deep or deeper than our gas inventories.  This is where the majority of our capital will be allocated as we move forward.</p>
          <p>Turning to oil in Canada and particularly heavy oil and thermal heavy oil, which in our view is the most undervalued and under-appreciated asset in our portfolio.  The Primrose East development, bringing on 40,000 barrels a day of heavy oil, is on cost and on track with the first steam in late 2008 and first oil in early 2009.  Primrose East is the second phase of our Define program to bring on 325,000 barrels a day of incremental oil from our vast thermal oil assets.  At Kirby, our 45,000 barrel a day third phase is in the regulatory process, approval is expected in 2009.</p>
          <p>As you know, our Define program, which will add up to 325,000 barrels a day of incremental heavy oil from our vast heavy oil assets, is really unmatched and will add tremendous value to Canadian Natural shareholders.  Higher pricing has dramatically increased that value as well and of these assets.  It's ready to take another step though, a significant step, with pipeline access to the Gulf of Mexico refining markets.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural expects at least one of the four pipeline proposals to be completed and on stream likely in late 2011 or early 2012.  This will normalize the differentials between the Midwest and Gulf of Mexico, adding value to all heavy oil producers in Canada.</p>
          <p>At Pelican Lake, our world-class pool with 2.8 billion barrels in place, is a significant resource.  With the polymer flooding, we can take recoveries from 5% up to 25%, or an incremental 560 million barrels of low-cost incremental oil.  Our polymer flood expansion continues on track and is delivering as expected.  The polymer flood will add significant value for Canadian Natural shareholders.</p>
          <p>On the heavy oil differential side, we have seen a marked reduction, as John mentioned, in differentials in March.  That has remained through April and May having a very positive impact on Canadian Natural's cash flow in Q1 and will have an impact in Q2.</p>
          <p>Our heavy oil assets are vast, pricing is strong.  With additional pipeline access to new markets and our well-defined plan, the future looks very bright for this undervalued and under-appreciated jewel in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Turning to international operations, which provide light oil balance and some of the highest return on capital projects in our portfolio.  North Sea production was steady in Q1 but will remain pretty much flat for 2008 with some reductions expected with turnarounds in Q2 and Q3.  Today we are in a major turnaround on Ninian South, about 21 days, and that will be completed in May.  We continue to implement our mature basin strategy by optimizing waterfloods, in-fill drilling, workovers and recompletions to maintain production capacity, adding reserves and extending field life.</p>
          <p>In Cote d'Ivoire, the deepwater rig has arrived at Baobab and has begun the restoration of production from the five wells shut in due to sanding issues.  We have a one-year contract with the rig and, depending on the effectiveness, anticipate to bring on a minimum of three of the five wells shut in due to sanding.  Currently, we have 8 to 10,000 barrels a day of capacity shut in.</p>
          <p>Our Olowi development in Gabon is on track.  The jack-up rig has arrived last week, well ahead of our expectations, and the rig will drill two delineation wells before it sets up to bring drilling to platform production wells.  The FPSO is under construction in Dubai, wellhead towers in Sardinia, and we are on schedule with first oil expected in late 2008, early 2009, ramping up to a 20,000 barrel a day plateau.</p>
          <p>Now, before I ask R&#xE9;al to give you an update on Horizon, our world-class oil sands project, I'll make just a few general comments.  We have as you know over 6 billion barrels of oil developed at Horizon.  Phase 1 is nearing the end of construction with start-up on track and targeted for Q3 2008.  Phase 1 will produce at 110,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>We have broken Phase 2 and 3 into four tranches.  The first tranche is complete and the second tranche is underway.  And the long lead items for Phase 2 and 3 are ordered, and in fact the coke drums and the hydrotreating vessel rings are on site.</p>
          <p>Phase 2/3 will take us to between 230 and 250,000 barrels a day of light sweet 34 degree API crude.  In addition, we have plans for phases 4 and 5 to take production to just under 500,000 barrels a day or 0.5 million barrels a day of light sweet crude with no declines for 40 years, creating tremendous value for Canadian Natural shareholders.</p>
          <p>We are now in the Phase I home stretch with a tremendous amount of effort and focus being spent by our teams as we push for mechanical completion, pre-commissioning, commissioning and getting ready for operations.  Overall, we are on track and we will be ready for our targeted Q3 start-up.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn it over to R&#xE9;al to bring you up to date and comment on our plans going forward.  R&#xE9;al?</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve.  Yes, indeed, we have achieved 94% progress on the project in the first quarter now, so it is on target.  And we have on the engineering side now of course totally completed.  The engineers left on site right now and helping in the field construction.  On the procurement side, we have all the equipment on site.  We have also in terms of heavy load pretty well everything on site except few trucks and shovel components right now.</p>
          <p>On the close out of the contract, we are over 30% close out now on all the contract we have.  As you know, we have about 600 contracts on site.  So we are winding down on that as well.  So on the modularization, all the oversized load have been installed already and we are into finalization of piping.  The major effort right now is really into hydrotesting, pipe blow-out kind of thing, air blow-out, and few other, walk down the plant side with the operators, and so on.</p>
          <p>So on the construction side, the overall construction progress is 91%.  The &#x2013; starting with the mine in overburden removal we have moved 56.7 million bank cubic meter already, which represent about 80% of the total to be moved, and we are on schedule for that one.  We already have commissioned trucks and shovels also for the mine.</p>
          <p>We have completed the Tar River diversion and the Fish Habitat construction that we had awarded to our own mining crew, so the mining crew now is back into doing overburden and that's the thing also with the contractor.</p>
          <p>We are substantially completed now in the extraction plant, and in the first quarter we have introduced water to the plant, test all the pipes and the pumps and so on.  We have completed also the constructions on two tanks on the tank farm, the east tank farm which are now filled with diluent for the start-up, so we have 190,000 barrel of diluent now ready for the start-up of the plant.  We have installed also three nitrogen storage tanks and completed all the pipings and the systems, control system and so on, for the nitrogen plant.  It is now ready and commissioned, so it is available to each area.</p>
          <p>We have installed also the auxiliary boiler in the cogeneration plant.  We have the warehouse fully functional now and we have close to $5 million worth of inventory in them already for the sustaining operation.  We have energized the last two substation, the sulphur recovery and the gas-treating substation on the plant side.  So all the sub stations, all the power distribution is completed, energized and commissioned, so it is also available for each area for start-up.</p>
          <p>We have also substantially completed the construction of the amine plant and we are moving that plant now into pre-commissioning.  We have started also the construction of the sulphur pipeline, which we &#x2013; as you know, we are going to do some sulphur blocking and that also will be competed on schedule.  And we have completed a lot of piping right now on the heat integration, pretty well done and we are starting the walk down on that area.  All in all, we have over 100 systems that have been commissioned, tested and everything, and the majority of them are in operation right now.  So indeed, we have started the commissioning of our plant already in January and we are continuing right now.</p>
          <p>What has been completed today, so we have all the firewater distributions and also energized and operational.  The potable water treatment plant, the permanent sewage treatment plant, the natural gas pipeline, the raw and recycled water pipeline, river water intake and pump house, the raw water pond and the pump house, recycled water pond with its pump house, all the electrical distribution.  We have the tank also to be able to put the plant in circulation.  We have the main pipe rack also that has been energized, the air, the water, the gas, the power are right now live in the pipe rack.  So the instrument and the utility air also right now is operational for the area who needed it.</p>
          <p>So we are forecasting now for the second quarter of '08 to have the extraction commissioned, the flare system, the steam in the cogeneration plant, the cooling and the heating integration plant, and the delayed coker, and the diluent recovery unit, the hydrogen plant, the gas treating and the sulphur recovery, the West Tank Farm also, which is an inter-plant intermediate kind of tankage to be able to put the diluent and the DV, the sulphur blocking pipeline and the synthetic crude oil product pipeline,  Then so what we are going to have left for Q3 is the ore preparation plant, the froth treatment plant, the cogeneration on the power side, the pipeline corridor, the hydrotreater, and whatever other things that are remaining in the East Tank Farm.</p>
          <p>So right now, the plant is vibrating, there is a lot of activities out there.  It is really high focus at this time to make sure that the plants are running well.  We are doing a lot of walk down and we are checking all of the equipment instrumentation.  And by the way the control room, which is controlling and managing the entire plant, is fully operational right now.  So all the pumps and pipes and valves and so on are controlled by the control room at this time.</p>
          <p>So we are well in tune right now to finish the commissioning and having first oil in the third quarter of 2008.  We have reallocated some resources already to Phase 2/3 on the engineering side.  We are in negotiation right now with some engineering firm also for the detail design for Phase 2/3.  We have awarded already several contract, major contract into Phase 2/3.</p>
          <p>So that's pretty well where we are right now and we are looking forward here to produce oil in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, R&#xE9;al for that great update.  As you can see, we have made good progress at Horizon as we prepare for the targeted Q3 start-up.</p>
          <p>With the start-up of Horizon, Canadian Natural will take a major, positive step in our ongoing evolution.  Horizon will shift from a large consumer of our conventional free cash flow to a large sustainable contributor to Canadian Natural's cash flow.  As a result, our balance sheet will strengthen quickly.  Cash flow available to allocate to capital projects will increase dramatically allowing Canadian Natural not only to unlock the huge value associated with future Horizon expansions, but the significant value in our high-quality conventional assets.</p>
          <p>We are in great shape and we are in an enviable position.  Our gas assets are strong and poised to deliver value growth once the relative economics of oil and gas normalize.  Our oil assets are even stronger in Canada with 325,000 barrels of incremental oil to add.</p>
          <p>Internationally, we continue to leverage our mature basin expertise, our offshore expertise and our government relations niche into some of the highest return projects in the company's portfolio.  And of course, Horizon is a world-class project, which will add tremendous value for shareholders.  We have the assets, a well-defined plan, the discipline, and most importantly the people to execute the plan and generate significant value for shareholders.  We are on the verge of taking the next step in our evolution and we are in great shape not only to successfully make this step, but to add tremendous shareholder value into the foreseeable future.  We are on track and confident in our ability to deliver in the future.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Doug to update you on our strong financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve, and good morning.  In the first quarter of 2008, Canadian Natural generated over $1.7 billion of cash flow from operations or $3.19 per share, and $727 million of net earnings.  We incurred 1.75 billion of capital expenditures in line with our cash flows, which allowed our financial metrics to continue to improve inside or below our target ranges.  Our commitment to cost control, controlled capital spending and discipline to the balance sheet is very evident in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Our liquid resources remained strong.  At the end of the first quarter our undrawn lines of &#x2013; bank lines of credit was over $2.6 billion.  This liquidity, combined with the plan to balance cash flow and capital expenditures in a year which will see us complete four major projects, again demonstrates our financial discipline.</p>
          <p>Our commodity hedge book is posted on our website and is presented in the press release.  Our hedging policy has served us well since it was implemented, coincident with the Horizon project sanction in early 2005.  This policy and the program allowed us the confidence to proceed with the major projects, continue to develop our existing conventional assets, and be opportunistic in several asset acquisitions, which further strengthened our asset base as well as our cash flow generating capabilities.</p>
          <p>Now, we are happy to report as we look forward to first oil from Horizon and with our financial strength in tact that we will be reducing our reliance on commodity hedges commencing next year.  The company's commodity hedge program has been revised to allow for the hedging of up to 50% of the near 12 month budgeted production down from the current 75%, and up to 25% of the following 13 to 24 months estimated production down from 50%.  We will continue to monitor opportunities to reduce commodity risk, but we will rely more on capital allocation and we will improve our balance sheet strength through absolute debt reduction in 2009.  Thank you.</p>
          <p>Back to you, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Doug and thank you, Steve and R&#xE9;al, for that great update on our developments.  I think as you can see our strategy of having a balanced asset base with many exploitation opportunities continues to result in excellent value creation for our shareholders.  We are focused to continue this value creation throughout the rest of 2008 and into the next stages of the developments of our strong asset base.</p>
          <p>With that, operator, I would open up the conference call to any questions that people may have.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  The first question is from Brian Dutton of Credit Suisse.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Steve.  You were commenting on the attractiveness of the heavy oil prospects you have.  Can you compare for us please the recycle ratios that you believe you'll be getting over the near-term on heavy crude versus what you're seeing on natural gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brian.  That's a very good question and one that probably isn't as well understood out there considering the first quarter cash flow we managed to generate.</p>
          <p>If you look at our heavy oil recycle ratios particularly what Q2 pricing as sort of the strip says right now, we'd be getting depending on whether you're going from Pelican Lake to Primrose or conventional cold heavy, anywhere from 4.5, 5 to 6 recycle ratio, so pretty darn strong.  On the gas side, if you assume gas gets up there, 970, 965 range, we would get a recycle ratio of 2.7.  So, pretty good recycle ratio, but certainly doesn't compare to oil today.</p>
          <p>The other thing you've got to look at, Brian, here is as we look at in 2009, if you look at that same recycle ratio going forward for a well in that price range, normal well sort of 600 Mcf a day, we would get a recycle ratio right now under this current royalty scheme of 2.4.</p>
          <p>Under the new royalty formula, which will come in effect January 2009, the recycle ratio drops to 1.6.  So effective January 2009, our recycle ratio drops well below 2, even in a price that's close to $10.  So with the heavy oil prices and oil prices in general and the new royalty regime coming in 2009, I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out why we're not drilling as many gas wells in Alberta.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Just to clarify, that 2.7 recycle ratio, was that on all your wells?  Or, you were talking 2.7 going to the 2.4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm talking 2.7 is sort of on a historical basis.  But if you look going forward, we would be about 2.4.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.  I was wondering &#x2013; two part question, the first one, how much do you have on your bank lines currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug will answer that question.  I think we have various lines there, Doug?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  We have &#x2013; right now, we have available bank lines of 3.8 billion, and drawn at the end of the quarter was just under 1.2 billion, leaving us with the 2.6 billion of available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And as far as the plans for that, you mentioned that you anticipated the balance sheet to strengthen quickly with the cash flow.  Are you content to just use the cash flow to pay down that bank line or you have expectations of terming that debt out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We issued debt in January and that gave us the liquidity we need for the rest of this year.  And so, we'll be allocating much of our excess cash flow going forward to bank debt.  And then when we get to the 2009 budget then we'll reevaluate and see where we are at that point.</p>

          <p>The following question is from Dave Thomas of Hi-Fi Capital.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, Steve.  Three questions.  First of all, on the budget, somewhat following the last question, when I just look at the numbers, what you guys did in the first quarter and where the strip is, you are going to be doing cash flow probably well north of 6 billion this year.  And you're only spending 2.4 billion of that on conventional CapEx, ex the acquisition based on the budget you gave us at the analyst meeting.  So you're spending between 35 and 40% of your CapEx.  When are we going to get a sense of when you are going to ramp that up?  I mean, you got Horizon coming on in Q, within the next quarter, are we going to need to wait until you guys come out with the new budget at the end of year or would you possibly consider doing something in the second half to go ahead and start spending the money given how much cash flow you are going to be looking at once you're comfortable Horizon is out on time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what we are going to do here is, obviously wait and see what the pricing environment is going forward.  Obviously, it's very strong right now, and the strip looks strong.  We want to just see that that's going to continue before we make any commitments.  Obviously, we can ramp up.</p>
          <p>But our first allocation of this cash flow goes to balance sheet.  So from the near-term here all that cash flow will go to our balance sheet.  And we will see how we go in the second half.  We haven't made any decisions at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Second question on the polymer floods, you mentioned the recovery rates.  Can you talk a little bit more about what that's adding incrementally where you've initiated that program?  And then also and probably more importantly, how much of your heavy oil reserve base could be polymer flooded?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll answer the second part first.  We are looking at other areas in polymer flood, but not much.  Pelican Lake in itself is a very unique pool.  It's very appropriate for polymer flooding.  We're probably 35 to 40% of the way of getting the pool converted, so we've got a lot more to go.  And we see production ramping up here.  We're on to a major conversion right now, so obviously you lose a lot of production wells as you convert.  So, it's a flat area in the production profile, but it will start to ramp up when the polymer kicks in.</p>
          <p>As far as the other heavy oil properties we have, and our average recovery I'd say on our primary heavy oil is somewhere in that 10 to 15% range.  And we are looking at many different techniques and technologies to increase that recovery.  Clearly, there is a huge amount of oil left in the ground.  We got the wells drilled already.  So there is a lot of leverage to any increase technology you can get there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  But it sounds like you are saying the polymer floods really are Pelican Lake opportunity right now and not much beyond that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then, lastly on your South Africa project, I then you guys have that offshore prospect we've talked about in the past.  Where -- can you give us an update on what you're thinking about there?  What the opportunity could be, and when you might go after it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we can.  You're probably talking to the wrong guy because I'm an engineer.  They tell me it's a 30% chance of success, so to me that means a 70% chance of a dry hole.  But going forward, they are very, very big structures, it's in deep water, it's a very hostile environment, strong currents and large waves.  So you've got to drill in the summer.  And you've got to pick your spot.  We are looking -- we will drill as well, I believe, but probably not until late 2009 or maybe late 2010, basically drilling it in their summer, our winter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, you've accelerated 49 of the120 Primrose North wells into this year.  Was it purely an economic decision or was it more a decision of equipment becoming available?  What drove you to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The drill is, Martin, is we were getting as you know very, very good results at Primrose.  Primrose is a long lead time, it takes, because we drill these super pads with so many wells on them, it takes a long time to drill the wells and takes a long time to get the facilities set up to produce and then steam.  And we felt that it's very economic to do and it's a case of being efficient with the equipment that we have.  And we'll keep on drilling here for the rest of the year, and that production will come on in 2009.  So it's a really kind of both I guess, it's economic and it's efficiency of the equipment we are using right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, okay.  And second question, we've seen sulphur prices explode here in the last four or five months.  You guys will be producing sulphur out of Horizon.  You produce sulphur, modest amounts, elsewhere.  Any thoughts on being able to get some revenue out of all that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Martin, a good point.  We produce a lot of sulphur coming out of Horizon.  We will produce 800 tons a day when we're up at 110,000 barrels a day.  We will and we are right now in negotiations to sell that sulphur.  We won't do that until Q1, 2009.  We don't want to have a bunch of things going, going here in the basically Q3 and Q4 when we're trying to get lined out to full value.  So Q1, 2009, we're looking to actually transport that sulphur and sell it in the market.  As you know, it's going for about $600 a ton.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  The following question is from Stephen Calderwood of Raymond James.  Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.  I wonder if I could expand or get you to expand on carbon capture issues.  You obviously have some projects like at Primrose where you have an established baseline of production.  And then in Horizon where you're just establishing or you will establish a baseline for emissions.  Do you have any thoughts around using your excess cash flow to try and take the lead on carbon capture, maybe participate in building some pipelines from Fort McMurray?  Or just how do you view the opportunity in carbon capture?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're looking fairly optimistically at carbon capture, Steve.  It's important for us to do this right.  And our first step will be in tranche two, tranche three at base two and three.  We will capture the CO2 from the hydrogen plant, and that's part of the engineering design that's going on right now.  It's a very pure stream of CO2.  We'll use that in our thicken peelings process.  So that's going to do a number of things for us, Steve.  It's a win, win, win, really.</p>
          <p>By capturing the CO2, we'll put that through our tailings.  It allows us to basically lock up the CO2, sequester it forever.  But it gets the silts and the sediments to drop out of the water very quickly in comparison to techniques used now.  That'll allow us to get the water back in the system when it's warmer, not cold.  It means we will burn less fuel, so less cost.  Burning less fuel means less CO2.  The fact that we have thickened tailings means our tailings ponds will be smaller.</p>
          <p>So overall it has sort of a win, win, win on the environmental side as well as the cost side for us.  It costs a lot of capital to get there, but it's an important thing for us to do.  We also, in looking forward, we participate with all the industry initiatives to do more as an industry to get a carbon backbone in place, but too early to say where that's going.</p>

          <p>The following question is from Peter Ogden of National Bank Financial.  Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentleman.  Couple questions.  In your budget, you still have allocated $390 million towards acquisitions.  Given where prices are, I guess, what kind of opportunities do you see out there?  And then, is that money better spent, I guess, drilling at this point given maybe price expectations in the acquisition market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good point, Peter.  We evaluate all the time.  Every acquisition we make has to compete with our other activities in the company.  Every dollar competes with capital.  And it may be that we will not allocate that capital to acquisitions.  And as we get into later in Q3 and Q4, we may allocate that to drilling.  Obviously, we have the inventory and the resources to make that allocation if we need.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would that be money spent in the second half or would that get pushed into 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it will be in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question, I guess surrounds cash tax guidance, maybe for Doug.  The guidance is based on $73 oil and $7 NYMEX.  Obviously as prices go up, I would guess that cash tax as a percentage of total tax goes up.  Is there any additional I guess guidance you can give us surrounding that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that two things, Peter, with -- the first thing is that the increase that we saw on natural gas and heavy oil differential pertain to Canada, so that increases our allocation back to Canada.  So that actually dropped our effective tax rate for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The second thing that might help a little bit too is the fact that we had just over $2 billion worth of expenditures that became available for use in 2008 with respect to the Horizon Project, and they transfer across into class 41.  So that had the effect of reducing our cash taxes for 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, on a proportional basis as we go forward, I mean, is it still the same percentage of cash tax or is that actually going to go down then in 2008 compared to the guidance that was in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cash taxes, it should be the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the effective tax rate for the overall tax rate, we'll be at the low end of our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Following question is from Barbara Betanski of UBS Global Asset Management.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a natural gas question and it's related to the considerable excitement that we're seeing in the industry over some new horizontal drilling and multi fracing techniques.  The question is, I'm not sure if this technology has sort of a narrow applicability to plays like the Montney or other resource type plays, or whether you would possess assets where this technology might be beneficial?  So whether it can be more widely applied and if perhaps some of the benefits, continued economics of this type of technique might offset some of the negative impacts of the royalty changes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Barbara, I'm not sure it's going to impact the royalty changes.  The basis of the fracs is to get the rates up to economic levels.  And as you know, the royalties are based on rates.  So the higher the rate, the more royalty you pay.  So it's not going to really help us on the royalty side.</p>
          <p>As you know, most of this shale gas focus has been in BC.  And now, the way it's described and the way you see it and the way our exploration group sees it, there seems to be in a way really no limit yet defined on the shale gas.  It's an evolving play.  You have the Horn River Basin and you have Montney shale play and then you have the Cordova Basin with the EV and other shales.  We obviously are one of the largest landholders in BC and in Alberta.</p>
          <p>On the Montney gas play, we have 200 sections of 100% land that we feel looks very prospective.  And we think the Montney is most developed for us.  On the Horn River Basin, we have some land, but we are not thinking that's great land yet, but it's hard to say.  It doesn't seem to be a defined limit.  You know, with more drilling, the limits will get defined on all these plays.  In the Cordova Basin where we have the EV shale, we have done some drilling.  It doesn't look that good yet, and we obviously have a significant land base there, but, from our other activities.  So that now I think is probably lagging the rest of those shale plays.</p>
          <p>As far as developing to other resources, it's really a tight, tight rock.  And you've seen it being used in the Bakken in southeast Saskatchewan.  That's basically the same technology, just modified.  So we have other areas that are in the <mark type="inaudible" /> resources that haven't developed because they're tight.  We are looking at some of those.</p>
          <p>Interesting enough, we are actually looking at it a little bit in the North Sea.  The deeper you go in the North Sea.  The deeper you go in the North Sea, the more compacted the zones get and the tighter the rock.</p>
          <p>Obviously to do these long horizontal wells with major fracs, you are limited somewhat by the topside facilities you have and equipment to get these large fracs up.  So it's not &#x2013; I don't know if it's really economic yet, but there is a lot of oil particularly around our Ninian Field that is buried deeper but very tight and low rate.  So we are looking at some of that as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So it would be fair to say then in terms of North American gas it's very early days and whatever you find might, won't really impact your strategy for gas for the next year or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's fair to say.  We've got a pretty good inventory.  It's not like we have to develop shale gas just to stay alive.  And we're watching, we're doing some drilling ourselves, we're doing experiments.  And we'll probably have I would say in 2009 some development and then bring on major developments later in 2009, early 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Steve.  I wanted to ask you another question about Horizon, because the construction in progress is 91% complete at the end of the quarter.  So there's a lot of work to be done.  I'm not so concerned about your ability to get that work done between now and the summer, but to the extent that finishing the construction can interfere with the commissioning, what do you do to prevent that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Rob, I'll give you sort of a general question and R&#xE9;al can probably give you &#x2013; can give you a dissertation for the next two hours if you'd like.  But really what we are doing here is you know this &#x2013; and you've been to the plant site, Rob, so it's a very large site, very well spread out.  We've designed this thing with that in mind.  So, as you heard R&#xE9;al talk, we'll be completing and commissioning plants as we go.  And really the &#x2013; right now the extraction plant is basically running on water.  We are circulating water around and around.  So it's pretty well ready to go.</p>
          <p>There is some construction left; you got to do some insulation, a little bit of heat tracing.  Those things really don't need to be done before winter and you get them done as you can.  Same thing will be happening across the plant.  So it's a very methodical and well thought out plan how you do it.  You are right, if you try to just send a bunch of guys in there and do a bunch of things differently without a well thought out plan that you can end up in sort of a circus.</p>
          <p>So, R&#xE9;al, you want to give more detail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I think what we got to understand is once you are at the 90% completion you're switching your construction progress from a ball progress genre area progress to system progress.  So what we do then is we are assigning the workflows for the construction by system.  So you are finishing up, for example, you are finishing up weathering your pipe, then you do your hydrotesting, then you connect your instrumentations, electrical installations and so on.  And as you do your hydrotesting, you do your walk around, and that is done with the operator.  So, then the operator knows what the system looks like.  He also has completed his punch list.  The mechanic and the welders are fixing up the punch list.  We do reinstatement afterwards.  In other words, all the little gauges and so on that we have used to do the hydrotest are removed.  And then we are reconnecting the pipe for a final inspection and then insulation.</p>
          <p>So it's a coordinated effort at this stage between the construction and the operation.  So in fact right now, the project managers and the operation managers are working hand in hand.  They are at this stage in the same office, they are using the same planning tool, the same planner as a matter of fact, the same coordinators also to get the job going in a smooth transition between the constructions and the operation.</p>
