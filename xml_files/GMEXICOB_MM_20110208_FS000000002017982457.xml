      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today in Grupo M&#xE9;xico's fourth quarter and full year 2010 earnings conference call.</p>
          <p>Joining me today are Octavio Ornelas, the CEO of Grupo Ferrosur Mexicana; Oscar Gonzalez, CFO, of Asarco, and other executives of the company.  On today's conference call, I will briefly comment on the economic environment of this quarter and the main issues impacting the company's profitability for the full year 2010.</p>
          <p>Then I'll comment on our Mining division's most relevant results, to pass on call to Octavio, who will explain the financial results of our Transportation division.  I'll finally give you an update on your proposal to combine Southern Copper and the Asarco's operations.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, metal prices improved significantly due to robust demand largely driven by emerging markets, and some consumption recovery from the developed economies.  Continually declining inventories and therefore a tight copper market, we also saw a weak dollar and excess of liquidity entering into the base metals.  Consequently, during the fourth quarter, we experienced further recovery but with increased volatility.</p>
          <p>According to International Copper Study Group, for the first 10 months of 2010 world refined copper consumption exceeded production by 400,000 tons, against a surplus of 32,000 tons in the same period of 2009.  Mainly explained by the recovery in usage levels in Japan, the European Union and the United States, as well as increasing consumption by the developing countries.  At the same time, China continued a positive arbitrage, continued its purchase leading to a decline in inventories and also positive arbitrage between LME and Shanghai.</p>
          <p>Those developments are clear evidence that we are moving towards a tight supply balance and robust fundamental for copper. Most analysts believe there will be a 400,000 to 800,000 tons deficit in 2011.</p>
          <p>We believe the market is anticipating copper's scarcity.  But also think that the copper market price might be overreacting to expectations.  The volatility of copper we believe, will continue in the short-term. Considering the mentioned circumstances and volatility, we have decided to take some price protection through the use of swaps and zero-cost collars.</p>
          <p>I'll discuss this topic further in a minute.  The average copper price for the fourth quarter was $3.92 per pound, 30% above the $3.02 recorded in the same quarter of 2009 and 19% higher in the third quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>With respect to Molybdenum, which as you know is our main byproduct, in 2010, it represented around 10% of our mining division sales.  I'd like to note that Moly sales as a percentage of the group sales have dropped because Asarco is not currently recovering any more, although we have plans to do so.</p>
          <p>Molybdenum prices averaged in 2010 $15.60 per pound, which is 43% above the average price in 2009.  We're currently seeing a slight recovery in Molybdenum consumption.  For the year 2011, we are expecting a relatively down market for this metal and hence have volatile prices at about $16 per pound.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Grupo M&#xE9;xico financial highlights, we are happy to report that in the fourth quarter 2010 our total consolidated revenues were nearly 2.3 billion, an increase of 52% year-over-year.  Accumulative revenue for the year were 8.1 billion reaching a record high and an increase of 67% year-over-year.  This increase is mainly due to higher metal prices and higher copper production volumes, as a result of the production we started in Buenavista. Buenavista is what we &#x2013; previously called Cananea. As well, as the corporation of the Asarco combined with significant increase of 28% in the revenue generated by our Transportation division, which Octavio will comment in detail. As Copper fundamental remained one of the most solid in the entire commodity sector, we anticipate good results to continue in 2011.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales for the fourth quarter was 928 million, an increase of 25% on a year-over-year basis, but 7% lower than the third quarter of 2010. This cost increase 184 million is mainly explained by the corporation of Asarco, which alone accounted for 76% of this increase. It was also affected by higher prices in several of our key inputs and by the Peso appreciation against the dollar.</p>
          <p>Even as copper prices improved, the company will continue its efforts of reducing costs, improve productivity, and maintain consumption and expense discipline with the goal of strengthening our position as one of the leading copper producers of low cost.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the fourth quarter was 1.2 billion, with an EBITDA margin of 55%. This figure represents a significant improvement of 79% year-over-year. The year's accumulated EBITDA was 4 billion, compared to 2.1 billion in 2009, a significant increase of 90% year-over-year, out of which 180 million were contributed by Asarco. Net income in the fourth quarter was 527 million, an increase of 53% year-over-year. For the full-year 2010, net income was 1.6 billion, a significant increase of 84% compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>With respect to CapEx, in 2009, we &#x2013; it amounted 604 million, out of which 454 million was spent in the Mining Division and 132 million in the Transportation Division, the remaining 18 million in our Infrastructure Division.</p>
          <p>In the Transportation Division, investments were made for the continued expansion of signings and improvement of safety measures. As a result of the solid performance in 2010 in our Mining Division, we continued with our mine expansions particularly in the Buenavista mine, where we expect to increase on our production to 180,000 tons &#x2013; from 180,000 tons which of you might know in the current capacity to 450,000 tons of copper that is an increase of 150%.</p>
          <p>For this reason, we're happy to announce that the Board approved a 2.3 billion capital budget for 2011. The highest annual budget in our history, out of which we will invest 1.9 million to our Mining Division and 400 million for Transportation Division. Here we need for the acquisition of 44 new locomotives in Ferromex and 14 locomotives in Ferrosur. This we expect to deliver in 2011.</p>
          <p>As we have previously announced, we continue with the re-construction and ramp-up of Buenavista. In order to reflect the restart of this mine and the new era, we have changed the name from Cananea to Buenavista del Cobre.</p>
          <p>The SX/EW plant produced 20,696 tons of copper cathodes in 2010. Operations began at the concentrated plant in October and Buenavista is now running at 70% of capacity and expects to reach its maximum capacity by the end of the first quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>At yearend 2010, Southern Copper spent 71 million in the rehabilitation of mine and plants of the Buenavista property and expecting to spend 37 million in 2011. We are maintaining our estimated debt cost of record at approximately 114 million. A portion of the total expenditures should be recovered from insurance.</p>
          <p>The current capacity of Buenavista as I mentioned is 180,000 tons. The implementation of community works and infrastructure, health and education programs continued for the benefit of the surrounding areas.</p>
          <p>Construction continues on the new SX/EW plant and its conveyor belt and transportation system on Buenavista. The retail engineering started in January 2011. When completed, the equipment will be purchased and the infrastructure construction will begin. The budget for this project is 236 million, of which 37.3 million have been disbursed as of December 31. Production of this plant will begin in the first-half of 2013.</p>
          <p>Basic engineering studies are underway for the Molybdenum plant at Buenavista and are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2011. Subsequently, the metallurgical tests will be conducted and the detailed engineering studies will be started, so that by the purchase of equipment. Productions here is expected for the fourth quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>With respect to Tia Maria, our Greenfield project in Peru, the company had provided the Peruvian government additional information on the project, including the option to use seawater. On December, the Ministry of Energy and Mines have approved our communication plan and new options to obtain the consent of the environmental impact study from the local communities.</p>
          <p>We expect the government to issue its final approval in April 2011 following which construction will begin in the second quarter of 2011 and production in the fourth quarter of 2012.  The estimated investment is 934 million, of which 432.5 million have been disbursed as of December 31.</p>
          <p>At the total completion of the expansion, <mark type="inaudible" /> increase in the project's milling capacity to improve the estimated additional copper production to 125,000 tons per year.  As a result of this review, the environmental impact study is expected to be presented during the second quarter of 2011 and production to begin in the first quarter of 2013.</p>
          <p>Now turning to debt, the total consolidated debt at year-end amounted to 4 billion.  With a cash balance of nearly 3 billion, the company's net debt stands at a little bit south of $1.958 billion to be served.  The company maintains a comfortable long-term debt amortization schedule and ample financial flexibility going forward.  Our current cash position for the cash generation will support all operational needs and CapEx going forward and allow us to have ample room to explore additional value generating opportunities as they arise.</p>
          <p>Now with respect to dividends, on November 12, we paid a dividend of $0.25 pesos per share outstanding which was equivalent to $155 million.  For the fourth quarter 2010, the company's Board approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.30 pesos per share outstanding, which will be paid in cash on February 18 and represents an investment of approximately $190 million.</p>
          <p>We are signing this hedging the company had contracted swaps and zero cost collars to both Southern Copper and Asarco.  This was in order to reduce price volatility and protect sales value to present in swap and 36% in collars of the expected production of 2011.</p>
          <p>For 2012, we have hedged around 3% of estimated production <mark type="inaudible" /> to collars.  With this hedging strategy we're also showing the next year cash flow generation to fund our  aggressive capital expansion program.</p>
          <p>Now turning to a quick overview of Asarco, which as you know <mark type="inaudible" /> 12:11) and December 2009 and since then have consolidated into Groupo Mexico.  So, this has been the first full-year consolidating with Groupo.  We are happy to comment that for 2010, Asarco sales were $1.7 billion, a significant increase of 46% year-over-year.  Cost of sales was $954 million, up 19% from the same period 2009 although 9% lower than the third quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>EBITDA was $818 million <mark type="audio gap" /> (12:40 &#x2013; 12:55)</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Asarco's copper mine production for 2010 was 209,000 tons, an increase of 13% over the same period 2009.  This increase is due primarily to better ore grades at our Mission mine and improved recoveries at Ray.  Asarco continues to reduce its cash costs after byproducts lowering it to $1.50 per pound in 2010 from the previous $1.60 per pound in 2009. This improvement is the result of greater productivity and operating efficiency, in addition to better product prices.</p>
          <p>The company had the potential to increase production in Asarco by 90,000 tons of <mark type="inaudible" /> copper per year. We are working on the plan and will give you the breakdown and details of the expansions and CapEx that we are booking for that 90,000 additional tons.</p>
          <p>I will now mention the main developments at Southern Copper.  We'll prefer to keep this brief as Southern Copper had its own conference call already.  For the full year 2010, Southern Copper's net sales were slightly over $5.1 billion, copper sales was $2.1 billion, EBITDA was $2.9 billion with an EBITDA margin of 56% and net income was $1.5 billion for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In 2010, Southern Copper's mine production of copper decreased 1.4% due mainly to lower ore grade at our Cuajone and Caridad mine.  However, to compensate copper production increased 3.5% year-over-year as a result of the restarted production at the FHC government plants in Buenavista.  For 2011, Southern Copper's <mark type="inaudible" /> increased by 31% production to 630,000 tons.</p>
          <p>Our 2011 guidance for Molybdenum production is 17,000 for the year. 2010 cash cost of the byproducts was $16.8 per pound of copper.  This cash cost was $0.19 lower than the $35.8 per pound of cash cost recorded in 2009, moving into higher byproduct revenues and continue efficiencies in operating costs.  I will now pass the call to Octavio Ornelas, who will discuss the financial highlights of the transportation division. Octavio.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Daniel and good morning everyone.  I will talk about the main developments during the fourth quarter 2010 and full year 2010 resource for our transport division, represented by the holding company Infraestructura y Transportes Mexico, ITM, AND its principal subsidiary Grupo Ferroviaro Mexicano, Ferrocarriles Mexicano, Ferromax and Ferrosur, which is accounted by the participation method.</p>
          <p>The relative load volume transported during the fourth quarter of this year measured in net tons-kilometers reported a record high of 11.1 billion compared to the 10.3 billion during the fourth quarter of 2009 representing an increase of 8% year-on-year. Total volume in 2010 reached the record of 45.3 billion of net tons-kilometers, an increase of 16% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Also the number of rail cars transported achieved a record high of 20% more cars than in 2009. The intermodal segment showed the most dynamic growth during the year with a 30% increase in the number of containers transported. Our guidance for load volumes in 2011 is 50.1 billion net tons-kilometers representing an increase of 11% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>ITM net sales for the fourth quarter was $300 million, an increase of 19% compared with the same quarter of 2009. Net sales in 2010 reached a record of $1.2 billion, 28% increase year-on-year. mainly from higher volumes in most of our segment as intermodal traffic which rose 39%, metals 27%, automotive 24%, agriculture 20% and the steel products and others 15%. 2011 plan cost $1.4 billion total revenue, an aggressive 20% increase.</p>
          <p>Operating cost for the fourth quarter was $204 million, an increase of 27% year-on-year. The operating cost for 2010 was $773 million, 27% above that of 2009. This increase is mainly attributable to increases in freight volume, a 10% increase in diesel peso price, an increase in labor, maintenance and locomotive leasing, all of which were partially mitigated by a better performance of our locomotives.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2010 was nearly $80 million, a slight decrease of 1% year-on-year due to higher costs with an EBITDA margin of 26%. However, EBITDA in 2010 reached a high of $371 million, a 36% increase year-on-year equivalent to 32% of net sales. In 2011, we expect to generate an EBITDA of $430 million.</p>
          <p>Net income during the fourth quarter 2010 was nearly $48 million, an increase of 44% year-on-year. The cumulative net income for 2010 totaled $185 million. Capital expenditures in the fourth for quarter of 2010 amounted to $77 million equivalent to 58% of the $132 million invested over the year. This amount reflects investments made in expansions and the construction of new sitings.</p>
          <p>Our 2011 guidance for capital investments is $333 million, which includes the purchase of 44 new locomotives and the completion of the site in Ferromex, which will increase track capacity and line speed. This investment amounts will be the highest in the history of Ferromex.</p>
          <p>I will now discuss the results of our subsidiary Ferrosur which currently does consolidate in ITM. As reported previously in the press release, the railroad rules service was affected in October by heat and cold and tropical storm Matthew. Traffic from Mexico City to Ocozocoautla was cancelled for over 25 years &#x2013; days, I'm sorry, including the traffic representing the greatest volume for Ferrosur. It is being the few traffic from Ocozocoautla to San Mart&#xED;nTexmelucan, Puebla The comparison for October 2010 against the same months of the previous year show significant reductions in revenue, 25%, cars 14% and net tons/kilometers 38%.</p>
          <p>Despite these, Ferrosur ended the year with increases of 19% in revenue, 5.8% in the cars and maintaining the same level of net tons/kilometers as 2009. Ferrosur's total revenues in fourth quarter 2010 were 61 million, an increase of 5% year-on-year. Net sales in 2010 totaled 265 million, an increase of 19% year-on-year. Low volumes transported during the fourth quarter of 2010 was 1.5 billion net tons/kilometers compared to 1.7 billion moved during the fourth quarter of 2009, a decrease of nearly 11%. In 2010, total moving cargo was 6.8 billion net tons/kilometers, the same volume than 2009.</p>
          <p>In 2011, total revenues are expected at 337 million, an aggressive 27% increase based on new traffics and hoping not to suffer from the hurricanes. EBITDA in the fourth quarter 2010 was nearly 11 million, a decrease of 39% year-on-year due to the effects of the hurricane Karl. However, EBITDA in 2010 amounted 66 million, a 5% increase year-on-year equivalent to 25% of net sales. In 2011, we expect to generate 90 million of EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Net income during the fourth quarter of 2010 was $3 million, an increase of 92% year-on-year. The cumulative net income for 2010 totaled 23 million, a significant increase of 25 compared to 2009. Capital expenditures in fourth quarter 2010 were 35 million and represented 75% of the $47 million invested in 2010. The majority of the investment was the purchase of locomotives, $21 million. Ferrosur plans to invest the highest market in history in 2011, a total of $66 million which includes the purchase of another 14 locomotives.</p>
          <p>In December 2010, Ferrosur received nine new locomotives which will improve efficiency and reliability even their technical characteristics. Pollution emissions will also be reduced and fuel performance will improve. With these additions Ferrosur fleets of locomotives increases to 161 allowing the company to handle the increased volumes from new traffics.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to provide you with an update on the legal process related to the concentration or consolidation of Ferrosur. As we previously announced on May 12, 2010, the Federal Court of Justice on tax and administrative matters resolve does approved the acquisition of Ferrosur by Infraestructura y Transportes, Mexico ITM, a subsidiary of Grupo M&#xE9;xico. A notification of this decision to the parties was delayed for several months and once received. The Federal Competition Bureau Comisi&#xF3;n Federal de Competencia, Cofeco contested the decision before the Collegiate Supreme Courts or a field court in Mexico City on finding a motion for tax review which is currently Taft-Hartley pending resolution.</p>
          <p>Regarding the investigation on monopolistic practices wherein January 2009 the Federal Competition found Grupo M&#xE9;xico and other parties guilty and impose secondary penalties. Ferromex and the other parties filed an indirect appeal with the Federal District Court for Administrative Matters. On December 17, 2010 the six district judge on Administrative Matters in Mexico City dismissed the appeal.</p>
          <p>On the December 28, 2010 the company and the other parties filed a motion to challenge the ruling. A resolution remains pending on this action and therefore a timeline for the concentration or consolidation of Ferrosur cannot yet be determined.</p>
          <p>I would now like to return the call to Mr. Daniel Mu&#xF1;iz.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Octavio. I'll conclude -- I'd like to mention that in regard to the combination of Southern Copper and Asarco under American Mining Corporation, the independent directors at Southern Copper have formed a special committee to evaluate the American Mining proposal.</p>
          <p>The special committee has retained the services of legal, finance, and mining advisors to assist with this transaction and help the special committee and the minority shareholders with the evaluation of the proposal. They have been conducting extensive due diligence. And they have been visiting sites not only of Asarco but also of Southern Copper and performing mining evaluations.</p>
          <p>At this particular moment, we have nothing particular to report on this to the market although we will keep you informed as we progress in this process.</p>
          <p>And we continue to believe that the combination of Southern Copper and Asarco will provide important synergies, including cost reductions in operations, transportation, and overhead, in CapEx savings which would benefit all shareholders of the combined entity. It would also solidify our position as one of the leading copper companies in the world and enhance the scale of our operations.</p>
          <p>Now with this, we conclude the comments to the earnings result. And, operator, if you could please open the session for questions-and-answers. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. I have two questions. The first one is related to Asarco. Daniel, if you could give us some guidance of what you expect to see in terms of production in 2010 and also in terms of cost? And my second question is related to hedging. We saw that you started doing some hedges for 2012 already. Do you think that your hedging strategy could extend to the next year as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Felipe. Thank you. Thank you for your question. Let me just start with the hedging real quick. Well, I mean, yes, as we've mentioned, our hedging policy has been very opportunistic. We've been trying to get the peaks and record highs of the market every time we've seen them.</p>
          <p>We've <mark type="inaudible" /> and take a mix of swaps and collars in order to be able to have some more room with this mix of instruments. And for 2012, we've already hedged, if you like, only 3% of the production, we have only used collars in this instance. I mean we have seen some market. And we've left the call part of the collar all the way to almost 540 for the first quarter only of 2012. Now that's regarding hedging.</p>
          <p>Let me just come back to the guidance in Asarco and tell you that we're expecting 200,000 tons of copper for 2011. The cash cost will be $1.65. That's what we're budgeting and that's currently our guidance, which if you put that together with Southern Copper's $0.45 per pound, will give you an approximately $0.70 of cash cost for American Mining Company, that is, for the whole group's Mining division. In terms of CapEx, we are looking at investing at Asarco's team with their  exploration program and investing a little bit less than $155 million approximately.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning, everyone. My question is related to the infrastructure segment, especially in airports. I mean how do you see this going forward? I mean you have recently purchased a small stake in Grupo Aeroportuario in Mexico. Should we expect this segment to increase? I mean is that something that you are targeting? We hear of  new projects in Mexico, potentially, the prevaluation of the segment in Brazil. Is that something that Grupo Mexico is looking at? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Renato. Well, first of all, it's a sector that we like as we have commented on for several quarters' conference calls with you all. And it's a sector that we think is very strong, that it has good margins, it has important dividends. And with this investment, we have been getting to know a lot better the sector and started participating in that.</p>
          <p>At the moment, we only have the investment in GAP. We are working and analyzing the public bid rules and the process to participate in the Riviera Maya airport. There we are, as I said, analyzing, discussing, meeting, running some numbers, in trying to assess whether it makes sense to present a bid. With regard to Brazil, I know there is going to be, the market is going to be opening up. And we are not looking at it now. I think that's the only thing that we're doing now, it's analyzing Riviera Maya and have invested in GAP.  Is that, Renato, did I make it clear?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Dave Radclyffe from BMO. Just have a couple of quick questions. Firstly, in terms of the combination with Asarco and Southern Copper, you're obviously saying that at the moment it's hard to give an idea of timing. But obviously, the combination was announced last July. Just wondering would you expect to be at a, complete the deal potentially in the next six months? And have any hurdles come up during investigation and that's why it's taking a bit longer?</p>
          <p>And then the second question would just be in terms of the potential growth for Asarco, which I think you said was potentially in the order of 90,000 tons of brand new copper production. Given the comments before suggest that you are already increasing the stripping ratio to help support that, what is the timing of delivering that 90,000 tons? Would it potentially be in 2012 or a bit after that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, David. Well, let me just start with the timing of the merger. I mean, first of all, I mean, yes, I agree with you. It's taking more time than we all anticipated. And this has to do mainly with the legal environment that's required under United States. In order to protect minority shareholders, general law forces the independent committee to take very careful steps in the way they analyze a proposal before coming back with a counter-proposal or with an agreement as a proposal.</p>
          <p>So basically, what has happened during this time and although we have not been able to keep the market up-to-date, I mean, yes, as I said, there has been a lot of due diligence. And by that because of the nature of the transaction and because we're proposing an exchange of shares rather than a cash payment, due diligence has been made on both companies, not only on Asarco, but also Southern Copper.</p>
          <p>So basically, the legal, financial and mining experts of the special independent committee have been going through each particular site and going through extensive due diligence. So that's really what has taken so much time. Also as you know, the advisors to the special independent committee need to be totally independent from Grupo. So for that they <mark type="inaudible" /> interviews before retaining each one of those advisors. So that's really how the timing has been delayed.</p>
          <p>In terms of expectations, I do think that it should be achieved during the first half of 2011. That is really just an expectation. We think that that could probably happen given the progress that we're seeing in this due diligence process.</p>
          <p>Going back to Asarco. I mean Asarco, as you know, was in Chapter 11 for many years, five years to be exact. And before that, we were under a very different copper pricing cycle when we first acquired Asarco in 1999, all the way to before the Chapter 11 filing. So there hadn't been a lot of exploration at Asarco. Also while in Chapter 11, I mean the priorities were others, right, than trying to expand and grow the mines.</p>
          <p>So we've been in this year working hard not only to lower costs to try to do as we do with the rest of the group, but also to try to see what's the potential of the ore bodies there. So we think there is a possibility to increase to 90,000 tons. And as you know, many ore bodies often extend to below <mark type="inaudible" /> in the future; that is not exception in Asarco. It is in a pure set of mines but with the expansion, we think it can grow to 90,000 tons and at one point achieve 280,000 tons.</p>
          <p>So basically, we're looking at in our program, and this is just an estimation, in that to increase reserves and reach 290,000 tons by 2015.</p>

Just can you elaborate a little bit on Ferromex in terms of the fourth quarter performance and some of the margin pressure that we saw there versus earlier on in the year?

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The main issue with the Ferrosur were the hurricanes that hit during October, Hurricane Karl and Tropical Storm Matthew. The problem was that we were out of service from our more efficient line from Oaxaca to Mexico City, which is around 800 kilometers. We were out for around 25 days while working on getting back the infrastructure. The load volumes in Ferrosur were 1.7 tons-kilometers, which was a reduction of 11% versus a year ago. And sales were 4.9% ahead of a year ago, despite October being a very low volume. We were able to get back in five days and what was very much affected was our most important traffic these days, which is with Ferromex. We transport diesel from Coatzacoalcos goes to San Martin Texmelucan, and it's a volume of around 900 railcars a month. That month we were just able to transport about 220 cars only. We're back in service since November and volumes have increased.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's go back as a little bit on the loophole of <mark type="inaudible" /> Pacifico. If you could just give us a bit of insight on the main purpose of the investment and if there will be any possible increase of participation in GAP, and that would be my first question. And the second one, today the stock is falling 2.3% due to China's interest rate increase. So, do we happen to have any guidance on GrupoMexico's regional sales mostly on  the big picture and what are you seeing on <mark type="inaudible" /> and behavior in the United States?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure. Thank you Armando. As far as the Grupo Ferroviario Pacifico question and the rationale, as I've pointed out and I have pointed out in the past. I mean we do like that the sector, we do like the infrastructure. As you know, we have a small division regarding infrastructure, projects in development, and we are working towards trying to grow that, of course, a strategy keeps on being to really accelerate in our expansion organically with regard to our mining division. And you know we have a very aggressive program, and we also have an aggressive program to grow and invest in their transportation division, although we like infrastructure. We think there is a lot of possibility there, a lot of opportunities to be taken by us, and we think we are very well-positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. And we've invested in GAP because we think it's a good diverted company, as I said, with excellent margins, with good dividend, track record and policies. And that has been very profitable for us as an investment. We have used a very conservative amount of cash out of the whole cash position and the cash renovation that we have. And that is a way that we believe is the best way to understand the sector and get really into the depth of the sector is to keep on investing when the prices are right. Although as you know, our position is a little bit north of 16% in GAP and <mark type="inaudible" />relevant to disclose.</p>
          <p>Regarding your other question as copper prices, yeah, I mean today it dropped, I mean the whole commodity sector dropped. I believe it has to do with the increase or interest rate hike in China. As you know, the Chinese are out of the market until tomorrow. They have been out for the last week because of the Chinese New Year, and I think it was that that we'll continue to see some volatility in terms of the demand, I am not sure you were asking specifically United States, but I mean the United States have gone down to around 10% of consumption.</p>
          <p>And I don't know, but I'll ask  Jacob of IR with Southern Copper do you want to add something to this, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically, what we are seeing is that in terms the smelters and refineries are well supplied with the copper concentrates that is not a tight market in any way. We just had a very strong expectation to have very strong imports from China. That has to be validated by reality. We have seen that in some other times Chinese imports are not as expected, so we believe that the market is overreacting to a very strong fundamentally driven market but not necessary short-term as expected.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, good morning I have two questions. The first one is you reported for the first time the financials of America Mining Corporation which includes other expenses for $33 million the fourth quarter. If you can explain a little bit of what is that? And second, if you can clarify further with copper prices significantly above the levels where you hedged some part of your production, can we expect that could have Grupo Mexico that we will be closing further swaps or hedges of their production in the short term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Victoria. Hello, good morning, and thanks for the questions. Regarding AMC, yes, we have posted the numbers of AMC consolidated. The main rationale behind that was, is the first year that we finally had Asarco within the group and consolidating within the group. So as we are anticipating, we think the market would like to see how the whole group will look like particularly, not particularly but also under the transaction that we have proposed to combine them. I think it's an interesting way to present not only Southern Copper and Asarco, but also to see them as our whole mining division combined. So that was the rationale of that.</p>
          <p>Regarding the posting of these other expenses, they merely have to do with &#x2013; as you probably recall, we entered into a syndicated loan agreement to reacquire or to take creditors and take apart the chapter 11 that was half in pesos and half in dollars. Well not half in half, but it was still, there is a 10.2 billion pesos outstanding on that loan that was a part that was not pre-payable. We had a non-call three, if you like, provision in the syndicate of loan, and that has not been repaid. We prepaid the asbestos, as you remembered, $280 million out of Asarco. And we have prepaid all the retail portion of that $1.5 billion facility. So that has to do with the exchange rate fluctuations between Mexican peso and dollar. Returning to hedging question, Victoria, I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, yes, go ahead. I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's all right. Going back to the hedging question, I'd just say, I mean I guess that your concern was, we've been hedging and prices keep going up and I guess the way we look at this is, well, we had first, we have the largest reserves in the world to cover. So we are fairly exposed, and we have the largest projects in the world to having to grow this lot of reserves. We have a very aggressive copper store. So we're making a hedge for the long-term, if you like. We have decided to do a mix of swaps in collar basically to allow the upside as the market keeps on growing.</p>
          <p>We've taken some portion of swaps and try to get the peaks of the market, that there is no part of swaps every peak, every record high, just because we want to ensure that we are able to complete this project, our board believes that this is prudent practice, a way to and while maintaining a lot of upside if this keeps on going up. I mean of course we are not in middle of separate two classes, and that's why we try to be a little conservative and hedge here given the historic records that we're seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, basically if you thought that $4 was okay, right now they were close to $4.50, can we see in the second quarter or first quarter a significantly higher percentage than what you have already announced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, no all of the...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>28% copper and 54% for Asarco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, this is a decision that we take based on the market, a little of course, I mean today we are seeing the market turn against us, in terms of prices. We've seen China rating I mean high grades. The answer that we anticipate a substantial or that we will hedge 100% of the lot, then the answer is no.</p>
          <p>I think our policy is to try and get a mix, balance of what the Board analyzes every quarter, giving us some guidance, I mean really the decisions that they like or positions they'd like to accomplish, of course, as you probably know, we cannot give you the exact decision on the Board on this particular topic. But now the idea is not to hedge all, not to keep on growing a lot of swaps, the idea is to have a mix and have a lot, leave some upside, have some percentage swapped or hedged if you like.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everybody. First question is regarding Asarco, if you could elaborate a little bit about the main drivers behind the improvement in the profitability of the business and the company during the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. First of all in business well prices have a lot to do with it for the fourth quarter.  As you know prices changed dramatically within the third and the fourth quarter.  Just to give you some color to the question, in the third quarter, the price of copper was $328 and in the fourth quarter it was $392.  So that's a big difference in prices just on quarter-over-quarter.  Second, we've continued to implement the way Grupo Mexico cut costs and basically this practice of the way Grupo Mexico implements cost cutting across the board.  So, this is really the answer to your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, then. Okay.  That was very clear.  Looking forward, what could we expect regarding further cost improvement or cost cutting initiatives on Asarco? And do you think this level of profitability is sustainable given the current positive price outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, absolutely. We think the &#x2013; the company did have a great year.  I mean, we think it was beyond expectations of all when we acquired Asarco at the end of 2009.  Commodity price, it helped, but the company has been doing a great job.  And, in terms of going forward, as it's already pointed out, we expect 200,000 tons of copper for 2010 at $1.65 cash cost per ton of copper.  We're going to be investing $165 million in CapEx and we think that there is a lot of potential for this company still in the terms of increasing reserves and increasing production.  As I said, we expect to increase 90,000 tons of copper per year by 2015.  So, we are very happy that Asarco is performing and we only see good things here.  Probably, the cost if you're comparing from copper to Asarco is different, Asarco only have mines and operations in the United States.  And as you know some copper, only mines and the other operations apart from the operation in Chile, in Mexico, and Peru, different country environments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right and the last question on the demand side, are you starting to see already first signs of improvement or recovering the demand coming from the developed countries, mainly in the U.S. as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have, we have. We think Europe, Japan, the United States have increased demands. I mean of course this has to be more or at least the prices that we are looking at we believe have to do more with the lack of supply.  I mean we are seeing how tough it is to put additional tons of copper in the market, but yes, we've been seeing increase of demand.

          <p>Yes, thank you very much, Daniel and I think that we are expecting a growth in demand of between 4% and 5% for 2011, a portion of that comes from the emerging economies and also from the recovery of U.S. and Europe.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Rene Kleyweg with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, gentlemen.  Sorry, just going back to my earlier question. It was actually Ferromex that I wanted to touch on.  If we look at the momentum for the first three quarters of the year, there is clearly sort of strong year-on-year performance 35%, 40% margin EBITDA gains.  And then when we look at the fourth quarter, we're basically flat on where we were for the fourth quarter of 2009, so just &#x2013; I was just wondering why the year on year momentum had been lost in terms of the profitability of Ferromex?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. The main reason is that the economic recovery has started on the fourth quarter of 2009.  We &#x2013; Ferromex has been having record months every month since November 2009. The fourth quarter was an increase &#x2013; I think it is important it's not as significant as the previous quarters because of the reason that I was telling you. We had an 8% increase in load volumes, 19% in sales, okay. The market continues to be very aggressive. We have also continued to be aggressive on new traffics.</p>
          <p>We are starting as &#x2013; we just started last week a very important traffic with Pemex that goes from the refinery in Tula to the Port of Manzanillo that will deliver around 950 cars per month. We had to work on an investment of 70 million pesos in order to have a terminal to unload the fuel oil there. We also have more projects that should be crystallizing in the next probably six months with Pemex that are important volume. So the month of January already was again a record month versus a record month in 2010 where we are over 15% in volume. So we continue to see a very healthy market environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, just on that I mean like you say, the volume growth of 8% is impressive and the sales growth of 20% is or nearly 20% is impressive as well, but EBITDA is flat and I'm just wondering why there is the, is there a lag on any issues with fuel price increases on pricing or why has the margin come under pressure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The main reason was....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>... you should have operational leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The main reason was the cost of sales. We increased our cost of sales during that quarter 28%. The reason was due to having to rent or lease locomotives in order to cope with the increased volume and part of that was due to the problems that we had in July with Hurricane Alex that forced us to take volume from the other railroad for over 40 days more or less. That put us in a very difficult operating environment where because of congestion moving all that volume. So, we had to rent new locomotives that were used and they do not work as efficiently as the ones that we currently have.  We  will continue renting this locomotives for the first semester at least because the arrival of the 44 locomotives that we ordered two months ago, three months ago will begin in May and June and end in September.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. So the recovery in margins will come back in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but it will take at least six months. The first six months will be a little tough also.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi Daniel. Could you have a guidance of in terms of sales and EBITDA and which price of copper that you are considering? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Bernardo. We've been conservative, we are using $385 as the price of copper. We have always been conservative with the budget. We are using $16 per Molybdenum and in terms of guidance we are anticipating with this, sales a little above $10 billion with an EBITDA of around $5 billion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>EBITDA 5, a little north of $5 billion.</p>
