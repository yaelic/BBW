        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. We're going to begin our earnings announcement of the Third Quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>But before we go into the presentation per se, I'd like to start by saying that this quarter has been a quarter with excellent results, every way you look at it. Excellent from the point of view of the amount, and even more excellent, I would say, if we take into account what is happening in our environment, in the international banks of our environment, international banks that we consider to be our peers. So we're extremely satisfied and extremely proud of the results that we are achieving. Which only confirm what we have been saying quarter after quarter. Which is that, despite the turmoil and despite the problems we face by markets, and despite the crisis of the financial system, the business model, the working model, the banking model that Santander has in all the markets and geographies where it operates, with a history that take into account the circumstances of economic slowdown, nevertheless, our model continues to be very consistent, very resilient, does not give rise to surprises, and it is one of the models which is achieving a solid results throughout the cycle, in good times and bad times, as we will see in a minute, for reasons that can be explained So, this I wanted to say as an introduction, because I think that the results of Santander clearly makes the difference between a bank of this nature, an animal of this nature, and other banks and animals which call themselves banks too, but which nevertheless have nothing to do in their morphology with the structure and business model of the Santander Bank.</p>
          <p>So, as usual I am going to divide my presentation into three parts. I will look at the main developments of the Group to start with, the accounts for the first nine months, particularly the third quarter. And then Mr. Jos&#xE9; Antonio Alvarez, who is the CFO for the Group, will comment in greater detail on the performance of the business areas in the three quarters, particularly the third one. And then I will end the presentation with some conclusions on the year and also with some ideas of how we see the next quarter and how we see the market and the environment as a whole.</p>
          <p>So, starting with the first idea, what I want to convey with this idea and underscore, is that this quarter has been extremely good for the Group, particularly taking into account this very complex environment in which we have had to carry out our activities. We have obtained profits of &#x20AC;2.205 billion attributable profit. And, as you can see in the left hand side graph that you have on screen, at the beginning of 2007 we went into the league of 2 billion in quarterly results, and we have raised that this last quarter. And all operating areas are performing very well in this environment. The profits have improved over those of the second quarter, but in the third quarter, we haven't had that good results basically because of three things. First of all, the seasonal impact, which always occurs in our accounts, of a fall in dividends collected, and this always increases the results in the second quarter, but this is seasonal as I say. And the second effect is that of losses in the dollar-euro exchange rate position compared to profits in previous quarters. The third quarter, well you notice it in the third quarter, and because of the Sovereign accounted for by the equity method.</p>
          <p>So, we have used the equity method in Sovereign and that has had a negative impact apart from less trading gains. Later on, as we look at this in detail, you'll see how trading gains have not contributed as much as this last quarter than previous quarters.</p>
          <p>But in the operating areas, these have performed quite well, better than in the second quarter and you will see this when Jos&#xE9; Antonio Alvarez, our CFO, explains in further detail the effect of the business areas and different business lines.</p>
          <p>And, in the first nine months, our results have been almost &#x20AC;7 billion, which means an increase of almost 16% more than the same period in 2007. Here, we're comparing nine months ordinary profit in 2007 and 2008, excluding the extraordinary items. Because you know that in 2008, in this period very recently, we've had extraordinary profits from the Financial City of &#x20AC;586 million, which has been generated but has not been included in these accounts.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the growth I repeat, if we compare ordinary profit 2007 and 2008 to the first nine months, the increase is up 16%, reaching almost &#x20AC;7 billion. Earnings per share have also in the first nine months of the year reached &#x20AC;1.04 per share. In other words, a growth of 8% over the year 2007. This is the reason why, in summary, I have given you that introduction, because these results are quite extraordinary in the context in which we we're in, particularly if we compare them to our peers, which is a closed list of international banks that we use for comparison purposes, because these are banks that have a similar business to ours.</p>
          <p>So, I was saying earlier that these results are based on the good performance of operating areas. And the operating areas here in this graph are divided into three blocks, Europe, the UK and Latin America. Here, we don't include Banco Real because it has not yet been consolidated. This will happen next quarter, the fourth quarter of the year. It's not included in Latin America. And here we see what Continental Europe, the UK and Latin America, without Banco Real, and you see how these three geographical areas have grown in terms of attributable profits, consistently.</p>
          <p>This might give rise to a question. You will wonder why Continental Europe grows less than the UK 20%, or Latin America 20%. Well, the reason is that in Continental Europe there is a unit, out of the four which are included in this graph, which are Santander Banesto Portugal and Santander Consumer Finance. Well, this last one Santander Consumer Finance, the profits are growing less and I think you can imagine why. In a situation of economic slowdown, logically this would be the business which would be most affected, because it's focused on consumer loans, loans for buying cars, etc. And this has been most affected. But this will change in the short-term, if there is a fall of interest rates, because falls in the interest rate are very good for this business. But this, in the situation of economic slowdown of course, where this can be most noticeable is in this part of the business, in Consumer Finance, but in the other parts of the business, as we will see later, well these have grown by two digits.</p>
          <p>I think I should also mention the UK, because I would like just to go over it very quickly. I'd like to say a few words on that, because the growth of 20% in pounds sterling I think is excellent. And I proved, once again, what I said at the beginning, that our business model in the UK, based in retail business and based in strict control of our costs, has given us very positive results. And, as it says there at the bottom of the slide, the profit of Banco Real, &#x20AC;725 million in the first nine months, which as I said have not been included in the operating area, they are in the corporate sector.</p>
          <p>Another idea, which I think is important for me to mention in this context, is how we are doing compared to our competitors. And in the first quarter we saw, or in the first half of the year we saw that we had a considerable difference. And probably, although we still don't have the results of all our peer banks, but we think that with these results that we have obtained, we are going to increase the difference with our peers. We are widening the gap here, because from what we know from our peers so far, we are the bank that has obtained most profit in this quarter, in absolute terms as well as in earnings per share. So from that viewpoint, we still have a five percentage point difference, which is our objective with our peers.</p>
          <p>Another idea, which I think is significant in this presentation, is to talk about the capital, because this generation of profits is linked to sound capital ratios. We have closed the year with a tier 1 core capital of 6.31. In this capital ratio we include the impact of the lower value of equity stakes. I say this before you ask the question: and how do we see that this core capital remains at more than 6%? But I'd like to compare that with the assets that this capital supports, because our business model is what it is. It is a business model whose assets don't have any toxic element. Therefore, they are healthy assets, they are retail assets, well diversified assets from the geographical and product point of view, and I think that's very important.</p>
          <p>There is another additional idea, also related to the capital, that we shouldn't forget, which is that in our system, we have 6.3 billion in reserve for generic funds, which in our system are not computed as capital. And it's a good thing that the Bank of Spain should have that rule. But we shouldn't loose sight of that either, they're there. And they're there precisely as an additional element of solvency, vis-&#xE0;-vis losses of assets of the Santander Group. So, those general reserves are there for a purpose, and that allows us to say that the next interim dividend, which we've already announced and that will be paid in November, is going to go up by 10%.</p>
          <p>This is also very important particularly if we look at the international context and how dividends of similar banks are performing and this capital ratio makes us feel very comfortable. It's solid, it's good. And we think that in the next few months or quarters the Group is going to grow very little in risk assets, because there is no demand for loans. So, we're not going to continue to grow at that rate. And that means that our organic generation of capital, quarter-to-quarter, is positive about 0.15, or from 0.15 to 0.20 basis points per quarter. And that is going to be something that we're going to experience very clearly in the next few months, because we don't think that we're going to have a lot of growth of assets at risk of more than eight digits.</p>
          <p>And we shouldn't forget either that we have announced, particularly with regards to the acquisitions of Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley and Sovereign, that we have a program in these banks. Well I shouldn't say in these banks, I should say in all the UK banks, not only ours but Abbey as well. Well for these banks, we're going to see a reduction of assets at risk, which is only natural. So, we're going to have 20 to &#xA3;30 billion in reduction. We were going to do that in three years, and we're going to do it now by the end of 2009, if conditions are favorable.</p>
          <p>The same thing can be said about Sovereign, because this banks allows us to reduce risk assets by 10 billion, apart from other divestments that we are studying, that we are considering. So, all in all, I wanted to insist on is that at this time, where capital is scarce and capital is something that is very visible right now, we have very good capital ratios, we have enough capital, plus we have our deleveraging program that has already been decided.</p>
          <p>Of course all of this has to be seen in the current environment, because we would be losing our perspective of the results. We have to understand these results in the environment in which we are right now: in an environment of economic slowdown, strong economic slowdown in all the markets we are operating in and in the world in general; problems in the financial markets, which is already having an impact on our trading gains, in our P&amp;L; also we have to remember that we are in an environment of higher cost of liquidity and scarcity of liquidity; and where we're seeing important banking crises, including nationalizations or pseudo-nationalizations of banks.</p>
          <p>So in this environment that we have always to take into account when we look at our results and activities, the Group, the Santander Group within its business model, which hasn't been changed and we're not going to change it, nevertheless we are adjusting it. It's like when a camera focuses on an objective and if you go backwards or forwards, you have to refocus the image once again.</p>
          <p>Well this refocusing of the image is the refocusing of our business model, which is basically giving priority to those things that we should give a priority to in this new environment. Focusing more on our relations with customers, focusing more on deposits, because right now deposits have a greater value than what this had historically, so more emphasis and more importance given to deposits.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, taking care of our spreads, because they reflect the cost or the price of risk and that's being reflected in higher spreads, which are offsetting the loss in volume.</p>
          <p>Number four, a new focus on efficiency. I mean Santander Group has always focused on efficiency, on cost to income and we always like to show off our cost to income ratio. Well, if that has been true in these past few years, now we have to make it even truer because in times of market difficulties and difficulties in generating revenue, we have to be very strict in how we manage our cost. So the fourth priority or adjustment of the model is focusing more on cost.</p>
          <p>And lastly to focus more on solvency and risk management. Well this is like going back to basics of banking. And this is what the Bank has always done, but we're doing that even more so now because of the environment.</p>
          <p>And this can be summarized in these four ideas, which are the four strengths that we believe the Santander Group has right now. First of all, very strong in its revenue lines, it's consistent, our revenues are consistent and growing despite the lower volumes of activity. It's well-balanced growth, more growth in deposits as compared to loans, with a diversification, which offset emerging and mature portfolios. And if we add to that the increase in spreads in most of the asset business and some fees, that means that the revenue remains at high levels despite the reduction in the volume. And then greater emphasis on cost, later on we'll look at this in further detail with some figures. Then maximum caution in balance sheet management, strong balance sheet, good risk quality, strong capital and lastly an increase in our retail capacity, because despite all of this, we are growing in installed capacity in those markets which we consider to be strategic for us. And following these lines, we see how in volume we're not growing that much, and then we were growing at 18% in the nine months of 2007, 13% in nine months of 2008, 8%, and we will end the year probably, when we look at the December graph, we will be below that figure 5 or 6%, higher in emerging markets, but in mature markets below 5%. That's in loans.</p>
          <p>But in deposits. We see greater growth in deposits, which is going to accelerate even more in the last few months of the year. We saw this change as of June and it will continue. Apart from all that we've had the incorporation of Bradford &amp; Bingley, with which we have gained more branch offices and deposits. So in Spain, for example, there is something there and Banesto, the two networks, in these months have generated &#x20AC;8 billion more deposits than in loans, and that's very important in this moment where there are liquidity problems in the market. And so, we are growing more in deposits than in loans, by those amounts.</p>
          <p>So, the first idea is an increase in deposits, reduction in volume in the credit side. Then increase in spreads and therefore improvement of the return on assets. You have this information there.</p>
          <p>The spread of deposits is improving as well as that on loans. And that is increasing our profitability and we will see it go up even further in the fourth quarter, because this impacts particularly in the retail networks, the effect of the improvement of the spread then, it's very slow when it's implemented, but we see this month-to-month and we will see this even more clearly in the last quarter of the year. And this means that the volumes per spread, the product volumes per spread, is giving us growing revenue. And it seems to be counterintuitive in an environment of less growth. Why is our revenue going up? Because the two variables, spreads and volume, gives us a positive result.</p>
          <p>Fees and commissions. They don't look very good. They're growing for the group at 3%. But we have to look deeper and see what is in the fees, to see what's inside. So, we see how, on the one hand, the fees that come from mutual fund activities, in this change of policy, of course go down. We are focusing more on deposits and on mutual funds, and the same thing, in this environment, the securities markets, that activity has gone down. But nevertheless, the normal activities, the typical banking activity of a retail bank, in other words insurance and banking services, in general those fees are performing very well.</p>
          <p>So, this is what gives us a solid business. And despite the economic slowdown we have a lot of consistency in terms of generating income.</p>
          <p>And this gives us the series, if you look at the series from 2005, even 2006, 2007 and '08, we see how quarter-after-quarter, quarter-after-quarter, the revenues and by that I mean fees and net interest revenue, some are doing better than others of course, because of market reasons, but nevertheless these are revenues that are consistently 6.5%, the previous quarter 6.7; series of this year &#x2013; 6.3, 6.5, 6.7; or the previous one. Wherever you look at it you see a sound consistency in the revenue line. And if you look at it by areas we can say the same thing. Europe and the United Kingdom and Latin America, we also see this consistency. This I think is extremely significant in our P&amp;L. This and the costs. But this is basic.</p>
          <p>Cost management. Well we've seen changes here as well, a change in the emphasis, because it is true that last year our revenue was growing at 20%, and costs we made them grow at 10%. We had more investment projects, infrastructure projects, we invested much more in many things, because our job allowed us to operate that way, because we had a 10 point difference.</p>
          <p>And we could do that because costs were growing at 10%, but the revenue at 20%. Now things have changed a little bit. Revenues are growing by 13% and therefore we have to adjust the costs to the new growth of revenue. So, right now the costs are based at 3.5% on the left hand side graph. On a quarterly basis they're growing at 1.5%, which means that the costs are slowing down we could say. We were growing at 3.5% last quarter and now 1.5%, which means that we will end the year with an increase in cost of about 2, 2 some percent. But we are at cruising speed, which is important so I can tell you that we're going to have a cruising speed of 1.5% or even less than that, because next year we want to maintain our costs flat. So, this gives us <mark type="inaudible" /> (29.05) of about 10 points, and to improve our cost to income ratio as compared to our competitors.</p>
          <p>Provisions now. These are the cellar points of these exercises. We see that there's been an increase by 67%. Why? Well basically all of the markets where we have a presence, all of them are in a worse macro environment. This is also true, the fact that in some environments, we've seen for instance in Latin America, we see growth in lending to the tune of about 20%. So provisions here cannot be attributed to that worsening environment.</p>
          <p>We can also attribute it in some parts of the world, specifically in Latin America, to growth in lending, apart from inter annual effect which are always visible. Last year things happened that I'm not going to go into now, but which do have very much to do with this. However we continue to see that our total amount is more, not only specific, but there is even a slight increase in generics, too. So, we see that we are there to the tune of &#x20AC;6.3 billion at the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's see the origins, the sources. It's what we've discussed. It's the same as in the previous quarters. In Europe, basically Santander consumer, and in America, basically Brazil and Mexico. Why? For the same reasons, basically, the generics. It's true that last year in nine months we improved by 300, this year, we've only improved it by 53. But there's no doubt that as you can see we as yet do not need to reach out to generics. Very good. And thus our NPL ratios and coverage ratios per group and per area are percentages that we could define as low, low. 163 at a group level and 150 for Spain. Coverage over 100%, basically in Spain and in Latin America.</p>
          <p>The UK is a little bit special because as you know in the UK coverage in this type of business activity is to the tune of 10% and we basically are talking about mortgages. So we are doing very well. And this talks to us about a very good quality of risk for the group, in total and per area. As I say, it's better, it compares very well with our competitors.</p>
          <p>A little bit more information. We are comparing with our peers and we're looking in geographical terms, Spain, the UK and Latin America. Whatever angle we look at it from, our NPL ratios are better than those in the markets, very clearly better. Definitely in Spain, we're clearly performing better in terms of NPLs.</p>
          <p>We really are outdistancing to the rest of the sector, banks and savings banks. And I believe that when banks and savings bank continue, or complete rather their accounting, we'll see how the difference is even greater with the sector.</p>
          <p>We said also that we have a commercial model. Our retail model has been strengthened, reinforced and improved upon in a systematic way. So, we're not going to stop investing commercially just because our performance is good. We are going to bring on board further networks and branches. And actually we're the largest owner in international terms, if we don't include China. And here we have included our new components. Wells Fargo, BNP, and even so we continue to have the best possible retail network. And well, our diversification is very broad; actually it's better.</p>
          <p>And this is the end of my brief presentation. I'm going to give the floor to my colleague, Mr. Alvarez, who will talk to us about these issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As our CEO has just said, I'm going to look in more detail at the business units, so as to have time for questions, which I'm sure is the reason why we're all here today.</p>
          <p>So let's take a quick look at our business units. As always, as you've seen, we begin to look at profits this will change from one term to another. We see that Banco Santander, Banesto, SFC (35.20) in Portugal, generally 10% (35.20), Wholesale Banking and other minor <mark type="inaudible" /> (35.23) generally 6. The UK represents 13%. And Latin America, ex-Real, roughly 30; with Real approximately 40%. There are no major changes here.</p>
          <p>What we do see is that growth is systematic and constant in the four large regional units. We see that they're going by 9% of profits, and the rest of Europe 6%. As to Wholesale Banking, that's rest of Europe. Basically Wholesale Banking we've seen quarter-by-quarter what the comparisons are. To compare with 2007, which was exceptional, perhaps that is what would explain why that comparison continues to give us negatives. When we see global marketing and markets, we'll see that the trends are good.</p>
          <p>If we look now at the basic Continental Europe main units. If we want to look at the performance what we would say is that it's been systematic and constant. We continue to see double-digit growth, the average is 13%. Cost are under control, which explains that net operating income of 18%.</p>
          <p>Provisions, as our CEO said, yes there has been an increase. So the numbers are double-digit in terms of generation of attributable profit.</p>
          <p>If we go down in that column, what do we see? We see good performance parallel with growing over 10%. Income is over 10%. And costs are under control.</p>
          <p>Consumer Finance is probably more complex. If we look at all of continental Europe, we see that the growth is good in terms of generation of income. Half are the result of different projects undertaken recently &#x2013; are growing at different paces (37.25). However, the net operating income is in excess of 20%, and yes there is a strong impact of provisions.</p>
          <p>What we see here is very different behavior. We look at Germany and the Scandinavian countries, they're doing over 20%. Drive in the U.S. is growing 11%. Italy flat. And Spain is the worst, negative 38% because of the provisions and because of course the market is weak as we all not only suspect, but actually know. Portugal basically is flat. In commercial terms it's growing by 8%. Although what we've seen in Portugal is that there's GBM markets, which accompanies us. We see as I say that it's growing by 8% and it did show that margins are shrinking. Why? Well because of regulatory issues, yields which have affected the margins.</p>
          <p>As to global businesses. We saw a decline in previous quarters, very sharp decline. That's going to be a little bit more moderate. And we'll talk about the different global parts &#x2013; the global banking and markets. But the trend is good.</p>
          <p>You have received a document, which gives you information  about spreads, NPL and so on. And here I'm just going to go over this very briefly. Alfredo talked a little bit about liquidity. He talked about growth. We see in Spain 2-3%. That's very moderate. Deposits are growing double-digits, roughly 20%, the margins are good. So we see that the trend is picking up. Month-by-month we see improved spreads, specifically in assets, but also in liabilities. Its good.</p>
          <p>Then Santander Consumer Finance, SCF is doing well. The scenario that we've seen so far, margins have been much flatter. It is true that in the new cycle we see shrinking rates, probably this unit will be rewarded just as it has been chastised so far.</p>
          <p>Portugal is doing nicely also in terms of business, and in terms of their net interest revenue, not because of spread cover. I said that, yes things improve, but this year has been tough because of the regulatory changes in Portugal. We've seen what the results have been in the recent quarters. We've seen how the Portuguese banking sector has reflected these changes.</p>
          <p>If we look now at net operating income, we see that the margin after provisions is roughly 10%. Banesto 12. Consumer, even in these very difficult cycles, grows. And Portugal, the same trend. Not because of the provisions in Portugal, because that's stable, but perhaps because of the revenues which are weaker because of the spreads. Yes the trend is good, but also, yes those regulatory changes have affected the results in Portugal.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the UK now. It is true that the numbers are excellent in absolute terms and in relative terms when we compare with our peers in the UK. We saw the incorporation of Bradford &amp; Bingley, with the B&amp;B in September, so no impact on profits there. The A&amp;L operation was also completed in October, so the numbers are not included here. The quarter has been good. We've seen a growth by 13%. We see on the right hand of our slide how the net operating income grows systematically. Costs are subject to control. So our net operating income is up roughly 20%.</p>
          <p>Let see the drivers. First, there's volume. We see those mortgages, that's 10, 6 in the previous year. Growth of deposits prior to B&amp;B was 6, 50% more than in the previous year and at the same time we see a systematic increase of spreads. We see that from the fourth quarter 2007 systematically that's making 5, 6, 7 base points &#x2013; that's the spread. And this together with good cost control, and if there is no increase in provisions because our quality is good, our NPL ratio is stable, which explains that this net operating income will go directly to the bottom and we'll see growth to the tune of that 20% for Abbey. So, I repeat excellent performance and trends, which actually cast a very positive light on upcoming quarters.</p>
          <p>What I am trying to do here with this slide, is talk a little bit about what it is that we are referring to when we talk about A&amp;L and B&amp;B operations. Basically these acquisitions times 2 our activities. Our market share has risen notably. We've seen a growth by 10%, a little bit more in the mortgages, but we're around that 10. And we see now that the structure of the bank is very excellent quality deposits and excellent capitalization. So the joint operation of A&amp;L and B&amp;B and Abbey really guarantees an outstanding platform. We will continue to see growth in the UK and we will continue to make headwind.</p>
          <p>Yes it's true that perhaps there will be a little bit of a slowing down, but we have that competitive edge, so we will be able to capitalize on that. But for the Latin American <mark type="inaudible" /> (44.01), I want to look at Latin America without Banco Real. Without Banco Real, I repeat, the trends are very similar to what we see in the previous quarters. We see growth in excess of 30%. I'm talking about dollars. Again costs grow of course. Our net operating income 40%. We saw an increase in provisions. And those profits are absolutely a record. We're talking about 1.1 billion that's the third, after our third quarter profit.</p>
          <p>Now the drivers are the same. We've seen how there are more and more customers. We see bank penetration. We see that fee generating businesses are on the upswing, and here we see that there is slower growth in lending and greater emphasis on deposits. That's very important.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the big countries. Again, we have information regarding income. There is no major difference here. Between 30 and 40%. The non-operating income is the same. And as we see how it flows into attributable profit, it's to the tune of 20%, with the exception of Chile because of the interruptions last year, discontinued operations at 17% &#x2013; before discontinued operations. And the same for SPB, Private Banking in the region. That market scenario was tough, pretty tough for private banking, but it continues to generate results around the 20% mark. So, the performance is good. Performance is good without major changes vis-&#xE0;-vis what we've seen in the previous months.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at business volumes. With the exception perhaps of deposits in Mexico, which focuses on mutual funds, in other countries funds are performing as they have performed in Europe. So, we see that slight difference in Mexico. So, high volumes in Brazil, Mexico and Chile and a healthy evolution of our net interest revenues. So, this is a trend which we have seen in Continental Europe.</p>
          <p>If we look at net operating income after provisions. We see Brazil growth of 24%. Mexico weaker. Why? Because of income in the third quarter there was that 820 million, which is in excess of the typical amount. And then there's been also a reduction of the credit cards. That business is definitely, definitely excepting the numbers.</p>
          <p>In the case of Chile, we see a quarter-by-quarter improvement after provisions before also we see how they are in excess of 20%. I'm not going to go into the details of Banco Real, but I would like to give you two pieces of information. The recurrent is going to the tune of 25%. We see that 30% deposits &#x2013; the quality, credit quality is good. We'll talk in detail about Banco Real and Brazil on the 31st in Sao Paulo &#x2013; we will be talking about Brazil this week.</p>
          <p>I do want to talk a little bit about financial management and equity stakes, because if we compare with previous numbers we see how telling it is. We saw 354 in the previous quarter, that was last quarter, and it's 1 million negative now. Our CEO said that this is the impact, minus 176 that's the main impact. And losses in the exchange rate position, we know that we need to cover results, that's been minus 123. You know that its point-by point, 30th September is the date. So, the impact as I said is not in the results, but in the negative, yes it's on September 30th. And the rest is &#x20AC;56 million dividends.</p>
          <p>So, this is a flash of the quarter.</p>
          <p>If we look at the year-on-year, it's different but for two reasons. Why? Because there is that improvement, that 206 because of Banco Real. Banco Real, <mark type="inaudible" /> (49.00) &#x2013; with the exception of Sao Paulo capital gains, which we sold last year &#x2013; and that is that total impact on profits, that positive 206, despite the fact that the quarter has been notably worse.</p>
          <p>Now if we look at some global areas. I want to talk a little bit about wholesale banking. I'm going to be skipping the retail-banking portion. I'm going to be talking about global wholesale banking which have enjoyed a good quarter. We see two years, which have been different. 2007 had losses quarter-after-quarter. I said that there was that fall quarter-by-quarter this year. It's going to be very different, between 350 and &#x20AC;600 million per quarter. We see that growth is to the tune of 21%. Trading is a little bit more volatile. It's been weaker than in the past, there's been fewer results.</p>
          <p>And finally obviously our operating expenses are seeing a tightening of the belt. So evolution is good, evolution is very good. If we compare with rest of the market, good cost control, good generation of results quarter-after-quarter, beginning with negative numbers in the first quarter, end up in a convergence with the <mark type="inaudible" /> (50.37). And so we can talk about good evolution here.</p>
          <p>And as to asset management and insurance. Well, we saw that before when our CEO talked about fees. We talked about funds and a drop with those assets being managed and there's that evolution, which is very positive. You can see that, not in results, but look rather at the right hand part of the slide, you see growth to the tune of 22%, that's in insurance; and income for asset management is minus 18%, because there are fewer assets being managed. Now we're generating profits and this of course has an impact. Profits before taxes, that's insurance plus asset management, the number is 120, which is different from what we had in the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to give the floor to Alfredo who is going to conclude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Very briefly now in my conclusions, I'll just summarize the more important issues which have surfaced here. To sum up, despite the fact that life is very complicated, the Santander Group once again proves it's metal, it's got strong and excellent results. We can see that 2.2 billion in third quarter, ordinary profit, and I repeat ordinary, is 6.935 million in the past nine months, that's 15.8% more than in the same period in 2007. EPS is &#x20AC;1.04, that's 8% higher than last year's.</p>
          <p>We also announced the payment of a second interim dividend, which is 10% higher than its equivalent in the previous year 2007. Our capital gains from the sale of Santander Financial City of &#x20AC;586 million, which as yet have not been included, and have had no impact on the earnings for the first nine months. And our credit quality standards have surpassed those of our peers. Our levels of solvency are very healthy, very solid.</p>
          <p>So, if we look at the future, it's obvious that our management is going to be organized around a number of important issues, two basically. First our levers, and second our integrations.</p>
          <p>So, the first block, which is our drivers or our levers. We've said it once and again throughout the presentation, but obviously these, we'll look at boosting commercial revenues and this by managing spreads and capturing deposits that's our priority. Focusing even more on cost management, in order to keep "jaws" of anywhere between 10, 9 points, as we've done in the past years. Continue to be very proactive in managing risks and recoveries. And finally being very firm in terms of the use of capital and also in terms of the use of liquidity. I think that these are basically the levers, the drivers for everyday use.</p>
          <p>And apart from that, we also know that there are priorities, this is the second chapter. And this chapter has to do with integration in Brazil and we'll be presenting that on Friday this week. It will be in Sao Paulo. We'll be also integrating in the U.K., A&amp;L and B&amp;B, and then another small integration in Germany of RBS activities, Royal Bank of Scotland. So these are straightforward integrations. They're not complex. They are in-market. In other words, we are availing ourselves of the best platforms, teams, market familiarity. We're not talking about anything complex. It is not like Abbey in 2004.</p>
          <p>We have local teams. We will be working with local teams. We have the experience. We've got a track record. We've got mature technology, which will allow us to benefit from these integrations. But of course the Group has experience, much more experience than remember some time back, Consumer Europe and remember Abbey. So despite what we see in the papers, we're not talking about risk, and execution is going to be low risk. So in a nutshell, Santander is here, facing a new scenario, after the crisis. And we feel strong, robust, solid.</p>
          <p>Our core capital is higher than 6%, with a quality balance sheet, with over 6 billion in generic funds and we can continue to improve our capital ratio, thanks to our activities. So basically from the point of view of capital, we don't have anything toxic in the house, so we can only talk about top quality activities. Also we have a diversification. It's not only geographical diversification. It's also in our activities.</p>
          <p>And then finally, our potential, because of the result of our new activities, we can really generate synergies. Our latest acquisitions will allow us to be very optimistic regarding future results. We can be optimistic. Really, the bringing on board of the different banks, all of these elements, all of these realities, will seem how together we achieve very important results.</p>
          <p>So, I think clearly, we are a bank with a winning model. We are a bank that can be assured that in the upcoming fiscal years we'll be successful vis-&#xE0;-vis our peers. And we will be successful in terms of our recurrent profits. So thank you very much. And now we have time for questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Well, thank you very much. We now are going to pose the questions that we have been receiving, the questions that we are receiving via web and then we will be taking calls from the phone.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There is question from Antonio Ramirez on the re-capitalization and funding processes to save bad banks. Does that reduce the relative advantage for the other banks when it comes to making acquisitions or to gain significant market shares? And if in our opinion the UK has profited from this situation? And if this is going to make the competitive advantage disappear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll have to see what happens in these competitive markets. We are aware that there is concern by part of the government and the Brussels authorities, concern that particularly the re-capitalization processes, but also the funding processes &#x2013; well, there is concern that they might break a level of playing field. It will break the market equilibrium between the different players. We'll see what happens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ramon Garcia (60.00). And there are quite lot of questions about this, about the capital issue. With regards to capital we agree that in Spain there is no need for greater capital. But in other countries such as Greece, they have a new plan by part of the government. What are the levels of capital that we have today? What are we going to have in the future? Are there possible sales? Well lots of questions on capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on capital, my opinion, and the opinion of a bank and as a group, we gave our opinion in the presentation. We have 6.3 right now. If we include the Banco Real and the other assets that we have to include, we will continue to have more than 6%, even if we include Sovereign in the first quarter of next year. At the end of the first quarter, we will continue to have more than 6%. So that's a fact. Okay?</p>
          <p>Second element, and this is a judgment, 6%, 6.3%, 6.2% of core Tier 1 in our business, and for our business, and for our assets, is more than enough. It's very comfortable, very comfortable level of capital. This is a fact. Now 6.3% in Santander has nothing to do with 7% of whatever other bank or other banks that we can all think of, with a completely different business, with toxic assets etc. I have nothing to do. So, we should have enough criteria so as not to adjust 6%. We have to judge it in its context. For Santander it's good enough. Now in the next quarters, it is true that we have to include some assets, but it's also true that we have the capacity to generate capital internally. Our pay-out of 50% means that we, we currently, quarter after quarter, generate capital, 0.10, 0.15 depending on the growth of our assets at risk, which is small by the way, because the circumstances are what they are, and we don't think we are going to continue to grow as we have in the past.</p>
          <p>And lastly, we have several capacities that for example we can reduce as to that risk. We have announced some of these. We presented, when we presented A&amp;L, a plan to reduce these assets. In fact, we cannot be more specific. But, we know that we can reduce the bottom lines of Alliance &amp; Leicester and Abbey, we can reduce financial asset securities, all sorts of paper, as well as loans. So we can reduce the leverage significantly. We've already said, how we're going to do it and where, like in Sovereign, and we can also sell some assets. The selling of Venezuela will give us capital. The capital gains of the Santander City also give us more core capital. So, and other divestments too. So, we don't think that capital is going to be an issue for the Santander Group taking into account everything I just mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Antonio Ramirez asks a question, but there are several questions on the subject. He asks about the valuation adjustments in equity &#x2013; 3.7 almost 3.8 billion? What is the breakdown of it? How much is Fortis and Royal Bank? If we're going to take these losses to the P&amp;L or not? And different questions also around the subject of exchange rate differences.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to adjustments, for valuation the figure that Antonio mentioned is 3.6 billion, basically there are three components. The first component, the most important one, is that which stems from the exchange rate effect in the goodwill, which is I think 2.2 billion, that is the most important one, which does not effect capital because on the other hand, on the other side, reduces the goodwill. And then the second effect in adjustments for valuation, are the available portfolios for sale, including industrial stakes, which have an impact of about 1 billion. And the third is fixed income, the "out-go" (65.30) portfolio basically of the "out-goes" (65.32) that are available for sale. This is what gives us that 3.7 billion in valuation adjustments, which are reduced from the equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Antonio (65.49) is asking about the updating of the selling, updates on the selling of the Venezuelan bank and the sale of Puerto Group (66.02)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in Venezuela things are happening. We hope that in November we can give more information and report on the fact that it's been concluded because things are well ahead and we hope to end this process very soon. And Puerto Group (66.24), well the execution is going to be a bit slow and long, it's going to take a few months and this, well the truth is that I didn't mention this, but it does add an additional deleverage, because it is an asset of almost 2 point some billion pounds, I think it is. In any case the details, it's too soon to tell because as I said it still needs a certain period for its execution, so this will take time.</p>
          <p>The <mark type="inaudible" /> (66.59) from Fortis is that thing about a guidance of core capital that you already mentioned, but he asked whether we could reduce the dividend or if we could pay part of the dividend in shares? The answer is clearly no. A clear no there. Can we confirm the guidance of the bank for the 8s and 9s and if you're thinking about a strong capital restructuring or pre-retirements? No, we are not thinking of doing any strong restructuring of personnel. We don't have that in mind. We don't have any need to do that and we are not thinking of any period of time and plan either, or restructuring beyond what is normal every year, we do a few pre-retirements, but that is part of the normal cycle of a bank. Nothing special there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And about the guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this time, I think what we already said about guidance of earnings for 2008, we still think we can reach those figures. It's possible. If next quarter we can get the same results as this quarter then with the extraordinary items we would reach that figure that we had planned. So right now there is nothing new to add there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Antonio Ramirez and Santiago L&#xF3;pez, from Keefe and Credit Suisse. They ask about the acquisition of real estate assets. And there is another question about this &#x2013; how much have you bought? What is your current exposure by types of asset? What is the relationship between the price and the debt? And if we can add more acquisitions during the fourth quarter or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when it comes to real estate assets, we have explained this already and we don't have to make many more acquisitions, but the basic rationale under this, for this operation is the same, always to better protect our credit assets. So far, what we have acquired is &#x20AC;2.7 billion. More than 70% is residential homes, finished or about to be concluded, or commercial property. In terms of land, less than 30%, and land under management is about 5%. With regards to loan to value, this is acquired below the appraisal value, so the developer participates in the potential profits of these deals. So, the loan to value follows the market rationale, that would be, the prices would be equal to the cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Santiago has two more questions. How would the capital affect the fall in the portfolios of fixed income in Latin American given the strong depreciations of currency and the fall of value of sovereign bonds? And the other question is, given the strong fall of the exchanges, are you going to execute some of the LBO loans that you have and what will be the exposure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to fixed income portfolios, they are all sovereign bonds, basically Mexico and Brazil. It doesn't have an exchange rate effect. These are sovereign bonds in local currency, financial local currency. Therefore, there is no exchange rate effect. What we see in the fluctuations from the available portfolios available for sale would be the mark-to-market. These are -- the greatest portfolios are out of Mexico, which covers what we call the core deposits. We buy bonds at a fixed rate, at an average for two and a half years, more or less, that's the average, to cover for potential falls of the interest rate. Even so the balance sheet is short. But it is true that the mark-to-market of the portfolio is having an impact. I mentioned that the bonds are sovereign bonds, in Mexico as well as in Brazil. The portfolios are slightly smaller in Brazil but the effect is the same.</p>
          <p>Something about LBLs he asks? The position of LBLs of the group is 1.2 to &#x20AC;1.3 billion in several operations. There is nothing special there to mention.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Antonio is also asking, as well as other analysts, of the updating of the coverage policies, of the hedging policies for P&amp;L capital? How are we doing in dollars? What hedging do we have there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't changed our policy. We have hedges in local currency against the dollar and then the dollar-euro position. There are hedges in Brazil, Mexico and Brazil &#x2013; Brazil, Mexico and Chile, to hedge for changes in exchange rate. In capital, we have coverages through tunnels, almost 100% in Mexico, Chile, Brazil and the UK. These are coverage by tunnels, tunnels of options, where there is a first loss that we take on, and from that moment on we are hedged. We are protected, and that's the policy that we have been following in the last few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos Soto <mark type="inaudible" /> (73.47). What are the levels of NPLs we can have in Spain, or that we have in Spain? And how far can that go? What are our expectations? And in that regards there are several questions too, about the use of generic funds. If we're starting to use generic provisions? And when do we think we can start using these?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the difficulties there are in forecasting these things. We believe that in Spain this year and at December 31, we won't have to touch that, we won't have more than 2% NPL rate. 1.9% is what is going to be more or less. We're not, just, going to reach 2% of the NPL ratio. And somebody will ask me, what about 2009? Well I'll talk about it when we get there, because it's very difficult to tell right now. Because we're driving with a lot of fog and the headlights can only go so far. So next year there can be an increase in the NPL ratio, but perhaps even less than what we are experiencing right now. But we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. But for this year, I would say 1.89, 1.90, 1.90 something. I don't think that it's going to reach 2%. That's my impression.</p>
          <p>What was the other question please?</p>
          <p>The use of generic provisions. Well in our vision, we don't think that we need to use the generic provisions. This year certainly not. We don't think we're going to have to use them next year. The generic provisions protect us and it is possible that at the beginning of 2010, we won't need to touch that either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos (76.02) is asking about the level of provisions or risk expectations in Brazil, Mexico and Latin. There's several questions on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Brazil and Mexico, the conditions are the ones we see right now. We've had an increase in NPL, a high increase in NPL because of credit cards, which is more less contained now, and in Brazil because of the change in the mix. It's more noticeable in Brazil, because apart from the NPL levels in the country as a whole, we've had a strong change in the mix, where we're giving more weight to the business size that has to do with consumer and with individual customers, credit cards, personal loans and so on. And this is why the nominal NPL rates are going up. We don't see any clear reason that would lead us to think that these figures will get worse next year.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Debbie Fernandez from La Caixa (77.12). Why has the credit, or the lending portfolio go down in the network Santander in Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't see any reason. A part reason, I guess it has quite a lot to do with loans to large corporations, which vary a lot. But lending activities, even if the rate of growth has gone down, has been quite normal. I can't think of any other reason, but the change due to our large corporations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also a question about consumer finance has increased?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Consumer finance is a division which has a very strong international component and Germany is going very well in consumer loans and they are selling a lot of cars, new cars and second hand cars. Italy is also growing I think at 14%, I don't remember by heart. 14 or 15% in Germany and Italy. Also in the UK this activity is growing. Then we have the impact of the assets of the Royal Bank of Scotland, their inclusion. And that's the change in the perimeter. And it also has an impact.</p>
          <p>Spain, growth is going down. Spain is the only unit of Santander Consumer Finance, whose growth in lending in 2008 has been negative, minus 20% more or less because of the general slowdown. But Santander Consumer as a whole? It's in Germany where activities are strong there, half of the Santander Consumer Finance business is in Germany in fact. And then we're also very strong in Italy, the UK, Drive in the U.S., which is also growing. So all in all, we do see growth. But the Santander Consumer is not that strong in Spain. We are a third part of the business, Spain. But in the other markets, like Germany etc. we're growing.</p>

          <p>Well, the performance of risk quality in England is very good. And this is not an issue. This is not a problem, at least not for us, for Abbey. And the main reason is, we have been mentioning this in fact on other occasions and other earnings announcements, because this point already came up in the earnings of the second and third quarter. In the UK, Abbey is carrying out a policy where on the one hand it is growing reasonably well in volume, not very much. It's improving its market share, but it's not growing very much in terms of volume, because the demand for mortgages is low in the UK. It's carrying out a margins policy and it's selecting the risk of quality very carefully.</p>
          <p>In fact in Abbey, in the new production, since June of next year there is less than 1% of new production of loan to value of more than 80%. And there is nothing of buy-to-let. And there is nothing, sub-classified mortgages, which are low quality mortgages. So, this selection policy, which is very rigorous and which is favored by the market conditions, so what we're putting into our portfolio is of increasingly greater quality, relatively quality. So, the risk quality is being preserved. If there is a small increase in the NPL rate, it actually comes from the severity or the low valuation or less &#x2013; lower valuation of the property which is being mortgaged. So if a property is worth less and less and that gives rise to an increase in the NPL rate. But we have no special concern on this product, and there is no indication that in England the risk quality of our assets will get worse. Much to the contrary.</p>

          <p>Matteo Ramenghi (82.45) from UBS has several questions. One of them is on variations of different items in the balance sheet, that I think we can answer later on, more in detail, if you agree. Then we have the contraction of the book-ins (83.03) thing &#x2013; that has already been answered. And then a question on quality in Mexico, is there a one-off there? These are the credit cards that we've been talking about in other presentations.</p>
          <p>Antonio Ramirez has another question. Wait a second, Antonio.</p>
          <p>I'm being told Jos&#xE9; Antonio and <mark type="inaudible" /> (83.28) are telling me that I didn't express myself clearly &#x2013; generic provisions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Generic provisions. What I meant to say, because the question is when are we going to start to use the generic provisions. So, what I wanted to say, I don't know what I said, I don't remember. But what I meant to say was that so far we have not used generic provisions in Spain. We'll probably start to use them before the end of the year. That we have the possibility of making use of them. And I don't think we will spend them until the end of next year or beginning of 2010. But obviously we will have to resort to these throughout 2008, during the rest of 2008. I mustn't have said this, well, I think that was a misunderstanding.</p>

          <p>Inigo Vega, three questions. The first one has already been answered on the follow-up lending in Santander. Then there's another one about the reduction of assets at risk in Abbey in the UK. Can you elaborate a bit more? What assets do you figure you are going to reduce? And then the third one is on the breaking down of the generic provisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I already talked about that in the UK. I talked about risk there. Actually I talked about it in detail when we presented the Alliance &amp; Leicester deal. Basically, it's going to be securities, but other things, too. Right now we are working on that, but since we haven't taken control yet over Alliance &amp; Leicester, we haven't been able to work in detail on these issues. We can probably be more specific in the future. But certainly securities there, we can make lots of reductions.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well today we reported to the CLMV (86.13) on Banif, and we told them what we can say so far, which is that this decision was made by Banif. It's a Banif decision and therefore its scope has been reduced, and it will be included in the P&amp;L of Banif. Number two, this is an exceptional decision, which certainly does not acknowledge that bad products have been sold, because of commercial reasons. This decision was made to support customers in a situation that Banif believes has been extraordinary and the cost will be paid by Banif and that is still being analyzed and Banif will report on it when it has valued the amount.</p>

          <p>Eva Hernandez from Morgan Stanley has several questions that have already been answered. But there is one that hasn't been answered, the low tax rate in Mexico, which already happened in the second quarter. Could you elaborate a bit more on that? The others have been answered already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in Mexico this tax advantage &#x2013; the volatility of the tax rate. It stems from the fact that in Mexico certain provisions are not deductible from taxes, but when you sell the portfolio, so you can do something. So depending on whether there have been sales of portfolio or not, the tax rate might vary because provisions when they are executed are not tax deductible. And this is why we see the fluctuation in the tax rate in Mexico.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You more or less answered this, but yes about the increase in provisions and credit quality at Abbey for the third quarter and the cost of risk, I don't think there is anything else to add to that. We already answered that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Javier Bernat from Caja Madrid (88.29) asks if, in view of the fact that we are not talking about capital increases. But are we thinking about issuing preferential shares or convertibles, apart from the ones that already exist? And he has a follow-up question regarding the networks, Santander and Banesto. Santander has grown, Banesto has shrunken. Is there any kind of an exchange of activities? And then another question about immigrants, referring to the quality of our assets in Spain, are we perceiving any loss in quality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Answer to that is we are not going to be issuing convertibles. We are going to continue with our business as usual policy. As to the network or our branches, actually that's part of the activities in any given year. I mean, if you have thousands of branches, while you close 20, you open 30, that's not new. To the best of my knowledge, Banesto doesn't have any plan to close branches maybe they'd have to adjust. But that is not the same as for Santander. So we're not talking about corporate policy if you will; we are not talking about a plan, a program, no nothing like that. It's just part of our standard operating procedure. We do this every year, there's openings and closings every year.</p>
          <p>And then there was, what was the other one? I am sorry, please refresh my memory.</p>
          <p>Yes about immigrants, about immigrants. Well, the Group is not especially exposed perhaps with the exception of Santander Consumer in Spain, but the Group does not have a very relevant position among immigrants. Santander Banesto and Banesto of course are units or business units or banks whose average customer is middle-middle, upper-middle class, so immigrants represent a very small slice of our pie. So, I really don't think that this issue would affect the Santander Group, perhaps a little bit more in Santander Consumer, the former <mark type="inaudible" /> (90.55) where yes in fact we did have money for consumption, for car loans and so on. But not even there are we particularly relevant. It is true that apparently NPLs in this part of the population is a little bit more than in other segments. But we really haven't observed anything that really sets that off, we are talking about products, products, not segments necessarily.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Giovanni Carere (91.29) has a question, actually he has a whole number of them, but let's just pose the one that as yet haven't been answered. He talks about the impact on the -because of liquidity that's because of the evolution of B&amp;B. We talked about exposure to builders, constructers, developers. There is a specific question, which is, what would the impact be of faster decrease of rates? And secondly, can we quantify or can we elaborate on the size of the portfolio of mortgages in foreign currencies in Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well those mortgages in foreign currency, I think it's zero. I don't know, I don't think that we have any in Spain. I think we just have euros. As to the loss in rates, I think that's euro-zone, here. What we would see is that Santander Consumer Finance is benefiting from that, and then we have the commercial areas, where in the short term this reduction is favorable, and in the long-term, well that will depend on the hedges in place. Have we hedged or have we not hedged?</p>
          <p>In the short-term Santander Consumer Finance, this is beneficial for SCF in the short-term, and long-term it's detrimental because of the spread, those core deposits, which in the Group in Spain are 20 trillions (he says) and this depends on the hedges. We have some hedges which have foreign amounts and that's to cover that position specifically.</p>

          <p>Arturo de Frias, Dresdner has a question regarding the cost of capital in generics?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's already been answered. But he's talking about those 50, 55 base points. He talks about that cost of credit at 45 and that's why our CEO made a reference to the upcoming use of generics, provisions.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> from <mark type="inaudible" /> (93.52) again has a question and this has to do with maturity for 2009 of wholesale debt. Again the reduction is going to perhaps be the reason where we're going to be issuing less or what are the forecasts for the upcoming few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At a Group level, we would be at about &#x20AC;20 billion, that's wholesale mid and long-term. Now linking up these assets with liquidity is not always necessarily the best idea. We could see some changes, but not always because our <mark type="inaudible" /> (94.35) would have to remember that there are other elements involved. We have seen in our presentation that if we are talking about those 20 trillion, the dynamic is credits and deposits, or long-term deposits, and that calls for less wholesale funding. And if we look at the current scenario, well what we see is that right now it's not liquidity that the issue, it's the capacity to issue in the long-term, at a cost that the market will find acceptable in the long-term also. As you know, at this point, we have come to a screeching halt. Some governments are attempting to guarantee some issues, some emissions in the upcoming three to five years and this is going to affect the market, but we are not really sure exactly how. Yes, it's going to be liquidity pumped in and investors will be thinking about buying, but we don't know when they'll be thinking of buying, or what they'll be thinking of buying. In any case liquidity right now is, has been, is and has been very comfortable and we continue to feel that there's a comfortable fit. We have short-term liquidity in the market.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> (95.53) and a person from Goldman have a very similar question. This one regarding dividends. Do we have any plans to pay out dividends? perhaps not cash or buyback? And are we thinking about a payout policy in view of the fact that our results have not grown that much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well to the first group of questions, the answer is no. And to the last question, is yes. Yes, we are going to be upholding that payout policy, but I don't agree with that footnote, with those shrinking results. I mean, if you think that 15% growth is a shrinking result, well all right, fine, but it's not, well, not really.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the quarter, and I think I said this before, yes, there is an impact and it is a negative one because, that the exchange rate, which is mark-to-market on a daily basis, the results are average monthly. So in this term, in this quarter, it's negative because this one-off appreciation of the dollar vis-&#xE0;-vis the euro. And if we look to the future, that's going to depend I think on different changes in evolutions, not only exchange rate, but also interest rates, because we need to bear in mind that those are the two sides of the coin. But when we talk about managing these risks, well no, we do not foresee great changes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes &#x2013; I have a comment and I'm harking back to a question that you just referred to now, we haven't answered. When we acquired Bradford &amp; Bingley, we talked about that and we said that our forecast was that we would lose up to 20% of the deposits. Excuse me. Was I being heard? Yes. Am I being heard? Yes, yes, yes. I said that when Bradford &amp; Bingley was bought, Antonio <mark type="inaudible" /> (99.50) said that we consider the possibility of losing up to 22% of our deposits. So there would be minor losses in the first few days, that's true, but now we have more deposits not only have we not lost, we've actually gained. I think it's very important, I think this is very important. I think we have one question, it's a conference call, the others I think have all been answered. So please could we have that question.</p>

          <p>Good day this is from, <mark type="inaudible" /> Garcia (100.22). Good day. I have a couple of questions. First why do generics in the UK shrink? And as to those adjustments, you talked about evolution in the first nine months. I'd like to know a valuation of that in the first, second and third quarters. Could you break that down please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question about generics in the UK. You might remember that yes there is a generic provision, which was in place when we talked about those unsecured personal loans, both UPLs. We're availing ourselves of that generic. As to the adjustment between the quarters, I think the difference is 700 million and that's due to those three elements that I referred to before. I talked about the exchange rate. So there is an effect in the quarter. I talked about the portfolio, the equity portfolio, which again has evolved in the quarter and that will be part of the operation. And I talked about that fixed outcome. I mentioned Mexico and Chile specifically, because in Europe it's been positive. That's net, because some portfolios have evolved positively, others negatively in mark-to-market. These are hedges and these three are the same components that continue to explain the evolution quarter-by-quarter.</p>
          <p>Well, thank you very much. I think that we have come to the end of the presentation. And we'll see you again next time.</p>
