          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for holding, and welcome to the Wesfarmers 2008 Half Year Results Announcement. The lines have been muted during the presentation; however, you will have an opportunity to ask questions immediately afterward, and instructions will be provided on how to do this at that time.</p>
          <p>A copy of the presentation can be downloaded from the Wesfarmers website, or alternatively, can be viewed on the live Webcast. In addition to the PowerPoint presentation, there's also an information pack which provides additional information regarding the full year performance. This pack can also be downloaded from Wesfarmers website.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the call over to Managing Director of Wesfarmers Limited, Mr. Richard Goyder. Thank you and please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Well, good morning, or afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Apologies for doing this on a Friday. We knew we were going to have to report a bit later this half, because of the complexity of bringing the Coles results in, and with a number of directors on different Boards, today was the only day we could do it.</p>
          <p>I'll just give you an outline of proceedings. As you can see, I'll talk generally about the results, and Gene will talk about financial results. Keith Gordon, who's with us here will talk about Coles integration. John Gillam, Mick McMahon, Launa Inman, Larry Davis, Stewart Butel, Rob Scott, Oliva Chretien, Ian Hansen, Tim Bult, also all with me in person, they'll present briefly on their divisional performances and then I'll wrap up, and we'll take questions. So we'll talk for a little while.</p>
          <p>In terms of group performance highlights, which is slide four, obviously, in the half we completed the Coles transaction on the 23rd of November. And that's important in the half-year results because there's a fair bit of seasonality in the results as you will have seen in our release.</p>
          <p>The operating profit after tax of $601 million is a record and I think a very strong result. Particularly pleasing is the businesses we own pre the cost transaction were up 12%. And we've had good performance from Target and Kmart in the very brief period we've owned the businesses, and generally, it's very early days on certain markets, as Nick will talk about, but we weren't unhappy with our performance over Christmas in that business as well.</p>
          <p>I do want to talk a bit about, and later, Gene will, on the seasonality, the five week period that we have owned the businesses, seasonal peak, trading periods and profit periods in a number of the retail businesses and they obviously have skewed the result for the half.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share similarly because we've got that profit effect coming through for the five weeks on an average -- weighted average number of shares, you're getting a skewed number on EPS but it was obviously a very strong number, as was cash flow. Cash flow from our existing businesses, our pre-existing businesses and from the retail businesses was good as you'd expect over that Christmas period, and we've announced, the Board of Directors have announced a fully franked interim dividend of $0.65, the -- Gene will talk about later the dividend investment plan will be underwritten to at least 75%.</p>
          <p>Quickly on divisions, I'll let others comment in detail but the Bunnings performance within Home Improvement and Office Supplies was outstanding, again, and John will talk about what was behind that. We are very pleased. Because I said early days, we're not going to make any false statements on Coles but we were happy to have product available through the Christmas period and that the performance, given all the turmoil that's been going on in the Coles business, we were satisfied with target <mark type="inaudible" /> and I talked about very solid Christmas trading period.</p>
          <p>Resources down because of prevailing coal prices but the operating performance was good. Insurance tough, as Rob will outline, improved numbers because of -- or higher number because of OAMPS and Crombie Lockwood and the broking business is going well there. And in industrial and safety, chemicals, fertilizers and energy, very pleasing performance in those three businesses versus our expectations in business last year.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me hand over to Gene Tilbrook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Richard. Slide seven shows the slowdown of earnings, and as Richard noted, the operating cash flow is strong, largely flowing from the retail businesses over Christmas. So not an overall six month figure and that needs to be taken into account as does the comparisons in earnings per share and they're around 454 million shares, the weighted average.</p>
          <p>Dividend of $0.65, down from last year, last year's dividend included about $0.25 that arose from the sale of ARG and the $0.65 is consistent with the indication that we gave at the time of the Coles acquisition that we anticipate being able to pay a $2 dividend over the year.</p>
          <p>Looking to the divisional EBIT comparisons, you can see there that the pre-Coles businesses other than resources all up. In the case of insurance, due to the inclusion of the broking business for part of the year. And the other item there, up significantly at $72 million, $32 million of that is a dividend from Coles that was received in relation to the period when we earned about 10% of that business.</p>
          <p>Return on shareholders funds is down because of the larger shareholders funds basis, again, that's on a moving average basis and so there will be further erosion of return on shareholders funds and return on capital as we go through the full year. Our focus going forward, as it's always been, is to achieve satisfactory returns on capital and turn that into returns on equity and we just have a much bigger base on which to do that in the future.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the dividend and the cash flow trends over time. Capital expenditure, slide 11, we gave an indication of $825 million budget CapEx for this year and that budget was weighted quite heavily towards the first half. So the pre-Coles businesses slightly behind the budgeted figure, but we would expect excellent Coles number to be about in line over the year. Coles adds another $90 million to that. So to date, we've expended $588 million.</p>
          <p>On capital management, net debt to equity is at the top end of the range that we indicated at the time of the transaction and December still represented a time with a fair bit of inventory and still finishes being worked through in transition around cash flow management. Interest cover ratio moving down at five times. As has been mentioned a number of times, we have $4 billion of debt to be refinanced by October this year and we plan to do that through a combination of dividend investment plan, turning the short-term debt into medium-term debt in both domestic and off-shore markets and we're looking at other vehicles, like hybrids and convertibles.</p>
          <p>That plan was intended to actually start being implemented following our results announcement and we're well advanced in the preparations, documentations, so on, ready to move in the most appropriate markets. Clearly markets have changed. There is some pressure in some markets, some are pretty liquid, but at high cost. So as we indicated back in November, we'll be flexible about how we tackle those markets.</p>
          <p>Dividend investment plan, for this interim dividend has been at least 75% underwritten and as I indicated, we're -- our dividend position remains that we expect to pay $2 per share for the total year.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll hand over to Keith Gordon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Gene. On integration, all the reporting lines for the former Coles trade corporate functions, such as tax, treasury, company secretary, legal, Investor Relations, insurance and risk are all now into the appropriate point in Wesfarmers. And this work will be completed as we go through the budgeting part over the next few months, so that from July 1 all of these functions will be accounted for under Wesfarmers Corporate.</p>
          <p>In the divisions, we've now finalized structures for Target, Kmart and Officeworks and are going through the process of transitioning team members from the Central Retail Support functions to those divisions. Developing the old structure for Coles is a much bigger job, but we expect to have this largely complete by the end of March.</p>
          <p>Wesfarmers processors are now starting to operate in all divisions. Examples include the first divisional board meetings which were held in late January, early February. The rollout of the Wesfarmers' corporate planning process and the soon to be rolled out budgeting program will be followed in all the Coles divisions.</p>
          <p>On slide 15, you will recall that sitting alongside various organizational initiatives were a number of commercial reviews and projects that we spoke about prior to completion. The Kmart review is well progressed and that's had involvement from people from Wesfarmers' business development, some Kmart executives and the integration team, and we're now at the stage of putting together recommendations out of that review to put to Wesfarmers.</p>
          <p>We also undertook a review of the outcomes of the Coles Group simplification program and I'll talk to the numbers on that on the next slide. And although we believe that we will achieve the quantum of cost savings targeted under this program, the sources of that are likely to be a little bit different than what Coles had originally planned in some areas. So I would now round up simplification as it was pre-acquisition, but we'll continue to report on the cost savings that we're achieving on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>The supply chain review is nearing completion and we'll be in a position to update you further on that at the next briefing day. The focus of this review has been on the phasing and implementation of the various initiatives, with the objective being that we achieve efficiencies in the supply chain without significant disruption at store level. Working capital was also identified pre-acquisition as an opportunity and all divisions are developing their own working capital management strategies.</p>
          <p>On other matters, we're working through a range of legacy issues but no major issues have emerged that we weren't aware of through due diligence. IT is a very complex area but we developed a strategy for operating under the divisional model and now have a team working through the detail of that, including implementation planning.</p>
          <p>On property, we'll be finalizing a position regarding office location in the near future but we're obviously well aware of the potential financial impact that a move from Tooronga would have and that will be taken into account and balanced against some of the other factors involved. All things considered, we expect all divisions to be operating fully autonomously by the start of the next financial year.</p>
          <p>On slide 16, I mentioned earlier, that we round up simplification program. That program targeted $395 million per annum in cost savings to be achieved over several years. At the time of acquisition, we validated the $288 million of cost savings per annum had been achieved, leaving a further $97 million in cost savings to be generated.</p>
          <p>Since acquisition we've had a net reduction in cost of $36 million per annum with most of this coming from the corporate areas that I mentioned earlier. That net saving will be achieved through a reduction of $62 million per annum in costs from the former Coles Group and offset by an increase in Wesfarmers corporate costs of around $26 million. That increase in costs arises from the transfer of a number of Coles corporate employees to Wesfarmers, which will take place progressively over the next few months.</p>
          <p>These changes in the corporate area have resulted in approximately 60 redundancies since the acquisition. That's a small number in the context of the size of the organization, but we will see greater numbers as we move further into implementing the divisional structures.</p>
          <p>Particularly over the next several months, we'll see a major restructuring in Coles particularly in supermarkets and the retail support areas. And we're comfortable that the overall level of cost savings targeted will be achieved.</p>
          <p>Additional to paper-related cost savings, we're also looking at opportunities to leverage non-core purchasing arrangements that were in place in both Wesfarmers or Coles and looking for advantages that can be achieved across the broader group.</p>
          <p>I'll hand over to John Gillam.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Keith. I'll start at slide 19 and comment firstly on the Bunnings result. Bunnings traded well across the first half, leveraging off good market conditions. Revenue growth of 13% fed through to an overall lift in earnings of 20%. Trading earnings, which we adjust to exclude our property activities, grew by over 15%. And our overall trading margins strengthened to 11.3%.</p>
          <p>We're pleased to see our ROC back above the 30% mark notwithstanding strong ongoing capital investment. The lift in ROC was driven by continued good inventory management work and more importantly, the sale and lease-back transaction of 11 warehouse stores, which we completed in June last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 20, retail sales growth for the half was 14.4%. The store-on-store growth in cash sales of 12.2% highlights the traction we're getting from our core strategies across merchandising, store network reinvestment and operational disciplines. There is much more to come in all of these areas.</p>
          <p>On the trade side, sales lifted by 6% on the back of continued steady improvements across the business. We're now starting to see the benefit of the hard work done to reinvigorate our trade business in Australia across the past 24 or so months, and our New Zealand trade business is tracking well.</p>
          <p>We opened 60 warehouse stores in the half as well as one trade center. Details of the store network movement for the half are contained in a supplementary pack. Good progress continues to be made on our major work areas within support functions, our business systems and our supply chain.</p>
          <p>Turning to the outlook for the second half, which is on slide 21, the threat of rising borrowing costs makes us cautiously optimistic about both the retail and trade market conditions. However, trading through January and February to-date has been good and we're confident of achieving continued sales and earnings growth. We have a strong focus on driving improvements across our business through the strategies I outlined in the November Investor Briefing.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 22, I comment on Officeworks. The performance of the business in ablate period from taking ownership control to the end of the half year was satisfactory and modestly ahead of the prior comparative period. Note that Officeworks performance has not historically been heavily skewed to a Christmas peak.</p>
          <p>As noted on slide 23, we've made a number of senior appointments in the key roles, with the express sign of revitalizing the business. Initial period has been characterized by, firstly establishing operational principals to lift store performance. Secondly, assessing the adequacy of both current strategies and business capabilities, and thirdly, working quickly to integrate Officeworks into the Wesfarmers' group.</p>
          <p>This has been done while trying to optimize outcomes from three important trading periods, Christmas, back to school, and back to work. We're now ready to set Officeworks strategy to deliver satisfactory shareholder returns and strategic competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>We will be seeking to reestablish authority across all of the core ranges, presenting a stronger more attractive offer to customers. We're also came to achieve far better alignment across the Officeworks stores. The Officeworks business is a direct operations and the Harris Technology business. We do anticipate some one-off costs in repositioning the businesses and addressing areas of past neglect that will be absorbed in the second half. But we're excited by the opportunities for growth within this business as we look at across 2008 and beyond.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll pass on to Mick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks John, and good afternoon all. Coles delivered an improved result in the Christmas trading period with total sales up 7% in the food <mark type="inaudible" /> trend improving to 2% with headline growth of 3.4.</p>
          <p>And as Richard has said, while there's still an awful long way to go on supermarkets, the improving trend reflects progress in a number of areas, with highlights including an improving position in on-shelf availability. In particular very good operational performance in the peak Christmas trading period. Customers lift their mind very late this year with Christmas day on the Tuesday, which put a lot of pressure back through the supply chain that was handled very, very well by the teams.</p>
          <p>We also continue to see an improvement in fresh participation rates and sales growth in fresh and we've made a lot of progress in stabilizing margins as we offer customers better every day value, reduced some of the high level promotional activity and take a longer term view of rebuilding sales momentum.</p>
          <p>In December liquor sales were impacted by some wet and mild weather, up the North coast, particularly in the Liquorland convenience channel and especially in Queensland where we have a very strong presence. But 1st Choice continues to grow rapidly both in comp sales and with seven new stores opened in the half, taking us to 46 stores in the network at the end of December.</p>
          <p>Coles Express continues to perform very well despite higher fuel prices, with continued strong comp growth, and C-store sales at 6.2% and headline growth of 9.5 in the C-store excluding fuel. And this is driven by the continued the roll-out and expansion of a new C-store offer and with 20 new stores added for the half.</p>
          <p>If we look ahead now on slide 27, we have seen the improved trading performance character in the January, that as I've said, we have a long way to go to rebuild the basics of the supermarkets business and that focus will continue to be on improving those retail basics, was the customers in areas like availability and fresh, and in maintaining a tight focus on cost and inventory.</p>
          <p>We'll also be better at managing the impact of change in the stores as we go forward, especially in the areas of supply chain and IT, which are now integrating into the business. There will be further change in the busy network over coming months, but with one change program being managed through into the stores.</p>
          <p>By Easter we will have implemented our major new IT system to support multi-product discounting, which we call Release III. And at the same time there's a lot of work going on to develop programs to significantly improve the customer offer over time in the areas of product range and imprudent choice for customers.</p>
          <p>Continuing the improvement in fresh, we've also continued to evolve our promotional offer to better everyday value and utilize the benefits available to us with the implementation of Release III. And we're putting a lot of work into developing new store format, which will result in a series of in-store pilots later in the year. And in particular we should call out there will be significant organizational change over the next couple of quarters as we move to a smaller organization within the Coles business division, which will be very focused on supporting the stores and with a much reduced corporate overhead.</p>
          <p>There's some good progress, a long way to go and a lot of change to manage through, overcoming periods in what will continue to be a very a competitive environment.</p>
          <p>And I'll hand over to Launa.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mick. Good afternoon everyone. Well, firstly we're delighted with our results with the sales being at 605 million for the period, we were up 6.5% on last year. And comp store sales or like-on-like sales were at 3.1, giving us an EBIT of 118 million. With regards to the highlights, we had a busy few past months with the fact that we opened nine new stores and trend for December was an interesting one. We had in fact been trading well in November and then a couple of days before the election sales definitely slowed down. But ten days before Christmas they came back very strongly and have continued to still be strong for us.</p>
          <p>There was some highlight areas with regards to the apparel areas that really performed were menswear and footwear and homewears also had a very good five-week period.</p>
          <p>On the electric side, consumer digital products were the outstanding ones. Anything like consoles, computer games, we couldn't get enough of them and they all performed exceptionally well.</p>
          <p>With regards to our outlook, we are going to continue to rollout stores and we got three more planned for the next half. We are also going to be continuing with our designer concept and in the light of the success that we had Stella McCartney last year. We'll be announcing another new international designer this March for actually launch into stores in April.</p>
          <p>We are conscious that the economy could being tighten up, but at the same time we're very confident that with our strategy of differentiation, which is very much about good quality and good value, we would be able to manage it. We are conscious ensuring that we manage what we would classify as high-risk merchandise, but at the same time ensuring that we are in stock of absolutely key basic items. Because fundamentally people still do have to shop. So we are confident going forward that we are going to have a good season. Larry?</p>

      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon as you can see on slide 43, Kmart had a good December with a 5% comp sales increase and an EBIT of 101 million.</p>
          <p>On slide 44 and the highlights, there were really two elements that helped us to achieved this growth. First was the continued good customer response to the improved product offer that we put in 12 months ago. And if you remember, this helped us in our second half of '07.</p>
          <p>Now we're continuing to evolve the offer and we're very pleased with a customer acceptance of the changes we're making. The second factor in December for our Christmas period was that we positioned an initiatives on specific seasonal Christmas items and lines across departments and stores that resulted in above average increases and helped our profit for the month.</p>
          <p>We've also had indications that our new marketing program Kmart where good times start is helping to improve the customer's perception of the brand. It has really been three years since Kmart has had any branding message on what the brand was about. Also, in December, our Kmart Tyre &amp; Auto continued to perform to plan.</p>
          <p>Now to slide 46 on the outlook.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>On the outlook, there's still a lot to do with Kmart. We're confident, we are evolving and improving the product offer is strategically correct. And will result in present customers spending more with us and will start to attract new customers. We know plan to focus on adding elements to improve our customer experience. We will be improving the customer service and we're working on elements to improve the shopping experience.</p>
          <p>And we plan to continue our refurbishing program. We completed seven stores in the last six months and we are confident, we have the proper format was receiving good customer response to the changes we've made. We plan to start 19 more refits in the upcoming months. And we're also looking at a more aggressive store-opening program.</p>
          <p>Regarding the operation of the business, we plan over the next 90 days to integrate the former retail support units back into Kmart, allowing Kmart to perform as a free-standing business. Our people are confident about a business plan and feel good about Kmart. Our people are starting to receive positive comments about their -- from the customers on Kmart.</p>
          <p>In closing, the there's still a lot to do but we're proceeding according to plan and I feel the plan is sound. Thank you. Turn it over to Stewart.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Larry. Wesfarmers resources financial performance is presented in slide 37. Operating revenue at 530 million was 9.7% below the corresponding period last year. Earnings before interest and taxes at 112 million was 33% lower than last year. This reduction in EBIT was expected and is due to lower export metallurgical coal prices, a higher exchange rate, an increase in tonnage-related costs resulting from ongoing infrastructure constraints, partially offset by a lower standard rebate due to the lower rolling 12-month weighted average coal price.</p>
          <p>Coal production for the period was slightly down when compared to last year, due to wet weather during December at Curragh, a reduced demand from Verve Energy as a result of maintenance and upgrades at the Muja Power Station in mild winter in WA, and lower production from Bengalla due to ongoing infrastructure constraints. Our coal mines continue to operate faithfully.</p>
          <p>Slide 38, highlights for the division. We continue to experience strong market fundamentals and customer demand. The export marketplace has tightened, with significantly rising stock prices over the last three or four months.</p>
          <p>At Bengalla, a modified development consent approval for mining the 1-tonne outfit was granted in November 2007. We continued feasibilities into expanding both the Curragh and Bengalla mine. In January, a major flood impacted our Curragh mine, with sales forecast as a result being reduced to 6.1 to 6.5 million tones of export for the year ending 30th of June. And we are continued to experience ongoing monsoonal rain events.</p>
          <p>While the flood had a significant impact on the Curragh mine, a major crisis was averted due to a first-class team effort by our management and workers to mobilize equipment and protected the mine.</p>
          <p>During the period, the division had a name change from Coal, to Resources. Looking at the Resources Division outlook, there is a strong market outlook for the division. The export marketplace continues to tighten, with strong customer demand, and ongoing infrastructure constraints continuing to impact the supply side response. As a result, stock prices are increasing.</p>
          <p>Coal price negotiations are expected to be aggressive over the next few months, and we'll see increased structure constraints will be ongoing high manage costs for the Curragh and Bengalla mines; 560,000 tones of carryover tonnage at Curragh is estimated for Q4 2007-08.</p>
          <p>During the year, PCI will form a higher percentage of our sales mix, but will return to normal percentages in next financial year. And as previously noted, exports of metallurgical coal from our Curragh mine are expected to be in the range of 6.1 to 6.5 for this financial year. This reduction in volume is due to the impact of flooding in January.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Stewart. And good afternoon, everyone. The earnings before amortization for the Insurance Division increased by 12.7% to 71 million for the half. This half included a full six months contribution from OAMPS and Crombie Lockwood, whereas the previous six-month period only included two months from OAMPS.</p>
          <p>The performance of our underwriting businesses were affected by competitive pressures in commercial lines, and an increase in claims as a result of the severe weather event. The net earned loss ratio for the period increased by 7.5 points.</p>
          <p>Operating activity in all regions have performed to plan and experienced growth, which resulted in a significant increase in the contribution of breaking to the division. The brokering margin is more reflect -- brokering margin over the last six months, is more reflective of the normalized margins for this business. More data on the financials are provided in Page 64 of the information packet.</p>
          <p>Turning to highlights, as noted a number of severe weather events were experienced during the half, particularly in New Zealand and along the east coast of Australia. Year-to-date, we had retained losses in excess of A$20 million, as a result it's storm in Gippsland, New Zealand, Lismore, the New South Wales storms in Sydney were also quite significant events for us.</p>
          <p>The wetter weather has also had an impact on claims in commercial motor classes. These events are characteristic of the La Ni&#xF1;a weather cycle, which tends to affect both New Zealand and the east coast of Australia.</p>
          <p>WFI had a solid result for the half and good results from crop insurance offset some of the losses from the wetter weather. The brokering activity experienced underlying growth in revenue and earnings before the contribution of any bolt-on acquisitions. We undertook three acquisitions of insurance brokers during the half, MIV Insurance Brokers in Queensland, Mahony, Trendall &amp; Jack in Auckland and Kate Johnson Insurance Brokers in the UK. The integration of our OAMPS and Crombie Lockwood are now complete and the portfolio transfer of the AOOL business within OAMPS has now been completed.</p>
          <p>Turning to the outlook, we are seeing premium rates stabilized in some classes. However, many short-tail commercial classes are currently unprofitable. Profitability in underwriting will remain challenging if the La Ni&#xF1;a weather pattern persists. We would expect the combined operating ratio for our underwriting activity to move towards and stay around the high 90s during this period. We have undertaken a number of measures to improve the performance of Lumley New Zealand and this has resulted in changes in management, a head count reduction program and change to underwriting that is starting to improve results.</p>
          <p>The outlook for our breaking operations is to continue growth in all regions and we continue to investigate bolt-on acquisitions made on our investment criteria and we have a number of prospects in all regions.</p>
          <p>I will now hand it over to Olivier.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Rob. Good afternoon everyone. On slide 45 in summary of industrial safety performance. The operating revenue for the third time has increased by 10.7% and earnings before interest and tax increased by 20% to 61 million. The return in capital incurred increased to 16.9% which is a significant improvement on the 13.7% recorded last year.</p>
          <p>For the next slide turning to highlights underlying these results. The increase in revenue reflects growth in all our businesses, as well as the addition of the Bullivants' business which was acquired in December '06 and which transitioned smoothly into our division. We reported trend growth in all businesses operating in WA, which reflects the trends of the Resources sector. Our businesses have recorded improvement in New Zealand, while the market conditions remain very competitive in New South Whales, Victoria, and in South Australia.</p>
          <p>The 20% improvement in earnings result from the growth in the operating revenue, and also ongoing benefits of the business restructuring we initiated two years ago. In <mark type="inaudible" />, the performance has improved in New Zealand as did the combined Australian specialty businesses, with the inclusion of a full six months of Bullivants' earnings.</p>
          <p>We also derived some good benefits from the continued development of our global sourcing capabilities, as well as from the implementation of our business improvement initiative. This color of supply chain and very good performance, as well as our sales and marketing capabilities, which has our contract and pricing -- our range of products and services including business. You'll find more details on those initiatives in the information pack.</p>
          <p>A significant improvement in return on capital, reflects both the increased earnings and the benefits of our ongoing capital management initiatives. At the end of December '07, our rolling 12 months capital employed was slightly lower than last year, despite the addition of the Bullivants business.</p>
          <p>If I now turn to the outlook for the division on slide 47. While market conditions are expected to remain mixed in the second half with continued demand from resources and infrastructure in WA and Queensland, but subdued trading performance in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia as well as New Zealand.</p>
          <p>Our businesses will continue to be facing strong competition, as well as a scarcity of skilled labor. However, we expect the division to deliver satisfactory growth in the period 30th June by leveraging stronger foundations and through an ongoing focus on business improvement initiatives, customer service and customer growth, including acquisition opportunities. Thank you, I now pass it over to Ian.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Olivier. Slide 49 shows the significant increases in revenues from both our chemicals and fertilizer businesses in the first half compared with half one 2007. Higher chemicals revenue is generated through good volumes in most business at higher pricing and the comparative period together with the full month's revenue from Australian Vinyls. Fertilizer volumes were significantly higher than the same time in the previous year and in fact were higher than in any first half result over the last 10 years. There's a graph of fertilizer sales in your pack, slide 83, which shows fertilizer volumes for the last five years.</p>
          <p>This higher fertilizer volume is driven by the positive grain outlook, as well as customers taking advantage of marketing programs to purchase earlier than normal, at a time of escalating global fertilizer prices. Also in your pack is a graph indicating substantial increases in global fertilizer prices at slide 84. This greater fertilizer volume, together with high unit prices, delivered the strong revenue growth for our fertilizer business.</p>
          <p>Total earnings for the first half were strong, reflecting these higher sales volumes together with the first months -- four months of contribution from the Australian Vinyls acquisition. Increased earnings were also assisted by generally lower unit costs due to improved production for the most chemical clients. These higher earnings together with improved inventory management resulted in an increase in the rolling 12-month return on capital, notwithstanding the additional capital from the AN expansion and AV acquisition. Pleasingly, the decrease now in our Lost-Time Injury Frequency rate is shown and it's a credit to all our staff.</p>
          <p>CSBP commissioned a new nitric acid plant, our major component of the first stage of the AN expansion project earlier this month, is now manufacturing increased quantities of ammonium nitrate solution. This product is being used in the manufacture of liquid fertilizers, substituting imports and also an increase to ammonium nitrate fuel production through CSBP's current profile which has been debottleneck to assist with meeting customer demand until the new profile comes online which is expected in mid-May. This lighter than expected commissioning is due to lower than projected labor productivity and equipment delays. All of these factors have brought about a higher final estimated project cost of around $400 million.</p>
          <p>The outlook for all of our chemical products, including PVC, remains strong. Demand for fertilizers in the second half will be dependent on the seasonal break. We would expect that good opening rains will encourage growers to take advantage of relatively high grain prices by seeding traditional acreage. Under these conditions we should see full-year fertilizer sales return to more traditional normal levels and the sales in the second half will be offset in part due to the higher first half sales.</p>
          <p>Work continues on both the sodium cyanide and QNP debottlenecking, both of which are on track to deliver higher production by the end of this calendar year. I'll hand it over to Tim Bult from Energy.</p>

      <speaker id="13">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ian. Slide 53 covers the Energy division performance for the half, and we delivered a 26% increase in earnings to $48 million earnings before interest and tax. The two main factors contributing to that improvement were firstly a six-month contribution from our new industrial gas business, Coregas and also solid performances from our other businesses.</p>
          <p>enGen was slightly above the previous corresponding period due to the input from some new projects. The allocated WA was broadly inline in terms of its earning contribution, Kleenheat was slightly below and that was driven by increased supply energy cost and I'll talk about energy costs a little later on. And Wesfarmers LPG was slightly above the results -- the same result last year and that was despite its production reducing by 12.3% that you will see on the slide there.</p>
          <p>Its reduced production was caused by the LPG content in the Dampier to Bunbury pipeline which feeds the plant. It reduced from 1 ton per terajoule to 0.88 tons per terajoule. However, the 0.88 tons per terajoule is very much in line with the figure that applied for the half ending December 2006 where it was 0.89 tons per terajoule, and that movement really reflects the volatility of the supply arrangements under which that business is currently operating. However, higher LPG prices meant it delivered a slightly higher earnings result.</p>
          <p>Just finishing on slide 53, our safety performance in terms of Lost Time Injury Frequency rate went up slightly. That was driven by some lost time injuries that we incurred in Coregas since acquisition and that's an area focus for the business going forward in terms of improvement.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 54, highlights for the half.  The integrated L&amp;G project in Western Australia, the 175 ton per day plant, $138 million investment, which involved three of our businesses.  It made very good progress.  Some details are provided in Page 91 of the information pack, including a picture of the plant under construction.  The Wesfarmers LPG team has made really good progress with the implementation of that prior construction.  The Kleenheat team has made excellent progress with regards to the downstream distribution infrastructure and the refueling facilities that are going to fuel the heavy-duty vehicle market and the team at enGen has made good progress with the two power stations in the goldfields.</p>
          <p>In the November briefing update, I mentioned that the project experienced time and budget pressure.  I'm pleased to report that the project remains on budget, however, we've incurred some delays throughout the summer and we now are expecting commissioning of the project in May as compared to late March as earlier expected.  However, we have commercial arrangements in place that mitigate much of the cost impact of that and the project remains well paused and remains on budget.</p>
          <p>In terms of industrial gas supply projects, we've made steady progress with the liquefier at Port Canberra, in fact that was nearing completion at the end of the half and has subsequently completed. And on the acetylene project, that is now well advanced and is expected to be complete in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>The businesses have experienced record energy prices and the graph on page 89 of the information pack provides more detail. If you look at that, you'll see that Saudi Contract Price, the international benchmark for LPG, the average for this six-month period ending December 2007 was $658 per ton for propane, compared to $504 for the previous corresponding period.  That's a 30% increase.  That's had the earnings impact -- positive earnings impact, I mentioned on Wesfarmers LPG, but it has caused some margin pressure on Kleenheat and contributed to its slightly lower result compared to the period last year.</p>
          <p>Throughout the half, we reached agreement with our partners to divest our interest in the Unigas partnership, and that sale went to completion on the 2nd of January.  Profit from the sale was not accounted for in the first half due to completion on the 2nd of January.</p>
          <p>Our new industrial gas business, integration of Coregas, was a ten-month process and was completed in the first half.  All of work was involved in integrating the business in areas of reporting, IT, human relations, policies and procedures, and integrating the business.  Following that, we are now looking at the long-term. Performance has been slightly below our expectations.  However, we remain very positive in regard to the growth prospects of that business and then looking at the long-term, following conclusion of the integration, we've sought to appoint a new General Manager, Tim Whiteside, who's had experience at BOC and within the Brambles Group and is well positioned to take that business forward.</p>
          <p>I'll move now to slide 55, the outlook for the division.  We'll see towards the year-end of Coregas -- full-year contribution from Coregas, the first one that we've had, which will be positive in terms of the contribution to earnings. However, our division's earnings do remain very much dependent on international LPG prices.  We've seen oils approaching and just going over a $100 a barrel, so we don't anticipate any real change in terms of strong prices going forward. And we remain exposed to LPG feed rates.</p>
          <p>LPG export sales in the second half will be in line with the previous corresponding period, and we will have lower export sales -- sorry, lower autogas sales from our Unigas divestment.  Contributions from the LNG project will occur in the next financial year.  I will hand over to Gene to cover other businesses.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tim. Very briefly, slide 57. Total earnings up due largely to the Coles dividend, I mentioned. Gresham Private Equity &#x2013; Fund 2, with strong revaluations offsetting lesser revaluations in the warehouse property trust.</p>
          <p>The breakdown on the next slide is really a reconciliation. You'll note the corporate overhead, up a bit, progressively we'll see that some of the Coles cost move into that segment and finance costs really up significantly with a larger group at $245 million. Gretchen Private Equity continuing good contribution through revaluations. The businesses as a portfolio, trading okay, some experiencing some difficult conditions and some achieving very good growth and two -- with two new investments and that those, the investments they will continue to flow to Wesfarmers earnings through revaluations.</p>
          <p>That all. Going back to Richard for the outlook.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Gene. Well, on outlook. Very quickly, then we'll move straight to questions. Outlook is in the coming period, is really to bring about the change. Mick, talked about at Coles and the team, well and truly onto that. As is Archie is involved within and <mark type="inaudible" /> has been kept informed. We will have some additional one-off transaction restructuring costs coming in the second half, it's too early for us to qualify that in a moment. We see all of the businesses continuing to try well and you've been given pretty good outlook commentary from each of the Divisional Managing Directors. Obviously, there will be an impact directly-indirectly, through higher interest rates and the cost associated with that and fuel price volatility in terms of a retailing businesses.</p>
          <p>The Cole price outlook is positive for the company and we'll no doubt impact certainly, in '08, '09 and the last quarter of this year. And as Gene indicated earlier, we will be refinancing $4 billion prior to October.</p>
          <p>So, with that, happy to take any questions. Yes, just bear with us.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't break down the difference, Shaun, as you know, but the couple of things that work there. One is the, as we say, concentration in Queensland is our Liquor business impacted by the wet and wild weather. There's also a reporting quirk in there in that our Period 5 ended on the last Sunday in December and New Year's Eve, which is a key trading day for liquor, actually falls into our January period this year. So without confusing you with the accounting, the reason in effect of that in the --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just two more quick. Just the reason, I'm sorry, one for Gene, a reason for the lower tax rate. There appears to be the effective tax rate with a little lower this year vis-&#xE0;-vis the first half '08.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the couple of reasons for that. One is the, there was some tax-free income, for example, the dividend from Coles. And the other is we did have some adjustments when we finalized the matter that was ongoing with the ATO around capital gains tax.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I'm sorry, apology, just one back to Mick. Can you just talk about the competitive environment in supermarkets at the moment, and I am also -- I just refer back to a bit of history, whether the price war that went on in August, September, early this year actually was successful, or was that a bit of an unsuccessful venture?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in my view Shaun, price wars are never successful in retail. What you need to do is find better ways to offer value to customers. What I referred to earlier is that, with the ownership issue behind us, with our ability to take a long-term perspective on the Wesfarmers ownership, we can get back to rebuilding this business from the ground up in gross sales, the right way. So, what I refer to them stabilizing margins and reduced high or and low activity does not mean that there is any lessening in the competitive environment. It just means that we're a little bit more sensible in our approach.</p>

Keith's identification of 288 million run rate in trading; for simplification, if I think back to August, September of last year when we saw you guys, I thought that the 335 was going to be realized over fiscal year '09.

          <p>The 288 was the per annum run rate at the time of the acquisition, and for the, I mentioned that we've in fact closed that program within Coles. We don't refer to simplification anymore. Part of the 97 million that was still to go was in factory initiatives that were more about centralization rather than the approach that we're taking with, obviously, divisional structures. So we're still very confident we'll achieve the balance over the timeframe that was spoken about, but it'll just be done through some different areas of cost savings  than would have been identified in the Coals program.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thanks. Next question, can I ask <mark type="inaudible" /> question Richard. Release 4 nobody wants to talk about it. It's all about replenishment. When is it going to work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Greg. Release four, obviously follows release three and I talked about it's been by each time we have release four operating in three pilot stores as we speak, and that would be changed to be got through particularly as the next couple of quarters, we'll be going very carefully at implementing release four. But it's working successfully in three pilot stores, but as you know Greg, release four and the implementation of orders and stock replenishment is a significant change to any retail business, and particularly one like Coles, which has been through a lot of change over the last year or two in supply chain and system. So we'll be going at that in a very measured way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, completion is till out in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, 2013 is a long way away. The good thing about release four is that you can implement store by store. Our view, at the moment, is that we'll get through the next two or three quarters of significant restructuring and change at Coles. We'll continue to run the pilot; we'll make sure we that we take full advantage of the implementation of release three and then we'll judge the pace and speed of rollout of release four.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And strictly have you fully implemented a category management structure such that you have category managers sitting over promotions and buying and private label in each of the key categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there was that structure put in place I think back a couple of years now, but as part of the review that we're currently going through. We will refine that structure, if you like, and in particular ensure that we break down some of the functional sidelines now that it previously existed in the organization. For instance, split between merchandise and marketing and we'll make sure the merchants and category managers have all the resources available to them that they need to get their job done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Richard one quick one for you. Has the Board reset the benchmark for which your ROA hurdle will be determined?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, we actually have a planning conference, executive planning conference next week and we'll be visiting that and talking to the Board about it later in the year. We'll set our target but then as you know we set the divisional targets around how various divisions are currently performing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If it's up to you your <mark type="inaudible" />  not going to be that top quintile any more, is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's under review.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a final question for Gene, you know the [indiscernible swap market with the numbers of over seven-year, five and ten-year money swaps is like 140 to 190 basis points including transaction cost. Should we be expecting 10% for your refinancing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't expect it to be that high but we've already locked in some of our interest rate position over the last few several months, so you could factor that in. And depending on the markets the margins are varying pretty widely so it will depend on where we finish up tapping the most effective markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Greg.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Michael Phillips of UBS. Please go ahead Michael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, Richard, I guess following on from that maybe for Gene, what sort of percentage of your debt gets hedged and for how long?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't give details on that but the overall, we're typically putting in place three to five year hedges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any idea on percentage or what you traditionally like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're moving towards where we want to be and we'll do that progressively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if there are not any particular variations in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, Richard, sitting through that you get a sense of how complex this business is now probably with about ten mini presentations there. I guess how're you going, you and Gene, getting around all those Board meetings business by business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's been pretty good actually. We had Board meetings in February of all the businesses and one of the things about the way we operate the company is the Board papers are very complete. Obviously Coles and Target and Kmart have got some work to do to get to the levels we would require of the business and the Board meetings give us a very thorough understanding of what's going on in each business. We only do them, we do five a year, we recorded Board meeting around a cycle and then a budget meeting. And it is a good opportunity for us to see what's going on in the business as well as getting the monthly reports. It's fine. We've got in place a very good team of people running those businesses. We're strengthening that group of people as Gene said and I think the model works very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, just on Kmart maybe Larry could help us out but he's made about as much money in five weeks -- he's made more money in five weeks than he did all of last year. He made a reasonable profit in the second half of fiscal '07, should we expect to be able to beat that number in the coming six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Larry answer that one -- obviously there's the significant seasonality in it and we're not in the business of giving forecast but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>December is the month you've got to -- in retail you've got to be right for the year and we were right and had a good performance. There's a lot of things going on right now in Kmart, we're doing the strategic review so, we've got to see what happens over the next 60 days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, maybe I can ask Launa and Larry, were the EBIT margins and EBIT contributions higher for that five week period than the PCP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We were -- hi. We were comfortable with ours and exactly basically were we thought we would end up. So yes, we were very comfortable with them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Larry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had a good December compared to last year because you remember last year we were -- a lot of changes were going on at Kmart. So we're again very pleased with the result in December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, if -- Michael, obviously you can't get carried away with the five weeks, that's the bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right. I understand. Just I'm going to get this one, it's going to be a hard one to answer too. But you look at the merger documents, I guess you guys didn't really have anything to do with that, but you look at the pro forma balance sheet and your inventory for this period it is 600 million ahead of where the pro forma balance sheet would have been and goodwill's about a billion dollars more. Is there anything obvious there that I'm missing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're for different periods?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a <mark type="inaudible" /> that goes on seasonally across the group, from one six month period to another, and there with -- in terms of goodwill there's been some adjustments at the transaction -- at the time of transaction, there was some adjustments within Coles prior to the transaction and we make some further adjustments, for example, we advertised some software and we did some fair value accounting. So, that will be the main components to generate differences.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and Richard, final one I guess, Wesfarmers really cuts its dividend, I think, you go back 10 years before you've seen a significant cut in dividend like this. I know there was the ARG franking credits in there, but you now look like you're going to pay $2, is that a number for the full year? Whereas before, I think, you said at least $2 for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, I'd stick with at least $2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I mean, now the interim dividend, I think, is very understandable given what we did last year with ARG.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I guess, I was just wondering how hard it was to sort of make that decision, given that you don't normally cut the dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it wasn't that hard.</p>

          <p>We give you guys enough advice on how to do your jobs. I was wondering if you guys could give us a bit of advice this time, because, listening to the answers on a lot of the questions, hearing saying, "We're comfortable with the margin, and we're pleased," doesn't really help us a lot. The question I've got is, how in the heck are we supposed to know the impact of the seasonality of those five weeks has had on the underlying profit performance of Wesfarmers in this half? I mean, what we are supposed to do in trying to estimate or to form an opinion as to how the Cole s business is currently operating?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">

          <p>Yeah. David, I don't think I'm well-equipped to help you do your job -- but let me try and help that...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but comp first half was pretty ordinary. First half of Kmart was dreadful.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="a">

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second half, but this is the first half -- on first half, or five weeks on five weeks, and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you can -- okay. Well, Kmart certainly performed better under our ownership period than it did the previous period. But that is consistent with improvement in performance in Kmart over the last, over some months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay? So -- but, you have keep that all relative, and Target's performance has continued to be strong. On supermarkets, Mick summed it up pretty well. Yeah, we were -- it's very difficult for us in a short period of time to get a proper view of what's going on in supermarkets, but Mick and the team were generally pleased with the Christmas trading period, particularly the performance in terms of getting stock into stores, and meeting our customer expectations. But, I mean, the numbers we've put forward, David, you've also got the comp stores numbers for five weeks. They are relatively modest compared to, <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so there is significant seasonality in the numbers you've seen.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the comp preferred in liquor , I mean it said 2% and liquor's gone backwards, and then I think it -- does that include -- what does that include, that 2%? Does that include Bi-Lo or the non-converted stores or converted stores? What does that actually include?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Mick answer it. It does include Bi-Lo.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That 2% is all in, so it's food and liquor and includes stores that have always been Coles the converted Bi-Lo, that are now Coles, and the unconverted Bi-Lo stores.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">

          <p>Okay. So, that's been a nice, little pickup then, because you had both -- I can't even remember, but it used to confuse me so much what you used to include in the previous number but...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Richard, on the <mark type="inaudible" />, that's obviously -- I mean the big issues in this report result look like -- I'm trying to understand the seasonality of this result. And then obviously there's a lot of concern about the <mark type="inaudible" />. Now, James said that he's confident and comfortable with being able to do it, and particularly rolling out the 4 billion, can he elaborate? There is a lot of market concern about, number one; he's got to be able to do it. And secondly, at what rate he's going to do it. But can you give -- can you talk about how he's actually going to do it, inside of those markets, and it is a pretty important issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim? And he'll talk about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. It's very important. We gave guidance on some of the various markets that we would tap last November. I can just say that we are well advanced in our preparations, so that we can move quite rapidly across a range of markets. I can't be more specific than that for, among other reasons -- statutory reasons. You can't flag that you're particularly going into particular markets at the time. We are seeing some markets that are quite illiquid, others that are liquid, but costly. You've seen the kinds of margins that have been announced on various transactions in the last few weeks and months and they run from probably 1% to 2%. So, we look at that component and you look at interest rates and we would expect to swap any debt back into Australian rates the way we want. We won't be speculating on the currency and trying to take advantage of say, low interest rates in the US. We have already swapped a significant portion of the risk into let's say three to five year cover. And then liquidity will drive the most logical markets we can go into and we're looking at some going into acquire the equity, so there's various hybrid structures and convertibles and things of that nature being worked on, as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's always important to note that all those markets that's in some are liquid, some are illiquid. It's important to note that we are investment grade and we've got exceptionally good relationships with our banks and it's not a matter of if, it's when and how.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You're going to be &#x2013; presumably, after Christmas, I think you always said that you wouldn't touch any of the Coles before Christmas. Such an important main period and then you're talking about how probably after Christmas Day, now you're going to really start looking at the restructuring in the next couple of quarters. How do you expect to go to manage the restructuring whilst not disrupting businesses to peak in liquor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mick might want to add to this, though. It's -- firstly, I think within Target and Kmart and Office Works, in some ways, the people are rejoicing. But they've got control of their businesses back and it will require some work. Particularly, Larry's got some work to do on supply chain and what's going on there as well but they're all rejoicing that, I think. I'm going to say for max business -- on the Coles businesses, one comment I'd make about the businesses, is that I think it's an extremely resilient business. I think the people in it have proven their resilience and one of the things that we're pleased with since we've acquired businesses is a number of the people in the business, they are focused on doing what's right for Coles and what's right for customers. So, there is absolutely appetite in that business for what's coming. And Mick has been very up-front with them on what is coming in terms of restructuring. They all understand it. They understand that costs will be coming out of the support functions. The focus will be moving to the stores. There's a lot of things going on. But my sense is that there's a real appetite for it and an expectation that it will happen the sooner the better. So -- and looking at the turmoil or the disruption to the business through the latter part or most of last year, most of calendar 2007 and these results have been posted notwithstanding that. And so, as I say, I think resilience is the right word. And the Store Managers I've met are just getting on with it and happily so. But Mick, you might want to add something.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't, certainly reinforce all of that. Let's just add I wouldn't underestimate the importance of the Wesfarmers business division, which will equally give Coles autonomy to get on and run the business. One real effect of that is that we are &#x2013; we've therefore put the business in control of the amount of change we're carrying in the business, particularly there is corporate functions like supply chain and IT. We have significantly reduced through resequencing and stopping a lot of activity, the amount of change which all flows through and impact on the stores. I would take it back to the discussion about R4, also it's another reason why we are going to go very carefully through some of those significant initiatives. But I would also say that the reason I have called out, the extent of the organizational change over the next two quarters is because it will be a significant change and we'll still have to manage it in an operational business.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good after noon, Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Craig.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just firstly, I would like to understand the food and liquor performance a little bit better. Maybe you can comment qualitatively on how that business is performing now. Your comments would suggest that you're seeing an improvement in the sales growth relative to industry growth, comment on ASEA market share performance development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Craig. By the way, for everyone, thanks for that. You kept the questions brief. We've got a whole lot of questions queued, so we'll keep questions and responses as brief as we can. Now, I wouldn't make that call. At the moment I'd say we've summed it up pretty well that we're not unhappy with what sort of happened. But where we stand back, we're unhappy with where the business is at. We've got a lot to do and it's fundamental restructure that Mick's outlined that we need to do. And our competitive position is not strong and it's been going backwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Secondly, it relates to a question earlier, maybe if I express it a different way. At the 16th of August briefing, there was an overhead reduction slide and it said the cost-savings achieved to date was at $100 million. That number in the current presentation is now $288 million. So is it safe to say that between August 2007 and now we've had an extra $188 million of cost come out of the Coles Business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Keith answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The important part of that is the -- all of those numbers are run rate numbers, so we will see the benefits of those changes coming through. And the 288 number was based on a -- an audit, if you like, of the Coles simplification issues and that was the run rate number at the time of acquisition from those initiatives.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess the more important question on that is, how much of that has been -- being reinvested or what is -- what are we really looking at here is 288, a meaningful number that we can see in the profitability of the filmmaking division going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mick might like to comment as well. But certainly a lot of those initiatives were driven, and this is the fundamental difference I guess between the old structure and the new structure. Lot of those initiatives were driven centrally and the decisions on reinvestment aren't necessarily related to those simplification programs, they keep on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to reinforce Keith's point about run rate savings or so. In order to see them come through into the business, Craig, obviously there's a period of 12 months and through that period of 12 months the run rate savings will translate into real savings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Referring to the coal division quickly, two questions there. One is the outlook for the cost growth in Australian coal production, do you expect cost growth to accelerate or decelerate compared to what we've seen over the last 12 months? And secondly, what fundamentalist would you save to volumes as opposed to these weather disruptions that you've had recently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks Craig. In terms of cost, I think over the last 12 months or so we're seeing a lowering of cost pressures in terms of what we're seeing in our businesses. I think that experience is similar to the common spread to the rest of the coal industry at the moment where the rapid escalation in cost over the last three or four years are starting to slowdown. So hopefully that's a longer-term trend but it's too early yet to say that that's going to happen next year. In terms of the weather and the major weather event that we've been having into Curragh, is that over? Well, is the monsoonal rain over I think is probably the key issue there. We've started to have monsoonal rain from December. It impacted Curragh's performance in December. We had the major flooding event in Central Queensland in -- at the back end of January. In February we've had certainly a lot of rain in the McHarg (76.45) arrear and a lot of flooding and that's impacted mines throughout the Bowen Basin and either although it's pretty too early to tell. But we're hopeful that we've seen the end of the weather.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, but what about port and rail infrastructure bottlenecks, are they easing at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well clearly if you look at the ports up and down the coast, in terms of Gladstone, which is where we export for Perth. We're seeing -- there's sufficient port capacity in Perth. But in terms of rail capacity getting coal from the mines down to the ports, that's where the constraint is. And we're seeing that constraint continue into next year and we think it will be about 90%, in terms of meeting contractual capacity. Looking further south for Bengalla at Newcastle, I don't think there will be any appreciable improvement in the situation at Bengalla and therefore Newcastle until 2010, when the new port is constructed with MCIG [Management for Continuous Improvement and Growth] and there are the further upgrades PWCS [Port Waratah Coal Services] Circles at that time. So we think there will be ongoing infrastructure constraints in New South Wales and in Queensland for at least in the case of New South Wales in the next couple years and in the case Gladstone at least next year, maybe even into the following year.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Phil Kimber of Goldman Sachs, JBWere. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I had a question around the Food and Liquor business as well. You mentioned that profitability was better than last year albeit the halfway period. Just in terms of color around that was the majority of that improvement really a result of the cost savings that you're talking about currently relegate them to begin? Because it also like, you come to 2%, inflation is 2%, so you really didn't have any volume come forth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With Richard's response earlier around the market share question which while improvement from new sales growth is 2%, is good progress and we still have a long way to go to get back to where we want to be in respect to sales growth. The second thing to add a bit of color to the result, I referred to, obviously little bit of sales growth that helps, I referred to stabilizing margins. The operating -- there has been some improvement underlying operating cost, but there are so many swings and that where about surrender some of the closure accounts and how we account through that five week period, but it's not really worth commenting further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you alluded to further cost in the second half. I wasn't sure that if you were really referring to one-off type cost in personnel changes or are you talking about there things like improving, increasing labor into the store, because perhaps it was being under invested in four things like, you know, turning over the fresh food faster to improve the quality, which comes at a cost initially. Are they the sorts of things you're talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All of those things, Phil, right and exist, we have, over a period of time now, we've made a significant investment in being more competitive and offering better value to our customers. We've put more labor into the stores particularly through the Christmas period, which did help in handling that peak that I referred to earlier. And we'll be certainly driving hard at continuing to improve the freshness of the product. But they're not the, sort of, one-off costs referred to in the second half. That will be more related to the restructuring that we referred to. And we'll be able to comment more fully on those amounts next time.</p>

      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, I'll just be brief. Just a quick question on Cole. You mentioned in the pack that there was a volume issue in the fourth quarter. Can you just explain that a little bit further? Is that, basically, you've got a contract at that lower price and that will be honored?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's essentially what it is. Normally our contracts go from April to March each year and then from first of April we reset the price going forward. But as a result of the ongoing infrastructure constraints, there will be some tonnage into the fourth quarter, which will be priced at existing prices as they sit at the moment. And that will have an impact in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just in terms of the debt increase, as, I mean, we're certainly seeing a lot of information coming through in relation to the increase of financing of debt. But how that transfers into the economy, you've mentioned that you're -- preparing for a more cautious outlook toward target. What time -- what preparations are you doing within Bunnings as well as? Are you anticipating a pull back in comp sales growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we flagged in the -- I think, I flagged in the discussion and hence more than attractive, we clearly threats to being able to barrel along that sort of constant growth rates we've been achieving. But we are confident of continued earnings in sales growth. And in terms of preparations, I'm not sure that's quite the way to think of it. We've got strong programs that reinvested in our stores and we've got strong programs around what we're doing in merchandising and what we're doing in service to lift our sales and our earnings performance. We also have a bit of a renewed focus on cost. So that we can continue to support lower prices for our customer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of very quick ones. Just on the Curragh production costs; you're saying there that your cash production cost per ton was down 2% in the half, and I think in the first quarter, it was up 7. I'm just wondering, is there anything peculiar happening there, or we are actually seeing cash production cost per ton coming down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it did level off in the last 12 months. And the only thing and issue that happened over that period of time is that we're continuing to develop Curragh North, and with commission, they can rail on -- coming from Curragh North down to Curragh, so that had a positive impact on costs for the last 12 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Stewart, just on the carryover, is that going to go in '09, or is that just purely in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think most of it will be cleared out by the end of the fourth quarter. There will be some carryover from contract for the -- from 1st of July through end of June. There'll be a small tonnage that'll be in the July, August period, but we think that'll be quite small.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly, that's our number one priority, is to minimize our carryover tonnage. And in the current market, I think we'll get some wins in that area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just one final one; just you're saying 90% of contractual for the rail? You've obviously got a lot more than 7 million tons contracted there...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but our contract with QR is about 7.5.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so assuming you've got 90%, there was no other issues, what would be the maximum that you could get to an export sales, tonnage for '09?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="28" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just a couple of brief ones. In a stock level, I think Mick made the comment that it would improve on last year. It's still the observation of stores that it's quite dreadful. How do you get that up in the medium-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks Grant. I think consistent with my overall comments. In course of all the bad improvement, we not say that we are where we mean to be and how we're getting it up in the short-term and how we've dealt with the -- through the critical Christmas trading period. If we go back if you -- a few periods, supply chain was separate, I&amp;C was separate and different function were separate and change was occurring in the business in a way that was impacting on the store in an uncoordinated way. So, we've already moved to make sure that supply chain nicely are being integrated into the business, that will be the strength of the Wesfarmers business division model as we go forward. It means we have one change program going into the stores. In the lead-up to Christmas, for instance, or in daily telecoms with store managers from across the states so that we can jump immediately on the issues as they arose. I would back that off to weekly now but that's how we stay in touch with exactly what's happening in the stores. We're putting in place, as a single-business division would, consistent measures across the business so that we can measure and assist where we are, and not have to get up and down functional silos to get there. I would say in response to your comment, more order we concerned, we recognized, we've got a long way to go. I think last time I said that very few of our stores, where we would like them to be. I think now, most of the time, the majority of our stores, getting close to where we would like them to be, but we still have stores that are unacceptable and we still have a degree of inconsistency which is not acceptable.</p>

Ben, Mick and the team, Terry Bowen and the team alluding the change at the moment, actually Norman and I involved in it, but they don't waiting for Ian to arrive and we've got a lot to achieve over the next few months and Mick will be leading that and we look forward to telling you what &#x2013; in the breaking down, I feel where we're at, but there will be a lot we get done over the next couple of months. Ian was always going to arrive in May.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and my last question is for Gene, actually and I'm just wondering what your expectations are for debt markets over the next six months, both here and offshore, particularly given recent debt rolls, it seems like they are like a <mark type="inaudible" /> and alike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, our expectations are that we'll get the kinds of rates that are investment grade as corporate does on fairly large amounts of debt as to just where markets will go, there are some signs that liquidity is improving, but we've seen a lot of turbulence and a lot of surprises. So I'm not giving any forecast on that the overall debt market.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Shaun Cousins of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Shaun.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Just regarding the fair value adjustment to the provision relating to the Coles acquisition, I think it increased by 390 million. By what time will you release this provision and what does this provision relate to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The provision adjustments came about in a number of areas. There was some right-back company profits, some adjustments on software and some other contracts, so some of those will amortize over a few years and some will run out probably five plus years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, doesn't demand as you release distribution doesn't exactly support your earnings growth in the coming years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the release of provisions, the provisions that I can get relief they get paid out by the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, you just get a better paid off what's related to cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, for some time, but the effect reduces over time as those are amortized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And we should be watching that effect if we have that adjustment to your provision line moves just to see how this release comes through, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think over time you'll find its pretty small in the scheme of things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it will certainly help your earnings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just the restructuring one-offs that you're talking about coming up in the second half '08; are they in addition or are they related to this provision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There will be additional structuring one-offs in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are they in addition to the increase that -- the provision that you've taken?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, they are.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess. Well -- all right. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Martin Yuel of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Martin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, a question for Richard. I guess one of your jobs in the last couple of months has been having some conversations with coal suppliers. So, I was wondering if you would comment on your observations and whether you sort of perceive a margin difference between yourselves and Woolworth's based on supplier costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't comment on that. All I'd say is that the conversations I've had with suppliers have been that they're very supportive of what we try to do with the business and want to be engaged and assist us. But as I said that to all our competitors, but, well, we really look forward to having a very positive engagement with suppliers where they can help us in getting things in our stores more efficiently and provide a better offer for our customers; we'll work very closely with them. And you know, we know they're a very important part of the business and we'll be treating them with that respect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just intuitively you'd think that, you know that would look at you taking over and think that this is a great opportunity to sort of restore some of the imbalance. Are you getting any positive commentary like that or is it just a case of you're just another corporate that they deal with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the extent have been very positive at the moment, because they really want us to succeed, I think. They probably do want some balance. But you know, sort of, we all know suppliers are also in business for their own purposes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you don't want to comment on the prices that you can see this is what your market intelligence tells you that worth its getting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not at this date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Sundu Benson of BT Financial Group. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I've just got a question on the retail performance. And I know it's not clear but it seems that things are going quite well. I'm just a bit confused now about comments made around the cash flow and there being some kind of inventory issue that needed to be resolved. Can you just comment on that, whether that -- you know, there's any inventory excess, or are you short on inventory and need to make investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The issue really was a timing issue. If you think about the date we acquired Coles, which is the 23 of November, then there's a build-up of inventory for Christmas trading. And so we've got big cash flow, strong cash flow generation from those Coles businesses through that trading period. That's really what Gene is referring to it. So it was really timing. We picked the business up when there was a significant investment in inventory, and some of that was realized through the Christmas trading period, and that's generate cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, there's no inventory issues, is it, December 31? So we shouldn't expect any inventory write-down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're having a good look at all of that, but nothing of great magnitude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the inventory's related to the businesses that are within their typical vein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from David Whittaker of Southern Cross.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="29" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, guys, outstanding results; John Gillam from Donahue. If you keep this up, you're going to may look like a bear. So, I'm just wondering whether, if given the way the trade seems to be going, you're very optimistic on that. If the trade through plannings stipe materializes, is it possible that we could be looking at better than 11% <mark type="inaudible" /> within that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. Look, we're very cautious about the net EBIT margin at the trading of that margin, and grow it through greatly. We're students of the productivity, and we're driving more volumes, and hence, strong earnings growth through rewarding customers with better value. So we do looks to reward our customers with lower cost, in fact. And we know that on our price baskets, on our basket of goods, we're not contributing to inflation, we've had deflation in selling prices, so on our gross margin, they're all back up in our P&amp;L. As we look at the long-term, we see gross margins decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="29" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just on the trade improvements, what are the key strategies that you're saying having an effect there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we've done is take a very hard look at how best to look after the different types of trade customers. So we've developed our model for large delivered to site customers, and we're servicing them through trade PC, and we trying to get some good traction from these trade centers. And in our stores, where pickup is clearly attractive, and traders can take benefit of whatever they're working, we've got someone to help. And we're also working hard to pick up, what we do at that end of the store, and that's going to reward to provide some traction for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="29" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much, and good one, guys.</p>

          <p>Thank you, the next question is from Matthew McNee of Goldman Sachs JBWere. Please go ahead, Matthew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've got time for about two more questions, or something. People are going to race offside, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. This is just a quick one; just on the updated current hedging profile, obviously, you have an assumption about the long-term price beyond this year. Can you just remind us whether that's changed, what it is at the moment, just to make more sense of those numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I suppose the long-term view on coal prices is a little bit problematic at the moment when the coal prices set for this year. And once we accept those prices, we will be able to increase the hedging, particularly in the short term. So, we don't normally give our long-term estimates of coal prices or where that's heading.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now it's just for us to make any sense of this 68% hedge we need to know what that number is. Otherwise it's not of any use.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Matthew you can assume that those percentages are based on a pretty conservative outlook for coal prices, and that we, since those figures were put out we are continuing the hedging program, and we will be hedging as the prices firm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, no worries. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Matthew, just to help you a bit more, I mean a few years ago we were quickly reverting to the long-run average price for coke and coal, that we've moved that up a bit. But it's in tens of dollars, not, no a great amount over the last couple of years.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up. Your dividend reinvestment plan you've underwritten for 75% for the first half dividend. Any plan to continue that underwriting?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's quite possible that we will continue to underwrite, but we'll make those decisions as we progress depending on other capital initiatives and requirements of the Group.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="28" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you, it look -- are you of the view that you need to raise more equity and reduce your debt load over the next two or three years?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="a">
