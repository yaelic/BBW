      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 2011 was a year of solid operational performance for Merck. It was also a year in which we established a new leadership team and laid the foundation for further change at the company. Let me start with Slide 4 and the highlights of 2011.</p>
          <p>We delivered on the guidance that we shared with you earlier in the year. We reported &#x20AC;10.3 billion in revenue, which represents 11% growth over 2010. Excluding the effects of currencies and acquisitions, we generated 5% organic revenue growth in 2011, with solid contributions from all divisions. The underlying core operating results grew 9%, to &#x20AC;2.3 billion, representing a margin of 22.3%.</p>
          <p>These results reflect good operational performance in a challenging year. The major challenges for us were the softening economy in Europe, the issues associated with the Japanese earthquake, pricing pressures from healthcare austerity measures, and the challenges associated with executing the global integration of Merck Millipore. Despite these challenges and a significant amount of one-time costs, we effectively managed our business to solid profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Important in 2011 were the three bolt-on acquisitions we completed in Merck Millipore. We believe that this attractive growth in the Life Science Tools market, particularly with the assets we have at Millipore, will drive our business further when we add the products, services, and expertise of these companies to the strong portfolio we have already today.</p>
          <p>Recently, we implemented a new equity-based compensation system for the senior management of the company. This is the first time in the company's history that senior managers will have variable incentives tied to Merck stock. We believe that this will help to drive change at Merck further in aligning the interests of senior management team with the interests of shareholders.</p>
          <p>And finally, 2011 marked a year in which we started our transformation process. We hired new executives and senior management. We introduced new organizational structures and implemented a global versus local approach to managing the business.</p>
          <p>Many of you may have seen the press release that we issued a little over one week ago in which we announced an efficiency program across all regions and businesses. This marks the official start of our efficiency program. We intend to share additional details of this initiative at our Capital Markets Day on May 15.</p>
          <p>On Slide 5 I show three distinct phases of the program: efficiency, growth, and portfolio. We need to fundamentally improve our cost structure to be competitive in the future. By the end of 2013, we expect that we will have improved the cost structure. When we have executed on these efficiency initiatives, then and only then will we move to making investments into major growth initiatives.</p>
          <p>This does not mean that Merck is a company that will be solely focused on cost-cutting over the next two years. We will continue to invest in our growing platforms of Merck Millipore and emerging markets, and we will continue with both <mark type="ph" /> on queue (6:13) transactions and licensing deals. What I want to signal is that we will not invest a significant amount of cash into growth until we have delivered on our efficiency targets. It is normal that we then take another look at our group portfolio, which is, however, normal process that is anyway done on a continuous basis.</p>
          <p>I would now like to provide you some operational commentary from geographic and divisional perspective. On Slide 6 we show the geographic breakdown of our organic sales growth for the overall Merck Group. Our highest-profit in emerging markets and the solid performance from North America helped to offset a weaker environment in Europe. Asia and Latin America grew 9% organically, which was primarily driven by Merck Serono. In these geographies we continued to benefit from our strong brand, experienced sales forces, and the quality of our product.</p>
          <p>North America delivered organic sales growth of 7%, mainly stemming from both Merck Serono and the full contribution of Merck Millipore in the second half of the year. With the addition of the Merck Millipore business, which has of course a strong U.S. presence, our sales in North America have grown to represent 18% of the group's full-year sales. In Europe, our performance was affected by the soft economic environment and pricing pressures in the pharmaceutical business.</p>
          <p>Let's move to Slide 7. Merck Serono reported total revenues of &#x20AC;5.9 billion, representing a reported revenue growth of 3%. The division's revenues showed resiliency during the year despite continued government austerity measures and changing competitive dynamics in our multiple sclerosis franchise. Positive development included strong results in emerging markets, good performance in our endocrinology and fertility franchises, and our successful efforts to defend the Rebif franchise.</p>
          <p>Rebif capitalized on its strong position as the leading therapy against multiple sclerosis in Europe. It generated higher volumes compared to last year in Europe, while U.S. sales benefited from higher prices that more than offset softer volumes. Overall, Rebif delivered organic sales growth of 3% in 2011, slightly better than our expectations for flat performance during the year.</p>
          <p>We shared with you our strategy to defend Rebif earlier in the year, which included leveraging the strong position in devices and life cycle management. We have made good progress on this objective, and our adoption rates of new Rebif devices are as high as 50% in countries where the devices are available. This reflects the convenience and benefits these devices provide to the patients. In addition to life cycle management, we expanded the label of Rebif into the CIS market in Europe, which should help us to further defend the franchise.</p>
          <p>Let me add one thing here. On December 15, we received a warning letter from the FDA related to inspections of some of our production facilities, which contribute to the production of Rebif for distribution in the U.S. The letter primarily addressed several processes related to the manufacturing of Rebif. We are communicating with the FDA to discuss the steps we have already taken as well as the steps we will take in future to resolve the findings noted by the agency. There is no disruption to the supply of Rebif. Patients who have been prescribed Rebif can continue their therapy.</p>
          <p>Erbitux generated organic sales growth of 4% in 2011. Erbitux growth is primarily being driven by the emerging markets, while our sales in Europe remain steady. We shared with you earlier this year that we were not satisfied with the performance of Erbitux in Japan, which represents 14% of Erbitux revenues. Since Q2, we have been facing challenges associated with the label change and increased competition. We have managed in the meantime to soften the negative growth trend there, and after substantial declines in quarter two and three, Erbitux sales in Japan declined only 7% organically in quarter four, indicating that this business is on its way to stabilizing in 2012.</p>
          <p>Our Fertility and Endocrinology business continued to develop nicely. Endocrinology sales increased 10% organically, driven by a good marked uptake of Egrifta, launched in the U.S. in 2011. We're also seeing strong performance of Kuvan. Fertility reported organic sales growth of 7%, which reflected good demand from emerging markets and good life cycle management.</p>
          <p>The CardioMetabolic Care and General Medicine business generated organic sales growth of 4%, with almost all of this growth coming from the emerging markets. We have trusted brands such as Glucophage and Concor, and we believe these businesses will continue to be attractive for Merck.</p>
          <p>Consumer Health reported solid results, with revenues increasing 5%, slightly better than expected. Key countries such as Germany and France delivered strong performance, helped by growing demand from emerging markets. We also began to reduce our discretionary spending in this division, which helps to improve its profitability.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to Slide 8. Sales of Performance Materials increased 1% in 2011, driven by higher Liquid Crystals volumes. We increased our overall market share in liquid crystals from 53% to 59%, due primarily to gains we made with the VA and IPS technologies, where we made important technical enhancements to drive better performance. Our share in PS-VA fell substantially over the last 12 months, but we were able to mostly offset this with good performance from other products in the portfolio.</p>
          <p>The growth and profit performance of Liquid Crystals reflects both the breadth we have across all LC technologies, but also our customers' desire to see innovation and technical upgrades in older technologies. With the track record of innovation in the LCD market, we believe this industry is well positioned in the near term despite potential challenges that might come longer-term.</p>
          <p>Pigments &amp; Cosmetics declined 5% in 2011. This business is highly tied to the European economy. We saw, therefore, sharp declines, particularly in the coatings business, as automotive production slowed in the region.</p>
          <p>Merck Millipore delivered solid performance in 2011, with revenues growing 48% despite challenging conditions in some off our markets. While increasing volumes of biologically manufactured drugs stimulated growth in the Process Solutions business unit, we saw demand from academia customers softening due to the expiry of governmental stimulus packages and tighter public budget control in various geographies.</p>
          <p>Since we regard these dynamics as only short-term and manageable impacts on our long-term growth prospects, we continue to prepare the division for future growth through stronger investments into R&amp;D as well as bolt-on acquisitions. With the completion of three bolt-on transactions in the year, we strengthened our product offering in areas we had already strong market presence. We will continue to pursue a dual strategy of organic revenue growth supported by innovation and portfolio additions through bolt-on acquisitions aimed at leveraging the full commercial power of a global and leading player in the Life Science Tools industry.</p>
          <p>I would now like to move to the next chart and cover some key developments of the Merck Serono pipeline. A pipeline review was completed earlier in the year. With a total seven pipeline discontinuations in 2011 based on stringent scientific and strategic criteria, we freed up resources for future activities with a higher potential to create value.</p>
          <p>As some of the first steps in this effort, we acquired rights of two new drug candidates to begin the process of rebuilding the R&amp;D portfolio for multiple sclerosis and strengthening the portfolio in our oncology franchise. We have added ONO-4641 from Ono Pharmaceuticals, a potential oral multiple sclerosis drug. The Phase II data is now in our hands, and we need to scientifically and commercially evaluate that data with our partner. We will make a decision about our future path forward in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Recently, we announced a collaboration with Threshold Pharmaceuticals on TH-302. This hypoxia-activated product with potential applications in oncology is currently in Phase III for the treatment of sarcoma. We have seen the positive headline results for the randomized Phase II trial in pancreatic cancer just a few weeks ago. We will evaluate these data in due course with our scientific advisors to determine the appropriate path forward.</p>
          <p>To Stimuvax, we previously provided guidance that the second interim analysis of the START trial will take place in Q1 2012. Independent data monitoring committee performed the interim analysis, and I can confirm today that the trial will continue on to final analysis. We expect the final analysis to take place earliest in 2013 after 100% of the expected events have taken place. Of course, the exact timing of our announcement of the outcome of this study is difficult to predict since it depends on the pattern of survival of the patients still on the study.</p>
          <p>We re-filed Erbitux in the European Union for the treatment of lung cancer last year based on a new biomarker sub-analysis of the FLEX trial. We have meanwhile received an extensive list of questions from CHMP. We are currently in the process of answering these and providing some additional data which have been requested by the committee. Once these data have been submitted, the CHMP will need time to asses it. In view of these developments, we now expect the CHMP to reach a recommendation on our application in the second half of 2012. Also in the second half, we expect to communicate to you <mark type="ph" /> half-line (20:02) Phase III data of Erbitux in gastric cancer indication.</p>
          <p>Finally, on cilengitide, our integrin inhibitor currently in Phase III for glioblastoma, as is usually the case in late-stage cancer trials, the final analysis for this product is event-driven, which again, makes timing of the availability of the final outcome of this study very difficult to predict. We previously stated, based on our best estimate, we expect to be able to communicate the outcome of the study by the end of 2012. Based on our latest estimate, however, and based on the timing of events observed in the study, we currently expect to have its final outcome in the first half of 2013.</p>
          <p>Now, to Slide 10; in 2011 we have taken a series of far-reaching decisions and actions aimed at transforming Merck into a more efficient and performance-driven organization. The coming months, we plan to begin a formal group-wide efficiency program. Some of you may ask what are the catalysts for the changes we are making. Well, while we have a solid business with attractive assets today, including those assets gained from the Serono/Millipore acquisitions, we need to improve our efficiency and come closer to the profitability of our competitors. We also need to do a more effective job of translating our growth into better bottom-line profitability. We spent much of last year bringing in new leaders and putting new organizational structures in place.</p>
          <p>As we move ahead into 2012, our focus now turns to cost efficiency. We have internal structures and processes that are too bureaucratic, complex, and costly compared to best-in-class companies in the industries and markets we are serving. While we have several important corporate objectives to deliver on in the coming year, the most critical will be on ensuring that the efficiency program is successful and respective initiatives are implemented.</p>
          <p>These measures should increase our commercial effectiveness, improve the returns on our R&amp;D investments, and optimize our cost structure to ensure Merck's future success. As I mentioned earlier, we plan to provide you the financial operational details of this process during our Capital Markets Day on May 15, together with our quarter-one earnings update.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would like to thank you for your attention and hand over the call to Matthias Zachert.</p>

          <p>A warm welcome from my side as well; I will address in my presentation full-year numbers briefly and then dive in more further detail into fourth quarter performance, and will finish the presentation with the outlook and indication on 2012. So let me move to Page number 12.</p>
          <p>The key points that I would like to make on this very slide, where I think levels of granularity have been provided for, is we delivered on the guidance we have communicated in summer in Q2. This relates to top-line revenue and also to underlying Core OR, which we guided for &#x20AC;2.250 billion, so we are just about right as we finished 2011.</p>
          <p>As far as the overall P&amp;L is concerned, I think it's noteworthy to stress that absolute numbers were impacted by the 12-month consolidation of Merck Millipore. This was only reflected partially in 2010. And of course you see that the transformation process impacted all respective key lines of the P&amp;L and has led to around about &#x20AC;0.5 billion of one-time costs being taken in full-year 2011.</p>
          <p>This is especially visible if you turn your attention to Page number 13, where we have only achieved, bottom-bottom line, the net profitability of previous-year results, so basically we have moved around about &#x20AC;500 million of one-time costs through the P&amp;L in 2011, and despite that, I think we were able to post profitable numbers net-income-wise.</p>
          <p>But now let's turn more to the operational trading updates on the entire year for all the four divisions, and with this I'll move to Page number 14, and I would go by size of the segments, and naturally I start with the Pharma division with Merck Serono. What needs to be mentioned is that Merck Serono, in a year of change, has performed organically on top line reasonably well, but especially as far as bottom-line contribution is concerned.</p>
          <p>In Europe, especially, we were facing, in many of the countries, austerity measures, and despite all these pricing reductions that we were facing in key countries, bottom-line results where improving by around about 4% operationally, thus digesting also the increase in R&amp;D costs that we faced. And I would explicitly like to point out that here, in course of the fourth quarter, difference to the past, the new management team was very successful in achieving a tight cost control which, in light of the new organization, is something that I think earns respect.</p>
          <p>As far as Consumer Health is concerned, reported-wise, you see a substantial increase in operational results, but here I would say the base against which we compare in 2010 was substantially lowered due to operational costs that we incurred in China and also in the U.K., so here I would say profitability has come back to a reasonable level which, however, definitely is far from industry standards.</p>
          <p>If we now move to the Chemical segment, we see that Performance Materials finished the year relatively well despite having currency against it, despite facing in Liquid Crystals, notably in June, July, August, destocking from the Liquid Crystals customer, facing also on the Pigments industry in the second half of 2011 a quite steep volume decline, and of course losing the high-contribution spending from PS-VA. So despite all these four elements going against the Performance Materials division, I think the profitability stabilized around previous year's levels.</p>
          <p>Last but not the least, let's turn our attention to Merck Millipore, and here it needs to be stated that this division is fully on track in terms of growth rates, whilst of course managing the softness that we faced like other life science tools in the academia market and notably in the North American region.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn the attention to fourth quarter, and with this I move to Slide number 16. The following four comments I would like to make here on the Merck Group P&amp;L. I think it's noteworthy to mention the decent organic growth we have posted in fourth quarter of four percentage points. Gross profit went up &#x2013; to some extent, artificially, because a) we operated from a low base Q4 2010, and b) we were not taking the step-up costs that were booked, notably in Q3 and Q4, last year in the gross margin.</p>
          <p>As far as R&amp;D costs are concerned, they went up due to the pre-warning that we gave with Q3 numbers that was resulting from the termination or the handover of the safinamide products to Newron, and with the decision that we took on the Parkinson's disease, the determination of Parkinson's disease, automatically we had to accrue for the ongoing costs for the running trials. Fourth, the last statement on this very slide, I think operating results, or core underlying operating results was solid.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to the segments, and I start with Merck Serono; here, overall, a good sales momentum stemming from Endocrinology, stemming from Fertility and Erbitux strengthening, notably in the fourth quarter, which I think is a positive sign. As far as the new organization is concerned, I again would like to stress that the new organization coming together in course of 2011 and very, very quickly taking on board cost control in the operational cost lines I think is something that I can only stress it again, is noteworthy and earns respect.</p>
          <p>As far as R&amp;D costs are concerned, again, especially in fourth quarter, the &#x20AC;40 million increase is basically coming from the safinamide accruals that we took for stopping pursuing the product's therapeutic area further. Underlying core operating results, with a 14% increase, from my point of view, is a very good finish for 2011.</p>
          <p>Now let's our attention to Page 18, and here I will be very crisp. Focus on the future in Consumer Health will be profitability. Of course this is a business that should post also in the future years, growth rates, but the focus will be less on top-line increases but basically on bottom-line profitability, so I think 2011, all in all, is a good start in this journey.</p>
          <p>I will now comment on Page number 19, and here, Performance Materials segment. As far as sales are concerns, the picture is mixed. Pigments was continuing to suffer in the fourth quarter, and that is something that will also continue beginning of 2012. As far as Liquid Crystals, however, is concerned, we did not see the negative implication stemming from the de-stocking on the customer side, which were elements seen in Q2 and Q3, so this was basically not a theme of Q4. And on top of that, currencies, which of course play a quite dominant role also in the Liquid Crystals segment because we produce in euro and we are shipping in U.S. dollar, Korean won, and Taiwanese dollar, Japanese yen, currencies here turned in our favor, clearly, so that led to a positive contribution also in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>As far as cost containment is concerned, you see that, especially due to the Pigments shortfall, we started in June/July to be very strict on costs and expenses in the SG&amp;A area, you see that this yielded results from Q4 onwards, with which we balanced the profitability in the positive direction and managed to reach our targets for the full year.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to Merck Millipore, and here the statement is that this division is fully on track. As you can see now from the information that we provide also on the business units, all three business units &#x2013; Bioscience, Lab Solutions, and Process Solutions &#x2013; contributed to the growth nicely, and I think this is a sign of strength.</p>
          <p>Gross profit last year was low due to the indication I have given earlier &#x2013; i.e., the step-up on the inventories, which lowered gross profit respectively &#x2013; and as far as R&amp;D costs are concerned, you see that we invest into the future of this business actively. As regards operating results, it's slightly lower than previous-year levels because in the year where the integration started in Q3 and Q4, it's obvious that you spend less in R&amp;D. If you take a look at the increase in R&amp;D and amortization costs, you basically see that in fourth quarter we were at comparable levels.</p>
          <p>Let me now to Page number 21, and with this I address the balance sheet; three elements I would like to highlight here. First, we do have a very strong cash position finishing the year 2011. This will be used to reduce the gross indebtedness that we still have in course of December closing 2011, so we will have two bonds maturing in 2012, and we will simply repay them-one to-one.</p>
          <p>With this, I'll move to the pension provision, and here it needs to be stated that on top of the net financial debt reduction, which I will address in a second, we took the liberty to fund &#x2013; similar to other German corporates, to fund our German pension scheme with &#x20AC;520 million. This was something that was reflected and accounted for in the operational cash flow, so you need to &#x2013; for operational comparability, you should restate that in order to come to a more apples-to-apples comparison. So for &#x2013; or had we not taken the CTA funding, net financial debts would have come down by another &#x20AC;300 million to &#x20AC;400 million.</p>
          <p>And of course, having said this, you see that despite the CTA funding, we reduced also net financial indebtedness nicely by &#x20AC;1 billion in course of 2011.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to Page 22, and with this I will address the cash flow statement. Of course, profit after tax was heavily impacted by the one-time charges that we took in course of 2011. This is being adjusted for in the depreciation/amortization. Obviously, changes in working capital basically reflects expansion of the business. CapEx was managed tightly, and as far as the position others is concerned, of course you see here the reflection of acquisitions, you see here the reflections of the divestitures that we took in course of 2011, also some legal costs that we still had to carry in course of 2011.</p>
          <p>So, all in all, however, the biggie items are last year the acquisition of Millipore and this year quite modest costs as far as Amnis and Biotest acquisitions are concerned, and this is much pretty much reflecting the guidance that we've provided on acquisitions being small bolt-on.</p>
          <p>With this, I turn to Page number 23, the dividends, and what we would propose to the AGM on this 20th of April is an increase of 20%, to &#x20AC;1.50. This should somewhat close the gap to peers. We are, I think, as far as comparability is concerned, clearly not there where the industry is. It should be a sign of a level of comfort that we have in our business, and it should also be a sign to the <mark type="ph" /> long on lease (37:08) that, despite the transformation process that we have embarked on and that might lead to one-timers in 2012 and 2013, we want to stick to a stable dividend, and stable dividend &#x2013; we remain moderate and humble as far as the yield and payout is concerned, but stable dividend policy does mean that you should not be surprised by a sudden reduction which sometimes occurs before.</p>
          <p>With this, I'll turn my attention to Page number 24, and this gives a certain level of further granularity as far as disclosure is concerned. In the future, we will give you a breakdown by region on the organic sales developments for each division. The same will be done for Erbitux and Rebif. And I think with this you should get a good level of comfort that our exposure in Rebif in the emerging markets is low, which I think is good from the defensive standpoint. And as far as Erbitux is concerned, you clearly see here that we are having a good momentum basically in all of our markets, especially also lately coming from the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Changes occur, of course, on the key performance indicator. We change from the ROS, the OR, and the CORE, to the EBITA pre, and therefore this EBITDA pre, I think, is a good indicator for the next two to three years in the transformation process, and we will then, of course, after this period, see if we will enrich this indicator like other companies have done.</p>
          <p>As far as margin analysis is concerned, we took also your feedback that margin analysis on revenue is sometimes not truly reflecting the operational business. We hear you, and therefore adjust our margin analysis on net sales and no longer on total revenues as we go into 2012. The line "exceptionals" that Merck used in the past will, in future, only be used for discontinued business. And as far as margins are concerned here, we will move in the Performance Materials segments to disclosing the segmental margin and will no longer provide the breakdown on the Liquid Crystals margin.</p>
          <p>With this, I turn to Page number 25 and here give some granularity on the division perspective. As far as Merck Serono is concerned, we foreshadow stable revenues. Whilst Rebif should be stable/slightly declining; Erbitux, Fertility, Endocrinology, our view is clearly that here the journey will move on in a low-single-digits growth direction, and this will then reflect a modest increase in profitability pre one-time costs.</p>
          <p>As far as Consumer Health is concerned, the focus on profitability improvements, of course, I have mentioned, so rather moderate top-line expectations should be modeled, but rather strict cost control and focus on profitability. As far as Performance Materials is concerned, please take note of the communication we've done earlier. You should expect a softness in the first half, especially in Q1, and from Q2 &#x2013; notably, from Q3 onwards &#x2013; you should see an improvement as far as previous-year comparable base is concerned. As far as Merck Millipore is concerned, of course the journey will continue in terms of top-line growth and bottom-line improvements.</p>
          <p>My final remarks are on the group. Here, I would clearly like to emphasize that we, in this guidance, don't consider efficiency costs or efficiency cost savings. Only once we have finalized our discussions and negotiations, we can give dollar and precise guidance on the respective one-time costs and savings, and then of course we have to provide updates on that. But, of course, it is something that will not substantially impact 2012. It should then be rather something for the second half and for 2013 onwards.</p>
          <p>The other element I would like to highlight is expectation on the first quarter. If you look into the last three quarters &#x2013; i.e., Q4, Q3, and Q2 &#x2013; our blended average profitability trading was around about &#x20AC;650 million of EBITDA pre. If you go to the old indicator, Core OR, it was around &#x20AC;550 million, so please take this into consideration as you model Q1. Otherwise, you would start on the wrong platform.</p>
          <p>And with this, I would like to move over to your, hopefully, questions that you will have.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen, and thank you for taking my questions. The first is about guidance, and particularly about the foreign exchange impact. Nowhere have you said what FX rates you're assuming within guidance, and clearly, for some of your divisions in particular, it makes an enormous amount of impact on both the top and the bottom line. So can you give us a little bit more color as to what you're assuming in terms of FX? Particularly, Matthias, you made the comment that Q1 will be tough, but from an FX perspective, you should also see a significant benefit from all those U.S. revenue streams being translated back into a significantly weaker euro year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Secondly, if I can just focus on the dividend, at Q3, you told us that it would remain humble, and then here we are at Q4; it's grown 20%. That's fantastic. I just would love to understand how we should model it going forward. It's a 50% payout ratio on reported EPS, but it's only a 20% payout ratio on core EPS. You told us that we shouldn't assume it ever goes down, but how should we model it going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matthew, I will take both questions. On currencies, we will start giving currency guidance precisely with Q1, when we have also the quantitative guidance. For the time being, you should basically consider the qualitative guidance we have provided for with the blended rates that we have had in course of 2011. Now, as far as the U.S. dollar exposure is concerned, I think we will have no positive contribution coming from the U.S. dollar on the Q1 versus Q1 yearly comparable basis because the U.S. dollar in Q1 2011 was already relatively robust, so you will not see an upside coming from the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>Now, as far as the divi is concerned, you're totally correct. The statement was it will be a humble dividend policy. Now, let me be more granular in this regard. How we've looked into our net income is of course we take the reported net income, but we take the reported net income adjusted for the one-time costs that we incurred in course of 2011. And if you do that &#x2013; so if you adjust for the around-about &#x20AC;400 million to &#x20AC;500 million that we have booked in course of 2011, you will come to the original payout ratio that Merck used in the past; i.e., the around-about 35 to 40 percentage points.</p>
          <p>So that was basically rather the approach being taken. So we move away from the pure reported net income because, had we done the dividend on the reported net income, then we would have had to cut the dividend against previous year. And therefore it is a sign that, despite a year, in 2012 and 2013, where one-time costs potentially for write-downs or for restructuring are very likely, we are not going to jeopardize the dividend, and will rather continue with this kind of approach that I've just indicated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Can I just ask a quick follow-up on the dividend then? So, fundamentally, if I were to ignore core EPS, but look at EPS reported pre onetime, so after amortization but before one-time charges, if I were to use the old Merck 35% to 40% payout ratio on that number, it could give, at least the best I can do at the moment, a fair reflection of dividend performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. This is the reason why we've introduced the new KPIs, not only on EBITDA and EBITDA pre, but also EPS pre one-time items.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have a few questions, please. Firstly, you talked a little bit about the impact of reforms through the full-year results for 2011. I was wondering if you give some commentary specifically on the sales and profitability exposure for 2011 and how we should think about this for 2012. Secondly, again, you've touched upon this question in your prepared remarks, but could you kindly expand upon the dynamics that you see in the other endocrinology and the other fertility sales platforms? Specifically, I was looking to better understand the impact from price and volume by the major regions, and in the case of endocrinology, how much of Egrifta is contributing to growth. Thirdly, if you could provide more detail on any of the additional data the EMEA is requiring for Erbitux in the high-EGFR-expressing patients; curious to know, are there any new trials required, or are you simply just working with existing data only?</p>
          <p>And then a quick question on Stimuvax, I was just wondering if anyone can clarify whether the patients on inhaled corticosteroids are permitted into the START trial. If I look at the exclusion criteria, it does include patients with preexisting conditions requiring chronic steroid therapy, so I was just wondering if patients on ICS are allowed into the study. And then, finally, a quick question on Performance Materials; if I look at the gross margin in the fourth quarter, just looking to understand the drivers and how much of this is sustainable going forward. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think we will address your questions as best as possible. As far as 2012 is concerned, on sales momentum, my understanding of your question &#x2013; I might have not fully taken note of it &#x2013; was related to what's the austerity measures we faced in 2011. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's correct, just wondering on the implications for 2011 and how to think about this in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we mentioned this morning that in 2011 we were facing roughly &#x20AC;5,200 million of top-line pressure, especially in the European environment, and you have seen that organically, if you go to one of the very early slides of the presentation, Europe has shown no growth. This is something that we will rather be confronted with, and "we" means basically the entire pharmaceutical industry, that pricing pressure in Europe is going to continue. I just mentioned the so-called forced rebate in Germany, the two Royal Decrees that we were facing in Spain last year, and also tighter pricing environment in the U.K. and in Greece.</p>
          <p>So, all in all, I think in Europe we have to be simply prepared for further austerity measures. Whilst, however, they often come on short notice, there is no bullet-point number that we factor into our financial plans or that we convey. It's the simple approach that we have to deal with this and we are prepared, of course, with respective measures that we have to take in 2012 on the cost side in order to compensate that; this as far as 2012 potential austerity measures are concerned.</p>
          <p>And now let's go into endocrinology, so I think on this particular item, I would like to keep the attention at high level because endocrinology/fertility is an area that we would like to further dwell on in our presentations on the 15th of May when we try to explain further our business here and try to convey that we are doing reasonably well here, also especially stemming from the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>As far as Egrifta is concerned, the growth rates are extremely sound in the overall development, but it's, of course, still on a very low basis. Kuvan and Egrifta are products that have been introduced in the last few years &#x2013; Egrifta recently &#x2013; so the growth rates are extremely attractive, high double-digits, but of course in absolute terms, we are here &#x2013; I think Stefan has mentioned very clearly last time, around the &#x20AC;30 million, &#x20AC;40 million for Kuvan and Egrifta is still smaller in terms of its absolute size. So if the products continue to drive nicely further upwards in the continuous years, then we'll reflect them in absolute numbers in our product pipeline or product sales overview as we go ahead.</p>
          <p>I would now take the last question and will then hand over to Annalisa on Stimuvax and Erbitux. So on Performance Materials, your point is very well-noted and taken. Fourth quarter is somewhat, gross margin-wise, stronger, but here my humble statement is, normally, in the fourth quarter, you have always seen that the gross margin in any of the Merck business deteriorated. This hasn't happened in the fourth quarter. In return, don't suddenly assume that the positive surprises that you've always seen in the first quarter on the gross margin will reoccur. They will not reoccur.</p>
          <p>So therefore my humble statement is Q4 this year has simply come back to normal trading reflection and also the more normal trading reflection you will see in Q1 in 2012. With this, we hope that we get more transparency in the organic development of our business, and I hope that fourth quarter simply started also to be a quarter where you got more transparencies on truly trading pattern and not technical changes.</p>
          <p>And with this, I hand over to Annalisa Jenkins, and we are all very happy that Annalisa is with us.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Matthias, and good afternoon to everyone. So let me take the questions first of all specific to Erbitux in lung and our ongoing open process with the European agency. So I can confirm, as we stated today, that we continue to be in this process and we continue to work with the agency on addressing their questions, and specifically, requests for supplementary information. At this point, we are not foreseeing, in this current process, the addition of new studies, but it's fair to say that we are currently performing additional analyses at the specific request of the agency in the spirit of dealing with their questions on an ongoing basis, and this actually is the reason that we today moved out our date for the expected outcome of this procedure.</p>
          <p>As your question relates to the Stimuvax START study and your question specifically around the inclusion/exclusion criteria that relates to inhaled corticosteroid, I think it's best if we deal with that one offline, and I will undertake with Joshua to get back to you with the specific details in answer to your question.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question now comes from Holger Blum from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello; Holger Blum from Deutsche Bank. I just wanted to come back to a statement you made during the presentation, talking about a short-term strong position of Liquid Crystals and some long-term challenges. Are you referring there to <mark type="ph" /> true liquids (56:01), or what other challenges would you see mainly for that division? And secondly a question on the guidance and restructuring, you mentioned you did not include costs and one-time items for it. Maybe you can help us to think about the potential besides discretionary spending that you can influence. Obviously, there's some head count reduction, but what other options would you foresee in reducing the fixed-cost base, and then maybe you can talk a little bit on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Blum. For the second question, the restructuring, can we ask for your understanding that we would like to really come out with data, with more information, on our Capital Markets Day on May 15? It does not make too much sense at this point in time to give fragments which don't add up to a big picture, so that it's impossible make out where we're really going. We want to wait for the results which we have in process in all countries around the world, and then we'll have a better feeling in terms of cost, and then we will communicate to you properly. But I pass on to Matthias Zachert for the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Herr Blum, on the Performance Materials side, I think what has been stressed right at the beginning is what is equally reflected in all of your models I've read with high level of interest in the last several years, so I think everybody stresses here the challenges that we face on the technology side, on the customers side, that face heavy pressures on pricing environments. And therefore, of course, we are facing pressure on our end as well, and we are, of course, trying everything to keep here ahead of the curve and to maintain our life cycle in this business, but of course the environment, as you have seen in 2011, is not always an easy one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you maybe update us here in terms of your next-generation technology and market expectations here, when we might see the next PS-VA technology launch, given you, again, are in the leading position on high-end applications?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What needs to the stated is we continuously, in the last several years, have upgraded the technology, but upgrading a technology doesn't come from one quarter to the other, so there was a cycle of around about every three years, we have changed from one technology to the other, like from TFT to IPS, IPS to VA, VA to PS-VA. So we are working on here new technology in order to defend our liquid crystal position, but of course new technologies always have probabilities associated to them and they cannot be taken for granted. We are working on the new technology, which will, however, earliest hit ground in 2013.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentleman. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on Erbitux. Can you tell us what is the opportunity in terms of number of patients for the gastric indication, and also what's your view regarding the opportunity for the adjuvant colorectal? Also a question on Merck Millipore and the sustainability of the gross profits following the good Q4 results. And the last question is on 4641, the oral MS drug, how would you like to differentiate this drug versus Gilenya, BG-12, or teriflunomide? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think on the first and the last questions, let us communicate here on market expectations and how we position once we have more data in our hands, so at this point in time, I would not be tempted &#x2013; we would not be tempted to give you indications. I think as far as gastric and colon is concerned, you can look into the industry reports with the respective patient population that we have in this area. We take the same kind of data, but I think as far as capturing patients here is concerned, eventually it ends up in questions on how successful the data of the drugs look like.</p>
          <p>Can you please repeat your question on Liquid Crystals that you've asked?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. No, it was not on the Liquid Crystals, but Merck Millipore, and the gross profit, the gross margin. Is the level obtained in Q4 is sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So here on the gross margin/gross profit that you've seen in Merck Millipore, I think what sometimes is irritating is, of course, the comparable base that we have posted in Merck Millipore in Q3, Q4 in 2010. Both quarters were impacted negatively by the step-up accounting that you had for the inventory, so in both quarters around about &#x20AC;40 million to &#x20AC;45 million were lowering the profitability in the Merck Millipore division, which you have no longer seen in course of 2011 when we had no penalties coming from step-up accounting. So the gross margin that you currently see, by and large, in the last few quarters reported in Merck Millipore should be an indication of where this business should be in the future years.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. Our next question now comes from Daniel Wendorff from Commerzbank. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions; two on Merck Millipore and one on Merck Serono, if I may. And starting off with Merck Millipore, the growth rates in Q4 for Bioscience and Lab Solutions businesses, I assume, were positively affected by acquisitions. I was wondering whether you could tell us a bit more about how both businesses would have performed on an organic basis. And also related to Merck Millipore, the outlook you gave for 2012, you talk about solid demand for licensed food products. Does that mean like low- to mid-single-digit growth? It would be great if you could give us more color there. And last question, on Merck Serono, you talked about volume growth in emerging markets, and I'm wondering whether you could tell us a bit more about prices, as well, there and also your most successful product lines basically in emerging markets, that would be helpful. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's come to the questions on Merck Millipore. I think for the fourth quarter, you, of course, have seen that we've consolidated the Biotest acquisition here &#x2013; precisely heipha/Hycon &#x2013; and also for the Bioscience business, the Amnis. But both businesses, compared to the size of Merck Millipore &#x2013; we are talking here about a &#x20AC;2.5 billion organization &#x2013; have been very small acquisitions. Heipha/Hycon, by and large, on a yearly basis accounted for roughly &#x20AC;50 million, &#x20AC;55 million sales, while Amnis is a business roughly being in the &#x20AC;10 million to &#x20AC;15 million sales, and therefore if you take the fourth quarter chunk and you reflect that in the reported numbers, you see that this lowers the organic growth rates only mildly.</p>
          <p>So, with this, we come to the second question of Merck Millipore. Of course, here, the industry, all in all, is having a good momentum, despite all the statements made on academia last year and humble national health budgets, but you've seen that Merck Millipore performed reasonably well in course of entire year 2011, with the growth rates of the around-about four percentage points. And that is something, of course, that's indirectly, without now giving the guidance &#x2013; quantitative guidance I would only give with Q1 &#x2013; but this kind of range you should also see as a range for Merck Millipore in the future year.</p>
          <p>As far as the volume growth is concerned on Merck Serono, or overall the growth is concerned on Merck Serono, we don't give a breakdown on pricing and volume in the emerging markets, so the only point that I would like to refer to is the products that have grown very strongly are basically the so-called golden generic brands &#x2013; i.e., Concor, Glucophage, Euthyrox, and of course also Endocrinology and GONAL-f.</p>
          <p>So often I think, on the sales side, you assume that many of these drugs, these branded generics, are part of our developed market sales. This is actually not quite true. Of course, Glucophage, Euthyrox, and Concor are also sold in some of the developed markets, but the growth rates are basically substantial in these branded generics in the emerging markets, where Merck has a very strong reputation and is a respectful organization, so that the products that we sell have, of course, high recognition when they come from Merck. So that is the answer I would like to provide on your last question.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. Thanks very much for taking my questions; two, please. One, just on the Merck Serono royalty income, could you just elaborate on how your expectations are for that going through 2012 and 2013? I think previously we've heard some sort of stability on that, and it certainly was stable to growing this year. If you'd give us an idea of how the detail on that will be affected in the coming years, that will be very useful.</p>
          <p>And then one question going back to Stimuvax, just wondered if we could get some more details on the fertility criteria around the interim analysis, what that was, and how you're thinking about the powering of the trial now it's continuing on longer than first thought. And actually I do have a third, which was on Liquid Crystals, which was just following on from your comments about the new technology, I'm wondering how the new technology potential that we could see in 2013, as you suggested, would be factoring into your qualitative guidance through 2012 and &#x2013; well, certainly 2013 at least. Many thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, Richard, always happy to take your questions. So I will start immediately on the last one, the new technology. We give qualitative indication precisely on this outlook slide on 2012, and I made further reference during the call that new technology, with all probabilities on coming or not coming, will only enter into the P&amp;L, if at all, in 2013, so by construction, the new technology cannot be factored into 2012. And that's basically &#x2013; it's, I think, for basic assumptions you should not factor in technology or anything into your models until we communicate it and have given precise guidance. Everything else would be wrong expectations.</p>
          <p>And as far as the royalty question is concerned, on the fourth quarter, what you have seen here is predominantly a good contribution coming from the royalties. However, this was substantially driven by two effects &#x2013; one, Humira performing nicely volume-wise, and two, of course the U.S. dollar helped us very, very nicely on the royalty income. So as far as &#x2013; on a like-for-like basis, as far as 2012 and 2013 is concerned, we've provided feedback that on a like-for-like basis for currencies, we would see a kind of stability in 2012 and 2011, whilst in 2013 we would see one royalty income stream fading out, and that has to deal with Avonex, so for that very reason, we are going to see a reduction on Avonex on the royalty income side, but of course there are also less expenses that we will face on the royalty expenses side.</p>
          <p>So that is something that needs to be factored in as far as royalties are concerned. And with this, I would very much like to hand over the Stimuvax question to our key expert, Annalisa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Now, first, the question, Richard, what I'd like to do is address the two different parts of your question together and just note that this was actually the second of two planned interims which were pre-specified in the original statistical analysis plan, as approved by the agencies, and that this pre-specified interim, as is often the case in these very long studies, was primarily put in place when we had accrued 75% of the preplanned endpoints to ensure that, in the spirit of protecting patients, we could stop if we saw that there would be no expected ability to show benefits or to reach the primary endpoint or if there was overwhelming evidence at this stage in the study of an efficacy benefit.</p>
          <p>So how I would advise you to interpret our announcement; the study will continue as planned to its completion, and if you remember, this is a study that is event-driven. We will go to accrual of 100% of events, and we've already stated today that we expect that event to be reached towards the end of this year, and then subsequently, post-data analysis, we'll see the data early next year. So hopefully that addresses your question in that this was an interim, it was pre-specified, it allowed us to stop for overwhelming efficacy or no expectation of benefit. The committee reviewed the data. They saw no safety issues, and they advised us that we should continue.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much. Matthias, may I just follow up just on one thing on the Performance Materials? Just in the news release, it does say total revenues to grow slightly in 2013 as well. For that division, I just wonder how the new technology factors into that part of the guidance. I completely understand that 2012, in the slides, it wouldn't affect that. If you could indulge me, that would be great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as 2013 should be read as always further away from 2012, so in our current assumptions, we are factoring in volume growth trends in the Liquid Crystals business, which from our perspective &#x2013; side comments, ceteris paribus on GDP, so volume-wise, the business will continue to grow in 2012, 2013, and also 2014, stemming from the change in applications on the televisions. You see right now that even liquid crystals televisions are being are being replaced by smart television, where you offer 3D components, where you offer bigger sizes, going away from the 55 to 60 inches to what's rather 60 to 85 inches, which you can only do with liquid crystals, or going for the 3D dimensions in the television, which all leads to automatic replacement cycle in the televisions that, hopefully, you also have in your home.</p>
          <p>And, of course, noteworthy is that always continuing change that, thanks to Apple, we have on the tablets, where you have iPad 1, iPad 2, iPad 3, which also starts a kind of replacement cycle. So volume-wise, in Liquid Crystals, we consider that the journey will move on, of course assuming that the GDP is remaining stable. So that is what we factor into 2012 and 2013. We do not factor in new technologies at this point in time.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. Just two questions, one broad and then one more specific. The broad question is on the new incentivization structure. I wonder if you could just discuss that in a little bit more detail, what percentage of management compensation is equity, a bit of color around performance targets that you've put in place, and some color as to how far down the management structure this equity compensation structure goes. And then the second question is around R&amp;D spend, one point of clarification. The guidance slide comments on R&amp;D as being at 14% of revenues. In another slide, you have suggested you would be moving to a percentage of sales. So I just wanted to check what metric that guidance was on. Is it a percentage of revenues?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, it's obviously a small decline versus 2011, just any color as to what is behind that and whether the Ono or TH Phase II/III progression decisions are embedded within that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin, I would just &#x2013; for intro for the incentive scheme because I believe it's an important scheme. It's an important change within the company we have been working on for some time, and we are happy to introduce it now as of the 1st of January. Number one, for the first time, executive management in the company, senior management in the company, really has skin in the game as far as share price is concerned. I think it's an important signal within the company. Second, the plan will not create any dilution, so it's with existing stock. And, third, the senior managers need to invest 10% of their gross salary to participate, so that's also their own money in the game.</p>
          <p>These are three important elements which I think I should highlight at the beginning. I'll pass on now to Matthias for the technical questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think with this, the incentive scheme has been set, and it's, of course, one that in the annual report already, to some extent, describes, but there's also the clear hint it will move down in the entire organization. And stock-based incentive scheme is not the only thing that was introduced now in the new year for 2012. As a matter of fact, we have changed the entire incentive scheme for the group, but also for the divisions, where we go for more focused individual targets &#x2013; i.e., the P&amp;L owner is no longer incentivized on the group performance, but on his true own performance P&amp;L, which of course is a change in the entire organization and I think is rather standard compared to other companies where this approach was implemented some time ago. So also this is, I think, an indication that the incentive scheme in general is changing, not only stock-price related, but also if it addresses more the performance culture that has been introduced already a few quarters ago that we are striving to achieve.</p>
          <p>Now I come to the R&amp;D spend, and here the answer is clearly the communication was done now with 2011 numbers. We kept here on the comparison versus revenue, so here your point is well taken. We should state, in the future, numbers already on net sales. So R&amp;D spend of 14% is rather related to what's the old revenue number. And so please take out the one-time costs that we had in 2011 on R&amp;D; then you would automatically already come to a somewhat comparable R&amp;D spend to revenue basis. As far as your third question is concerned, of course we have to currently assume certain costs for the drugs that we have licensed in, but of course whilst the decisions still have to be made in a budgeting exercise, you need to factor in variable costs that you will have normally for Phase II and Phase III trials.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, just the one for me, on a more general basis. You obviously significantly reduced debt in 2011, which has improved your financial flexibility, within BBB ratings. With regard to further deleveraging, are management aiming to return to A ratings, as was the case before Millipore, or are you happy where you are with more of a focus on pursuing bolt-on deals? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So what I think &#x2013; Nick, thank you very much for questions. Automatically, if you improve ratios, you should get credit by rating agencies, so I think with the existing ratios that we reach, we clearly qualify for a strong basically Baa1 rating or BBB+ to A- rating, but while we always strive to increase to levels where we've been in the past, we of course are completely dependent on, here, the rating agencies and what kind of approach they take. So the communication that we can only make is we are trying to strengthen Merck as a whole. We try to be balanced in our cash allocation, so we focus in 2012, notably, on deleveraging and on funding also efficiency programs when they come, so cash will not hinder us from advancing with the efficiencies. We're a dividend-paying company, with the explanations I've given before, and of course we will continue to wisely allocate capital to small- and medium-sized acquisitions in business fields that have strong underlying momentum, like you've seen in Merck Millipore transactions in course of 2011.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Nick. I would say we go for our last question on the call, and then of course everything else would be handled for the upcoming road show that we will start this evening and in the further conferences, and I would, of course, highlight the 15th of May, where we would all welcome you here in the lovely Darmstadt environment. So last question please?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. Our final question now comes from Michie Yana from ECM. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question; two questions, if I may. On Performance Materials, in the outlook comment, you mentioned a flat profitability versus continuing price pressure on the Liquid Crystals. Does that imply you will be reliant on further cost reduction, or are you actually seeing &#x2013; are you expecting any recovery on the Pigments side in the profitability? And on the working capital for the year, the current year, given that you have a slight top-line growth assumption, should we expect similar movement, or are you expecting to do some further squeeze in the working capital as a percentage of revenue of sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Michie. So on Performance Materials, I would say, Liquid Crystals, you should see volume growth, whilst pricing will be humble, and Pigments should improve on a full-year basis versus previous year. So that is basically bringing us up to the constant sales and constant profitability. But all in all, again, I would like to reemphasize, even though I repeat myself, be very, very moderate in your expectations for Q1. Only expect that after Q2 things will gradually then improve and more momentum in third quarter.</p>
          <p>As far as working capital is concerned, this is not the primary focus. Primary focus now in 2012 is delivery on the transformation process; notably, as far as efficiency is concerned. But of course working capital will be an area where we would like to improve as well, so should we achieve gradual improvement here over the next three years and have a slight start in 2012, it would be always welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just on the Pigment, can describe here when you say improvement, are we talking more volume or talking more margin or both?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would basically like to say that here we would &#x2013; of course we need more volume in order to have better utilization rates, which in chemicals is always needed in order to improve profitability, so it's basically a combination of volume, with costs that should here improve the profitability that was not that satisfactory in course of 2011.</p>
