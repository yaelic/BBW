        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning, everyone. Welcome and thanks for joining us for the Full Year Results for 2009. We will endeavor to keep the lights on this time at least from Mark and I's sanity. In the room today we've got all of my executive team and Lynne Peacock, our U.K. CEO is on the phone and welcome to everyone who's also on the phone and joining us by the web.</p>
          <p>I'm going to take you through the headlines of the results, and then Mark Joiner, our CFO will take you through things in more detail, and following the presentation we'll take questions.</p>
          <p>In summary, the group delivered a solid performance in light of the market turmoil over the last 12 months. It's the most significant global economic downturn since the 1930s and it was a year that was characterized by significant uncertainty. It was a rapidly deteriorating credit environment and unprecedented action was taken by governments to see through restore stability.</p>
          <p>Less than six months ago we started to see a period of stabilization. It's only been in the past few months that we've seen some improvement of the economic conditions. And our full-year result reflects that environment.</p>
          <p>In addition our constant adherence to the priorities we adopted for the managing of the business are also reflected. In particularly, we've insured balance sheet strength and flexibility and our capital funding and liquidity position remained strong. We've maintained tight cost management through our focus on efficiency and we've supported our customers by continuing to lend and by working closely with those experiencing difficulty. So let's start and look at the detail.</p>
          <p>Revenue growth was 9% &#x2013; 9.7%, up year-on-year driven by continued strength in the business bank where we further enhanced our market leading position. There's also a strong contribution from our markets business, which is counter-cyclical.</p>
          <p>The U.K. and MLC experienced pressure on revenue, but both saw some improvement in the second half with improving basis risk and funds under management respectively. The Group delivered another strong performance on costs, while on a reported basis operating costs were up 4.2% year-on-year on a like-for-like basis excluding GWB costs, which was only owned for four months of 2008. Growth was 2.9% in line with our guidance.</p>
          <p>Underlying profit was strong for the year, up approximately 15% and on a sequential basis underlying profit declined by 3.4%, mainly reflecting the lower contribution from markets in the second half as market volatility aged. Bad and doubtful debts are up significantly year-on-year reflecting the deteriorating environment. This is mainly driven by some larger corporate exposures and business lending in Australia and the U.K but to-date we've not seen any material deterioration in the credit quality of our retail portfolio.</p>
          <p>As a result of higher bad and doubtful debts cash earnings declined 1.9 year-on-year and is also down sequentially by 10.5%.The final dividend of $0.73 per share is in line with the first half and reflects a 25% reduction on financial year '08 consistent with our objective of prioritizing capital strength. Overall, the group delivered a solid outcome in a challenging operating environment whilst making good progress in positioning the business for continued momentum over the longer term as we try to drive sustainable returns as we move potentially into a slower growth environment.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we are seeing some more positive signs emerge but there remains a degree of uncertainty on the outlook. Overall, Australia has fared remarkably well but we do remain cautious. Growth has been brought-forward by stimulus and the economy is still below productive capacity. Unemployment will continue to rise albeit to a lower level than we expected at the half year. Currently we forecast a peak of 6.7% in mid to late 2010 versus our 8% forecast just six months ago. Internationally non-Japan, Asia and China will continue to experience strong growth which will benefit Australia and our Monthly Business Survey results have strengthened considerably. Forward orders are improving in some sectors of the economy like mining and construction but there is softness in parts of retail, also in transport. While businesses may feel more confident this hasn't yet translated into new investment and demand for credit. We're also moving into a rising rate environment and it's not yet clear what impact this will have on credit demand and consumer and business sentiment.</p>
          <p>Our Australian GDP growth projections are for around 2% in 2010. This includes an expectation that the Australian economy will achieve 3% <mark type="inaudible" /> growth by the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>In the U.K. there are some early signs of improvement in consumer and business sentiment and some indications that commercial property prices are stabilizing and that housing markets have modestly strengthened.</p>
          <p>However the latest GDP estimate show the U.K. economy fell for the sixth quarter in a row and they're still mired in recession in the third quarter of 2009. We are forecasting less than 1% GDP growth in 2010. Addressing the large government deficit will clearly post challenges but we do expect the depreciation of the sterling to provide some support but logically we expect the U.K. to continue to remain difficult, but for Clydesdale bank to benefit from its strong relative positioning to peers.</p>
          <p>New Zealand is emerging from a long recession with the housing market stabilizing and consumer spending starting to increase. There remains a number of structural challenges in the New Zealand market, <mark type="inaudible" /> continues to be well-positioned, given its consistent strategic focus and its strong assay quality relative to peers.</p>
          <p>Globally, sentiment has markedly improved from where it was six months ago. However, our forecast of just over 3% for world GDP growth next year is below the long-term trend and is also well short of the V-shape recovery seen after other recessions. Six months ago, there were heavy downside risks to our forecasts. However, today there is some chance that macroeconomic conditions could out turnout better than we expect.</p>
          <p>So while the environment looks considerably better now than it did earlier in the year, we are mindful that contribution from government's stimulus programs boosting household spending power will fade over time as will the stimulus for monetary policy, system credit growth will be lower than previous recoveries, and we expect business lending system to be negative to flat in financial year 2010. Unemployment is still to increase, albeit lower than previously expected, and there still remains widespread out of capacity. Overall, we are cautiously optimistic on the outlook.</p>
          <p>In terms of our priorities for 2010. At our strategy update in March, I announced a new Group Executive team. Each of these Executives has now settled into their role. As a team, we are fully focused on delivering the priorities we've set for the Group.</p>
          <p>The first of these is maintaining balance sheet strength. During 2009, we undertook a range of responsible actions to preserve the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet to appropriately position us for the environment but also to enable us to take advantage of opportunities, both organic and inorganic to support business growth. At year-end our Tier-1 capital ratio was strong at 8.96%, up 65 basis points on March. In the current environment, we will retain our bias on balance sheet strength. Mark will outline our approach to capital in more detail.</p>
          <p>Our focus on cost has served just well over the past few years and we'll continue to do so as we potentially move into a slower growth environment.</p>
          <p>As I flagged in March, we have accelerated the realization of efficiency opportunities to reshape our business to deliver future sustainable benefits. Our next generation project is progressing well. This involves a significant transformation of our systems and capabilities and will help realize our efficiency, quality and service agenda. As previously stated, the project will continue to be funded within our existing investment spend and will deliver a range of capabilities throughout the next five years.</p>
          <p>At the strategy update in March, the management team clearly identified improving the reputation of NAB in the community as a key long-term priority. Since then we have made some progress on this agenda. We have taken a responsible and sustainable approach to supporting our customers throughout the crisis.</p>
          <p>Despite the uncertainties in the market over the past year, we've been able to maintain an increase in our lending to Australian businesses. As the country's biggest business lender, this has been important not only for the Bank and its customers, but also for the economic strength and resilience of the Australian economy.</p>
          <p>In the personal bank, we've laid and acted on the issue of bank fees and our actions in this area have been well publicized. Like the stand we took on commissions in MLC, we believe this is the right direction for our industry and the right direction for our customers in our business. We will continue to advance conceded and sustainable initiatives to progress our reputation agenda.</p>
          <p>The structure I announced in March has been fully rolled-out. We've been managing the business on that basis during the second half. From the first half of 2010, we will also present our results under this structure.</p>
          <p>I advised the market earlier this year that our prime focus in the short to medium term would be Australia. This is our largest and most significant market. And we want you to ensure we will not be distracted from taking opportunities and managing through the asset quality cycle.</p>
          <p>In addition, we indicated we will preserve the value of our international business through organic and bolt-on opportunities as they arose. Consistent with this strategy, we've added value to our portfolio through well-priced strategic acquisitions and organic growth. We have strengthened our wealth capabilities with the acquisition of Aviva and the private client business of Goldman Sachs JBWere, which we expect to complete in coming weeks. In 2010, our focus will be consolidating these acquisitions and demonstrating the full leverage of our customer franchise as more customers seek financial advice. MLC has a good integration track record and we are confident that the management team will maximize the benefits from these businesses.</p>
          <p>We have taken decisive actions to position our retail business for improved performance. In the second half, we made incremental steps to build our position through the joint venture with Costco which doubled our ATM network and through the acquisition of Challenger, giving us a stronger position in the broking market.</p>
          <p>A key driver of our underlying profit in 2009 was the strength of our business bank. Our business bank is growing lending volume significantly ahead of the market. In 2010, we will continue to invest in this business. We plan to appoint a further 200 frontline bankers in addition of the 145 new bankers we've appointed since March. This investment recognizes the strength of our position in business banking and the focus of the executive team on continuing to grow our share of this market.</p>
          <p>The 2009 result is a solid performance for the National Australia Bank. It is based on good revenue growth and cost control. Our balance sheet remained strong. We will continue to invest in our business and our reputation to deliver sustainable returns for all of our stakeholders.</p>
          <p>I'll now invite Mark to take you through the detail of the result.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Cameron, and good morning everyone. As you've already seen from Cameron's slides and from the materials, this is a remarkably stable result. It's down 2% year-on-year and about 10% half-on-half, but I say remarkably stable because it has, as we all know, being the most extraordinary year. So we've had a rollercoaster ride in the Aussie dollar, we've had a collapse in interest rates. We are well into what looks like a full B&amp;DD cycle particularly on the business side. We've seen a surge in markets activity and the profit opportunities in markets. We've entered a new pricing regime and NAB alone has raised $8 billion in capital or nearly $8 billion.</p>
          <p>So that all &#x2013; all those things net off to be nearly the same number is quite remarkable. And I'm sure that you will understand that there is some residual volatility therefore in where that result comes from. So in a couple of places as we go through the materials I will try and make some observations to help normalize some of those numbers to give you a better base to understand how the underlying business is performing and we can in our interactions over the next few days continue to build on that for you.</p>
          <p>So let me draw a few things out of this summary of the Group financial result. First of all, there is a strong performance on the revenue side. We've got 9.7% growth in net operating income although the second half is weaker 1.4%. A major contributor to the strength in revenue has been the markets business particularly in the first half of the year where the crises was at its most intense. And a good part of the explanation for the decline in the second half is that while the markets business was still strong, it was not nearly as strong as it was in the first.</p>
          <p>Now, my first attempt to normalize, if we were to hold aside quite a long list of things, which is &#x2013; that the difference in half-on-half markets performance, the fact that GWB in the year-on-year is at 12 months consolidation versus four in the prior year, put MLC, foreign exchange at one side, and also good deal of volatility in the treasury. So in other words you peel it back to the underlying business banking franchises, then the revenue growth for the year is about 5% and for the half-on-half is about 5%. So I appreciate that's taking a lot of things away but hopefully gives you a sense of the momentum in the underlying businesses, which is increasingly coming from pricing and less from volume growth because the economic conditions are not supporting volume growth. In fact, as we get into it you will see there has been some shrinkage in our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The second thing I would point out is the continuation of operating expense disciplines. We have 4.2% expense growth for the year. Again, adjusting for the inclusion of GWB for a full year that's 2.9. Now, as you all know and as we foreshadowed we have taken some costs below the line about $250 million, it's about 190 in the second half, there's been very, very discipline around the sorts of costs that would qualify to go into that form of treatment and they are one off costs as Cameron said associated with accelerating projects that improve our efficiency. They yielded just over $100 million of benefits this year and are geared to deliver more than $300 million of benefits next year. We will probably continue that treatment for about 12 more months and then bring that to a conclusion.</p>
          <p>So however you cut the costs and the revenues means we have maintained positive jaws which we are very pleased about in this environment. And the other thing I would say is the result has been achieved with a continuing emphasis on maintaining a strong balance sheet. So you'll see the two sided coin of the capital raising that our ROE has fallen quite substantially to 11.8%, but the Tier-1 ratio is now very strong 8.96% and I'll say obviously more about that later.</p>
          <p>You can see that our RWAs are flat but in the second half there is actually a $10 billion decline in RWAs and with all the share issuance that's gone on the cash EPS is proportionately weaker.</p>
          <p>And finally on the dividend payout, we have a 74% payout for the year, 80.6 for the second half, obviously this is not an equilibrium but we are very well capitalized and so we are holding our dividend as we go through this part of the cycle and we are hopeful if current trends continue we can return to a more normal payout ratio and resume the growth in dividends in the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>The other thing I would say is obviously there's a significant B&amp;DD headwind this year with the B&amp;DD expense being 87 basis points so the average balance sheet GLAs which is a significant increase on the prior year particularly as the prior year if you will recall had about $1 billion of CDO expenses in it.</p>
          <p>So just going to the underlying business performance, and if you look at the chart across the bottom you can see at the underlying level, the strength is really coming in two areas, first of all out of the Australian Bank and secondly out of nabCapital. And just to dwell on those two for a moment. In the Australian Bank it's really volumes, pricing, tight cost control all the things that you would hope for that delivers that results and it is quite strong. You can see there for business and private banking where the expense growth is a little higher because we have been consciously investing in that business with new banking centers and more bankers and the like. At 14.3% and the retail at 19.8% and retail has a very, very flat cost base through this period.</p>
          <p>What I would say is that there are some treasury effects that particularly effect the business bank both through the non-recurring of some benefits in '08 and also some particular headwinds associated with the crisis in this year and that's a restatement of the business and private bank underlying performance would have it about 18.3% for the year and 8.8% half-on-half. So, again, that's something we can get into a better explanation with you over the coming days, but that just again gives you a sense of the momentum in that business.</p>
          <p>On the retail side there has been attention to pricing. There's been good traction on deposit volumes, and in the first half in particular there were some benefits stemming from the substantial rate cuts that went on. The wealth business is obviously much weaker, really both sides of the business had their issues on the investment side much lower from as I'm sure those of you in the industry would be well familiar with. And on the insurance side, a real off-trend claims experience particularly on the death side. So those two things combining to weaken the MLC result but of course the forward looking view on that is beginning to look much better.</p>
          <p>With respect to the U.K, the U.K actually held its underlying profitability up 2% year-on-year, which again is quite remarkable because the basis risk experienced &#x2013; expense experienced by that business was &#xA3;172 million; about 120 of it coming in the first half and about 50 in the second half. And it was through repricing, through considerable attention to the costs side and through some gains made about &#xA3;38 million of gains made in buying back its own secured &#x2013; small proportion of its own securitized paper. It was a combination of those things that really enabled the business to sit pretty flat, which is good I think considering the operating environment there.</p>
          <p>And then the strength in nabCapital is of course all to do with the markets performance or substantially to do with the markets performance in treasury. Although in the second half, we do really start to see some of the benefits of repricing coming through in that business as well.</p>
          <p>The only other comments I would really make with reference to the half-on-half is you see quite a significant drop in New Zealand from 417 to 359. Well, 44 million of that change is &#x2013; if you remember back to the half, the early repayment fees from customers breaking fixed mortgages, which gave about a $20 million benefit that had to be brought to account in one lump in the first half and a good chunk of the economic cost associated with that came through in the second half. So you get like a $44 million swing from that particular item. Nevertheless, there is ongoing and continuing escalation of pressure on deposit margins in that market. So there is a downward trend that is still being felt. And in nabCapital, the drop from 1035 to 848 just comes back to strong markets performance, but not as strong in the second half.</p>
          <p>If we go down then to the cash earnings line, again, if you look at the chart across the bottom, you see that all the businesses &#x2013; all the banking businesses in a cash earnings sense were negative because of the substantial B&amp;DD headwind. So for the Australian Bank for example, the B&amp;DD uplift was $1 billion year-over-year. And in the U.K., it was a &#xA3;250 million uplift. Now, the one exception to that is nabCapital, ironically, which had about $400 million drop in its B&amp;DD expense. Last year was a billion of CDOs and 400 million of other customers and this year was about a billion of other customers. So it is an upswing, but with the conduit assets not repeating, of course, you get a positive effect. And so they are the items that contribute to the cash earnings outcome.</p>
          <p>Let me spend a little bit of time on the balance sheet. Beginning with the Tier-1 and believe it or not, we've simplified this chart because there were so many moving items. But obviously, there has been a lot of capital activity during the half, so this is a half-on-half raw forward. We underwrote to 500 million the interim DRP, we had two billion and then 750 million of SPP placements, and we had hybrid issuance both institutional and retail. So that's obviously, provided a great boost to the capital base. Against that we have had, a number of acquisitions and we've brought to bear the goodwill component of those acquisitions. There will be further hits to capital when we actually consolidate the businesses. We've had a big turnaround on some of the below the line items in our statutory profits. And we've settled a number of tax cases, I'll talk about that a little more and the U.K. pension deficit has continued to worsen and now sits at about a 12 basis point deduction from capital. So &#x2013; and then, if you look the fourth number and you'll see the RWA movement is actually negative, which I foreshadowed on the opening slide.</p>
          <p>So lots of ins and outs but bringing us to a very strong capitals position 8.96. We're not saying that nine is the new eight. We do actually &#x2013; we can already see certain headwinds to capital. For example, there is the expectation that the industry will move to reinstate the general reserve for credit losses which will probably cost us 10 to 12 basis points of capital. I mentioned the acquisitions. And of course, there is a wider and very fundamental regulatory debate about what should count this capital, what should be deductions and what is an appropriate level of capital, as well as the prospect of an increased focus on a general leverage ratio.</p>
          <p>So we think that it's better to be strong on capital until the dust settles on all those things and it's easier to move from a strong position to the new standard than it is to move from a weak position to the new standard.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would say, one of the benefits of being strong on capital now is that we would like as much as possible next year to not be leveraging the government guarantee on our wholesale term borrowing. And so to have capital not an issue while you go through that transition is quite helpful.</p>
          <p>So let me just dig in on a couple of those. First of all the credit RWA movement over the period, the six months period, dropping from 322 to 312 and it's really attributable to these five items. First of all, a gain or rather an increase in credit RWAs from credit quality, which shows that pro-cyclicality is still with us and in fact particularly in the SME basis we incorporate June 30 information and it's quite likely that there will be upward pressure on RWAs in that particular base.</p>
          <p>That said, there are early signs at the larger corporate and institutional end that there may be some unwinding of RWAs. In particular, higher share market helps some customers in their ratios and also as you will see in a little while a number of customer through capital raising and asset sales have been retiring debt, and again, that tends to help. So we are perhaps going to see it unwind at the high end, but we're still going to experience it rising most likely given that it will be a lag indicator at the SME end. We're not seeing as much activity at the retail end by any means.</p>
          <p>Secondly we have adjusted our calculations in quite a large number of cases. We're changed the treatment of our New Zealand RWAs and now consolidate them at the more stringent calculation of the RBNZ or APRA. We have also moved to increase the waiting on our securitization assets particularly the CSOs and the credit wrapped bonds which is added about three billion and so there is a slew about the adjustments that have been made to make sure that all the calculations are robust. So that's taken the RWAs up about 12 billion in the period. There is a big exchange rate effect which is offset in the Tier-1 calculation by a move on the foreign currency translation reserve.</p>
          <p>Then you can see the net growth in the balance sheet is negative three billion, and as you'll see in a moment that's really due to quite a substantial late run off in the nabCapital balance sheet from large corporates. And then our RWA optimization program post accreditation continues yielding about 30 basis points of capital in this six month period in bringing to just over a 100 basis points the benefits of optimization post accreditation thus far.</p>
          <p>Turning then to the items between cash earnings and statutory earnings and you are familiar with a number of these. The treasury shares line still mystifies me but if we put that aside. The fair value and hedge ineffectiveness, if you remember at the half we had quite a substantial boost due to the behavior of interest rates and the Australian dollar. It was quite handy at the time from a capital point of view. That of course all reversed in the second half, taking out 555 and fairly consistent year-on-year picture. You then see the EQS initiatives, which is the cost we've put below the line, our stated gross. The tax litigation is around the ex-caps and the settlement of the New Zealand. Well, not settlement but the provision against the judgment in the New Zealand tax case. And other litigation is a topping up of our Bell provision until we get clear line of site as to what the settlement might be.</p>
          <p>So all of these things bring the cash earnings for the year 3.8 down to 2.6, and for the second half, actually put it slightly into loss at $75 million. But hopefully, none of these items will be recurring.</p>
          <p>Let me just move on then to the other aspects of the balance sheet, the funding and liquidity picture, which I think is a good picture. We have continued the strengthening trend in our funding ratios. Importantly, that's been achieved at the customer funding level more than at the term funding level. So the customer funding index has gone from 56% in the September '08 to 59% in September '09 and you will see all the businesses had good contribution on the customer deposit line but we've also continued to average up our term funding index bringing the stable funding to 78%, which is a trend we like and we will probably seek to continue.</p>
          <p>Our liquid asset holdings remain at multiples of where they were historically. Liquid asset holdings have been quite expensive in the current environment probably cost us $110 million more this year than last year given the nature of the yield curve; nevertheless they are a valuable components of the balance sheet in this environment. Of course there is quite a bit of debate around where this may be going and so we will have to wait to see where that all levels out but for now I think we are very comfortable with the level of liquids that we are holding.</p>
          <p>On the term funding side, we had a target term funding $19 billion for the year. We actually raised 32 billion, which effectively means we are 12 or $13 billion pre-funded for our requirements this year. Now that may be wise if funding becomes difficult again or it may be unwise because spreads may continue to narrow but it's an example of us erring on the conservative side and just preferring to have the term funding in the door.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously, in the first half we were very heavily reliant on the government guarantee, but pleasingly in the second half 50% of our issuance and particularly the last few issues were unguranteed as the spreads came in to the point where the debt investors were focused on why the government was getting twice as much spread as they were and perhaps they should tap into that. So, we're quite hopeful barring any shocks that we can have the vast majority of our issuance next year in an unguranteed format because we think there is good demand there as indeed there has been on the &#x2013; to capital side with capital of the banks making significant subordinated &#x2013; long-term subordinated debt issuance and the like. So that's definitely ungluing.</p>
          <p>And then finally on the bottom rack, we continue to term out as best we can so that we don't have refunding peaks that we will have to do deal with in future periods. So, the term funding tenure, the average maturity to first call of the issuance during the year was 4.2 years. So we're tending to favor the long parts of the curve as much as we can.</p>
          <p>On the retail deposit side as I said to you, all the franchises have done quite well. In the Australian Bank, in the last six months, a 7.3% increase, in the U.K. 7%, in New Zealand which had been losing share in the six months to March '09 then really regaining that share in the second half. So, the Australian Bank grew at about 1.5 times system, we also transferred in some deposits from our wealth business but they are not included in that statistic. The U.K Bank grew at many multiples system experiencing something of a flight to quality and New Zealand, the market share having made up for the first half is pretty much steady.</p>
          <p>Now this is not just us raising rates and attracting people in that way. It's being done at very fundamental level working with bankers and their score cards, calling on customers for support, the nature of products and sharing of best practices between the businesses. So this is not a rush to the top in terms of the price that's being offered, but it's a steady exploitation of our potential in the deposit given the strength of our lending and the nature of the customer relationships that we have.</p>
          <p>I think, generally in the long run, we'll be quite comfortable if our deposit book is growing at system. So I don't think we want to have lofty ambitions in this, but we may err on the side of just tapping the potential as I say inherent in our relationships, which could lead to a slightly better outcome than that.</p>
          <p>Then on the business lending side, you can see some quite different pictures here really, the Australian Bank growing at 5.6% over the last six months, continuing strong momentum actually and achieved in a business credit environment or market that actually shrank. So by the statistics business lending shrunk about 3.5% over the year, if we look at all Australia, we are up about 3.7, by the way this is the 11 months to August. But the SME, just isolating the SME component was actually up 7.7%. So the investment in that franchise and its inherent strengths and the momentum are still very positive despite system figures that are less encouraging.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., our business exposures were pretty flat and in fact down half a percent, but the system is down 2.2%. And clients there was very much open for business. As a bank, it had about &#xA3;4 billion of new lending in the second half of which about two billion was going into the business segment. So there is still lot of activity underlying that flatten us and as I say it's better than the system.</p>
          <p>New Zealand really just continued its momentum, gaining share in &#x2013; particularly in segments that it's interested in, but moving much in line with the market. And then you can see the late run-off in nabCapital with the business lending balance is falling from 56 billion to 49 billion, reflective as I say of capital raisings and some assets divestments and corporates looking to strengthen their balance sheets.</p>
          <p>On the retail side, the growth is less spectacular. In the case of the U.K. and New Zealand, I think that really reflects the recessionary conditions in those markets. In the case of New Zealand, as you know, we were operating well below the system in all of our channels, partly &#x2013; well, party because of issues in the channels and party because where the activity was which tended to be focused at the first home buyer, which is not a natural area for our retail franchise, and of course, we rely heavily on our business franchise for mortgage sales and there wasn't much activity at that end either.</p>
          <p>So I think for the year &#x2013; or let me give you for the second half, the proprietary network in the second half was at 0.8 times system, out broker channel was 0.6 and our business bank was at 0.8. For the fourth quarter though there was a step up in all of those and so we do go into next year with good momentum. Our proprietary channel in the fourth quarter was at 0.9, and broker channel was at one, and the business bank was still at 0.8, again reflecting where activity is. So that's quite pleasing I think having had a weak mortgage year that we've got momentum back going into next year. Obviously, unsecured personal lending remains small and very stable.</p>
          <p>So let me take you through what we've experienced on the NIM this year and it's really a tale of two hearts. With the NIM falling from 2.25 to 2.07 this is Group NIM which I don't normally talk about, but I thought I'd be brief this time, so falling from 2.25 to 2.07 in the middle of the year and then back to 2.25 at the end. And just to take you through the franchisees and the effects that they brought about.</p>
          <p>In the Australian Bank early on in the first half of the year was where we really experienced the deposit margin pressure in the Australian Bank. It's also a period of delayed repricing because there was much hanging back on the retail side and on the business side we didn't just mandate price increases to customers by sending them a letter we did it in a &#x2013; by engaging customers, so it took more time to get traction on that. But there was the benefit of the rate cuts in the first half. So the combination of those at the group NIM level was a slight position out of the Australian Bank. The UK took a significant backward step through the basis risk hit, &#xA3;120 million, the prior half had been about &#xA3;40 million.</p>
          <p>New Zealand banking had significant deposit price pressures disguised by the inclusion of the early repayment fees, the 20-odd million dollars on that front. And in nabCapital there is an extraordinary amount of accounting noise as well as some real factors, so you have a 12 negative here which is really about a gain of one basis point from repricing on the lending side about five negative from holding of high levels of liquids and about eight negative of accounting noise to do with the relativities in interest rates mainly across markets.</p>
          <p>That brought us down notionally to 2.07, but as I said, big factor in all that was accounting noise. The second half saw a big uptick in the Australian Bank through repricing benefits and the deposit margins remain much more stable in the second half. In the U.K., again, they were substantially through repricing for the first time their business customers by the end of September. And the basis risk fell from 120 million to &#xA3;50 million, giving a &#xA3;70 million uplift. And so those come- factors combine to give us a three basis point uplift at the group level. In New Zealand you had continued deposit pressures and the reversal of the ERC and in nabCapital you had a seven basis point uplift, which again if we peel it back for reality is a five basis point gain from lending and then something of a reversal on the liquids and some of the accounting noise as well.</p>
          <p>So that's really the journey that we've been on. If you look across the bottom, you see the Australian Bank is now sitting at a NIM of about 265 basis points. The U.K. region has come off the low of 214 and is heading back up; it's 235, and the light shading shows you a normalization for basis risk, if you care to make that adjustment. And New Zealand continues a downward slide partly as a result of the presence of KiwiBank, creating a lot of pressure on deposit margins but also as I say the effect March '09 to September '09 exaggerated by this early repayment phenomenon.</p>
          <p>OOI is even more complicated unfortunately, because this is where a lot of the volatility ends up. And so there are swings between OOI and NII that are quite substantial in the period. We have a big difference in the way markets contributes to this number. We have differences between the prior year and the current year treasury experience and so there is a lot going on in these numbers. I guess, if there's one comforting thought it's the fees, which are a substantial part of this are actually very stable through this period underneath. So if there is reality in there it's stable.</p>
          <p>In the bottom left you can see exactly what's going on in global markets including the nabCapital Treasury through this period. From just over $500 million of revenue in every six months period in the prior year to more than a billion in the first half and 830 million in the second half. This is obviously a very difficult area to forecast. But we do expect things pretty much to normalize next year. So the way we are thinking about this business is that performance will be more like '08 with us growing off the base in '08 as we get better with cross-sell. But I think the extraordinary market conditions of low participation by international banks and dramatic and predictable swings in interest rates and currency are much less likely to be present in FY '10. So that's the way we're thinking about them.</p>
          <p>On the MLC side, as I've already said if you look at the top we have lower contribution on the investment side and on the insurance side in the period, but I would say that both these businesses are actually well-positioned. If you look down the bottom at the funds under management, there's a significant drop in the first half and then a bounce back to previous levels in the second half. And a couple of positive features to draw out of that, firstly that MLC has been very much maintaining its margins through this journey, sitting at around 90 basis points. And secondly, as we like to think to think of &#x2013; as a flight to quality under these conditions and some of the recognition of MLC having taken leadership on fees and transparency, starting to get traction we have three billion of positive net flows in the second half and MLC has gone from an environment where it had a slow erosion in market share to again be taking market share gains.</p>
          <p>On the insurance side, there are some as I mentioned before some one-offs in the prior year, that were helpful and then some headwinds in the current year from claims experience some of it you expect in a downturn such as income protection but on the death side they're obviously real. But we think the insurance side, absent the headwinds, its performance should start to reflect its underlying growth in premiums in force which has been about 11.4 CAGR over the last few years, there is some details in the appendix on that. So a combination of these businesses now being better set up to perform plus some of the acquisitions going in around that franchise I think could make for a more buoyant contribution from the wealth franchise going forward.</p>
          <p>On the costs side, just to peel that back a little for you, in separating here the franchises, if you look from our cost basis, September '08 at 7276 though to just the franchise effect on that 7316 you've actually got a 0.6% growth in expenses in the franchises. Now, there is not huge currency effects in this end to end but there are some and if we normalize for those, the franchises themselves delivered about a 1.1% growth in expenses. So, the expense disciplines are alive and well  in the underlying businesses.</p>
          <p>Then we have the effect of consolidating GWB more fully, and we have some investment at the corporate center, which in particular has been funding some increased investment in Asia, some of the early expenses around our IT transformation, the launch of UBank and these sorts of things, as well as some other initiatives. But in aggregate, if you look at the table center, just normalizing for GWB, that's how we get our 2.9, and then on the bottom right, we have been maintaining our investment spend, despite the downturn, on a consistently defined basis. We had 483 million of spend in the second half. There's always a tilt to the second half, as you know, and pleasingly, a good proportion of it now is directed at the business and much less at compliance projects. Although coming out of this crisis and the likely reaction to it on numerous fronts, it wouldn't be a surprise to see some increased spend on the compliance side at some stage.</p>
          <p>Coming then to the bad and doubtful debts. You can see here, first of all, with the charge itself, reasonable stabilization in the expense. It's actually up just over 190 million, half-on-half. Which, ignoring the CDOs is a big step-up on the prior year, as we've already noted. But much more of it now is specifics coming through with the collectives remaining fairly stable, partly because we are comfortable with the level of our collectives and partly because the underlying credit changes in the portfolios themselves are not that dramatic.</p>
          <p>So relative stability in the expense, you can see on the top right there that the Australian franchise in the U.K. largely account for the expense now. And if you look at the light blue, you can see March '09 looked to be the worst experience for nabCapital, with something of a softening in the bad debt expense in nabCapital in this last six months. So that's a hopeful sign that that part of the portfolio at least may have passed its peak.</p>
          <p>Down the bottom, collective provision balances are pretty flat. In fact there's quite a significant foreign exchange negative in there. They have, in an underlying sense, continued to grow somewhat and you can see in the specific provision balances just how strongly the business franchise is feature.</p>
          <p>And then the coverage ratios are set out bottom right and as you know the one we focus on is collective provision as a percent of credit risk weighted assets ex-housing and that ratio has continued to strengthen in the period; it's now 1.46%, it was 1.07 at PCP. So we are continuing to put in place collected provisions ahead of the &#x2013; what we can see in the underlying portfolios.</p>
          <p>Then just some reflections on the Group portfolio and how things are behaving. The top hasn't changed terribly much. You are already aware of the diversity of the portfolio. What I would say, looking at the top right, is that the non-retail exposures, the proportion in investment grade is very stable now at 74%, down only slightly on the September '08 position.</p>
          <p>Similarly on the categorized assets, if you look bottom left, there is a leveling off in the categorized assets. So it's difficult unless you have a ruler to read those numbers but the watch loans, just commenting on the June '09 to September '09 picture, the watch loans are up from 15.1 to 15.7. As you know, we have a very generous definition of watch loans, so it's not something that's comparable across banks but it is something that you can look at through time to get some sense of what's going on. The 90 days past due are down from 2.3 billion to 2.1 billion and the impaired assets are flat at 5.5 billion.</p>
          <p>And then on the bottom right, you can see the 90 day past due and impaired assets a percent of GL&amp;A by product, just to give you a sense of what's going on in there.</p>
          <p>Just to take a moment on the U.K. and this is a picture consistent with the special briefing we did on the U.K. with the last results. You already know the construct of the portfolio. It's a substantial mortgage portfolio. We've had shrinking unsecured lending. We have about &#xA3;8 billion in commercial property, three quarters of it in investment property and about two in development. And then the development portfolio, down the bottom, is very substantially residential development.</p>
          <p>Now there is good and bad in this. The development portfolio, despite its small size, is actually driving about 45% of the bad debt expense in the U.K. The behavior of most of the other asset classes is pretty much aligned with our experience in other countries at this stage.</p>
          <p>So it is &#x2013; so that is the problem area. It could have caused &#x2013; be much worse in that &#x2013; in the U.K., housing prices have probably corrected 20, maybe a little bit more percent, whereas other forms of commercial property have corrected maybe 45, 50%.</p>
          <p>So we are operating primarily in a category of commercial property which has been perhaps less affected. Nevertheless, it is still driving the charge. As Cameron said, we are forecasting a weak recovery in the U.K., which is a negative, but what I would say on the housing side is that house prices rose, I think 1.6% in August, which is the fourth consecutive rise, which is good news. And our general mortgage portfolio continues to perform extremely well. It has 90-day past dues of 80 basis points which compares to Australia of 57, so all the other parts of the portfolio are well in control.</p>
          <p>As we foreshadowed, we are in the process of creating a specialized Group asset area that will be headed by Peter Thodey, which is really non-franchise assets that we will put into orderly run-off. It's not a bad bank. It's just a series of exposures that, either because of the amount of capital or the nature of the returns or the relevance to the rest of our franchise, we think don't represent the sort of business that we will support in the future. That's &#x2013; there will be lots of detailed disclosure around this before our half-year results next year. But there are still, at the margins, some things moving around this, so we just want to be quite general in giving you an indication of what it will look like.</p>
          <p>At the moment, it's about $24 billion of credit risk weighted assets, representing about 20 billion of commitments and 17 million of drawings. It's just an indicative split of that is about nine billion out of the conduit assets, of course, including the third-party purchased conduit assets. About eight billion in vanilla corporate loans, three billion leverage loan book and some project finance credit wrapped bonds and some associated derivatives.</p>
          <p>Just to give you a sense of where it's come from. Prior to formation of SGA, these were nabCapital assets, and of which about 13 billion were managed from the U.K., about seven from the U.S. and the remainder from Australia. So as I say, that's set for an ordinary run-off. Unfortunately, the weighted average contractual term of the underlying assets is about eight years so I'll probably run-off before they run-off.</p>
          <p>Then, finally, with respect to the nabCapital securitization portfolio or the conduit assets, the overall behavior of the portfolio is pretty much as we have anticipated. It's pretty stable, with slight decay in certain areas. The balance is down to 13 billion from 17 at the half. Obviously, the foreign exchange is a big part of that but there were about 1.9 billion of genuine exists in the period. There were some credit events that are relevant, the monolines were downgraded. There were some defaults in the underlying pools of names under the SCDOs, but all of that was pretty much as we had anticipated and doesn't really change anything substantially. Although we did take an additional $50 million provision against the credit wrapped bonds anticipating that at some stage the monolines may stop paying on their policies which of course they haven't done yet, which would then expose us to the behavior of the underlying bonds.</p>
          <p>It's likely that at some stage two of the six SCDO instruments will move below investment grade. I think the longer we manage these things, more comfortable we get in making decisions around them, and we have a firm view as to the expected loss over the long run.</p>
          <p>And in an orderly manner we will decide whether we want to hedge them slightly or whether we were comfortable with them sitting at just slightly sub-investment grade, so we will just manage that as we go along. But no sudden changes there and no sudden changes anticipated.</p>
          <p>So let me conclude by coming back on to the priorities Cameron set out and just reiterating some of the points from a CFO perspective. And just focusing on a few of these, balance sheet strength is still what we're going to run the business to. We're not optimizing it to earnings. We're optimizing it to balance sheet strength; that means elevated levels of liquidity possibly even enhanced levels of liquidity. We'll stay strong on capital, but when the dust settles around the regulatory debate we would hope that there's room to begin to grow into that capital base and move the ratios lower. But it is not bold enough to make a prediction on that front at this stage. We will continue to engage in sensible deposit gathering strategies that are more geared to tapping the potential in existing relationships than using price to outbid other banks. And we will continue to term-out as best we can our debt and to provide for very smooth repayment schedule over future years.</p>
          <p>On the efficiency and cost management side, as I've said we will have one more year of accelerated cost take out. We will continue to have a very disciplined set of criteria and oversight of that and then we will begin to pull that to a close. We're still looking to accommodate our bank re-platforming within our current spend rates, so we're not expecting a significant jump up in the level of investment, nor are we expecting it to fall. And we are recommitting to the final piece of guidance in the banking industry which is the NAB cost growth to September 2010, and we will still operate within that, albeit that it's soften somewhat by the below the line position.</p>
          <p>And then finally on portfolio, we are continuing to look very hard at our capital allocation. It's not that the businesses get to deploy capital that they generate. We have a very much a top-down view and we're working on the mechanics also of how capital gets allocated as we work to bring our ROE from where it is now back towards the norms that the industry enjoyed prior to the crisis.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me end and invite any comments or questions.</p>

          <p>It's James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. Guys I just wanted a bit more information on the margin if I could. Obviously, quite a big movement at the Group in the second half. I just wanted to get an idea as to how sustainable is that? I know you've gone through parts of it, but just wondering is there any sort of accounting noise in there that we need to back out that will flow out into the 2010 year. And are we seeing similar trends walk through into the October period as what you saw finishing up in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are some one offs. I mean, for example, the benefits of the rate cuts in the current year or in '09 won't repeat in 2010. So there are some things that have helped that won't recur but generally speaking the businesses have good traction on repricing now. So not only will they continue to go on that but you will get a full year effect of what was done in prior years. So I guess &#x2013; so that's supportive.</p>
          <p>That said, competition is increasing and price is back as a competitive weapon. So there are various sources that will come to bear on this and it's a bit hard to say exactly what the outcome is going to be. My own view of it is that it's more likely that margins will be fairly stable than it is that you'll see dramatic upward trend in margins.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod Martin, Royal Bank of Scotland. Couple of questions on bad debt charges. If I listen to what you said just on reference to slides 19 and 20, you said <mark type="inaudible" /> assets are flat between June and September, 90 days past due lines are down, you mentioned that underlying credit rating changes in the portfolio were low and nabCapital potentially has passed its peak in terms of bad debt charge. I am wanting to understand, at what point are you willing to say that you've hit the peak in bad debts? What do you need to see to be a bit more concrete in terms of the outlook for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we need to see a couple of things. Obviously, they're all positive, as you have pointed out, but we are going to start to see the effects of stimulus unwind, that's been a reasonable underpinning impact. We are going into a rising interest rate environment, so it's not clear yet what impact that's going to have on consumer sentiment as well. So yeah, I think you've got a couple of things in there that would suggest to us we do need to see probably a little more traction over the next six to 12 months to get a sense about whether we are peaking or not.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Flipping it round, is there a situation where you see bad debts spiking up from where they are at this point?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; yeah, there's a number of risk to that. I mean, you've got some global risks. Okay? So that, if you start to see some downturn in -- some of the Asian demand is obviously fueling -- particularly strength in mining and construction. Probably the most significant one will be unemployment. So six months ago, we thought unemployment would peak at 8% <mark type="inaudible" /> as I said in my remarks, and now we're saying 6.7. If you've got something there where you got a marked change in unemployment, that could have an impact.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John Locke from UBS. Just a question on the rate pricing. You're saying a period of rate pricing now is going on for around 12 months, especially in the business bank <mark type="inaudible" /> area domestically, and a lot of that was due to the economic conditions being not as good as people thought but since that time, we've seen the Australian economy continue to perform pretty well and beat people's expectations.</p>
          <p>Are we still in the period of repricing, or are we now in a period where it's difficult to go to customers and tell them that they should be paying a higher spread when they look around and say, hey, things aren't really that bad out there, why should I be paying for that? Is repricing coming to an end?</p>
          <p>And following that on, if we're in a period where credit growth is going to be pretty benign, if repricing doesn't continue and you did say that margins will probably be flat, where's the revenue growth going to come from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, a few questions in there. The &#x2013; I'll see what I got. In terms of repricing, I guess, like many things in the result, there's two parts to this. In terms of where we are in the cycle, we're about &#x2013; at the corporate end, we're getting close to the end of that. It's about 75% of the corporate books being repriced, at the top end of the business bank about 60 and SME about 40. So that's kind of the mix of where repricing is going through the book.</p>
          <p>Competition, other people have worked out that Australia's probably performed better, so we're actually starting to see some quite significant competitive pressures come back in. So that could have a muting effect.</p>
          <p>In terms of revenue growth, we think it's going to come from if you've got a strength in the franchise and what we've deliberately done that &#x2013; it's been a very conscious focus that, in many respects, you build the strength of your franchise, particularly in the business bank and how you deal with the last 12 months and that can provide sustainable. So we've been very conscious about how we've handled that repricing. We've been prepared for it to take longer. When you look at those stats, they are obviously, we're prepared for it to take longer if it builds a sustainable relationship. We're not about ringing a customer up and saying, guess what, here's another 100 basis points.</p>
          <p>So we think the way you deal with the customers and the way you support customers builds <mark type="inaudible" /> franchise, that's been a lesson of past crisises. So we've tried to learn that. So we would think &#x2013; we would hope that the strength of that particular business bank would be one of the source of revenue growth for us in the future.</p>

          <p>Thank you. it's Craig Williams from Citi here. Just with respect to the retail bank reinvigoration that you are undertaking, how long do you think it will take to convince the Australian public that NAB, or any bank, is a fair bank? And what sort of investment is required to satisfy customer service expectations in the retail bank to meet the anticipated uplift in customer enquiry <mark type="inaudible" /> fee initiatives i.e., call centers <mark type="inaudible" /> staff, that sort of thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've got to keep investing, we've been doing that. Look, the &#x2013; pleasingly, on the fee initiatives, we're seeing a reduction in customer defection, we're seeing an increase in customer acquisition and a plummeting in complaints. That all starts to build a sustainable business model for you. We've doubled our ATM fleet. In fact, we have the largest number of unique ATMs in the country now. We've made a &#x2013; finally, NAB's made a commitment to broking after a fairly indifferent attitude <mark type="inaudible" /> with the Challenger acquisition definitively in there. We're investing in the call centers. We've introduced voice biometrics, we're pleased in the Roy Morgan survey, released yesterday, that NAB's experienced the largest gain year-on-year in retail customer satisfaction, still four out of four, unacceptable, but particularly in the second half, a significant lift. And particularly importantly a drop in customers, so we'll be positioned from being the worst in the industry into main financial institution defection, to the best.</p>
          <p>How long will it take for the public to buy into that? Years. When I made the commitment back in March. It's taken years for us to ruin our reputation; it'll take us years for it to return. We are committed, as an executive team, to taking initiatives to improve reputation and we believe that if we continue to do it &#x2013; it's not just about fees, it's about the $150 million <mark type="inaudible" /> micro finances, about social inclusion, the whole range of other things that we do. That &#x2013; it will be, if each initiative we do, a few more customers will buy in that we're actually serious about it, and that it's bit more than a gimmick and certainly as an executive team we remain committed to it. So we'll continue to invest, I mean in the retail business. We recognize where we are, but we are very committed to continuous sustainably chipping away and being seen as a leader of reputation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Scott Manning from J.P. Morgan. I have one question on capital, it happens to have three parts to it. Firstly just on slide 10, the offset between the deterioration in credit quality versus the optimization of risk weighted assets and also the poor outlook for growth next year. Are you expecting those type of mechanics to repeat, so the outlook for risk weighted asset growth next year is effectively flat? Secondly on capital ratio, is the push globally towards extraction of hybrids so we are looking at a core Tier 1 ratio, do you think that will be the constraint going forward? And thirdly, how do you think you're looking on the kind of raw gearing ratio that just looks at the size of the balance sheet relative to tangible equity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So on the credit RWAs, I &#x2013; we will certainly do more optimization. We have some more targets that we will be going after. Bear in mind, a lot of this could have been done in the run into accreditation; it wasn't, so we're really just tapping the potential of Basel II that was always there.</p>
          <p>So we have that initiative continuing to go. So that will deliver some benefits over the period. Can you hear me now? So, on the price cyclicality, I think it probably &#x2013; it certainly will happen in the SME book that we will get a pro-cyclical effect. The question will be whether and to what degree there is an offset in the nabCapital part of the portfolio. But I suspect the SME will win. So we will still have probably a negative, rather an increase in credit RWAs, out of net of those two items.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I'm not going to predict where the debate is going to come out on Tier 1 versus core. I think it's certainly true to say that some of the Tier 2 instruments didn't perform particularly well during the crisis and so the attitudes to things like subordinated debt are fairly negative.</p>
          <p>I think it remains to be seen whether hybrids will go the same way. Certainly, the Australian banks don't have the same proportion of hybrids as some of the European banks, for example. So we look reasonably good on core Tier 1 ratios and we'll just have to see where that pops-out.</p>
          <p>However, on the gearing ratio, we don't look as good, because the low risk rates associated with Australian Housing don't show through in a simple gearing ratio. So the Aussie banks start to look a little bit out of line on that ratio. But it would be &#x2013; hopefully a fall-back measure rather than the central measure that people focus on and it will be &#x2013; a) we'll have to see where that comes out and b) we may have a &#x2013; have to have a process of educating people, as we have in other areas through time, to understand the differences in Australia.</p>

          <p>It's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. You mentioned some of the good trends in credit quality, but the new impaired assets actually increased from $2.8 billion in the first half to 3.7 billion in the second half. I am wondering if the improvement in the economy meant that you had better quarter-on-quarter trends within the second half? What're your expectations for the first half of next year and were you disappointed with the business bank line loss charge, given that we're apparently in a much better economic environment than we were six months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, bad debts are a lagging indicator. So, what you've seeing in the second half is a function, in many respects, of the first half economic activity. So I haven't been disappointed in the business bank this year at all, on the contrary, I've been very pleased with its momentum.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said before, I think we will see a rise in SME and because where &#x2013; it's been coming out of nabCapital and large corporates. SME's just catching up and the others are going in the opposite direction. So it will be a question of how they trade off, but we will certainly see an upswing in SME, but SME is reasonably responsive to the economic condition. So confidence is very high. Activity is reasonably high, although I think absent stimulus spending, it's not that strong and so it will be very important to see how we go through this Christmas holiday period for example.</p>
          <p>March this year was a real peak for delinquencies and we will have to see if next March is a real peak as well. So I think we are about to find out over the next four or five months.</p>

          <p>James Ellis from Credit Suisse. Just coming back to that question of capital and regulation. If we get a situation where the Northern Hemisphere very tough capital rules were introduced, what risk do you see that APRA just introduces those into Australia, given the push towards more global standardization of capital? What do you think <mark type="inaudible" /> will sort of take the view that if it's not applicable to Australia we won't introduce them, what's your timeframe for getting clarity around the regulatory risks? Is it going to drag on inexorably, or are we going to know fairly soon, so that you are comfortable to guarantee your capital ratios?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On second point, I think we have been accounting for speed of resolution even if the resolution is not something we are happy with because at least we can do with a certain environment. You can't have this debate dragging on, because the longer the debate drags on, the cycle changes, so the debate kind of changes.</p>
          <p>I think as Mark said, we really can't predict at the end of the day, whether or not there's going to be a drive for us to adhere to a global standard that maybe arguably not appropriate for Australia, or whether in fact Australia will say the reality, the regulatory environment, served us well, which it has and we can stand to a different system. You see microcosms of that debate now. One of them is on liquidity holdings, we would rather be a little stronger on capital and be able to deal with those buffers and we can see already, as we said some of those headwinds which you're really likely to come to see is probably settled fairly quickly down about 8.5% Tier 1 just on some of the headwinds we can see. We'd rather have that position to be able to migrate down than suddenly be out there trying to say we need to move up based on the stance. So I think we're fairly comfortable, I think that we've got the buffers you need to deal with, but it's an open question as to whether we're again somewhat standalone or maybe moving to a global standard.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brian Johnson, CLSA. I have a question predictably about the conduit. I just like to go back to what was said in the first half '09 result. On page 25, it spoke about how APRA were talking about some kind of regulatory provisioning for the conduit. Today we hear now for the first time talking about the resumption of the general reserve credit losses, which aren't thinking the same as sectoral.</p>
          <p>I want to speak to the other banks who are certainly not saying that. I also note on page 122, note six, most smallest font you can possibly imagine, but the securitization exposures have fallen from 22.5 billion to 17.6, which I believe the big cause for that is the conduit. Yet the risk assets have gone from 7.8 up to 11 bill, and in that note six is a reference that APRA had basically changed some of the risk weightings on the underlying assets. Is it fair to conclude that the comment that was made that increase in the regulatory capital charge in respect to the conduit, that's where it's basically falling through, or is that not yet been resolved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think well, we've been working with APRA over the six months to get to a better and a shared understanding of the conduit assets. That is probably going to be an ongoing process until the last conduit asset has expired. What we have suggested and implemented along the way and APRA has been comfortable with thus far, is that we increased the risk weights around the CSO. So we have implemented that. And it's not related to the discussion on general reserve credit losses, which is an industry issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, where are we up to on the discussions with that for regarding the regulatory provisioning with respect to the conduit that they spoke about? That was detailed in the first half '09 result?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have implemented what's appropriate. We continue to work with them and make sure they have complete transparency into the portfolio. We are not anticipating any significant changes from this position. But there will be an ongoing engagement and dialogue.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Cameron, 17% of the loan portfolio in commercial property at this point, I realize that it's something that was inherited. We are seeing that loan losses tend to basically lag. Isn't the extreme commercial property concentration we are seeing in Australia and the United Kingdom pretty well everywhere in the NAB franchise? Is that a real barrier to that loan loss perhaps declining given that we are seeing on the global trend we are seeing commercial property, the new wave of bad loan losses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's going to depend on how the economy performs. I mean, obviously what we have seen to-date is I think commercial property be relatively resilient in this market. Mark outlined some of the characteristics of the U.K. portfolio. I think that banks have been taking through the cycle view on commercial property which I think has helped, that certainly wasn't a feature of prior downturns. There is probably still an issue remains around refinancing. But having said that we are now actually seeing some competitive tension come back into the market and the reemergence in the foreign banks and that was -- that will help in refinancing. Yeah, unemployment is going to be a big driver. If you start to see declines in retail, spending, office tenancy and that first half is going to put further pressure. But I think we do have a concentration there. But I think at this stage we're not uncomfortable with that relative to how the economy is going.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. <mark type="inaudible" />. The question on the average balance sheet. The average interest earning assets increased by $20 billion relative to the interest bearing liabilities over the first half, second half '09. Can you comment on why that occurred and what was the impact on the margin?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Average balance sheet moves around for whole bunch of reasons, also to do with some of the fair value and hedged items and the like. So it's not possible to draw conclusions easily from average balance sheet movements and relate them to margin. So if you want to understand that we will have to do an exercise and lay it down for you I think.</p>

          <p>Well, surely in the business bank, we'd had to perform better than the systems we traditionally have. On account it can be forecast as negative five, but then you've got to break it down. It will probably be perhaps flat in SME, but negative in large corporate as I continue to do <mark type="inaudible" />. So, yeah, again it will be a story. But we would hope as we've evidenced this year that we &#x2013; that the strength of the franchises that whatever the &#x2013; however the system turns out, we would hope to perform solid, better than that. And obviously, upside benefit is if the economy gets better and it translates into greater demand then obviously the system will improve and we'd have to improve with it.</p>

          <p>Yeah. This is &#x2013; now I know what you're talking about. This is on the credit default swaps we used to manage our capital exposures to large corporate. So we may engage in a large loan to a corporate; we don't want that much capital exposed to them so we take a credit default swap to effectively limit the capital exposure. As credit spreads blew out in the first half the value of those &#x2013; of that protection increased and in the second half as the spreads came back in that gain reversed and the net position on the CDS portfolio is about neutral. So we've booked about as many gains as we have losses through the period.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think pretty consistent with what we said in March, I think we've tried to stay as focused on that as possible. I mean Australia we said we would reject core market, we didn't want to distracted and I think that served us well over the course of the year, that we haven't been sort of focusing elsewhere and making sure we took opportunities here, ones that would logically build distribution in brands, so I think a little bit of challenge <mark type="inaudible" /> consistent with that.</p>
          <p>Offshore, we said we would have an orientation towards things that really had a strong deposit orientation and strengthen the distribution of the franchise with &#x2013; our appetite for assets offshore is pretty limited.</p>
          <p>And we've done &#x2013; we haven't seen those opportunities in the U.K. market, because clearly the market has been pretty dysfunctional and a majority of the government <mark type="inaudible" />. In the U.S. we've done two small deposit oriented, I would say great ways has been a source of strength for us this year in the sense of, it's probably been <mark type="inaudible" /> it's performed very well, hit what we would expect. So, I think in two years we see normalization in the offshore markets. Yes, we pretty limit on our appetite there, other than those deposit oriented branch strengthening things.</p>
          <p>In Australia, I think we've strengthened the business through what we've seen; I don't &#x2013; the market becomes better I think you're going to see some of those opportunities start to be less available, the prices start to be move out what we thought was fair prices we paid this year. So, I think we're just pretty focused now having consolidated building off that platform next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon. My question was a bit related to Richard's with regard to the fair value item. Just trying to understand whether the second half market income or trading income is at a sustainable level.</p>
          <p>If we have a look at slide 17, you point to the numbers going from sort of 10.79 to 8.34 for global markets and treasury. Then on that page 16, we've got trading income going from 6.42 to 1.46. I guess I was just interested, obviously the 2.79 is one item, but there is a number of other positive fair values that you talk about as well in the discussion. So just again, trying to understand the differences between those two sets of numbers and whether we're at a sort of sustainable level on the trading income going forward whether it was a bit depressed this half due to some of those fair value items?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it was depressed in the second half partly by those items. But there are some fairly big thing swinging around in there. I guess the thing that characterized the difference between the two halves the most was the treasury opportunities in the first half, considerably greater than they were in the second half.</p>
          <p>So there are various swings and roundabouts on the other marks &#x2013; mark-to-market. The underlying customer volumes are not as elevated as they were but still healthy and the pricing is also healthy, but with renewed competition that is going to come under increasing pressure. So I would say next year the treasury opportunities will be less, there'll be more competition around pricing.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, we have good untapped cross-sell potential that will support the business, and as to some of the marks it will really depend on where credit spreads go from here. I mean, if the credit spreads are reasonably stable to the level they have now established then we should see more stability in the marks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just with regard to the treasury income margins, where are they recorded with regard to net interest income versus non-interest income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it depends on the nature. Part of the market's revenue ends up in NII and part of it ends up in OOI, depending on the nature of the particular trade. So some of the first half, particularly rich treasury opportunities I think ended up in NII.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon gentlemen. A question on the commercial real estate exposure, if I may on page 68 and continuing. Really, around the risk tolerance for the commercial real estate Bookham (89), I was wondering about the balance between refinancing and new business. If I look at half-on-half growth rates in Australia and New Zealand, I mean New Zealand, if you annualize the half-on-half, you're seeing about a 14% growth there, Australia about a 6% growth. So I was wondering, what's your risk tolerance and what's the breakdown in terms of the refinancing and a new business volume growth?</p>

          <p>We'll come back to on that one as <mark type="inaudible" /> detailed question. But <mark type="inaudible" /> talk broadly about the risk tolerance as opposed to the half and half movements. I mean, we are very focused on these portfolio and we work consistently through it as a management team as to what our tolerance risk exposure is. In many respects the right thing to do in this sector is to support the sector through and certainly not generate a bigger issue. So I think it's certainly sounding ahead as how to grow at risk attention and assessing what our risk capital is for the sector. We can come down to you on the specifics on the half on half movement.</p>
