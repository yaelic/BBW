          <p>Good day everyone and welcome to today's Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. John Elicker, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Elicker.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Steve. Good morning everybody and thanks for joining us to review fourth quarter full year results as well as discuss our '09 guidance. I know there's a lot going on in the markets today. So thanks for taking the time.</p>
          <p>With me this morning are Jim Cornelius, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jean-Marc Huet, our Chief Financial Officer. Jim and Jean-Marc will have prepared remarks. And then also joining us for the question-and-answer period are Lamberto Andreotti our Chief Operating Officer and Elliott Sigal, our Chief Scientific Officer.</p>
          <p>Before I turn it over to Jim, let me just make a quick few legal comments. During the call, we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects including statements about our financial position, business strategy, research pipeline concerning product development and product potential that constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those discussed in the company's most recent annual report on form 10-K, periodic reports records on 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. These documents are available from the SEC and Bristol-Myers Squibb website or from Bristol-Myers Squibb Investor Relations. In addition, any forward-looking statements represent our estimates only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change. Jim?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Thank you also for joining us. Earlier today, we announced very strong results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2008. And we shared an earnings per share guidance range for 2009 which will be wider than usual with major external uncertainties potentially affecting our results. However, our outlook continues to be positive and is tracking our long-range plan.</p>
          <p>I'm particularly proud of the hard work we've done over the past year to execute our biopharma strategy. Our results in the quarter and in the year show clearly that our strategy is working in the short term. We're delivering on our promises, reaching our financial goals, advancing our String of Pearls strategy at a rapid rate and expanding our productivity initiatives globally.</p>
          <p>We're executing against our plans with speed and with rigor in all areas. As a result, our corporate transformation to a biopharma leader has been relatively quick and decisive. Our financials underscore another strong quarter with improving profit margins leading to very solid operating performance, capping off an excellent year.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, we had diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.61 on a GAAP basis and $0.46 on a non-GAAP basis. For the year, we had diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.59 on a GAAP basis and $1.74 earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis.</p>
          <p>Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, company net sales were up 4% in the quarter, or 8% excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. In the quarter, our important medicines such as Plavix, Abilify, Sustiva and Baraclude continue to achieve significant sales growth around the world.</p>
          <p>During 2008, we continue to fund our rich pipeline at all stages. We submitted ONGLYZA for diabetes, both in the US and in Europe. We presented encouraging Phase II data for dapagliflozin which represents a new mechanism for diabetes as well as promising Phase II data for Apixaban in acute coronary syndrome. We also shared promising early clinical data on both our gamma-secretase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease and our NS5A compound for Hepatitis C. Just last week, we received approval for Sprycel in Japan.</p>
          <p>In the coming year, this year, we budgeted monies for further advancement of our portfolio and pipeline. We're preparing for an FDA decision on ONGLYZA. We're poised to submit our novel biologic belatacept for the prevention of rejection in kidney transplant in both the U.S. and Europe this year. In addition, we're looking forward to presenting the first Phase III data on dapagliflozin as well as additional Phase III data for Apixaban and belatacept at major medical meeting scheduled for this year.</p>
          <p>Our String of Pearls strategy is building on the opportunities we've developed internally. We're identifying potential acquisitions and alliances that can amplify and advance our work in key therapeutic areas particularly those with high unmet medical need such as Alzheimer's disease, Hepatitis C, solid tumors, cardiology, and hematologic malignancies.</p>
          <p>For us, it's a dramatically different approach to business development and is helping us in our goal to create a strong Phase III pipeline in the 2010, '11 timeframe. Since we started with our acquisition of Adnexus in the fall of 2007, we've had a total of six new pearls. In recent months, we added collaborations with Exelixis in two novel cancer programs and with ZymoGenetics for a novel early stage interferon in the development for the treatment of Hepatitis C.</p>
          <p>Overall, we put our cash to good use with this strategy and we continue to actively seek and evaluate opportunities while we ended the year with $8 billion of cash and equivalents still in the bank. Again this quarter we managed expenses well keeping with our promise to become more productive. We've made solid strides resetting our cost base since December of 2007 when we first announced that we would achieve 1.5 billion in cost improvements over three years through our productivity transformation initiative.</p>
          <p>Based on that success, last July, we announced an expansion of the initiative to achieve an additional 1 billion in cost improvements by the end of 2011. Our productivity goals touch all areas of the company and have become part of the Bristol-Myers Squibb culture. With manufacturing, for example, we continue to focus on our network to reach a reduction of more than 50% by 2011 and that's down from 27 plants in 2006.</p>
          <p>With these changes and others underway, we're becoming the midsize company that is leaner, more agile and better able to execute our strategy and adapt quickly to the challenges and opportunities in the external environment. Based on our strong strategic execution in 2008, I'm very confident that we're well-positioned for success in 2009.</p>
          <p>We're providing guidance that our earnings per share will be in the range of $1.58 to $1.73 for 2009, measured on a GAAP basis and in the range of $1.85 to $2 per share on a non-GAAP basis.</p>
          <p>We also continue to project that non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations will grow at a minimum of 15% compounded annual growth rate, that is from the 2007 base through 2010. And that's without rebasing for ConvaTec. I believe that's one of the best growth rates in the industry.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased with the overall financial health of the company especially at a time when so many companies across America are struggling. Our monetization of non-pharma assets and the reallocation of resources has put us in a great position to execute against our business development strategy.</p>
          <p>In summary, we're prepared for another successful year for the company. Our management team is confident that we're in a much better position now compared to a year ago to adapt quickly and face the global challenges in 2009 and the coming years. In doing so, we'll continue to deliver on the commitments we've made both to our shareholders and our patients.</p>
          <p>Thanks again for listening today on a busy day. I'll now turn the call over to Jean-Marc for some color on the details in the financials.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Jim. I will first review the Q4 results and the 2009 guidance before turning to questions. Let me start firstly with revenues. Our total Q4 sales from continuing operations were up 4% or at a very healthy 8% excluding foreign exchange. Sales for the quarter included a negative 4% due to foreign exchange but a positive 5% from price and 3% from the increase in volumes. When it comes to full 2008, our sales were up 13% or a good double-digit growth of 11% excluding foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Q4 pharma sales were up 4% or 8% excluding foreign exchange. This was broad-based growth that we saw across the whole portfolio driven by Plavix, Abilify, our virology business as well as our newer products.</p>
          <p>Let me start with our CV med business. Our US Plavix sales were up 11% for the quarter. This is true sales growth as there is no impact from Apotex. In particular, we are seeing very good growth in new patient starts in PAD.</p>
          <p>Turning to neuroscience, Abilify was up 31% globally and 36% in the US. We witnessed a 31% growth in US prescription trends which is approximately five times the antipsychotic market growth. This reflects our execution against the opportunities in bipolar and the new major depressive disorder indication which is being supported by a strong DTC campaign in the second half of last year. Growth in Europe was supported by the bipolar indication which was launched in mid 2008.</p>
          <p>Now turning to virology, REYATAZ decreased 1% globally although trends in both the US and Europe remain strong. US prescription trends grew at plus 14% in Q4 although US sales were only 4% due to some inventory work down in Q4 of 2008. Our international business is also strong but was somewhat negatively impacted due to foreign exchange. Sustiva franchise sales were up 15% globally behind a strong performance of Atripla. Baraclude sales were at $153 million, up 55% with over $100 million outside the United States.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to immunology. Orencia sales were at just south of $130 million as we continue to make good progress in being the first line biologic of choice in the US. Lastly, oncology. Erbitux sales were flat at $182 million compared to Q3. This was mostly due to lower sales in later lines of treatment for colorectal cancer.</p>
          <p>We do expect this market to be a growth driver long-term as oncologists are able to identify those patients most likely to benefit based on KRAS testing. Global Sprycel sales were at $86 million with continued growth in both the U.S. and Europe. Finally, with IXEMPRA launched in the US last year, generated sales of $25 million.</p>
          <p>Sales for Mead Johnson, our nutrition business, which represents approximately 13% of company sales increased 6% or, again, 11% excluding foreign exchange to $707 million.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, we had high quality revenue growth, be it for the quarter or for the year in each business and geography. The US pharmaceuticals business was particularly strong at plus 13%.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to expenses. Excluding specified items, gross margin increased by 310 basis points to 71.8% compared to the fourth quarter in 2007. Favorable mix in the pharma business, manufacturing cost improvements and some non-recurring costs that took place in Q4 '07 were only partially offset by inflation.</p>
          <p>Excluding specified items again, full year, IE for 2008, gross margins were up 150 basis points to 70.2%. If you look at the gross margins, again excluding specified items for the pharmaceutical business, they were up 170 basis points at 71.8%. Mead Johnson was rather stable at 62.7%, down approximately 50 basis points from last year. So, very good growth and progression of gross margins be it in the quarter or for the year.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to other cost items. Again, excluding specified items, marketing, selling and administration was down 3% or roughly flat if you take FX out of the equation. Importantly, G&amp;A was down 6% or 2% excluding foreign exchange. Advertising and promotion was down 3% or roughly flat for the quarter if you exclude FX.</p>
          <p>Turning to R&amp;D, excluding specified items, this was down 2% to $870 million or roughly flat excluding exchange. Full year R&amp;D was up 5%. This is significant as productivity has enabled us to fully fund R&amp;D and integrate the business development opportunities that took place during 2008.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our effective tax rate, which from continuing operations, before minority interest and income taxes and excluding specified items was at 16.5%. This lower rate reflects the R&amp;D tax credit, which we took in the fourth quarter of last year and a sooner than expected reserve release. The full year rate was 22.3%.</p>
          <p>Our financial condition has improved in the quarter as our cash and cash equivalents increased to approximately 8 billion as a result of firstly strong operating cash flows, but also the proceeds from the ImClone transaction. A significant majority of this cash is onshore and remains invested in treasury and treasury-backed securities, reflecting a conservative investment policy that we initiated earlier in 2008.</p>
          <p>So, today we have a net cash position of 1.5 billion versus a net debt position of $4 billion where we were at this time last year. We also expect to receive proceeds from the proposed 10 to 20% IPO of Mead Johnson in the first half of 2009 and we also importantly announced a working capital initiative during the quarter with the goal of improving cash flows by approximately 1 billion by the end of 2010. While we recognize the need to maintain a strong balance sheet, we are also in a very strong position to continue pursuing business development opportunities.</p>
          <p>Let me now give you a quick update on auction rate securities. During the quarter, we sold some of the assets and we reduced the carrying value of some as well. As a result, the original carrying value of 811 million at the end of 2007 has now been reduced to under $100 million, representing interest in insurance securitizations.</p>
          <p>So, in general very strong sales excluding FX, improved gross margins, and effective expense management has driven improvement in pre-tax as well as net margins.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations grew by 53% to $0.46 from $0.30 in Q4 of 2007. Our GAAP EPS from continuing operations was at $0.61, as the gain from the ImClone transaction more than offset other specified items. The full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP EPS adjusted for ConvaTec is posted on our website.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to guidance. We are issuing full year 2009 GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance is $1.85 to $2. As Jim mentioned, we are also confirming our three-year minimum 2008 to 2010, 15% EPS compound annual growth on a non-GAAP basis and that is without rebasing for ConvaTec in 2007.</p>
          <p>Let me just go through some highlights when it comes to our 2009 non-GAAP guidance. Firstly, our revenue growth will be in the low single-digit range. This assumes FX rates similar to those that we saw in Q4 of 2008. Importantly, without FX our revenue would be up in the mid to high single-digit level for 2009.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we expect gross margins to improve slightly based on mix as well as continued productivity improvements. AMP should increase in the low to mid single-digits as we continue to invest in the business and we continue to invest behind growth and potential new product launches in '09.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A should be down in the low to mid single-digits, driven particularly by productivity. Again, when it comes to investments, R&amp;D should be up in the mid single-digit range. And lastly, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24%.</p>
          <p>As we exit 2008, we are very pleased with the operating performance of the business and the outlook for 2009. However, given some of the challenges facing the industry and potentially Bristol-Myers, I believe we've been appropriately balanced in issuing our 2009 guidance. And I do expect that we will update our guidance as the year progresses. As such, our guidance range acknowledges some of the challenges facing our business and industry in '09 such as potential new competition, potentially from Plavix, Abilify; takes into account currency fluctuations and the overall economic situation and the potential impact that may have on our business.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, our fourth quarter underlying operating performance was very strong. We saw solid sales growth, improved gross and pre-tax margins resulting in a 53% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share. The company continues to be focused on execution against our strategy and continues to deliver growth, improved operating leverage based on product mix and our productivity initiatives. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jean-Marc and Jim. I think we're ready to go to questions now and I would just remind everybody that in addition to Jim and Jean-Marc, we have Lamberto and Elliott here as well for any questions you might have. Steve?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll go to John Boris with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the questions, just two. First one for Elliott, yesterday there was an early communication from the FDA on safety review on clopidogrel most notably on patients that are poor metabolizers and on a drug interaction with Proton pump inhibitors. Is this something you're anticipating that could end up in your label before you complete these additional clinical trials or will the FDA wait until you conduct those clinical trials before there is any change to the label?</p>
          <p>Secondly, also related to Plavix, can we just get an update on the current OASIS 7 trial enrollment and when you might plan or we might see final results on that? And then just one for Jean-Marc on working capital. Can you provide a little additional color on how you plan on getting the billion out by 2010 and the timing of how you see that billion coming? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, John. This is Elliott, thank you for the questions on Plavix. Yes, the FDA made a statement yesterday. We're working very closely with not only the FDA but the healthcare authorities around the world to ensure that our advice continues on Plavix to use this important medicine in a safe and effective way. I can't comment at this time what labeling changes will occur. We are very interested in adding information that would help both physicians and patients receive appropriate guidance on the use of the drug. And we're committed to the safe and effective use of Plavix.</p>
          <p>I will say that the variability of response of any drug is certainly a phenomena that resides with any drug. It has been very complex to examine this for clopidogrel and recent publications have focused our attention on new science with regard to variability of Plavix that may be linked to certain drug interactions like the Proton pump inhibitors and also to specific genetic variation. Some of the information has been contradictory and so we're working closely with the FDA and other healthcare authorities to review this issue and provide more data. We're looking at ongoing studies, analyses of completed studies and select new studies to further define the metabolism of the drug and the effect of the interaction with PPIs, the PK and PD is influenced by genetic variation and different dosing regimens. And I think the most important thing that we can state at this time has been stated by the FDA that healthcare providers should continue to prescribe and patients should continue to take Plavix as directed because it has demonstrated benefits in preventing blood clots that could lead to heart attacks or strokes. And they should reevaluate the need or the continued use for PPI or alternative medicines. And within a matter of months, we hope to have more data with regard to the PK/PD establishing whether or not there is an interaction or more importantly, how to take concomitant medicines with Plavix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes maybe I, this is Lamberto, I can add something from a commercial point of view. The information on possible interaction with Proton pump inhibitors has been out for some time now. And we have not seen any significant commercial impact. As of today, we're making the communication from the FDA available to all of our people and we'll allow them so to address questions that might come from doctors and we'll allow them, if questions are asked, to confirm that the FDA mentions the fact that clopidogrel has demonstrated benefits in preventing blood clots that could lead to a heart attack or a stroke. And the FDA says the healthcare provider should reevaluate the need for starting or continuing treatment with Proton pump inhibitors.</p>
          <p>In the FDA communication also indicates that there's no evidence that other drugs that reduce stomach acid such as H2 blockers or antacids interfere with the anti-platelet activity of clopidogrel. It seems to me that as of today, this communication is more on the management of heartburn, stomach acid than on the management of Plavix. Obviously our R&amp;D colleagues, BMS and Sanofi will work actively at delivering the data the FDA wants, but we believe that there's enough already that we know and that is in this communication that can make us continue to support Plavix. And in fact, Plavix in the fourth quarter as Jean-Marc was saying, continue to grow and the 11% growth in the US included a 4.4% growth in volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, this is Elliott. You did ask about the OASIS or the current trial which is our high loading dose trial comparing 300 milligram versus 600 milligram, loading dose plus a one week increased maintenance dose, with a 600 milligram arm. This is an event driven trial, so although we initially looked forward to having data in the first or second quarter this year, due to a lower than expected event rate in the trial, sample size has been increased to maintain study power and we are looking forward to having results by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe just turning on to working capital, let me just start more broader in terms of cash flow. We're focused on CapEx, as well as work capital and have been doing so on an increasing basis over the last six to nine months. This whole topic has received more management focus. We're investing in our systems and our compensation is aligned to be much more focused on these different line items. Very briefly, when it comes to Cap Ex, we've continued to invest in the business, very specifically our biologics plant in Devens. But we're going to be more closer and accountable to our actual capital expenditures going forward. But we will continue to invest, which I think is an important point to mention.</p>
          <p>On the three pillars of working capital which will bring us to our billion by the end of 2011, based on 2008 sales, it's receivables, inventories and procurement. Receivables is receiving a lot of attention within the markets as well as in the regions not only from a cash, but also from a risk management perspective. And we've made good progress over the last six months. Inventories, which is something that we have worked on for a longer period of time, is a line item within working capital which will continue to improve, as we continue to rationalize our manufacturing base.</p>
          <p>And lastly, on procurement, we've spent a lot of time from an organizational perspective putting the right people, and we will continue to do so putting the right people in place to make sure that we take the necessary strides to become best-in-class on the procurement side.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thanks for the questions, John. Steve, can we go to the next one?</p>

      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Yes, we'll go to <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. This is a question for Jim. I was wondering if you saw the Pfizer Wyeth deal as a one-off transaction or the beginning of another wave of industry consolidation. And my second question relates to where Bristol would stand in that sort of strategic realignment, and if you could talk about your String of Pearls strategy and whether or not you see opportunities for bigger acquisitions that move the needle more than a String of Pearls deal. And my last question relates to Plavix in Europe. If Jean-Marc, if you could comment on what you're seeing today with respect to generic Plavix, and what your guidance assumes for 2009. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, <mark type="inaudible" />, that's a set of very far encompassing questions. As company policy, we don't like to comment on the strategic actions of our competitors. That being said, we've read the same materials that have been made public and we're working hard to make sure our people focus on Bristol-Myers Squibb's strategic plans, not the reaction to that announced transaction. As I said in my prepared remarks, the String of Pearls is very much on track with six completed and we believe they've been complementary or expanded areas that we felt needed to be fixed or added to. And I'll turn it over to Elliott to describe where we think we're going in '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />, we've been on two tracks with regard to the String of Pearls. You've seen evidence, multiple deals as evidence of building the Phase III pipeline of '011, but we also look at important opportunities that could add both revenue as well as pipeline. So, with our cash position, we're looking continuously for opportunities should they make sense to improve the business in stage two which is targeted to of our phase of business to raise the floor of earnings after Plavix exclusivity loss as well as signal the rise of earnings in stage three. All the deals done so far have been done under the guise of building the 2011 Phase III pipeline even stronger than where we are now to help signal the health in stage two and stage three and all of these deals are done in that area while building on our core competencies in areas such as Hepatitis C, hematology, Alzheimer's and CV.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And <mark type="inaudible" />, this is Lamberto, I probably take the Plavix EU question. Things have not changed much in recent weeks as far as Plavix generic competition in Europe. There is concern. There are still two generic companies marketing a salt, an alternative salt or clopidogrel in Germany launched in August. What they have is a limited indication. They do not have the full label of Plavix in Germany. And what we have seen so far as of December 2008, they have taken approximately 25% our market share units with the pricing of their products at 20, 30% discount versus Plavix. So, it's a less aggressive uptake curve than you generally see with generic products in Germany.</p>
          <p>There are a number of other applications that have been filed in Europe after July 15 for approval in Germany and elsewhere of other versions of clopidogrel. There is no news about those additional applications. But in our plans for 2009, we have included some further approvals of some of these applications. We continue to support Plavix very, very fiercely and aggressively in Germany and elsewhere. We have a good product profile there and the results that we see in Germany are not only due to the fact that generic competition has a reduced label, but to the fact that we are behind Plavix very aggressively.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just to reaffirm what Lamberto says, <mark type="inaudible" />, is when looking at the guidance of 1.85 to $2, we have taken the various different scenarios for Plavix Europe into account when coming with that range.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I also have a couple of more follow-ups on 2009 guidance. I'm just curious what it assumes in terms of A, contribution from saxagliptin; B, the extent of benefit from the productivity transformation initiative; and C, what would be the potential impact to this guidance from the intended IPO of the Mead Johnson nutritionals business in the first half of this year? And then separately, a question on Erbitux. If you could just comment on the expected timing for the lung cancer filing now in the US and whether or not you expect growth out of Erbitux before that comes through. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe I'll just start off in terms of productivity. I'll let Lamberto make mention about saxagliptin and then we can take some of the other questions from you. Productivity like Jim said is something which is really becoming part of our culture. So rather than just single out productivity, I think that what you're seeing on each and every line item, we are becoming more productive. And so if you take the 2.5 billion of productivity initiatives, I think we mentioned in the press release that approximately what, just north of 1 billion has actually been identified and executed upon, 2.5 billion has been identified. And so we will get close to that number as the year goes by. But we have been productive in all senses of the world and that also permits us to continue to invest, and investing will be within R&amp;D but it is also with respect to saxagliptin, so maybe, Lamberto.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for saxagliptin I can say that as you know we have filed in both the US and the EU, and we're getting ready for a launch if we get approvals, and we're working very, very, very closely and actively with AstraZeneca to get ready. Sales forces have been put together. Medical support is in place and we're giving particular attention to be ready for inclusion in formularies in both the US and Europe. The strength of the clinical data is at this point known and we believe we have a competitive profile to position the product in the field of diabetes in both the US and EU. We are ready as soon as Elliott delivers an approval to us.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on your point on the MG IPO, again looking at guidance, we do take into account that we will lose between 10 to 20% of income within, as a result of the IPO and so that has been factored into our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and obviously for saxa, you will not expect a big contribution to earnings per share this year. In fact, the expenses related to the launch of saxa will be very significant in terms of both sale forces and A&amp;Ps. We have built in saxa not for 2009 but for a much longer period of time.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Roopesh, finally you asked about the timing on the resubmission of the lung cancer filing for the indication for Erbitux. I don't have a firm timeline for you at this time. I do believe this is a manageable issue of comparability between the clinical supplies that came from one source and what we market in the US. We felt that we initially had this answered. We respect the fact that the FDA is asking for more information. We think we can do this in a relatively expeditious way but we are still talking with the FDA about additional data that will satisfy everybody so that we can move forward with this very important indication and I believe very exciting data, mortality data on this new indication for Erbitux. So, we'll be able to tell you more as the year progresses.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I have a couple of questions. With respect to REYATAZ, the sequential growth moderated a little bit in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter of '08. Could you just talk a little bit about the momentum that you see for 2009 for REYATAZ? And second, could you please walk us through your development and launch plans for saxagliptin ex-US? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>REYATAZ. David, I would suggest that we don't concede Q4 as very indicative of the overall performance of REYATAZ. There are a number of factors that have affected negatively the performance of &#x2013; for the results &#x2013; the reported results of the product. I would mention three. One is the foreign exchange. And obviously that is to be seen and might continue. The two others are related to the timing of some supplies to our Latin American markets. And most important in the US, to a very specific depletion of inventories we had in the fourth quarter of 2000 &#x2013; inventories at both wholesalers and pharmacy levels that we don't expect to continue in the following quarter.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the performance in the US, we have for the quarter, 4% growth, reported growth. And in fact, TRx, total prescriptions grew 14%. What is happening in the third agent market is the market continues to grow. In fact, has accelerated growth, our market share, with two agents that we have in the markets Sustiva, Atripla and REYATAZ, our market shares have not grown significantly. But remain big, steady and we have product number one Sustiva, Atripla and product number two REYATAZ in that market, very far from product three and the others.</p>
          <p>The new products for the new HIV8 products are mostly used in late stages of the disease. And what we see is they're used as add on. Therefore, they do not displace our products but they're added on to our products that remain very strong in naive patients and in early stage patients.</p>
          <p>So the market is growing because there is an added on use of these new agents in the late stages of therapy but a position of REYATAZ and Sustiva, Atripla in the third agent market, those positions remain strong as they were in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Product stocks in Europe, we are ready to launch &#x2013; we will be ready to launch if we get the approval, obviously, the timing of the approval might be different than the timing in the US. We have work going on at regional level and local level with AstraZeneca. And what I said before applies also to Europe. We have sales forces in places. We have medical activities continuing in all countries. And there is a particular attention we're giving to this product as far as access is concerned. So, we're preparing the pricing and <mark type="inaudible" /> discussions at regional and local level there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Jim, the biggest overhang on your stock is the patent cliff that starts in 2012. And I'm hoping you can talk about specific levers you can pull to address this period beyond just pushing your own compounds through the pipeline and beyond pursuing your String of Pearls that will translate in the new product flow only slowly. One lever would seem to be extending Abilify contract with Otsuka, for example. Not sure what the others would be such that you can lessen the P&amp;L hit you otherwise will face in that 2012, 2013 timeframe. The String of Pearls approach doesn't seem like it will adequately address this period unless you start doing bigger deals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Tim, you put your finger obviously on the big strategic issue. We call it stage two in the house. And as you know, we did everything we could to get stage one to a 15% compounded annual growth rate for at least three years. And have just now, meaning late last year and activities continuing in early this year to address things that can affect stage two. So, we're not at a stage where we can go public with any of those discussions. So I'm confident we're examining the right levers as you described them. And finally, the String of Pearls, there are companies out there that have existing revenue. They're on the target list. And we'll just have to see how the String of Pearls plays out for the remainder of '09. We're as busy in '09 as we were in '08 and I'm optimistic that somewhere along the line we'll get some products in there.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, the two productivity programs are really lowering the cost base of this company quite dramatically, and we can't see the full impact of that yet because some of it has to do with people. Some of it has to do with plants which take a while to close and reallocate the production to other units. So, that's the third lever is, when we get to that stage two, I think we'll be a much leaner, smaller, more agile company than we are today. And those three should give us a starting point then for stage three, which is continued growth of the current products, plus the new products, plus the String of Pearls if they're fortunate to get through the regulatory process. So, we're busy at work doing stage one, two, and three.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. This is a quick and easy one, and I apologize if this was covered earlier. But in the second page of your release, you mentioned that the tax rate from continuing operations is 22.5%. And then obviously the reported result for non-GAAP adjusted excluding special items is 16.5. And I'm just wondering if you can tell us the difference in whether the true up &#x2013; what specifically the true up was for the R&amp;D tax credit specifically in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't discussed this up until now, so thank you very much for the question. And there are two drivers behind our tax rate in the fourth quarter. The most important one is the R&amp;D tax credit. And I think the good news is that this is something that we will enjoy and we know that we will enjoy for 2009 and as a result, our tax rate will be more even as we go through the quarters. There are also one or two release reserves that actually took place in Q4. So those are the two main items. If you look over the year, we're at around 22, 22.5% and our guidance is basically at around 24% for next year. So that's a small decrease in our tax rate and that's primarily due to the mix in geographies for next year.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Units in non-US markets were down a bit in Q4. I'm wondering if you would elaborate on the cause of this trend. Was this the effect of Plavix in the EU or was there some other trend? And secondly, I'm wondering if there is any news to report on the 11F8 rights disagreement with Lilly? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that the &#x2013; our portfolio of products in outside of the US is undergoing a big evolution, Steve. We are, as you know, divesting products. We are moving products from our own units to distributors. I'm speaking about what we call mature brands because our strategy is still focused on the same portfolio everywhere around the world. So there is a lot that is fluctuating in the mature brands of Bristol-Myers Squibb in terms of performance and sales.</p>
          <p>If we look at the sales of the individual regions, we have, in the quarter, EMEA, Europe, Middle East and Asia grew overall by 5% net of FX. And what we call the key and new products, that group of products grew in total by 20%. So you see that the performance of the key and new products in that region is very different than the performance of the mature brands in that region. And we can continue for same way for Latin America, Asia-Pac and the other region in Latin America. In Latin America for example, another example, we have divested a number of products. We have closed certain operations in Central America and then we have taken a big number of mature brands and given them to Merck, Merck Darmstadt for distribution in a number of countries. So we are reporting lower sales than what we were reporting there.</p>
          <p>In summary, our key products and our new products are doing as expected and doing well in the international markets as they are in the United States.</p>

          <p>Steve, this is Jim. On 11F8, there's really nothing brand new to report. This humanized version of Erbitux is still in dispute. ImClone is obviously now owned by Lilly. Should we not be able to resolve the differences there as to the ownership, by contract, that goes to arbitration. I will report we've had some productive discussions with Lilly and we'll have more to report on that as the year goes on. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. Just a couple of quick questions. This is for Elliott. Can you tell us if you've been informed about whether or not saxagliptin will go to a panel? It is our understanding there is a second day scheduled after the liraglutide panel. Secondly, and I believe that that panel actually falls after your PDUFA date.</p>
          <p>Secondly, can you let us know if the renal study that I believe you are, that is underway with saxagliptin is required for approval, when could those data actually be added to the FDA dossier? And then just lastly, Jim, this is a question for you. Could you just remind us of the timing of your transition or your planned transition and if the Board is currently considering candidates for your replacement? Not that I'm trying to chase you out of the position. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll be happy to go next. This is Elliott, Seamus. You asked about the progress on saxa. First, I'd like to correct something. Our PDUFA date is April 30. If the agency decides to have an advisory panel, I believe they have plenty of time to do so. We have noted, as you have, that there's more than one day scheduled in the first week of April. I would say that the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 states that advisory committees are expected for all NCEs absent an articulated reason. Therefore it is our practice always to prepare for one. We have teams in both companies ready for an advisory committee. The official announcement of an advisory committee comes in the federal register by the reviewing division. So, we get prepared, I think they have time to have one.</p>
          <p>You asked in general about the data that would be needed for approval and you asked about the renal study. The renal study is progressing and will be available late in '09. However, it is not my feeling that the renal study is needed for an evaluation of the current program. I do note that CV guidelines came out after our submission. However, before our submission, clearly the thinking from the agency was evolving to prescribe extended exposure, certain types of patients to expose a drug to and we followed all those guide lines and we submitted a program that has over 5,000 subjects, 4,000 treated with saxagliptin, multiple patient conditions. And about 1,500 patients received saxagliptin for at least a year of the 3,000 that have been studied in Phase III. We do not see any cardiovascular signal and we think the database as been provided, allows application of the guidelines. And we're working closely with the FDA to assure people that the new standards put in place are adhered to, because we think the new guidelines are an important advance for patients in assuring cardiovascular safety.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Just on, maybe on the diabetes line here, can you just also update us following those recent CV guidelines for dapagliflozin. Just expectations of a filing timeline for this product or just any comments you might have of what changes you might need to make to your clinical program as a result of those CV guidelines? Also on the R&amp;D front Sprycel just updated timing on front line, head to head data when we could think about that? And maybe just a broader question, when we think about macroeconomic impact to your business and thinking about 2009 guidance, can you just give us any more kind of quantifying what's reflected in your guidance? Are you seeing a macroeconomic impact already or is this more of something we expect as the year progresses? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Chris, you asked questions on diabetes in general, dapa in particular. Let me take the question on Sprycel. First line, we are running the first line study head to head with Gleevec. The study is, as of last year fully enrolled. And we will be, data will be maturing towards the end of the year. We'll see some data in '010 as we have said before. And I'm quite excited about the progress of the Sprycel life cycle management not only in solid tumors but certainly in the humanalogic applications.</p>
          <p>With regard to the CV guidelines on dapagliflozin I will say that we are working with the agency to fully integrate everything going forward. Because we had anticipated that this agent should be exhaustively studied in terms of safety and efficacy, we had already designed a very large trial study in characteristics of safety. I think addition of the CV guidelines won't materially impact. I don't have the filing schedule, but I don't have a specific filing date to announce at this time. AZ and Bristol-Myers are working very hard. And I think we can incorporate all the guidelines in our planned dapagliflozin program. I did meant to say with saxagliptin, both &#x2013; well with dapagliflozin, we will see Phase III data at the ADA or at the European Society so either in June or September and that's an important event for us. We also have exciting Phase IIb data on insulin refractory patients that we hope to submit and talk about at ADA in June.</p>
          <p>But with regard to saxagliptin, I meant to say that one of the ways to differentiate is to capitalize on the pharmaceutic properties of saxagliptin. It's a very potent pill. It's a small pill that enables combinations, products to be more readily formulated. We've worked out a very exciting formulation with saxagliptin and Metformin XR. And we hope to have a US submission for the first once daily fixed dose combination of those two ingredients by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the overall financial crisis going on around the world and its possible effect on our business, let me first start saying that we have not seen much of an effect on the markets that are significant to us, our referred markets so far. We are obviously looking at the evolution of the situation and we're very mindful of the possibility that less money would be available to individual payers and collective payers like government and therefore there might be additional actions on prices by the government or payers. And there might be less money available by individual patients for the healthcare expenses. And we have reflected some of that in our guidance of 2009.</p>
          <p>What we are convinced of is that we have a portfolio of products that are addressing significant medical, unmet medical needs, all medical needs. And therefore we should be less affected than some others in this situation. We don't have lifestyle products or secondary products. Our focus is on pretty innovative biopharmaceuticals. And therefore we are a bit less negative about the short-term outlook than others.</p>

And we're excited about the developing life cycle extensions of new indications, as well as new formulations. So the big events this year that I tell people about that I'm looking forward to is the subcutaneous program that's producing Phase III data, safety data first that we hope to have at the American College of Rheumatology in October. At that meeting as well, we should have Phase II data on psoriatic arthritis. Last year we had a study, a Phase II study, on lupus that informed how our generalized lupus program should move forward in Phase III and that work continues. The lupus nephritis Phase III study is continuing. And I don't believe we'll see that data this year, but Orencia remains exciting both in the market and in clinical development.</p>

          <p>And these can be quite brief. We made tremendous progress in 2008 on the biopharma strategy. And we expect that progress to continue into 2009 as evidenced by our guidance range. Operating performance is improving. We continue to project the three-year earnings per share compounded growth rate of 15%. And I'm particularly pleased about our productivity efforts as we make headway on those and raise our profit margins. Thanks everybody for taking the time and attention this morning.</p>
