        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Uta.</p>
          <p>I am very excited to be here today and I look forward to further strengthening the Investor Relations function at Merck. I hope to meet many of you for the first time over the course of the next few months while also rekindling relationships with those of you who knew me from my time at Millipore. The entire IR team at Merck will endeavor to be responsive to your requests, transparent with our disclosure and insightful with the commentary we provide you as part of your efforts to better understand Merck's business and its future direction.</p>
          <p>So with that brief introduction behind us, I'd like to formally welcome you to Merck KGaA's third quarter earnings conference call. During today's call, we'll be referencing a slide presentation as part of our prepared remarks. You can download these slides from our Investor Relations' website. Additionally, you can download our Q3 2010 quarterly report, financial statements in Excel, and a detailed overview presentation on Merck. A recording of this call and a transcript of our remarks will also be posted to our website shortly after the call.</p>
          <p>We will be making forward-looking statements on the conference call today. Please review our disclaimer about the risks and uncertainties of such statements on slide two.</p>
          <p>Dr. Michael Becker, CFO and Elmar Schnee, Head of Pharma will join me on today's call. Both are general partners of Merck and member of the &#x2013; members of the Executive Board.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Becker.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, and hello, good afternoon, good morning ladies and gentlemen. It's my pleasure to present to you the third quarter results for the Group and later on for Chemicals and in between Elmar will present our Pharmaceutical business.</p>
          <p>I shall refer to the third quarter only unless stated otherwise. I'll start with slide three, and the key messages; Q3 was in my opinion a fine quarter for Merck and the key messages are summarized on this bespoke slide three. First, our Q3 revenue growth was balanced, with all four divisions contributing to the 9% increase in revenues prior to the effect of acquisitions. Second, we continue to do a good job of leveraging our top line performance to drive attractive growth and profitability and free cash flow. We expect to deliver record levels of core operating result and underlying free cash flow in 2010.</p>
          <p>Third, this is the first quarter that we have consolidated Millipore to our financial statements. During the course of today's call, I will provide details of how this consolidation has affected the year-over-year comparisons of our performance.</p>
          <p>You can see that we had some nice accomplishments during Q3. However, we also saw signs towards the end of the quarter that demand for Liquid Crystals slows.</p>
          <p>In response to that slowdown as well as to the changes in foreign exchange, we are lowering our revenue targets for the year. We expect that we will more than offset our lower revenue growth with lower spending and improve profitability at Merck Serono. This will allow us to report a higher core operating result for the year, and I will talk in more detail about the 2010 guidance in a few minutes towards the end.</p>
          <p>If we move into more detail in describing the performance, as you can see on slide four, total revenues in Q3 rose significantly by 25% to &#x20AC;22.4 billion compared to year ago quarter. Of this, the first time consolidation of Millipore as of July 1st contributed 16%, whereas currency tailwinds had an impact of 5.3%. This translates into 3.5% organic revenue growth in this quarter. Favorable product mix and high plant utilization rates helped to increase the gross margin by 27%, despite a &#x20AC;43 million amortization charge for grossing up Millipore's inventory in connection with the purchase accounting.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A increased 24% to &#x20AC;908 million. Excluding both Millipore's contribution as well as integration-related costs of &#x20AC;21 million, SG&amp;A would have been up by 9% in the quarter. Higher R&amp;D costs in Chemicals were partially offset by lower R&amp;D investments in Merck Serono, also affected by the termination of the Stimuvax study, STRIDE, in breast cancer. Overall, this resulted in an increase in R&amp;D of around 5% for the Group.</p>
          <p>Amortization of purchased Millipore intangibles lowered the operating results by &#x20AC;48 million. As a reminder, we expect to incur an annual charge of roughly &#x20AC;190 million related to this purchased intangible amortization over the next few years.</p>
          <p>We succeeded in leveraging this top line performance to generate quality growth in Q3. Our core ROS increased by more than 600 basis points to 25.6%, leading to a core operating result of &#x20AC;623 million. No important influences were booked this quarter, but as indicated in our last conference call in July, we expect such influences, especially impairments of more than &#x20AC;100 million for the full year. Most of the impairment charges will relate to our pipeline product, Safinamide.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide five, I would point out three items below the operating line this quarter. First, we saw no exceptionals until Q3, but may see some by year-end, driven by a further provision related to the pending litigation at Dey Pharma.</p>
          <p>Second, the financial result of minus &#x20AC;75 million has more than doubled and includes the interest of the bonds issued to finance the Millipore acquisition. That item relates to our tax rate. Our underlying tax rate was 25.8%, which is above our previous annual tax rate range of 24%. This is the result of the consolidation of Millipore and resembles the increase of the tax rate when we first consolidated Serono. At the time, the increase lasted a year, and I don't think that this time it will last much longer.</p>
          <p>As part of the integration, we will restructure some of Millipore's tax holdings to help optimize our tax rate going forward. Despite this tax increase, core EPS improved 55% to &#x20AC;1.95.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide six, you see that the quarterly underlying free cash flow crossed the 0.5 billion mark in Q3 for the first time in our company's history, totaling &#x20AC;560 million, driven by the higher underlying profitability of the company. Total cash outflow was &#x20AC;4.8 billion following the payment of the purchase price for Millipore in July.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we intend to pay back &#x20AC;500 million bond &#x2013; the &#x20AC;500 million bond, which is due in November of this year, which will also lower our interest payment by &#x20AC;5 million per quarter. So, you can see that this will not be a refinance of the 500 million bond, but a genuine repayment.</p>
          <p>In our Q2 conference call in July, we indicated that settlements of litigation-related provisions should put pressure on this year's free cash flow. Given our visibility today, we accept that these settlements will be cash effective now only in 2011. This will have an effect of helping our 2010 underlying free cash flow, but we do not expect our underlying free cash flow to increase in 2011 as a result of releasing these provisions.</p>
          <p>Key balance sheet data for the Group are on slide seven. Total assets have increased to &#x20AC;23 billion now. Comparing the figures to December 31, 2009, the difference of &#x20AC;6.3 billion mainly stems for the acquired assets of Millipore. But in the payment of the purchase price of Millipore in July, net financial debt rose to &#x20AC;4.7 billion accordingly excluding pensions and pension funding.</p>
          <p>This is all I wanted to say as an introduction to the set of Group figures, and I'll now hand over to Elmar to comment on our Pharmaceutical business.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael. Also a warm welcome from my side.</p>
          <p>Let's start with the key financials for Merck Serono on slide eight. As already highlighted by Michael, Merck Serono contributed to the Group's top line growth with revenues increasing 5.7% to &#x20AC;1.39 billion, compared to &#x20AC;1.32 billion in the year-ago quarter, helped by 4.1% from currency tailwinds.</p>
          <p>Growth was held back by two factors. First, higher mandatory rebates following healthcare reforms in various countries adversely affecting pricing. Second, sales in China were minimal during the third quarter, as Merck deferred sales to local distributors due to the establishment of its own trading company in China and the resulting change in inventory policy. This resulted in a one-time sales loss of &#x20AC;45 million. We have completed this change in our distribution model in Q3, so from Q4 onwards we will book sales again in that country.</p>
          <p>Royalty and commission income slightly rose by 6% to &#x20AC;8 million in the third quarter. The gross margin went up by 9.1% to &#x20AC;1.2 billion in the quarter under review as the increase in production cost was below revenue growth helped by higher production yields. Marketing and selling expenses were up 9.7% affected by 5.6% currency effects, and an organic increase of 4.1% driven by pre-launch cost of Cladribine Tablets and Tesamorelin. The 8% increase in commission and royalty expenses again is mainly driven by higher Erbitux sales, especially in Japan; Rebif in the U.S.A. and higher royalty income.</p>
          <p>Research and development costs slightly decreased to &#x20AC;280 million compared to &#x20AC;293 million in the year ago quarter. In total, the improved gross margin and soft R&amp;D spendings lifted Merck Serono's core operating results by 33% to &#x20AC;358 million in Q3, resulting in core ROS of 25.7%. Consequently, underlying free cash flow rose by the same order of magnitude to &#x20AC;410 million.</p>
          <p>Slide nine shows you the development of sales by therapeutic area and products. Erbitux grew 17% to &#x20AC;207 million, driven by stronger sales from 1st and 2nd line metastatic colorectal cancer as well as head and neck cancer. Continued strong sales; all regions contributed to the double-digit growth. As already indicated earlier this year, seasonality and the impact of price reduction in some countries to kick in during the third quarter resulted in a sequentially flat sales development versus Q2.</p>
          <p>Rebif sales increased around 7% to &#x20AC;407 million compared to the year ago quarter, mainly driven by growth in North and Latin America and helped by favorable FX developments. Gonal-f sales improved 4% to &#x20AC;115 million compared to the year ago quarter despite temporary suspended sales in China caused by our implemented change in this country's distribution model.</p>
          <p>Sales of Concor dropped by 19% to &#x20AC;84 million in Q3 driven mainly by anticipated generic competition in brands and again the drought effect from the change of the Chinese distribution model. Finally, Saizen again saw healthy double-digit growth of 17% to &#x20AC;56 million pushed by strong growth in Asia and Latin America.</p>
          <p>I will now summarize slide 10 to 13. As you have seen, shows continuously growth since many years and it is fundamental part of our multiple sclerosis franchise strategy to support its further growth in order to address patients' unmet needs and to support Rebif future growth, we invest continuously in a series of Life Cycle Management initiatives. There are three key areas for our Life Cycle Management; formulation enhancements, injection devices, and potential extensions of the existing label.</p>
          <p>First, we focus on enhancement of the drug formulation. Since 2007, the serum-free formulation of Rebif, which we also refer as to RNF, Rebif New Formulation, right after its launch has been launched in 40 countries worldwide. It offers an improvement in injection tolerability and reduced immunogenicity. In our continuous research to provide patients with enhanced formulations, which can help them better cope to live with the chronic disease and potentially improve the quality of life, we have recently initiated with our partner Flamel a Phase I study in healthy volunteers to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics and dynamics of the extended relief formulation of interferon-beta 1a.</p>
          <p>Second, we strive to provide patients with innovative state-of-the-art injection devices designed with the objective to improve injection convenience and to enhance treatment compliance. As you know, we revolutionized the market last year with our RebiSmart, the first device of its kind in this indication, which was specifically designed for ease of handling and use. Unique features of RebiSmart also introduced the potential for improved treatment adherence.</p>
          <p>Earlier this month, we have announced the approval of RebiDose in Europe and Australia. RebiDose is a single-use, pre-filled device that was developed for a quick and simple injection process of rabies and might also be ideal for patients who are traveling. RebiDose will be launched in the first countries by end of this year.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 gives you a update on the regulatory status of Cladribine Tablets. Cladribine Tablets are now approved in Russia and Australia, where it will be made available end of 2010 under the trade name Movectro. As announced at the end of September, the Committee of Medical Products for Human Use issued a negative opinion regarding the marketing authorization application for Cladribine Tablets. The CHMP was of the opinion at this point in time the benefit of Cladribine Tablets did not outweigh its risk.</p>
          <p>Clearly, this decision was a disappointed &#x2013; disappointment as we and the thought leaders firmly believe that Cladribine Tablets have a positive benefit risk profile. We will continue working closely with the CHMP to address the Committee's concern and the appeal procedure is the fastest possible way to do so.</p>
          <p>We respect the U.S. market. We expect the decision of the FDA by the end of this year. We will have new clinical data from the CLARITY extension and ORACLE MS studies available in the second half of 2011. Results from the ONWARD study are expected for the first half of 2012.</p>
          <p>I forgot slide 13 to comment, which I have to do now. We worked on extending the eligible patient population for Rebif, which is the third part of our Life Cycle Management activity. Yesterday, we announced the top line results of our REFLEX study. The study results showed that the treatment with Rebif delays conversion to MS in patients with first clinical signs of the disease. The risk of conversion to MS according to the McDonald criteria over two years was reduced by 51% with a high significance.</p>
          <p>Patients who received Rebif 44 micrograms three times a week compared to placebo. A risk reduction of 31% even though also with high significance, compared to placebo was observed in patients who received once weekly administration of Rebif 44 microgram. The probability of conversion to multiple sclerosis over two years was 86% in the placebo group, 62% in patients who received Rebif 44 micrograms three times a week and 76% in patients who received once weekly administration of Rebif 44 micrograms. We expect full results of REFLEX to be presented in the second quarter next year.</p>
          <p>We believe that interferons will remain an available treatment options in MS despite a broader choice of treatments and increased competition that MS market will face going forward. Rebif is well positioned to be the interferon of choice because of its efficacy and well-established safety profile, and also thanks to our Active Life Cycle Management initiative targeting numerous aspects of the product as I just outlined.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our oncology franchise. On slide 15 and 16 you see that we recently brought good use from Erbitux in several indications. In metastatic colorectal cancer, further analysis from the Phase III CRYSTAL study showed a longest ever median overall survival of 28.3 months for patients with KRAS wild-type tumors who experienced early tumor shrinkage during 1st line Erbitux based treatment.</p>
          <p>In recurrent metastatic head and neck cancer, a recently published survey revealed that in the four biggest European countries meanwhile, almost 60% of the patients received an Erbitux based therapy as a 1st line treatment, up from 28% back in 2008. Similarly, 36% of patients suffering from locally advanced head and neck cancer received Erbitux based therapy as a 1st line treatment, up from only 9% back in 2008.</p>
          <p>This data confirms the role of Erbitux as a leading standard in head and neck cancer therapies now and in the future, since other drugs in the difficult-to-treat indication has just recently failed to show a significant benefit.</p>
          <p>Finally, results from the randomized Phase II study BALI-1 for treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer revealed that patients receiving Erbitux showed a significant reduction in risk of progression. Progression-free survival was more than doubled and tumor response rate nearly doubled. Apart from that development program of our pipeline drugs, Stimuvax and Cilengitide are ongoing as planned.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 shows the updated pipeline including the recent developments. As I told you earlier this year, we expect FDA's official response regarding Tesamorelin in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 provides an overview of the pipeline catalysts over the next 12 months. If we leave Merck Serono and move to Consumer Health Care on slide 19, you find the key financials. Revenues grew by 2% to &#x20AC;125 million in the third quarter, negatively affected by currency. In line with our focus on strategic brands, marketing and selling as well as R&amp;D, were 8% and 29% higher respectively. This lowered the operating results by 24% to &#x20AC;16 million compared to the year ago quarter resulting in a return on revenues of 13%. Consequently, the underlying free cash flow was lower following softer operating results.</p>
          <p>This is all from my side. I would now like to hand back to Michael again who will take you through the Q3 results in Chemicals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Elmar.</p>
          <p>Before I go into the numbers again, let me remind you on how the integration of Millipore has reshaped the organization of our Chemicals business. This is shown on slide 20 and 21. With the quarterly numbers we released today, you have seen the results of these changes for the first time in our P&amp;L, with the newly created divisions Merck Millipore and Performance Materials.</p>
          <p>Merck Millipore combines Millipore's activities and the two Merck's Performance &amp; Life Science Chemicals divisions, Laboratory business and Life Science Solutions. From 2010 onwards, we will fully plan these businesses and report sales in the new businesses unit structure Bioscience, Laboratory Solutions and Process Solutions.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have bundled the remaining Liquid Crystals, Pigments and Complimentary Products business into the new Performance Materials division, which from 2011 onwards will only see insignificant changes compared to what we have now. Given the very unique nature of the Liquid Crystals business, we intend to report respective sales and operating result figures separately going forward like we did today.</p>
          <p>The third quarter development of Merck Millipore is shown on slide 22 and 23. Total revenues of &#x20AC;574 million were 153% above last year's third quarter, with all business units contributing to growth. Of that, 139% or &#x20AC;314 million came from the first-time consultation of Millipore. On a pro forma basis, this translates into a organic growth rate of 4%, held back by 1% from adverse currency effect.</p>
          <p>Growth in Millipore's former Process Solutions business unit benefited from healthy demand from biotech customers in North America and Asia. Bioscience business unit's performance was highlighted by new product launches and strength in academic markets.</p>
          <p>Compared to this year's strong first half growth, the legacy Millipore business has slowed for three reasons. First, as we mentioned last quarter, Millipore's first half performance benefited from the timing of orders from large biotech customers that were pulled into the first half of the year. Second, Millipore is facing tough year-over-year comparisons in the second half of the year as a result of one-time orders that occurred in the second half of last year relating to H1N1 vaccine. It was a one-time effect, because last year there were two flu vaccines manufacturing &#x2013; manufactured, whereas, this year H1N1 was simply included with the normal seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Millipore business always sees some degree of seasonality in Q3 as researchers take vacation over the summer and some of our large customers shut down their plants to conduct normal maintenance.</p>
          <p>For the portion of Merck Millipore that relates to legacy Merck, Merck's legacy Laboratory and Life Science Solutions business grew 15% in quarter three helped by an 8% tailwind from foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Marketing and selling, as well as investment into research and development for Merck Millipore were up following the bigger organization. The core operating result which excludes amortization of the purchase price allocation and step up of inventories, as well as transaction and integration costs, came out at &#x20AC;122 million resulting in a core ROS of 21.2%. Finally, the underlying free cash flow was &#x20AC;102 million.</p>
          <p>Slide 24 now shows you the recent progress in the integration process. Integration was off to a strong start. We have achieved a series of key milestones already and expect most of the work to be completed by early 2011. A new market-driven organizational structure has been defined to reap the most fruits out of our combined businesses. First three layers of the organization has been established already and here we were able to retain the top talent. As of today, no unmanaged risks were threatening the integration's success.</p>
          <p>Moving to Performance Materials, which is on slide 25. Revenues increased by 23% to &#x20AC;346 million helped by 12% tailwinds from currency. Liquid Crystals came in at &#x20AC;255 million, reflecting an increase of 21%; that again benefited from a favorable product mix from our unique PS-VA materials. Sales of Pigments and Others grew 28% driven by a strong demand from the coatings industry. This healthy market environment enabled us to announce price increases of 5% to 10% effective 1st of October.</p>
          <p>Marketing and selling, as well as investments into R&amp;D were up following stronger sales. Compared to the third quarter 2009, the operating result more than doubled from &#x20AC;72 million to &#x20AC;152 million, yielding a return on sales of 44%. Of that, Liquid Crystals contributed was &#x20AC;137 million translating into an ROS of 54%, even slightly higher than the fantastic second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>On slide 26; you see the quarterly development of sales and operating result of Liquid Crystals back to Q1 2008. Comparing this year's Q3 with Q2 reveals the sequential weakening in sales by &#x20AC;29 million driven mainly by an unfavorable exchange rate and the slowing in volumes which I have already mentioned. Whereas our Liquid Crystals revenues in July and August were in line with our expectations, we saw lower volumes in September following some cautious comments from our customers starting end of August.</p>
          <p>Industry experts see this well known type of micro-cycle to possibly last until Q1 next year with volume demand picking up again thereafter, in line with the overall promising mid-term growth spread of the industry. I would like to stress that despite 10% sequential sales growth from &#x20AC;284 million in Q2 to &#x20AC;255 million in Q3, the ROS margin was well above 50% indicating a temporary softer end market demand rather than a fundamental change in the characteristics of the business.</p>
          <p>However, as a result of the lower Q3 revenues and a reduction of our expectations for Q4, we have lowered our growth expectations for this business for 2010. This outlook for Liquid Crystals brings me to the outlook for the Group for the full year 2010. Based on the nine months result, our expectations for the rest of the year we have adjusted our guidance for all four of our divisions.</p>
          <p>We now expect the Group's top line to grow 19% to &#x20AC;9.230 billion, which is 2 percentage points below our previously forecasted growth. Some of this reduction is related to changes in foreign exchange rates since we last gave our guidance in July, with the remainder of the reduction relating to softer demand. We are decreasing our spending in the fourth quarter which will help the Group's core operating profit to move modestly higher than our previous guidance to &#x20AC;2.05 billion this year, up &#x20AC;40 million leaving the core operating result unchanged &#x2013; core operating return unchanged at 22%.</p>
          <p>Moving to the guidance by division, for Merck Serono, revenue growth is now expected to be 7.2%, up &#x2013; slightly down from the 7.5% increase, with an increased core operating result return of 22%, up from 20%. Our smallest division, Consumer Health Care, we see revenue growth now at 3% coming from 5 with an ROS of 4% down from 8%.</p>
          <p>Performance Materials, we see 34% top line growth, down from 43 in July and a 2% lower ROS margin of now 52. 42 for the whole Performance Materials area. This is almost entirely due to the lower growth from Liquid Crystals I mentioned earlier, and this business we now expect the top line to grow 35%. That was previously 50%, but improvements to our operational efficiency will help us to only lower the core ROS by 2% resulting in 52% ROS for 2010. This will also be partially offset by our Pigments and Others business, which are performing well.</p>
          <p>Finally, Merck Millipore, we now see revenue growth of 80%, slightly down from 84% and a 1% lower core ROS margin of now 17%. The majority of the decline is related to the negative effects of foreign currency.</p>
          <p>That concludes our comments on the Q3 results. Thank you for your kind attention. Elmar and I are now ready to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you so much, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today comes from Matthew Weston of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thank you. Three questions if I could. The first one regarding Pharma margins, clearly they showed a marked improvement in the third quarter. What I'd like to understand is what profit margin you believe is sustainable going forward? Clearly, you've set out expectations for 2011 at your recent Analyst Meeting, and I wondered whether given the strong performance in 3Q, you were going to raise those expectations to the medium-term performance in Pharma?</p>
          <p>My second question is regarding Rebif, and particularly Rebif in the U.S. I realize your relationship with Pfizer remains confidential, but in the past it's been suggested that Pfizer has been making incrementally profitable contributions or receiving a greater amount of profit after sales of Rebif in the U.S. reached a certain level. And if I then look at how the implications of new drug launching may therefore impact that, would I be right in assuming that as sales potentially declined, actually the profit impact on Merck is significantly less than you would anticipate and the vast majority of that negative, certainly, initially would come out of royalties being paid away to Pfizer?</p>
          <p>And then finally just a broad question on guidance as a whole. You've obviously changed your guidance for 2010, but you gave us first-time guidance for 2011 a number of weeks ago, should we assume that, that is also subject to change, I realize it's not been discussed in today's slide pack?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much, Matthew. Regarding the guidance which we have given as 20% ROS going forward, I do not see any reason to actually based on the good third quarter to increase this number because we have still health reform hitting us more in the fourth quarter, beginning of next year. So I believe that 20% as given in our investor presentation is the right number going forward.</p>
          <p>Regarding Rebif and Pfizer, you are absolutely right. The contract is confidential, but it's also clear that the original contract, which obviously was agreed before we acquired Serono, has a staggered royalty approach and we are on the highest levels. So if you just look onto Rebif, yes, the impact is less because it paid quite some commission to Pfizer. So we don't take the whole range of a possible decline of Rebif, though I think Rebif is still very much competing in the market, as we have shown in the numbers.</p>
          <p>And of course there is also another question. Is Cladribine taken up by Pfizer, which obviously would bring back on a successful launch the stagger to royalty? So that's as far as I can go giving you some help. I hope that helps you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Group guidance for 2011 including Liquid Crystals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the Group guidance for 2011; maybe we haven't been clear enough. What we did in the recent road show was a demonstration of the combination of the acquisition into the Group. And it was &#x2013; on purpose it was called target, and not a guidance, so it wasn't a guidance. This is our target. And the reason is that we have an identity between our internal figures and our external communication. And the medium-term forecast wasn't finished at the time and, as we speak, it hasn't been approved by the management yet.</p>
          <p>So, if I'd to talk about target that we had set for Merck Serono, it's 20% and I don't think that just because we had a very good third quarter and we are anticipating that this is deteriorating in the fourth, that doesn't justify to revisit in a fundamental way the medium-term guidance that we gave in that respect to the core ROS of Merck Serono.</p>
          <p>The thing has resulted into a Group ROS target for 22%. I wouldn't think that if we go for 2011 that that will change dramatically once we have put the medium-term forecast through our system. So that is the Group target.</p>
          <p>If we talk Performance Materials, I think there we have said that the Liquid Crystal contribution to that, we have a fighting chance to cross the 50%. A fighting chance means that if everything goes fine we will cross the 50% again, but it is not a given. And if we take a cautious guidance, or an anticipated cautious guidance, that could be below the 50%. But we stick at the moment to our statement that we have a fighting chance to stick to the plus &#x2013; above 50% in 2011. But the real buzz word there is fighting chance. So we are going to issue the new guidance as usual in February. They will not be way out from what we told you in this target scenario, but it will not be the same.</p>

          <p>Our next question today comes from Andrew Baum from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Three please, first regarding the gross margin improvement in Merck Serono you showed in the quarter, I understand the capacity utilization as a concept, but yield improvements typically tend to be sustained within biopharmaceuticals. And I am struggling to understand how you've achieved this, and whether it is sustainable or whether there are any other factors, including inventory stocking, which may contribute to the gross margin enhancement for Merck Serono. So it would be helpful to have your color there.</p>
          <p>Secondly, perhaps you could disclose what your expenses for marketing for Cladribine were during the third quarter. Obviously, I am thinking about the scenario assuming the European and the U.S. decide not to grant approval, what could be produced from your overall budget.</p>
          <p>And then my final question relates to STRIDE and the Stimuvax breast cancer trial, which you have seemed to have permanently terminated. Given you are continuing with the lung cancer, should I interpret your decision to terminate STRIDE as a reflection of Merck's ability to finance its R&amp;D pipeline, given the risk reward. Or is there something on a scientific level that means you had additional concerns about the breast cancer indications? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me start with the gross margin or cost of sales production cost respectively. There are a couple of influences. Capacity utilization isn't such a big factor in pharmaceuticals, but efficiency and yield is. In the biotech production you have a yield fluctuation stemming from the quality of batches. And if you are on a lucky string that can have, compared to an unlucky string, quite a hefty impact. So we had a good efficiency in that sort of production in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We also had, in our production costs, less costs from the ramp-up of our VV plant than we had previous quarters. This is by pure coincidence, has nothing to do with the planned ramp-up of the production there. And then there is a third impact, which is the product mix. And I think the product mix is sometimes not really appreciated in our set up at Merck Serono. We have two different features of manufacturing costs.</p>
          <p>And this is between the protective business or innovative business where there is no generic competition, and with our traditional business and local business, where there is low protection in case of strong generic competition, and sometimes dealing with very, very mature products which have lower margins, i.e., higher manufacturing costs.</p>
          <p>And as Elmar commented on what is shown on page nine, where the product mix is clearly shown, we have good increases in our protected business; 5% in neurology; 17% in oncology; 7% in fertility; and 20% in endocrinology. And we have minus 1% in local CardioMetabolic Care. This is a substantial change in the product mix, whereby a 450 million volume of mature product with high manufacturing costs shrink, and the innovative product was relatively low manufacturing cost increase strongly. And this is, I think, an underestimated influence of the improvement of our manufacturing costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you just say something about your inventory levels, where there have been any significant...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was no influence from inventories.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Cladribine, of course the third quarter performance has been influenced by delaying also some Cladribine launch costs in Europe clearly. But I am sure you will understand that I am not telling you how we spent, since Novartis didn't tell their write-off in their call, though I would love to know it if you happen to know.</p>
          <p>Regarding the STRIDE trial in breast, the decision is purely based on our financial risk-reward system. It is not based on the science, because we still believe the science would work in there. What we decided is that having going back to a Phase II, because as you remember we jumped from Phase I straight to Phase III. We could not actually convince the authorities to do this.</p>
          <p>And therefore, if we have to do the full program that's another magnitude of investment and therefore we would like to await the results of the lung trial before we further embark on high-risk investments into Stimuvax.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question today comes from Markus Mayer from UniCredit. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for taking my question. So again two questions, one again on the Pharma margins. So just for clarification, so you said efficiency and good efficiency in product mix. So am I right if I take then product mix, that is lasting, and efficiency that is then fluctuating compared on the products, therefore, part of the margins sustainable of this high Pharma margin? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second one is on the generic competition in China. What can we expect, from which products are affected besides Concor? And what are the effects with respect to ongoing, so for this year and next year? And another clarification question on Millipore, Millipore consolidation. On the slide, you show a change of your Pigments for Cosmetic products for Millipore to the Performance and Chemical division. So can you give us a flavor on this effect, then, as it should come in 2011? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, regarding the product mix and the yield, I do not believe this is sustainable. The product mix will change again because we had some one-offs in the quarter. One is China, which Concor affected. We have still competition for the last quarter in comparison where we did not have generic competition in France for Concor. So I expect that those products will go in &#x2013; back in a growth rate and, therefore, the mix will again change. So I think you cannot take these assumptions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's good.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding China, no, the effect is finished in the third quarter because we have done the change in the distribution model. Products affected in there are obviously Concor, is Erbitux and the Fertility business, as well as some local business, which are not on a global product level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, comment on the Pigment business. Our Pigment business &#x2013; sorry, about the Cosmetic business, our Cosmetic business consists of two parts, one is Cosmetic Pigments and the other is Cosmetic Actives, because many Pigments have already gone into the Performance Materials.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other part of the Life Science Solution business, it will be carved out at the end of the year and transferred to the Performance Materials business. We are talking about a yearly turn over of about &#x20AC;80 million with a net margin of between 10% and 15%.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question today comes from Jack Scannell from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I've got a couple of questions for Joshua. And apologies if I'm being slightly unfair here putting you on the spot. But a casual and perhaps unkind observer would say that Americans who join the Merck IR team have probably a lower-than-industry average median overall survival. So my question is, I wonder what attributes you think you bring that mean your going to have a happy, successful and importantly long tenure at Merck IR?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, is there anything you would change in the way Merck IR interacts with the rest of Merck that would make your career even longer and happier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I appreciate the question. I guess I'd respond to it this way. I am just beginning my tenure here at Merck and, obviously, I wouldn't be here if I wasn't excited about the opportunity, and also if I didn't believe that the business has a bright future. Yeah, certainly, I think what will drive the activity will be on how can we improve the communication levels with, not only analysts, but other investors.</p>
          <p>In terms of the cultural dynamic, I really haven't seen any evidence of that whatsoever and it's not really much of a concern for me. So I'm looking forward to hopefully, as you say, a long tenure here at Merck.</p>

          <p>Our next question today comes from Richard Vosser of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for taking my questions. A quick question on the R&amp;D spend in Merck Serono. I believe one of the contributors to the better margins was lower R&amp;D in the third quarter, and of that, was lower milestones. Could you help us with the major trigger points going forward for milestones where you expect to pay out in R&amp;D, and how you see R&amp;D developing going forward within the division?</p>
          <p>Second question, just on the royalty income, I think we've got an idea of the general trends, but if you could give us a bit more color on the general trends in terms of how you see that royalty income going, and more quarterly, how we can get a handle on how that develops on a quarterly basis. And, finally, just an update on the healthcare reform impact and what you're expecting to see both in the fourth quarter and in the first half of 2011. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much, Richard. Let's start with the royalty income. The royalty income we see for the next two years, meaning '11, '12, roughly stable. I cannot give you quarterly forecast, because I rely on the company selling these products, and we rely on you folks actually, how accurate your forecasts are, because we take those and slot them in and then we reconcile at the beginning of each quarter, and there you might see some differences. That's the best what we can offer to you.</p>
          <p>Regarding the healthcare reform, the healthcare reform will accelerate in the fourth quarter, hence also the lower impact in the fourth quarter that we cannot sustain the profitability nor the sales increase from the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We will have an impact in Germany roughly already this year 15 million. We will have next year 35 million. In the U.S., we have a double-digit number taking on the full year. We have impacts in Spain, which are a few percentage points, and other countries are coming. Greece, we don't even have to discuss.</p>
          <p>So I believe there will be quite a few percentage points coming up on us over a full 12-month period going forward into 2011.</p>
          <p>Regarding the first question, which I forgot?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it was just on the R&amp;D spend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the R&amp;D spend. I expect R&amp;D spend to hover around 20% of our revenues going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And any major trigger points on the milestones that we should be thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what contribute to lower spend is that, for example, we had to stop the breast trials in Stimuvax. We had the clinical hold of the non-small lung cancer trial in Stimuvax, which pushes out some patient recruitment, hence some payment. So these are some minor effects, which take part in our R&amp;D budget. And also we don't launch the breast cancer, as already alluded before, because the risk-reward metrics.</p>
          <p>These are the events. And the difference has not been so huge either.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our next question today comes from Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. Three quick questions, if I may.</p>
          <p>Firstly, I wonder if you could just clarify the cancer signal and the data you have on Cladribine referenced in the EMA document. I think you've previously disclosed five cancers to date in CLARITY. I just wondered whether you've seen any other cases in other trials or with longer-term exposure.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you very kindly provided some perspective on LC for '11. I wondered if you could do a similar thing for Merck Serono for full year '11, should you not get U.S. Cladribine. Background to the question is, I believe organic growth for Merck Serono year-to-date is mid-single digits, and just wondering if U.S. Cladribine is the only thing to get you to high-single digit next year, or am I missing something else?</p>
          <p>And then finally, a very quick one. Are you expecting a U.S. FDA Advisory Committee meeting for Cladribine, and if so, do you have a date as yet? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the possible cancer risk, because the risk has not been confirmed, because it was not possible to confirm a cancer risk based on the CLARITY trial.</p>
          <p>In the CLARITY trial, we had three cancer &#x2013; different cancers in there in the active group. We had a stage-zero cancer, and we had later on, nine months in the follow up, we had a <mark type="inaudible" />. So overall you could call it five, but actually three confirmed ones. One was a pre-cancer and one was interlase follow up.</p>
          <p>In the current studies, we do not communicate ongoing studies, how they develop. But you have to realize that each study has a Safety Monitoring Board, which actually does control the side effects of the drug. If there would be something going on towards malignancies, which is not in line with the general public, the Safety Board would react.</p>
          <p>We do not have any reaction and therefore, the clinical trials are ongoing as planned, and I'll leave it to you for interpretation. We will communicate hence the trials come to an end, which is our policy.</p>
          <p>Regarding the U.S. Advisory Board, up to now, we do not have a advertisement from the FDA that there will be a Advisory Board, but we have also no advertisement to the contrary. The review is ongoing as planned, and we should get, as already communicated, end of Q4, a response from the FDA.</p>
          <p>Regarding the ongoing procedure, it goes as planned.</p>
          <p>I do also not believe that a negative CHMP opinion will influence in any form or shape the outcome of a FDA verdict, as they will evaluate the drug on their own remit remit and on the file given to them.</p>
          <p>Regarding the growth without Cladribine, I think was your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I was just trying to understand. I think your year-to-date run rate is mid-single digits organic. Is U.S. Cladribine the only thing that gets you to high-single digit, or is there something else I'm missing for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think Cladribine would make this difference, if we would get an approval in the U.S.A, to bring us from an average Pharma growth to a higher-single digit growth for the company.</p>
          <p>But the good thing I think is still that, even assuming worst case scenario that we do not have any Cladribine approval in Europe and the U.S.A., Merck Serono still would grow in line with the pharmaceutical market, which I think is rather a comforting thought.</p>
          <p>And of course we have also Erbitux still as a possibility to accelerate sales, because we have still two trials going on. We have the gastric trial and we have the adjuvant trial, though not affecting Erbitux's growth next year. But we have seen Erbitux is going very well.</p>
          <p>And when you have heard the news from our competition regarding Alimta, for example, not showing a positive effect in the head and neck arena. The Berlinger product is not working. So it looks like in head and neck we are for years by ourselves, which is good news. And also in colorectal, I guess the news from Ernitumab is everything but encouraging for the company, but maybe encouraging for Erbitux.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes, thank you. Just one question on multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>In the REFLEX study, you're showing that giving Rebif is slowing down the onset of the full diagnosis of multiple sclerosis from clinical isolated syndrome. My question is, will you need to run a study where you compare giving Rebif early to a CIS patient, compared to waiting for them on the McDonald criteria for the MS patient, to see if there is a difference in disability progression, or not, in order to get CIS on the label?</p>

          <p>I personally think that this study has been discussed with the authorities. And in my view, this study qualifies to ask authorities for a label extension into CIS.</p>
          <p>And the McDonald criteria, actually is the currently most used and accepted criteria for these kind of studies. And on top of it, I believe also that it will help us in our discussions with the FDA for RNF, the Rebif New Formulation in the U.S.A. to get approval.</p>

          <p>Hey, good afternoon, three quick questions. First one on Liquid Crystals.</p>
          <p>Do you have visibility on the degree and the extent of the inventory build up? Digitron's estimated a North American build up at three times the normal level. What does that &#x2013; or would that imply in terms of weeks, please? And can you give us any further indication on the other regions?</p>
          <p>Question two on Erbitux in breast. When will you start Phase III, and can you tell us something about the design there?</p>
          <p>And question three is on Stimuvax. After the suspension &#x2013; addition of more patients and the restart, can you update us on the expected read out of START and INSPIRE? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Liquid Crystals, our visibility is good. We have said that consistently, and it hasn't changed and has not improved.</p>
          <p>We learned about the slowdown first by our colleagues in supplying the display manufacturer, which is Corning. They were the first to highlight a slowdown, which they saw. Then we saw with some of our customers that they discontinued certain lines. The next thing we saw that there was a slowdown in orders, and even cancellations in orders.</p>
          <p>As I said in my introduction, we expect at the moment this to last into the first quarter, but reverse in the first quarter. I can't tell you anything more about our customers, or their customers, for that matter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Erbitux in breast, we are doing the evaluation of a possible Phase III trial for breast.</p>
          <p>You have to take into consideration that we will lose protections for Erbitux in 2014. Though we see currently no biosimilar development, so under this assumption, one could assume we are exclusive with Erbitux until 2017, as it needs plus/minus six years to develop biosimilars in the current pathway.</p>
          <p>But still we have to make the business case. We are doing this. And since the trials are pretty long, the business case has to be clearly positive that we would embark on a Phase III trial.</p>
          <p>Regarding Stimuvax, the restart is fully ongoing. If my memory doesn't let me down, I think we have 41 centers open from 44 again. We have started to recruit patients again. So there, we should not incur too much of a delay.</p>
          <p>Since the trial is event-driven, meaning we need sufficient events, meaning, unfortunately, patients to have died, the timeline is somewhat flexible. I would guess it is somewhere in the horizon 2012. The longer it takes, that's better the news for the patients and for Merck.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our next question today comes from Liav Abraham from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually Andrew Baum again. Sorry for taking another question.</p>
          <p>Could you just repeat what you said on Erbitux in terms of when you think you'll lose European intellectual property, in terms of the timing of the impact of a generic?</p>
          <p>And also regarding Gonal-f, perhaps you could remind us of your European patent timing for &#x2013; and U.S. patent timing for that, too? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Regarding Erbitux in Europe, we have dosage protection. We launched the product in 2004, plus 10 years, makes 2014, where a possible biosimilar could enter the market.</p>
          <p>However, currently there is no, at least to our knowledge &#x2013; and one would see this activity, because you have to do clinical trials, and we have to disclose clinical trials nowadays &#x2013; we do not see any activity of Erbitux being developed as a biosimilar.</p>
          <p>Now, if somebody starts today, our assumption is six years until approval. That would bring you to 2017 as the first possible entry of a biosimilar. So I believe until then, Erbitux will be exclusive as Erbitux, though there are other products coming in the space, but there will be no biosimilar competition, which I think is rather good news. And do not forget, monoclonal antibodies to develop is a different league than a growth hormone to be developed, so that's much more challenging for anybody to do this.</p>
          <p>The other question was?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On Gonal-f, both in the U.S., where I believe Watson is working on an NDA, given &#x2013; and intends to file it is an ANDA. And then on Europe, perhaps you could remind us of the timing for patent expiration.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>May I jump in here with a different subject? Uta just tells me that my comment to the difference between the expected guidance in February and the targets given at our last road show weren't perhaps clear enough.</p>
          <p>So I would like to come back to that issue by saying, if we are talking about changes in our ROS &#x2013; that was the target that we gave &#x2013; we are talking about 1 to 2 percentage points, not more.</p>
          <p>And if I go to the important influences, then I would say that I do not expect a difference between target and guidance on the total Group level. I expect Merck Serono to be slightly up compared with the target, so Merck Millipore and Performance Materials slightly down. And I repeat these. Slightly up and down are between one and two percentage points.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me correct my statement. My memory let me down. I've checked it now. The U.S. expiry for Gonal-f is 2015, and not 2014 as I said. And actually in Europe, it expired already, and it's not expiring in 2011.</p>

          <p>Our next question today comes from Holger Blum from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi there, Holger Blum, Deutsche Bank. Unfortunately, two more questions.</p>
          <p>One, where do you see Pharma market growth next year?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on Rebif maybe you could talk a little bit on the development U.S. versus Europe, volume, price, and maybe the rationale on &#x2013; and maybe patent protection, as well, on the drug? Especially if you do a Phase I trial now on an extended release, would you have additional new patent protection then on it? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I expect the market growth of the Pharma market for next year being somewhere between 4% and 6%. That's what IMS claims to be. Depending on the generic expiries, I think maybe that could be ambitious, but that's the number which they communicate.</p>
          <p>If we take Rebif, in Europe we did not grow this quarter. We had results on weak demand, which can be inventories. Sometimes you have quarters where this happens. We did grow in the U.S., but only by currency and by price.</p>
          <p>There was a weak demand in the market, so I think &#x2013; you have also seen this last year &#x2013; that we had some quarters where we didn't grow fantastically. This is one of the quarters. I have no reason to assume that we will not get back to volume growth as we have shown in the other quarters before the third quarter this year.</p>
          <p>Regarding the patents, the old form of Rebif, which is not any more in the market in most of the European markets, we have an expiry in 2012. The new form expires in 2024. And in the U.S., the patent for the old form, which is current form &#x2013; but do not forget, we believe that REFLEX will allow us to have discussions with the FDA to launch this there &#x2013; will expire in 2013. Obviously, if we get the new formulation, it would also mean a protection in the U.S.A. to 2024.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But there is no &#x2013; again, currently there is no development in Europe nor in the U.S.A. visible for a biosimilar for Rebif old formulation.</p>
