          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It gives us great pleasure to welcome you all to the Grange St. Paul's Hotel. I'd like to take this opportunity to point out some important information regarding fire safety. There are no planned fire evacuation drills today. In the event of the alarm sounding, please be ready to evacuate the building. This will be identified by a long continuous ring.</p>
          <p>The evacuation meeting point is located just outside the front of the hotel on Godliman Street, just where you entered. And the closest fire exits are located at the front of the room on either side. In the event of the alarm sounding, the lifts will be out of operation. Therefore, the stairs must be used. Please follow the fire exit signs accordingly to the evacuation point.</p>
          <p>I wish you all a good afternoon. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hello. And I wanted to just take a second to remind everybody that today this conference is being broadcast. So there are people participating who are virtual, on the phone or on the Web. So when it comes to the question and answer session, please take the time to raise your hand. Somebody will provide you with a microphone and then just state your name and please speak clearly into the mic. And thank you, everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Scott. Ladies and gentlemen, a very warm welcome to you all and also those who are joining by phone and on the Web. We have announced today our full year's results, and we will run you through that. But we want really to concentrate and spend most of the time today updating you on portfolio and strategy, and discussing a new agenda for the next tranche of growth for Shell.</p>
          <p>So we will review what we have achieved since 2009. Then let's look at the growth agenda going forward and then the financial framework. And, of course, there will be plenty of time for questions.</p>
          <p>You know this page. The global economy and energy markets are likely to see continued high volatility. This is the interplay between robust structural growth in energy demand and unprecedented geopolitical events, such as the Arab Spring, the Eurozone crisis or the Japanese earthquake.</p>
          <p>Shell has the scale and portfolio choices to manage a through-cycle investment strategy for sustainable growth. Innovation and a competitive mindset are at the heart of what we do.</p>
          <p>We have delivered the strategic drivers that underpin our 2009 to 2012 targets, cost take-out, continuous improvement and 14 successful project start-ups. Our 2011 underlying earnings increased 37% to $25 billion and cash flow from operations, excluding working capital, actually reached $43 billion. Our balance sheet now has improved and has a position of 13% gearing at end 2011 compared to 17% at the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>Our improving financial position gives us room to announce a measured increase in both our investment levels and cash returns to shareholders today. We offered some $10.5 billion of dividends in 2011, which is the largest dividend in our sector, and about 12% of all dividends paid in the FTSE 100.</p>
          <p>Our spending in 2012 will be $30 billion net to support the growth program for the medium term with over 60 new projects under construction and in design, and this investment is underpinned by new cash flow targets for the next four years, up to $200 billion for the timeframe 2012 to 2015. So this is an ambitious program and lots to do.</p>
          <p>Now, let me start with safety and reliable operations. That's at the heart of everything we do. Our HSSE key figures are trending in the right direction. For example, 2011 TRCF and the numbers of spills are broadly similar to 2010, and our fatalities numbers have declined. However, we still had fatalities and other incidents last year, and operational spill volumes increased and so we have more to do here.</p>
          <p>I'm satisfied the way our people actually responded to the incidents like we had the fire in Bukom, the Ghana spill in the North Sea and also the Bonga spill in Nigeria. But still there is no doubt we have to make further improvements here. We look at these incidents and take the learnings across our global portfolio, with a continuous improvement mindset here.</p>
          <p>Now, let me look at the overall development. Rapid economic development in non-OECD countries is driving sustained and long-term demand growth for all forms of energy. Demand for oil and gas overall could rise by 40% by 2030 and this growth will be kind of equal or equivalent to 7 North Seas, which will require huge industry investments. But with many traditional basins actually in decline, the challenge is much larger, replacing declines on the one side, as well as reaching demand growth on the other.</p>
          <p>Regulatory and political uncertainties, combined with challenges in the debt markets, are adding to price and cost volatility in this longer-term trend. And we are seeing local pressure points from things like excess refining capacity in the Atlantic Basin, and a supply bubble in the North American gas market.</p>
          <p>As a result of all of this, we are seeing strong volatility in our underlying quarterly earnings. Our highest quarterly underlying earnings in the last three years were $7 billion in Q3 2011, or more than 2.5 times our lowest quarter in Q3 2009. These are cyclical effects in a world where volatility has increased and both volatile, macro and volatile earnings are now a fact of life, and we have to deal with that in the industry.</p>
          <p>Now, in Shell, we are dealing with this by staying focused on the longer-term trends. Shell activities provide affordable safe and reliable energy supplies for our customers worldwide. We use conservative ranges and long-term assumptions for project assessments. We plan inside a $50 to $90 range for oil and $4 to $6 for U.S. gas.</p>
          <p>Upstream, we are investing for growth, with a strong focus on exploration and continued portfolio build into resource plays like liquids-rich shales. Downstream, we have taken out a lot of capacity in the last few years. Now we want to optimize this reshaped portfolio to maximize profitability. And we will have some very selective growth themes.</p>
          <p>On climate change, we see mitigation opportunities in energy efficiency and CO2 capture and storage, as well as investing in themes like biofuels, which have CO2 advantages. On the financial side, we are planning for a balance between attractive payout for shareholders today and investing for shareholder value in the longer term.</p>
          <p>So let me have a look at the performance since 2009. Our underlying CCS earnings have increased by some 115% since 2009. And cash flow from operations, excluding working capital movements, has increased 80% versus 2009 to $43 billion. We have been investing for new growth and selling down non-core positions in Upstream and Downstream.</p>
          <p>Underlying oil and gas production has increased as we deliver our growth plans, and the refining capacity has come down by net 15% due to asset sales. And for shareholders, our total shareholder return was around 70% over the last three years, a sharp increase over the period and a competitive performance by Shell.</p>
          <p>Now, as you can see, on the next slide, the portfolio has developed tremendously in the last few years. And we will show you how this fits together in a moment. We started up three really substantial projects last year, and you know them, it's LNG in Qatar, GTL and Oil Sands and we went ahead with biofuels in Brazil. And we took FID on the floating LNG in Australia. This is all part of a large sequence of start-ups and portfolio moves in recent years.</p>
          <p>So this is my introduction. Now, in the next 45 minutes, Simon and I will take you through a recap on strategy, what we have delivered over the last few years and Simon will do that. Then I will update you on the outlook and Simon will also make some comments on the financial framework, and then we will open up for questions and answers with all of you.</p>
          <p>With that, over to Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. It's good to be here and seeing you all again today. So I'm just going to update you on delivery against the targets that we set over the past few years before Peter takes you through the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now, we set out three priorities for everyone in Shell back in 2009 when Peter took over. In the near term, raising our game on short-term performance, delivering our growth projects, particularly targeted at this year and working on new growth options for the next wave of investment that will grow the cash flow further into the future.</p>
          <p>We've reduced our underlying operating costs with the corporate reorganization, 10% you may recall against that 2009 baseline, and we've built a continuous improvement mindset inside the company. So now, cost savings opportunities from multiple, smaller scale initiatives into the future.</p>
          <p>Our free cash flow, before the dividend payment, was $23 billion in 2011, $16 billion after the injection into working capital. And we declared $31 billion of dividend over the last three years. Our project delivery in the last two years has gone very well, and combined with the higher oil prices, that's helped us to rebalance the financial framework to free cash flow last year. And that underpins the dividend increase that we announced earlier today. So we've worked hard to generate new options, and we've launched new projects for medium-term growth.</p>
          <p>A few words on the quarter. The current cost of supply earnings, CCS earnings for the quarter, including identified items, were $6.5 billion. Excluding the identified items, which were primarily gains on asset sales, the CCS earnings were $4.8 billion, earnings per share increase of 16% as compared to the fourth quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>On a Q4-to-Q4 basis, we saw higher earnings in Upstream, but weaker results in the Downstream. The earnings, of course, were impacted by higher oil prices and cyclical pressures in the industry downstream margins. We also had warmer weather, which does reduce gas demand quite significantly for us in Europe.</p>
          <p>Our cash flow from operations in the quarter was $6.5 billion, that's just over $7 billion excluding working cap. And the dividends in the quarter were $2.6 billion, of which around $1 billion were settled with new shares under the scrip dividend program. We're offering that scrip program again for the fourth quarter 2011. Our buybacks for the quarter were $0.3 billion, and they're all under the program to offset the dilution caused by the scrip.</p>
          <p>Now, quarterly results are important, but they are really only a snapshot of our performance in what is very much a long-term business.</p>
          <p>Since 2009, our Upstream underlying earnings have increased by $12 billion. The Upstream cash flow, excluding working cap, has increased by $15 billion. Of course, that's underpinned by a $50 per barrel increase in the oil price. We have had higher gas realizations as a result and we've also seen profitable production from the new growth projects. And the contribution from new projects like Pearl gas-to-liquids continued to grow or will continue to grow in 2012. So feel good about what we've achieved, the underlying performance and the underlying potential in the Upstream just for 2012.</p>
          <p>In the Downstream, 2011 underlying earnings were $2.3 billion above where they were 2009. And the cash generation, excluding working cap, was $2.9 billion higher. 2009 was a low point in the Downstream cycle and we've had the benefit of an upturn since, especially in chemicals.</p>
          <p>Refining, however, remains a very difficult segment for the industry and, if anything, we entered a down cycle across the board in refining again in quarter four. Now, we have restructured the Downstream portfolio quite considerably in the last few years. We've brought in some selective growth, for example, in chemicals and biofuels. And I think that puts us in a lot more competitive position, a more robust portfolio in Downstream overall than we were a few years ago.</p>
          <p>Our return on the capital in service, that which is generating revenue today, was 25% in 2011 and that's an increase of 10 percentage points since 2009. It's a satisfactory level of return. This underlying figure reduces by nine percentage points to 16% when we take into account the fact that 30% of the balance sheet, on average through the year, is still not yet revenue generating; under construction or unproven leases. That $60 billion of capital, that will move through into revenue over time.</p>
          <p>Both the Upstream and the Downstream segments generated surplus cash after investment over the three-year period, you can see on the right. This free cash flow position, combined with our capital spending, the dividend, the buyback program, they all resulted in a decline in the balance sheet gearing to 13% at the end of 2011 and that compares with the recent peak of 19% at the end of the third quarter 2010. That's only 16 months ago. So you can see the company's well-positioned to fund both growth investment and also the payout to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now, capital efficiency is an important part of our continuous improvement drive. We sell down non-core positions, we reallocate the dollars into growth projects. We sold $17 billion of assets in the last three years alone. We've announced exits from around 800,000 barrels a day of refining capacity. On the marketing side, we've completed the bulk of our program to get out of markets where we have a small presence and/or a limited growth potential. So, delivering on our targets to refocus our Downstream exposure, and from here we're working to improve the underlying operating performance and to generate much better returns from this overall reshaped portfolio.</p>
          <p>In the Upstream, we've sold 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of Upstream positions where we see others can add a lot more value. And at the same time, we've made $15 billion of acquisitions, and that includes new acreage. This has mostly been recycling cash from the Downstream into the Upstream, buying into immature resource positions and growth markets where we have either a technology, infrastructure synergies or other advantages that can add value for our shareholders. These are deals like the North American resource plays and, for example, Brazil biofuels.</p>
          <p>So, overall, 17 divestments, 15 acquisitions, that's the equivalent of a mid-sized, mid-cap oil and gas company that we've sold and bought in the last three years. So good progress on capital efficiency. We expect asset sales and bolt-on deals to continue as part of just our basic business model.</p>
          <p>A few words on resources. We will report our SEC reserves position in detail in the 20-F return as usual in the middle of March. However, we'd expect to see the headline reserves replacement ratio, all-in on an SE basis, to be around 100% and the replacement ratio, on an organic basis, just the additions during the year, of around 120% when we take account of the impacts of acquisitions, divestments and changes in oil price and the allocation of resource in production-sharing contracts.</p>
          <p>Now, in addition to reserves, of course, we look at resource as a broader definition, and that's what we use to manage the business. Now, we have a substantial oil and gas resource base in Shell. This chart shows you just the subset of the total resources position that is in active maturation today. That's around 32 billion barrels of oil equivalent or about 27 years of current production. And this is where we put the focus of activity in the Upstream. We look to commercialize these barrels and we turn what was exploration or negotiation or technology success into production and cash flow.</p>
          <p>Shell now has some 12 billion barrels of oil equivalent of resources on-stream producing today. That's an increase of 20% in only 12 months. It's the big projects coming on, but it's also 3 billion up and 30% up over the last three years, during which time we've produced 3.5 billion barrels. And today, we have a further 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent of resources either under construction or in development design options, and they, as we mature them, will drive the cash flow further from the middle of this decade onwards.</p>
          <p>Looking at our targets for 2012. We've made good progress on both the key targets, production and cash generation. We are on track for an increase in production in 2012. The precise outcome for the year, of course, will depend on external factors like temperatures, the Nigerian security situation and the pace of investment in our onshore tight gas activities, particularly in North America.</p>
          <p>Over the past two to three years, our project delivery and our cost management have gone well. We have delivered on all of the strategy milestones and the targets that we set when we first talked to you back in early 2010. We've been busy with asset sales in attractive market conditions, with a strategic imperative to improve the capital efficiency. And we've also seen changes in the external environment. For example, we've had headwinds on both production and cash generation from the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico. And, obviously, we're spending at the low end of our potential in tight gas in North America at the moment.</p>
          <p>Now, if you put together the divestments, the Gulf of Mexico and the onshore effect, those impacts together, since 2009, equate to around 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production or, in fact, 100,000 barrels a day since we last spoke to you in March of last year. So that effectively means we're substantially ahead of the targets that we set ourselves, both on an economic basis and underlying production basis, although the headline figure may be somewhat lower, as you can see.</p>
          <p>We have rebalanced the surplus cash, the key strategic driver behind the 2012 targets. We had in 2011 $43 billion of cash from ops and a cash surplus after investment and after returns to shareholders. Now, there's more to come on the underlying cash flows. As those 2011 projects ramp up, they need to get to full capacity, 150,000 barrels a day still to come during 2012. At the current macro conditions, and even with the net higher capital investment that we talked about, we would expect to be in cash surplus this year after the dividend payment.</p>
          <p>However, of course, the macro picture is very different today compared to the environment we envisaged in early 2010. Oil price is higher, downstream and the U.S. gas price are in the down cycle. So we are moving on from these 2012 targets, setting a new outlook for the company longer term and they reflect the new realities.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me hand back to Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Simon. So there is more to come on the CFFO side and also on the production, but with the projects now enhanced to deliver this growth, we are moving on from these 2012 targets, as Simon just said, and setting a new agenda for the medium-term growth. So let me update you on the strategic priorities, and you will see we are keeping the momentum on the strategic drive we have had in the company over the last few years.</p>
          <p>As I said, we have over 60 new projects and options today, dominated clearly by Upstream. As we deliver our new projects, I expect our cash flow to be up to 50% higher in the next four years compared to the last four years, or up to $200 billion for the 2012 to 2015 time period.</p>
          <p>Capital efficiency is a key part of Shell's strategy, and we expect some 250,000 BOE per day of asset sales and license expiries over the 2012 to 2017/2018 timeframe. We look at operating metrics such as oil and gas production on a very long-term basis. And you can see the potential here if these impacts play out; an increase of 25% from 2011 levels to 4 million barrels per day, absorbing the 250,000, which I explained beforehand.</p>
          <p>So let me give you more details on these themes. Simon mentioned it, continuous improvement is embedded in the day-to-day activities in the company. This is all about operating performance, controlling costs, implementing our strategy at a rapid pace. The opportunity set here runs into the billions of dollars. Themes like improving our reliability in Downstream, reducing our drilling times in tight gas and getting more from process efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Just as one example, our Q4 unit operating costs at our Canadian oil sands have fallen by $5 a barrel compared to the same period in 2010, with continuous improvement initiatives, as well as our start-up of the Expansion-1. We expect to take out another $3 to $4 per barrel in the oil sands over the next two years.</p>
          <p>So let me give you some more details on the portfolio that is driving the next tranche of growth from Shell. This is all about more energy in Asia Pacific, more deepwater and tight gas in the Americas and more investments in traditional and oil and gas plays.</p>
          <p>I think if you look at Shell's growth profile in the last few years, the investment profile was really dominated by three large projects, which was Qatargas 4, Pearl and the Oil Sands expansion. There is an important shift in our project flow here now these three are on stream, with 26 projects under construction, which will open up another wave of production growth. I think this is one of the most competitive portfolios of projects under construction in our industry today.</p>
          <p>So let me update on some of these new projects. Shell continues to be the leading IOC for integrated gas, that's LNG and GTL, and I expect to hold onto the position to at least the middle of the decade. We have delivered new projects in Qatar, as you know, in 2011 and our energy capacity is now 20 million tons per annum.</p>
          <p>The next tranche of energy growth for Shell is coming from Australia with 8 million tons per year under construction, which is expected to lift our capacity by 40% by 2017. Prelude FLNG, which is an industry first, is progressing well. The Crux field will provide part of the gas supply for Prelude, and we are discussing with Nexus to take an 80% stake in Crux and develop an FPSO there to commercialize the liquids content. We have entered the Abadi FLNG project in Indonesia in 2011, with a 30% stake and we have bought Bow Energy, which will allow us to increase the train size in Arrow LNG. Overall, Shell has around 50 million tons per annum of new LNG options under study.</p>
          <p>We have also made progress on LNG sales, with contracts for 6 million tons per annum of LNG sales signed in 2011, linked to oil markets and valued at $100 billion at today's prices. These are portfolio deals. That means the gas isn't linked to any particular supply project.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. This is an important region for Shell. We are one of the largest player in the industry here. The moratorium announced in 2010 after the spill did bring delays industry wide. The moratorium ended in 2011 and the new safety standards in the regions are pretty similar to the ones we have at Shell. The slowdown in the Gulf is still having an impact on our drilling program, but we are really regaining momentum here.</p>
          <p>The development priorities, beyond the projects which are under construction, are to launch new hub class developments at Vito and Appo discoveries, and you can see the timelines we are using there. We're also getting back to work on exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, with at least five wells planned for 2012.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to our heartlands. We have some large projects underway in Shell's traditional heartlands. These are plays like new oil in the U.K. Atlantic Margin, and new gas investments in Asia Pacific for Shell's LNG joint ventures there. Much of this investment is non-operated. It's an important part of maintaining Shell's cash flows from these profitable and long-life basins.</p>
          <p>So when you put all of this together, we expect to see attractive growth in Upstream in the next few years. I look for financial growth here, not simply chasing the barrels. You can see the impact this is having on our production mix, with growth in the Americas in resource plays and deepwater, and growth in the Middle East and Asia Pacific integrated gas.</p>
          <p>So those are some comments on growth plans for the next few years. And you can see we have some exciting projects underway here. Now, before I hand back to Simon, on the financial side, let me also update on some of the options, which we are maturing. So it's the next generation of project options and long-term investments.</p>
          <p>Some 80% of our capital investment is going into Upstream, but we're also investing in very selective growth in Downstream as well. As you all know, Port Arthur refinery expansion in the Gulf Coast is coming on stream during the first half of 2012. We are also working on new potential chemicals capacities in North America and in Qatar, which would be integrated with the upstream gas for feedstock.</p>
          <p>We're investing in selective growth in oil products, for example, in China, and continued momentum in Brazil biofuels. I think overall, we will continue to have a measured approach to Downstream manufacturing, relatively small stakes in new manufacturing assets, building just one or two at a time and positioning for low-cost advantaged feedstocks and market growth potentials.</p>
          <p>So, let me now turn to options in Upstream. We had five new exploration finds in 2011, including French Guiana and more gas resources in offshore Australia. We're also working hard to add more acreage to our exploration portfolio. We look for acreage in established plays, in frontier positions, where the subsurface is less well understood, but the rewards are potentially very high.</p>
          <p>But the nature of exploration is changing, with onshore resources plays in tight gas and liquid-rich shales, which are driven by land acquisitions and drill-out, alongside more traditional offshore activities. We made a series of resource-based deals in 2011, including liquids-rich shales in several countries.</p>
          <p>In total, we spent some $6 billion last year on exploration activities and bolt-on deals during 2011, adding over 4 billion BOE of potential resources. Combining exploration and deals, over the last four years, we have added around 13 billion barrels of resources for some $30 billion or at the cost of some $2 to $3 per.</p>
          <p>Now, here you have got two examples of exploration appraisal progress in 2011. French Guiana, this discovery tested an entirely new oil play. This oil discovery is a stratigraphic trap. It means that defining the edges of the reservoirs is complicated, and this will need some careful appraisal. We think that in French Guiana, the well confirms now over 300 million BOEs. We are printing two wells in this block in 2012, which have the potential to increase these estimates as we explore this new exciting play.</p>
          <p>As mentioned, in Australia, we have continued to find new gas there, with three successful wells in 2011, which could be part of future expansions of the Gorgon LNG project.</p>
          <p>Shell has a long track record in adding new oil and gas resources through exploration. Exploration has added around 15 billion BOEs in the last 10 years. Now, exploration is still the lowest cost entry into new oil and gas, and Shell has a global exploration program underway.</p>
          <p>We focus on large prospects in proven hydrocarbon plays, high-value near-field wells, resource plays like liquids-rich shales and tight gas, and we make selective moves into frontier acreage positions with, as said, higher risk/reward trade-offs.</p>
          <p>We stepped up our exploration spending in 2005 with positive results, and we are increasing our commitment to exploration again in 2011 to 2012. So we expect to see a 35% increase in core exploration spending in 2012 to $5 billion, as we drill up our new acreage and continue to build new options. Now, this increase includes a step-up in drilling in liquids-rich shales and continued investment in tight gas and CBM.</p>
          <p>Now, setting aside these resource plays, we expect to drill 20 to 25 key wells in 2012, compared to 18 in 2011. The drilling plan covers both wildcat activities on the one side and then high-value near-field prospects. So that's where we are on exploration.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to some of the development potential that we have over the next few years. We have some 36 projects on the drawing board for medium-term growth, so let me show you some of these.</p>
          <p>We have been working hard to build up Shell's portfolio in tight gas, and we have moved rapidly into liquids-rich shales. These are exciting themes for our industry, unlocking large resource positions, using advanced drilling technologies. In liquids-rich shales, which is a relatively new play for us, we are looking into our existing licenses across the world, where we can produce oil from what the industry used to see as source rock.</p>
          <p>What's increasingly clear is that controlling our supply chain is going to be critical in tight gas and CBM. The wells joint venture we have formed with CNPC in China is making good progress. We expect to build nine new rigs together in 2012 and, ultimately, to deploy about 40 rigs and support services like fracking on a worldwide basis for example in North America and in CBM plays in Australia.</p>
          <p>This is very much a story of drilling up and commercializing the portfolio, building a longstanding and profitable gas supply business, with interesting integration opportunities and building up liquids production.</p>
          <p>I expect to see total spending in these plays to be some $6 billion on a worldwide basis in 2012. Development spending in North American tight gas will be around $3 billion in 2012, which is similar to 2011, and at the low end of our spending range of $3 billion to $5 billion per year, reflecting, obviously, the weak pricing environment.</p>
          <p>We are moving to develop our Eagle Ford liquids-rich position following successful appraisal there in 2011, part of just over $1 billion of development spending on the liquids-rich shales in 2012. We will also spend some $2 billion on exploration and appraisal in these themes this year, with a focus on maturing our new liquids-rich portfolio, which you have seen on an earlier slide.</p>
          <p>We have quite some flexibility in how much we spend in developing tight gas and shales, and spending could be in a range of $5 billion to $6 billion per year on a worldwide basis over the next few years, including exploration, of which $3.5 to $5 billion would be in North American gas plays. The precise annual spending levels will depend on near-term pricing and, obviously, on our capital allocation choices overall.</p>
          <p>Now, some of you may know this, we have been looking at ways to leverage Shell's strong resource position in North American tight gas into value-added products. So Shell is assessing at the moment options for LNG exports, for GTL, for gas-to-liquids and for LNG to transport. These are value chain projects, which will very much play to Shell's strengths as an integrated player.</p>
          <p>Let me just stress, these are early days. We are looking into various value chain opportunities and it's just too soon to say which one, all of them or none of them will go ahead. The precise timings and how we balance the opportunity between spot gas exposure and integration will come.</p>
          <p>Now, the one that we have launched is actually a small scale 0.3 million tons per year LNG to transport project in Canada, which is called the Green Corridor. We are installing a gas liquefaction plant at our Jumping Pound gas plant and LNG fuel dispensing equipment at the Shell/Flying J joint venture truck plazas throughout Western Canada. We are, at the same time, maturing similar projects worldwide. For example, we are looking into LNG for shipping fuel out of Rotterdam and LNG for trucks in China.</p>
          <p>Finally, on options, let me update you on Iraq. In Iraq, we are continuing with the development of the giant Majnoon field. Now let me be here very clear. Majnoon is a greenfield project. Basically, we started from scratch and rather different from the brownfields awarded to some companies in the first round.</p>
          <p>We are making good progress, although, I have to say, on the logistics side, we had some challenges for the industry in Southern Iraq. We are taking the time to get this right and build it up, and we are expecting to reach this commercial production of 175,000 BOEs per day somewhere during 2013.</p>
          <p>We signed the final agreement for our gas commercialization joint venture in Southern Iraq at the end of last year. This is a midstream gas deal, so no production entitlement, and we plan to supply subsidized domestic gas to local power companies and sell LPG and NGLs at international prices.</p>
          <p>The early stages of the JV are all about upgrading and expanding the existing facilities. In the longer term, we are starting a 4 million tons per annum LNG project, likely to be a floating LNG, to avoid congestion on what is a short coastline.</p>
          <p>As we mature this portfolio, we should be taking some 15 new FIDs in the next two years, all part of a strong pipeline of new projects to drive our financial performance into the medium term. We are maturing these and other options, and we will launch new projects according to portfolio fit, profitability of these projects and affordability, which, of course, is partly linked to the development of oil prices and downstream margins.</p>
          <p>So this is an exciting portfolio, lots to do. We have it under construction today and we have great choices for the medium term. So, with that, I hand over to Simon for more details on the financial framework.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. Well, we've given you the outlook for strategy and portfolio, so let's spend a few minutes on the financial outlook that underpins that strategy, firstly on CapEx. Our net investment in 2011 was $24 billion and that's similar to where we were in 2010. We have taken 12 final investment decisions in 2011, and that's 17 over the past two years. So spending on these new projects is now building up and you can see the trend in the Q4 2011 figures. This will drive our net CapEx to $30 billion in 2012.</p>
          <p>We've also taken on new portfolio options in 2011 and they will have an impact on CapEx too, in plays like exploration, the Iraqi gas, liquids-rich shales. This will increase our feasibility expenditure costs, for example, in the new LNG and chemicals options. And you can see the main investments on this chart and we're putting the priority on a series of large themes, investment themes, where we get economies of scale through technology or contracting and procurement, and overall in the portfolio, we get the right diversity of political and technological risk and overall, we get the right size of portfolio, the material projects that we need to impact our own bottom-line growth.</p>
          <p>Now, the returns on these projects are attractive for Shell and they are attractive for shareholders. About 80% of the investment is Upstream and, of that, 60% is in Australia and North America. The portfolio of projects that we have underway has an oil price break-even on a net present value basis of less than $60 per barrel and, over time, as these projects come on stream, we're expecting that these attractive full-cycle returns will translate into a much more competitive return on capital employed for Shell.</p>
          <p>Now, our cash flow from operations was $136 billion over the past four years, 2008 to 2011, during which, the average oil price was $87. We're expecting cash flow from operations, measured on the same basis, but $80 to $100 range, to be some 30% to 50% higher than the last four years. That's, in aggregate, around $175 billion to $200 billion at the two price extremes.</p>
          <p>Today's downstream in U.S. gas markets are clearly in a downturn. So, in these figures, we've assumed a return to mid-cycle downstream conditions and a $5 Henry Hub in the outer years to give these projections. But we have got more conservative assumptions in the short term.</p>
          <p>Now, this outlook, the four-year outlook is underpinned by the ramp-up of the projects that we've already brought on stream in the last few years and the new project start-ups that we've already looked at.</p>
          <p>Now, we look at the free cash flow very carefully. And there is no simple formula for what we choose to do with it. I expect incremental CapEx, debt management and payout to the shareholders will all play a part, although I want to be clear that we see share buybacks primarily as a tool to offset the scrip dilution rather than as a primary route to return cash to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Also, I would like to be clear that we look at oil and gas production levels, they're an outcome of the investment decisions that we make on a long-wavelength basis, over multiple years. They're not a primary strategic driver for the company. Capital efficiency is an important part of the strategy. And we're expecting, over the coming years, around 0.25 million barrels a day of license expiries and asset sales. If those impacts all play out, then we would still expect to have production to average 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day 2017 and 2018. That's 25% higher than the 2011 levels.</p>
          <p>Now, this chart may be a little complex, but on the left-hand side, we're showing patterns of investment and the growth potential in the Upstream business. The dark bar is last year's cash generation. The two blue bars are historic CapEx and future CapEx.</p>
          <p>Now, we have been focusing our spending in Qatar and North America in the past few years, and we're expecting substantial production and cash flow growth from these regions as a result; ramp-up of Pearl, Canada oil sands driving this.</p>
          <p>Now, going forward, we expect to see sustained high spending levels in the Americas. That now includes the build-up of a deepwater at the Gulf of Mexico, liquids-rich shales, and that's offsetting a slowdown in investments in the oil sands.</p>
          <p>In Asia Pacific, we will be building up in Australian LNG and continuing to invest in the traditional heartlands such as Malaysia and Brunei. So cash flow there should continue to grow more quickly than production.</p>
          <p>So over time, over the next several years, I expect our Americas and Asia Pacific Upstream cash flows to show significantly the strongest growth. And that would reflect the highest spending level in both regions.</p>
          <p>So let me sum up just to look at the overall financial framework. Our business strategy requires significant levels of capital investment through cycle and it is designed to grow earnings and grow cash flow through the business cycle. For 2012, we're expecting around $32 billion of organic spending, around $2 billion to $3 billion of asset sales. We continue to screen the whole portfolio carefully to optimize capital efficiency.</p>
          <p>The spending levels that we see this year and into the future, they will be driven by the choices we make and the macro environment. And oil and gas prices themselves are an important driver of industry costs as we see. Of course, we can afford more flexibility on our spending levels in the up cycles. We must keep a conservative balance sheet to underpin through-cycle spending. And the dividend, as per the policy, is linked to the underlying financial performance.</p>
          <p>With that, let me hand you back to Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Let me just sum up. A few lines and then we can open up for Q&amp;As and Simon will join me here. So we have delivered the strategic drivers that underpin our 2009 to 2012 targets. The global economy and the energy markets are likely to see continued high volatility. Shell has the scale and the portfolio choices to manage through these short-term ups and downs and the strategy's all about through-cycle investments for sustainable growth.</p>
          <p>Our financial position gives us room to announce a measured increase in both our investment levels and cash return to shareholders, spending of some $30 billion net in 2012 supports a growth program for the medium term, with over 60 projects and options maturing, 20 billion BOEs of new resources, and all of this is underpinned by new cash flow targets for the next four years; the sum could be up to $200 billion, as Simon said, for the four years depending on the oil price or 30% to 50%.</p>
          <p>So, I think an ambitious program ahead of us, lots to do. We want to invest like our shareholders do. That means for profitable growth. So we are on this journey now and with that, let's go for questions. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Theepan from Nomura. Three questions actually. First is just on the quarterly numbers. Clearly, a difficult quarter in oil products. But it seems that marketing and trading in particular per weak. I was just wondering if there were any sort of one-offs or you expect some sort of improvement into sort of 2012 in terms of marketing and trading.</p>
          <p>Secondly, just, Simon, you mentioned major start-ups and you've got about 150,000 barrels per day to go in terms of &#x2013; from 2011. Can you give us any indication of what the cash flow from Qatar and the expansion in Athabasca has contributed so far?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, I guess this won't be the last question on the financial framework. But I think you've outlined the financial framework and, in particular, it's about the dividend. You talked about the dividend linked to business results. You've also indicated cash flow from operations</p>
          <p>increasing up to 80%. But you are at the low end of gearing. You talk about dividend growth in 2012. I was wondering two questions. I mean, how should one look at the dividend in terms of growth going forward, in the context of what we've talked about in terms of cash generation? I appreciate capital investment is increasing, but surely there's scope to increase that dividend by more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. I think I take the first one. You can take the second and you start with three, and then I may come in on three, so. On the OP results and the outlook, I think, on the &#x2013; we had the refining side and we all know the negative impacts on the refining margins across the world. I think, on top of it, clearly, at Shell, we had got three impacts, which were a little bit unique. One was we had $150 million charge coming from the Bukom fire, which was in the quarter. We had roughly Q4/Q4 $100 million FX effects, which were in addition to that. And &#x2013; we've had the two, yeah. And, therefore, I think, the refinery results are actually, my opinion, pretty much in line with what we have seen in the market.</p>
          <p>Sorry, there was a third one. We have no Mid-continent refineries. And therefore, the whole WTI versus the Brent kind of benefit, which a lot of our peers actually had, we just didn't have. So I think if you add the three back, I think you look at the refinery portfolio in a very similar way to the industry players.</p>
          <p>Now, we had a perfect storm. After the driving season, the demand just collapsed, both in the U.S. but also in Europe. Weak refining margin, overcapacity, demand coming down, trading going clearly from a contango in a bank federation, so you had the whole chain actually being affected in a very short period. Whilst normally our marketing, trading and business thus kind of smoothes out the big effects on the refining side, this quarter was just a perfect storm and everything was coming in.</p>
          <p>So, looking forward, my assumption is, clearly, we saw some recovery of refinery margins. You have on these numbers already the first few weeks. So we'll see where that goes. I'm pessimistic on the refining. It's overcapacity, new capacity coming on-stream.</p>
          <p>On the marketing trading side, I'm more optimistic the way I see the rest of the year. But I think we will see how this goes. But the Q4 was a real perfect storm type of example, where the integrated chain really was under pressure in all the areas.</p>
          <p>I think you give Qatar, et cetera for numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. The three big projects, what we have said on the production potential is total, and this includes the first phase of Athabasca as well, is 450,000 barrels a day. In the third quarter, we were around 300,000 barrels a day &#x2013; fourth quarter 300,000. So there's 150,000 more to come from that activity. That's about 180,000 in Qatar, 115,000 or so in Athabasca. We had some downtime on the first part of Athabasca. Expansion was running okay. GTL was about 110,000 barrels a day. So steady ramp-up, still you can see quite a lot to come.</p>
          <p>What we've said on the cash flow side, contribution, at $70 a barrel, those three projects would deliver $5 billion of cash in a given year because the oil price was higher, but we actually delivered about just under $2.5 billion from those three projects last year, about $800 million in the fourth quarter. I'm being kind with you in terms of granularity at the moment. We're not going to give this information every quarter as we go forward. But it is important in terms of the ramp-up and you can see the potential we still have to come.</p>
          <p>Just say a few words on dividend?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Dividend, just how do we think about it? I think you have to say a dividend isn't just for Christmas. It is something that reflects our long-term strategic priorities and ability to pay the dividend. I've been CFO now nearly three years and this is the first time, I've been able to announce a dividend. So I'm very pleased today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I am.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And same for Peter as Chief Executive. In 2009, you as investors were asking, and quite rightly asking, could we afford the capital investment program we had and could we afford the dividend we had, $10.5 billion. We took decisions to maintain both of those through the last three years. Remember, credit crunch? How many of competitors, let alone industry at large, have cut their dividend or their investment program in that three-year period?</p>
          <p>We stuck with both. Investors are now benefiting both in terms of dividend growth and in terms of the underlying financial performance that we've delivered and the growth potential ahead of us because we maintained the investment program. We are still the largest dividend payer in Europe last year. We may end up second this year but we will still be right at the top, $10.5 billion plus. And that is a very significant contribution and commitment from the business.</p>
          <p>And we should not forget either that actually reinvesting the cash in the business is the best way to create value. As long as those are the right projects with competitive returns, we will create more value over a longer period of time by those choices. Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just summarizing the policy at the end, you are looking at the growing dividends, but as Simon said, if you will take a clearer view on the long-term options which we have on how we can generate, let's say, value for the shareholders, we will, therefore, take our cash flow and earnings expectations into account.</p>
          <p>I think I'm pleased where we are now. We have moved back into growing the dividend, whilst, at the same time, offering a lot of options. So I think &#x2013; and having actually a balance sheet, which is fit to face whatever the next six months will bring.</p>
          <p>I go first there, and then I come back, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Iain Reid from Jefferies. Peter, you showed the production breakdown by theme earlier of your 4 million barrels a day. I just wonder of that, how much is North American dry gas? And I wonder if you can give us a sensitivity, if, for instance, North American gas prices remain at these sorts of levels, how much would you cut off that 4 million barrels a day of what you announced there?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just coming back on the dividend. You say that a dividend's not for Christmas. But a share buyback can be, in the sense that you could turn it off and on to reflect the environment. So I wonder why you're not &#x2013; you said earlier that share buybacks are not your preferred methodology apart from wiping out the scrip dilution. I wonder why it's not the case because your peers in North America use that very extensively. So it seems strange that you've kind of taken that one off the table.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll cover the second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think on the gas side, as we have said, we have a certain framework between, let's say, $3 billion to $5 billion on what we could spend going forward. At the moment, we're spending at the lower end. We expect a certain price recovery later in the period, as we said, to Henry Hub $5 in the order of magnitude $15. This all will drive our investment levels and therefore, will drive our production outlook for 2017 and 2018.</p>
          <p>I would say today, if the price recovers in the way I have just described, I think you will not see an impact on the 4 million barrels. I would also say, if you lower actually the gas, the tight gas and shale gas investments, we will most probably switch some of that money either into the liquids-rich shale where we get more oil exposure, let's say, 60% oil exposure, 40% gas, and therefore, we would add barrels through that. Or if you have more money being freed up, which we don't want to spend in the U.S., with the options which we have in the funnel, and we have deliberately more options that we think we can actually do ourselves, some of them we will have to monetize, we could actually then develop that.</p>
          <p>So I think in the way I look from a macro picture, I think we will manage to those 4 million barrels in whatever shape or form. The only thing I'm not going to do is it's exactly X gas because I don't know how much gas it will be, but we will go for the 4 million barrels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. A couple of words on buybacks. Just to reiterate. It is our policy to use buybacks to offset the scrip dividend. That means that the current rate of scrip takeup, around $3 billion per year. We're not like our American friends in that there are some restrictions on how quickly we can do this. We can only buy back B shares as a result of withholding tax restrictions around the A shares, and we can only buy back a quarter of the liquidity on any given day.</p>
          <p>We've been running flat out and still only made $1 billion plus in the second half of</p>
          <p>last year. And we're not going to do it when the market is not attractive either. So there isn't actually a limit on our buybacks this year, other than how quickly we can do them. We have the cash available, but policy-wise, at the moment, we do not see buybacks as a major priority in terms of the return to shareholders.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Jason Kenney from Santander. So your cash flow forecast, the 30% to 50% increase depends very much on the Downstream moving back to mid-cycle earnings. And I'm wondering roughly what you would be expecting to earn mid-cycle earnings from the Downstream division. And if you were to stay at today's kind of conditions, what that percentage increase would be relative to the 30% lower level.</p>
          <p>And then the second question would be the sustainability of the integrated gas result, which was quite special in the fourth quarter. I mean you'd spoken about Qatar already. But are you willing to guide a bit more on integrated gas earnings for the next year or the medium term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll leave the mid-cycle to you. I do the integrated gas earnings, so go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Downstream $8 billion of cash generation, excluding working capital last year, the capital employed in the Downstream remains around $70 billion, of which a lot is actually in the working capital. Clearly, we need to grow that, both in chemicals and in the Downstream and do better from the refining. The figures we've just given, the $175 billion to $200 billion are not particularly dependent on Downstream, even four times, eight, 32 are still quite &#x2013; the majority is, obviously, Upstream. So it's not fully dependent on Downstream. It does depend on a pickup two/three years out. But it's not a significant contributor toward the growth that we expect to see compared to the $136 billion that we've just seen.</p>
          <p>What is a reasonable rate of return? Well, we've previously talked we have to get above cost of capital return on capital at the bottom of the cycle. We're not there today. Our actual return was around 7% on a FIFO accounting basis. So we know we need to do better. Some of the things we've talked about today are what we expect to help us get there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jason. I pretty much know &#x2013; you know that I will not give you guidance in terms of numbers for the integrated gas. But I think it is &#x2013; you can really see the strategy coming to life with clearly bringing the integrated gas projects on stream, not just Qatargas, bringing all the others on stream, running the LNG business on a 90% long-term contract basis, with roughly 80% oil price linked. And I think these are parts of our strategy, which you now will see obviously the earnings coming in.</p>
          <p>And then don't forget, GTL is coming into that line as well. And therefore, you will see growth in that line. Assuming the oil price stays roughly at the same level, you will see growth because GTL will just come more in into 2012. But very pleased about the strategic drivers there, and it's really something which we push, as you have heard from the presentation.</p>
          <p>Okay. Well, Lucy, come back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. You gave a range of cash flow outcomes on a $80 to $100 price range. How does your CapEx numbers look going forward on a range of different outcomes? And could I also ask in terms of the cash sort of apportionment, we had a 2% increase in the dividend for 2012, a 20% increase in terms of organic CapEx, so is that actually your preference in terms of how your cash will be utilized over the next four/five years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. CapEx, you saw what we have as a net $30 billion for 2012. Given the 17 FIDs which we have taken, you have already seen in the second half that the CapEx was ramping up, so we came down in the first half as the new projects came on stream and then we went up. So the CapEx for 2012 is really what we give as a guidance. Going forward, I would just say, as we said, we will structure our priorities also along the affordability lines. So quite clearly, if you are in an $80 world, most probably you wouldn't expect that costs for CapEx to go up. If you are in a $100 world, we may bring more options and we therefore could look at more CapEx going forward.</p>
          <p>But I think this will be &#x2013; we will play over time and we will see how it develops. I think with the cash flow outlook which we have given, we have enough buffer in there to actually deliver the growth and we will have now, for the first time, and that's what I said, previously we had three big projects driving our spend. Now we're looking at much more and more flexibility. So we can react also faster, hence, typically in the past I said, when you go into these big projects, you need an 18 months, 24 months kind of timeframe before you actually see lower costs coming into your capital expenditure. So that should happen a little bit faster. And if you are in a lower oil price world, you need to balance that.</p>
          <p>So I think let's look at the 2013, 2014, 2015 later when we are there. I think we have an ambitious program, but we will optimize the cash flow clearly in such a way that we can deliver value, short, medium and long term to shareholders. You wanted to take the other?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the dividends. The 2.5% dividend increase reflects the discussion I said before. We've reached the point where we can consider an increase again and we're very pleased, proud that we can do that. Organic CapEx, think of the relative returns, typically for every dollar of CapEx we spend, we expect back $1.30 to $2 of net present value. So that's how we create value. And it's the quality that, ultimately, we should be judged against, how we choose to allocate that against the opportunities available to us.</p>
          <p>So there is no mechanical calculation. There will be no mechanical calculation. There will be a reflection on a quarterly basis with the Board, does the underlying strength of the financial position of the company, both in terms of ongoing financial ratios, cash generation and the balance sheet itself for affordability at any given time? Now clearly, the balance sheet is much stronger than it was and can sustain in the current macro environment the level of investment and dividend we've talked about. If <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:08:41) the Board again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul Spedding from HSBC. You commented earlier about seeking capital efficiency. But if we take your financial framework, it seems to me that at the high end of oil prices, you are probably going to be in a net cash position towards the end of your planning period, with cash earning probably 0.5% maximum or low risk, bonds earning maybe 1% or 2%. That doesn't seem to be a particularly good return to shareholder.</p>
          <p>The area that you do seem to have some flex on CapEx appears to be American dry gas, which, at current prices, is probably also a zero return business. And it's also very a short lead-time business. You commented that the buyback you're sort of prohibited or find it difficult because of the restrictions with your share structure.</p>
          <p>In the past, when your share structure has caused you problems, you've done something about it. Is there anything you can do to your share structure to at least give you a buyback as a weapon because at the moment, it seems to me as though you're trapped by it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I would like to give you all the assurance that we are talking to the respective inland revenues and governments to deal with the withholding tax. It is not a particularly easy time to talk about taxes. Nevertheless, we are trying. I'm not going to promise anything. I just say that we are working on it. If it comes, you will see us go very fast into a one-share structure which then will actually give us all the flexibility which we need. So we are working on it. It is known. It's more a Dutch issue than it is a British issue. And we're really working on it. But tax and budgets at the moment are not an easy game. But we're working on it, so.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Alejandro Demichelis from Merrill Lynch. Just to follow up on the CapEx question. Should we be thinking that the $30 billion is the minimum that will allow you to grow? And then, if you get to that $200 billion of operating cash flow, we should be thinking about a much higher level of CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have outlined to you how we want to run the cash flow and how it's a growth. I just don't want to be dragged in now starting to predict 2013, 2014 and 2015. I think it's too early. We have given you a framework, which would allow us to grow in such a way. And I think if you look actually and compare it to our competitors, if you take Chevron and Exxon, they're actually quite higher on that side. Started much earlier, we could really harvest for a while, clearly our big spending. So I think we will deal with this year on year and come back. But I'm pretty convinced that with what we have outlined to you today, we can achieve these growth aspirations.</p>
          <p>Can we do more? Most probably, yes. Will the world change and costs will go up over the next three, four years? If you are constantly on a $100, $110 oil price could also happen, but I think then our cash inflow will also change. So I think this is a dynamic framework, which I just don't want to go into giving you long-term projections at this stage, so, on the CapEx side. Do want to add anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really. Other than the oil price does determine the unit CapEx cost through the cycle. So oil price stays at $110, then you may have to spend a bit more to get the same outcome.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen or at least it's morning over here. Sorry, I'm getting an echo, I hope you can hear me okay. I had three questions really about the 2012 budget. Firstly, how much have you budgeted for Alaska exploration? Is there a chance you might under-spend that budget for 2012?</p>
          <p>Second question is of the $5 billion exploration budget; can you split that onshore versus offshore? I understand, of course, the liquid's directed and it's giving exploitation and delineation of the gas, acreage drives the growth there in your exploration budget, but just curious on just the offshore piece of exploration, what that looks like year over year.</p>
          <p>And then the third question would be of the $6 billion 2012 Downstream budget, how much of that is associated with the completion of the Port Arthur project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Alaska and I think if some of you have more questions, Marvin, as he is camping in Washington on a regular basis, I think he will have a lot to say about that. We are very pleased with the progress so far. I think we are getting the permits. We are doing a lot of work together with the regulator in these authorities to prepare the drilling campaign. So I'm cautiously optimistic that we will start to drill in July, August and September. We have a ten-well program for the next two years and we are preparing ourselves for that. We have stepped up to go into that.</p>
          <p>Now, all what we have given to you today, for the long-term outlook but also the short-term outlook, does not include Alaska. So, if we are successful there, if we drill and we develop and we get volumes, that would all be on top of it. Now, I can tell you already, you will not get Alaska production before 2017 or 2018. It's going to be most probably later. But this is not part of what you have seen here, so, also not exploration-wise what we would spend the next two years, that's not in it at this stage.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The $5 billion of exploration, at the moment, about $2 billion will go into onshore unconventional activity. Not all of that is North America. At least $0.5 billion will be outside North America in China, plus some of the plays that we showed on the chart earlier, so imagine Turkey, Oman, elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Of the $6 billion in Downstream, how much is Port Arthur? Well, the answer is none really. It's an equity associate. It's already financed for the construction of Port Arthur, which is beginning. Some of the units are already in warm standby. And we are seeing the units by the middle of the year. They should be on full production. So no further capital injections to Motiva required.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was quite a bit higher because there's a lot of acreage acquisition. If you just said of actual activity, it was probably about the same. So it was $400 million or so in China, the rest in North America. But with a significant shift of what the activity is from gas to liquids rich. And in last year, in particular, quite some significant spend acquiring the acreage that Peter's referred to.</p>

          <p>Jason Gammel, Macquarie. Given the prominence of tight oil in the capital spend program moving forward in the Eagle Ford in particular, I was hoping you could let us know what the existing production was in the play and how much acreage you have in the Eagle Ford, if possible, broken down between black oil condensate, rich gas and dry gas?  And if that's too much detail, I'll just get Marvin afterwards.</p>
          <p>Then, second of all, on the Motiva expansion, we know what the incremental distillation capacity is. You should be able to share what the hydro cracking and coking capacity that's being added at Motiva are.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Eagle Ford, overall, most of our liquids activity today is on Eagle Ford. There's a little bit elsewhere, Utica and in Canada, but most of it's Eagle Ford. We've got 13 rigs, quarter of a million acres, 250,000; about 60% of it is condensate rich. And that's where we're focusing the activity this year. About right, Marvin? Thanks. I'm sorry on Port Arthur, I can't you give you the hydro cracking, not the specific capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll come back on that. Good. Jon?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Jon Rigby from UBS. Two questions, one on exploration and one, sorry, again, on the buyback. On exploration, it seems to me over the whole cycle since the issues the early part of the last decade; one of the things you needed to fix was exploration.</p>
          <p>I mean that was one of the problems you ran into, it seems to me. And $5 billion is a big number and I guess one of the issues of exploration is you don't want to be turning it off and turning back on again because you want the people deployed and you want the expertise and so on. So, as you look at it going forward, do you have the pipeline of opportunity to keep level loading that exploration through the next five or six years at the same rate as you're doing in 2012? I guess is the first question.</p>
          <p>And then if I look at &#x2013; I think you quoted some costs of resource ads, which I think was a mix actually of acquisition and exploration. But if you do a quick bit of mathematics, it would suggest that you can probably self-support yourself at $5 billion on resource adds organically. Is that true or is that an aspiration internally to do that?</p>
          <p>Then the second point is on the buyback. You said you'd try and do everything you could to give yourself the opportunity to do a buyback if that were possible. But surely, the one thing you could do is stop doing the scrip dividend, which would give you the opportunity to buy back stock; either not buy back stock at all and therefore, you'd be flat or then start to use that cash to actually reduce your shares in issue. Has that been something you've thought about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think on the &#x2013; you take the second one. I'll try the first one. So yes, indeed, it was the nature we did acquisitions in the explorations. We have always said where we can and we want to some niche acquisitions were part of the game. I wouldn't rule that out going forward. The pipeline and having the right people, having actually the structure, we reviewed this extensively in 2011. In order to make sure that if we step up the spending, like we have done a few years ago in 2005, today we have the people but we also have then actually people to mature the barrels through the hydrocarbon maturation funnel and that's exactly what we have now tested and checked. And I think from that point of view, we could go on and do this.</p>
          <p>The other thing which I said earlier on, which is, I think, important to understand, not everything needs to be developed in Shell. We have done this in the past. We are good in finding and de-risking, but then comes a decision, if you do it or if you monetize at that stage, we have done that in the past, and I would not rule out that, but I won't &#x2013; the options which we can generate in order to grow longer term with our organic growth plus strategy through the exploration, and that's what we are really driving here. So even if we find things, we de-risk it. We can farm down. We can completely monetize and we have done both, yeah.</p>
          <p>And it's actually also you need to think through this, also from a change in the whole industry. A lot of stuff is driven today with global partnerships, where you need to have international assets to get access to resources in a certain country or you do like we do with CNPC. And having actually things that at 100% on your basis on the exploration side, you de-risk it, gives you actually quite a bit of trading chips, which are quite useful and things you need in order to diversify your portfolio going forward as well.</p>
          <p>So actually, the exploration guys, they normally get a gross target minus. So they have to prove to the two of us every year that they can monetize, because that's the only way you can actually keep them pushing to spend the money in the right way. And Marvin can sing a song about that because that's how he gets his budget approved. So he always has to come back and show how he can monetize as well, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Maybe just one other thing on exploration. I don't want you to think we're being vague deliberately. It's actually quite difficult to be specific with you now, as the nature of the business has changed. We used to drill wells and add resources. We now have this big resource business, onshore business. This year, we'll drill 20 to 25 key wells, maybe another 25 or so traditional type exploration wells and 250 or so onshore. So it's an order of magnitude bigger in terms of activity. So I've given you number of wells. With traditional metrics, it's quite difficult. It's even difficult for us to have the conversation with Marvin about comparing what really are apples and pears opportunities. So we're trying to help by saying, actually sometimes you acquire a company, sometimes you acquire acreage, then you need seismic and drill it. Put all the cost together, last four years, $30 billion, 13 billion barrels and that includes East Resources and Duvernay acquisitions. So that's the best overall view we can give you of what it's cost to bring barrels in. Sorry, but it's an important point and I don't want you to think that we're dodging and weaving.</p>
          <p>Buying back the stock. Clearly, the answer is yes, but again, the scrip dividend is part of a long-term policy towards shareholders. Some of our shareholders like it, clearly. 30% or so have been taking it up. We don't want to switch it on, switch it off for short-term reasons. If I was sat with no debt and cash piling up, then I think we would that discussion, but, as of today, we're not. So it's not something that we're looking at, at the moment.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you. Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello. It's Martijn Rats from Morgan Stanley. Two questions, one really to production. You're talking of 4 million barrels a day, it's obviously a very encouraging one, but at the same time, the industry has a history of missing that, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And therefore, I'm sure you must have considered that when you set that target. Therefore, I wanted to ask if there's a very significantly downwards-risked target, or if there is actually some upside potential in this deal. I was wondering if you had any thoughts about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The short answer is I don't want to burn my fingers, so that gives you the answer most probably, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. The second question relates to the comment just made that every dollar in CapEx creates $1.3 to $2.3 in value. That's an interesting one because at the same time, Shell, like many other large oil companies, has not traded well below net asset value for many, many years. And I think you do fall amongst most of us, the discount could easily be something about 40%. If you apply that 40% discount to that $1.3 to $2.3 figure, you roughly get back to a dollar again. And therefore, you could say a dollar in CapEx, in stock market value, creates about a dollar and therefore there is no net sort of positive impact on value, at least from a stock market perspective. Now you can say, well maybe the stock market might not be efficient, that's not our problem. At the same time, I was just wondering whether this is something you would be considering when you're saying your CapEx plans and whether you truly have the right trade-off between the dividend growth and the CapEx plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>He can explain it. I can just tell you these discussions are quarterly discussions, not just among the two of us but also with the Board. So this goes around our head, so. And the value gap which we see, I have actually brought it to my top 200 leaders back in November and took them through the logic of the value gap, which we still see in our stock. And it's about time now to go after these things. And we have an outline of various processes, which we go through and projects, not just growth but also underlying assets to prove that our assets can do more. So this is very much also how we drive our performance inside the company. Not just when we think about on dividend structures and CapEx structures, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I said $1.30 to $2 that we would expect to get. If we got $2.30, I'd be very pleased, of course. And the key thing is, indeed, embedding that thinking in the organization. And there are three people in the audience, actually, Marvin, who spends most of the money; Maarten Wetselaar, who actually looks after Malcolm's money; and Ruth Cairnie is Head of Strategy who actually helps me decide who gets the money in the first place. So on all of the individuals, their targets, they are expected to know what they need to do to close the gap that you refer to.</p>
          <p>And I think we see it that there are one or two big explanations. One of them is your ability to deliver value from the current assets, continuous improvement, operational excellence and just do that better than anybody else; the return on capital. We know where the gaps are. We are working on them, and all of our asset managers are with us on this, what work do they need to do.</p>
          <p>The second thing is the capital that we invest; we need to convince you, amongst others, that it really is going to deliver that much value. And unfortunately, 10 years ago, we lived in a trust-me world. I could stand here and you might believe me. We now live in a show-me and verify and prove it quarter-after-quarter world.</p>
          <p>So we know, and we've been saying for some time, you need to judge us quarter by quarter as the current projects come on, show the quality of the current projects, and believe that the new projects, the Gorgon, the Prelude, the onshore gas, the deepwater, are going to be as good as the current wave. And then you've got to believe we can replicate it and grow over time with the new opportunities.</p>
          <p>That's what the strategy is built around. That's how we play it internally. And that, we fully accept, we have to prove it. We have to show it quarter by quarter, which is why a fourth quarter is a kick into the system. We know what the impact is both on external perception and what we need to do internally.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Coming back to the dividend if I may, so two questions. First of all, you have a new dividend policy or you introduced a new policy back in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And today, we're seeing the first increase since 2009. Prior to you coming in, the pattern used to be an increase in the Q4 dividend, leaving the subsequent three quarters flat. Is there anything to read in the fact that you're now increasing the first quarter's dividend for next year?</p>
          <p>Related to that is the word you used in relation to the dividend, which is affordability. I mean, clearly, there's no issue of affordability today. You have a 13% gearing and there would be no issue of affordability in your mid-cycle scenario when you are net of cash. What is the stress case that the Board is concerned about over the next six to nine months that might, indeed, create an issue of affordability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I was CFO during that time, I think I take the first one. As far as I remember, but I'm happy to check, we always announced &#x2013; and maybe JJ knows that, we always announced in Q4 for Q1. So we have not changed this, this time. But I will check back. But I think that's the policy at least I have used. Maybe earlier, it was different. But I think that's what we have used over the last few years. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I will still check. So if I had one year, where I didn't follow that pattern, so. Do you want to take this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So don't read too much into the timing. But it is a quarterly discussion. We don't only discuss it at the end of January. What was the stress case? What are we worried about? Well, we've been pretty resilient against anything down to $70, $80 for a period of time. How long that period might be, it would determine how stressed we might get. But that's not really the point.</p>
          <p>What we're looking at is once you've increased the dividend, we don't want to keep &#x2013; are we going to pull it back again? So we have to be that much more careful about going up in the first place. We still think it represents a pretty attractive payout for the shareholder and it's still 40% of our earnings last year.</p>
          <p>So it's not an easily covered dividend in the event that the price comes off and we need to &#x2013; the balance sheet's in a better place but the rating agencies are also a little bit tougher than they once were. And that AA rating means a lot of us. So it's all of those things we balance. And I wouldn't want to give an oil price case, but you know we look at $50 to $90 on the range. I'm not sure we see it right at the bottom of that one over the next 12 months, but we could certainly see it in the middle of that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Come to you and then go back somewhere there, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Oswald Clint, Sanford Bernstein. I just want to focus back again on the liquids-rich shales and the lots of comments you made about them. You've got 15 liquid-rich shales globally. I just wondered are those the top 15 that you've found within a screening process? If they're in the exploration bucket, do you think of these like exploration prospects whereby one in four or one in five of these will be successful? So how should we think about that?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, I guess, related to the 4 million barrels per day in 2017, maybe if you could talk about the decline rates in the base production that's embedded with that. And maybe put that in context of today's decline rate, what it will be in 2017, and maybe actually what it was five years ago. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second question, we always used 4% to 6% and we have been in that range for a long time. And we are not going to give a 2017 number. But that's the range which we have used in that sense.</p>
          <p>On screening and adding, it is clearly something which we are pursuing on a worldwide basis and we have given you some insight. The screening or the prioritization has not finished. We are working further on potential opportunities. And then I think we have given you all today what the potential is in all of these plays over the longer term. And I think I'll leave it at that at this stage before we go deep per basin, per basin or prospect by prospect. But the screening exercise and the adding exercise is still ongoing, and we will be forthcoming during 2012 and 2013 when we actually add more acreage.</p>
          <p>But I can just go as far as saying that in our existing acreage across the world and licenses and permits, we have got quite a high number of potential possibilities. And we are looking at them. Some countries are further advanced than some others. I think we are very much advanced in North America and in Latin America. So we went into Argentina. We are looking at Colombia. We're looking at other areas, U.S. and Canada. I think in the rest of the world, the pace has been somewhat slower, but is now picking up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just a comment on decline rates if it helps. This is another area that gets less easy to translate in a single headline number again, because of the unconventionals. They either have no decline if you keep drilling, or they have enormous decline if you don't. So take that piece of the portfolio out. That depends on how much we spend. The rest of the portfolio, still in the 4% to 6% range, but it's a lot closer to 4% than 6% than it used to be. So it's better than it was because of the amount of long-life assets in the portfolio.</p>
          <p>So the shape of the portfolio is changing over time. Today's unconventional production's less than 10%. It could grow towards 20% and then what I've just said starts to make a much bigger impact on decline overall.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We have a question from <mark type="ph" /> Alex Murray (1:35:04). Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First question is on Iraq. Could you elaborate a little bit on the economics of the Basrah Gas project? And, in particular, will it be profitable only thanks to the LNG part of the project, or will the domestic gas part will be profitable on its own as well?</p>
          <p>And second question, coming back to prior comments on buyback and share structure. Would you consider simplifying the share structure by, for example, merging your two classes of shares or keeping only one of them? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Alex for the question. And the second one, the answer is yes. If the withholding tax is solved and we would go rather faster or sooner than later into one share structure. But we need to sort out the tax issue there. That's something which we tried to do back in 2004 when we brought the two companies together. But we haven't been able to do it so far.</p>
          <p>On the Iraq side, I think we look at this project in two stages. And therefore, we look also at two profitabilities and both parts are profitable. So the first one is what we are doing now, which is the domestic gas. It's the export of LPG, et cetera. And then the second one, there could be longer term an LNG play. But the longer term is quite a few years down the road. And from that point of view, we have been clearly focusing on the first part and that first part had to go and pass through our profitability hurdles, which we have internally in the company. So we are now looking at one big project whereby one part is really an option for the very, very longer term. And thanks for the question.</p>
          <p>And then I think I had one there. Yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Iain Armstrong, Brewin Dolphin. Do you have an implicit assumption that there's going to be a well established export market for LNG in the U.S. given that you're putting so much more money into shale gas? Because it strikes me that everyone's trying to do this. You're putting money into a market which is already in surplus, with the assumption that the gas price is going to get higher. Are you making some assumption that U.S. GDP's going to suddenly accelerate over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I do agree there is too much gas around at the moment. And I think that's why we say we look at possibility to change, to <mark type="ph" /> have enough exposure into (1:37:45) liquids exposure and I gave you a few examples. I think I would also distinguish between the U.S. and Canada. So, if I look at Canada, I would see the export of LNG through the Western Canadian side as something which will happen and we are working on that with our partners, CNPC, Mitsubishi and Kogas. So I think that's an option.</p>
          <p>I think we will also see some exports coming out of LNG of the U.S. But I still believe that this is going to be limited, given the fact that there is potential to generate actually more out of that gas locally, so gas-to-liquids, gas-to-chemicals, which will actually use the gas and produce the energy inside the Americas, less dependent on imports, more job-generating capabilities.</p>
          <p>And I think whilst I can see that some energy plans will go ahead, I wouldn't think that these exports will be at such a magnitude that A, they will have an impact on the global market, point one; and point two, I think, it will be limited in capacity, because I think the more value chain integration will actually happen in the U.S.</p>
          <p>So bringing petrochemicals back into the U.S. is certainly a theme every politician, every businessman in that part of the industry is thinking about and is interested by now.</p>
          <p>Thanks for the question. Go to the back. Go forward and there. There is one more &#x2013; two on the phone. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Neill Morton at Berenberg. In terms of maturing new growth options, you spoke about recycling Downstream disposals into Upstream acquisitions. Given the fact that your disposal target is sort of slowing, coming down, is it fair to assume you're now happy with the portfolio or where do you still see gaps?</p>
          <p>And then just secondly, related to that, can I just confirm that the 4.25 million number in 2018 ex-disposals is all from the existing portfolio, does not assume any further acquisitions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You can take the second. I'll take the first. I think your question was about the Downstream portfolio or overall the whole company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The overall portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think you never come to an end on the portfolio management and optimization. You will always have assets which you will push out. And that's why we say on the average $2 billion to $3 billion is just something we will always do. And therefore, I distinguish between major portfolio rationalization exercises and the ongoing business. I mean we have just gone through a major rationalization of the refining and marketing assets in Downstream. And I think we have concluded that. At the same time, we are improving operational performance, et cetera, so we are moving down there.</p>
          <p>Will there be no refinery or no marketing assets being sold? There will be. Some at the edges we will do. Some markets we cannot actually grow in economy of scale on the marketing side and most probably will go out.</p>
          <p>The same will be true also on the Upstream side. You have monetization of the options like I described on the exploration side. But you will also have assets, late mature assets, which we may not be the best operator and we just will sell them. So you will see a turnover there.</p>
          <p>Second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question's really on the 4 million. Well, we did 3.2 million last year. We expect 250,000 of further divestment and license expiries. So your starting point's, what, 2.95 million? You have a look at the 60 projects, the 26 under construction and the other 30-plus that are in design and that's what drives the 4 million barrels. So of the 26 projects, they're peak production, which won't all happen at the same time. There's about just over &#x2013; it's over 900,000 barrels. And it's close to 2 million barrels within those under design. So we've listed the projects; you can see the potential scale.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we need to develop and mature those projects. We don't actually need to buy anything more. That doesn't mean we won't. It doesn't mean we won't develop exploration either because in that timeframe, it's possible to bring certainly near field on stream. But the target is not heavily dependent on either exploration success or additional acquisitions. What it's really dependent on is level of CapEx in the environment we actually see and good project execution.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Just three kind of specific questions, if I could. You recently put into place an exploratory joint venture with Tullow, with very little detail associated with it. Could you put some color on exactly what type of prospect that's going to pursue and whether it includes any of Tullow's existing licenses?</p>
          <p>Secondly, you recently indicated and announced, and I believe this project probably made a major contribution to your 2011 reserve adds, a sizeable Malaysian EOR project. Given the fact that the fiscal terms there have traditionally not been terribly favorable, was there a modification in those terms associated with the agreement on the EOR project?</p>
          <p>My third question relates to the substantial commitment that you made at least over a number of years to exploration off Nova Scotia. Is there a particular new play type that you want to be focusing on that was reflected by your decision to make this commitment? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take two and three. You can take one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Tullow hook-up is really targeted at joint prospects where we both see potential and we look at bidding together. It's not really based around farming either way, them to us or us to them, which is still possible, but it's not really the nature of the venture. It's likely to be in areas where one or other of us has some IP advantage, knowledge of the basin or otherwise.</p>
          <p>So expect to see it more in the areas that Tullow clearly has that expertise. Elsewhere, we have many other partners around the world. This is not uncommon in the oil and gas industry that you have partners for exploration in particular basin areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Mark, on the Malaysia EOR one, which potentially could be the first EOR offshore project by using chemicals as well. Very excited about it, 30 years extension of the license, together with PETRONAS. And I can only say as much as the terms which we have received for these extensions are attractive for the technology and the innovation we bring into the project from our side. But also attached to it, there is actually joint R&amp;D going to happen between the two parties for the longer term to develop more. So very attractive terms there.</p>
          <p>On the recent Canadian exploration tender, this is a new area. It's not much explored. But we see, obviously, some value in it. It's a new leap for &#x2013; to play there. And therefore, we have gone in for the acquisition of the &#x2013; or acquisition &#x2013; or the work program better say of the four plays. So this is not like in other countries where you do upfront payments like you are used to in the United States. This is actually a promise of work program and we will go through those in the years to come. I think, Marvin, drilling most probably 2013? 2014, yeah, seismic beforehand then drilling. So I think we go into some unchartered territories and waters. But obviously, we have got some expectations there. I think then if we go...</p>

          <p>Thank you. It's Colin Smith from VTB Capital. Your chart sort of implies, I think, that you're looking for about 1.5 million barrels a day of production out of the Americas come 2017, 2018. And that looks like it's up about 1 million from where we are today. If you go through the major projects, I add up 300,000, 350,000 barrels a day, which leaves a pretty big gap. And there is quite a lot on the projects under construction, but it does kind of feel like an awful lot of that is going to have to come from shale or unconventionals of one sort or another. And I wonder if you could just comment if that's sort of roughly right...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Of the question that Martin asked, which is you didn't really have to set a 4 million barrel a day target today with the other things you've talked about. And in the past, this has been a bit of a graveyard for forecasts for many large cap companies. And that, obviously, does include yourself, not when you were CEO, of course. So I'm just curious as to why you kind of felt it was important to put that out there. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I take the second one. I think the way I want to be measured and, therefore, also the company want to be measured is actually on the two elements, which is cash flow and long-term growth. And production is obviously a function for that. I think also what we have experienced inside the company with the target which we had for 2012, it does focus the minds and the cash flow does it as well by the way. And I know we are a brilliant industry in doing all the right stuff, but we have never been great in forecasting production growth and volumes.</p>
          <p>But nevertheless, I think if you ask the shareholder to spend $30 billion net and you promise to the shareholder certain growth rates of cash flow, part of that is also a long-term outlook of production. And I think that's what I really wanted to have as a framework for discussions with the shareholders but also internally as key drivers.</p>
          <p>Now, as I said earlier, I always like challenging targets. On this one, I was particularly sensitive because of the past record. So I was reviewing this inside out. And I can tell you; there were hesitations inside the companies as well to go out with that. Because we all know things can change five, six years down the road. But I just don't think you can spend $30 billion net every year without actually telling the world what you get for it. So it's a very simple thing. And I'm happy to be measured against that.</p>
          <p>And I will drive it and I think we have driven it the last three years. Projects are on stream. It's coming through. Yeah, we didn't forecast that Q4 2011 was warm and the whole production came down. That's fine. That's one quarter. We look a little bit long term quite clearly, and we will drive it.</p>
          <p>So like I said before, you will not get a gas number in North America, because that one will change. But I have enough in the portfolio to get to the 4 million including the 250,000 which we take out through the sales and the licenses. So I'm happy to take the challenge.</p>

          <p>Well, Marvin's here, so I don't want to tie him to the math too much. But if you think, the Americas is where the growth potential is. There's still another 100,000 to come in the oil sands. We've already said that. 250,000 we talked about liquids-rich shales, that's from zip.</p>
          <p>And we have set up 3 Bcf gas before. Obviously, the balance of those two will need to be considered. And we've just said there's another 150,000 plus to come in the Gulf of Mexico. So there are some real projects driving real growth. There is potentially more to come in the Arctic. So he's got the assets, he just has to deliver it. Sorry, Marvin.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's wait until he comes back. In the meantime, I'll take Lucas. You had a question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Lucas Herrmann at Deutsche. No, Peter, it's just coming back on your last point. I agree with you entirely in the context of balancing production with the CapEx that you're indicating. As a shareholder though, I'm asking myself, well if the CapEx is this and the production growth is that, and what I end up at the end of the day is a stock with a 5% dividend yield, which is going to grow at 2%. And we can all debate what cost of capital is, but ballpark can sense it's probably going to be 9% or 10%. How do you get &#x2013; I mean I'm going to struggle to justify the valuation or I'm going to struggle to justify owning your stock for one. But I guess the key question with that, therefore, is how does the Board determine that 2% is an appropriate level when the growth you're looking at seems nearer an underlying 3% to 4% out to 4 million barrels. That's in terms of production.</p>
          <p>The growth in terms of cash flow, even using 2011 as a base, seems nearer 3%, 4% of an equivalent oil price. Why is 2% the appropriate number or 2.3% the appropriate number for dividend growth at this stage? What confidence is that giving me in the statements you're making on growth, on return et cetera? What confidence does it show that the Board has in the statements that the company is making on cash flow growth, on production growth, et cetera?</p>
          <p>Sorry, I'm a great admirer of what you've achieved over the last three years. But I am obviously slightly surprised at the reticence to modify the dividend by slightly more at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I can repeat all what we already said how we look at it. Lucas, we have, I think, delivered the last three years. We are about to now embark on the delivery of the next few years. As usual, we had long discussions at the Board level on the right dividend levels. We looked at &#x2013; we haven't talked too much about the payout ratios compared to the competitors. We are miles above most of the others. There's only one and most probably Total is coming close. I still remember 2009 discussions with all of you, where in all of the meetings, I had one question is can you afford the dividend, are you going to cut the dividend. So growing the dividend is key in our discussions and I think that the Board is behind that statement.</p>
          <p>But we also want to grow the resilience of the company. We have delivered that now and we will deliver the next step as well in order to actually increase the flexibility to go forward and actually deliver our dividend policy, which is a growing dividend policy attached to our cash and earnings projections.</p>
          <p>So I think, as I said, being the biggest, having maintained it, I think we delivered actually on what we said we will deliver. And we are going forward. So I do think actually shareholders should take a certain, let's say, credibility out of what we are delivering and having a measured approach to dividends, whilst at the same time, I have to say also a measured approach to CapEx increases because you all think it has gone up quite a bit.</p>
          <p>But I do refer you to all the competitors. Look at the others. They have actually gone up miles more and one is actually also quite smaller than we are. And the payout and dividend is actually quite small. So I think we are trying to deliver on all the fronts and all the pieces. And I think that with that, there is a growth dividend policy there. And that's what we are delivering.</p>
          <p>And I have said this I think personally too many times. It's always fascinating you have this discussion here. If you are in the states, normally dividend is not a discussion. Because you either do buyback or you better invest on CapEx and you go in order to deliver growth. So we are trying also to balance the various needs of our shareholders. And I think we are here to deliver growth. And I think we have a fantastic story because we use the time bringing the project on stream, but we use that time to build actually the pipeline to go forward.</p>
          <p>And I think the cash flow growth you are seeing, again, I would like to see anybody matching those growth rates over the next few years. They are there. And the dividend policy will follow. But it will be a measured application of the dividend policy. I can't invite you for a discussion to the Board, but I think it will be a good one to have, so.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I have three questions. My first question is regarding the DD&amp;A charge. I've noticed that that significantly decreased during 2011 from $15.6 million in 2010 to $13.2 million in 2011. Are we going to see this figure in 2012?</p>
          <p>My second question's regarding the licenses expected to expire in 2017. Can you give us a sense at all for those licenses expected to expire and their contribution in terms of proven results in 2011?</p>
          <p>And my last question is regarding the mix between oil and gas in 2017 and what may be this mix compared with the current oil and gas mix? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. It wasn't too easy, to hear all the questions, but I'll try. The DD&amp;A charge went down in 2011 was because the impairments were in 2010. The underlying depreciation charge is just under $12 billion per year. It's almost exactly three-quarters Upstream, a quarter Downstream. And we expect no real change substantially into 2012. So that's the underlying DD&amp;A. Anything else on top is either impairments or the effects of asset divestments.</p>
          <p>Didn't quite catch the second question. I think it was about proven reserve contribution. But basically, there were three main areas of contribution in 2011. They were in the Groundbirch activity in Western Canada, in the Oil Sands expansion and in Prelude in Australia. They were the three main additions, but they added up to less than half of the additions. The rest were spread right across the portfolio. Overall, quite a significant contribution coming through now from the unconventional activity.</p>
          <p>Oil and gas mix in 2017. Well, 2011 was 52% oil, 48% gas. We have said for some time 2012 is the inflexion year. We will produce more gas than oil this year, whatever the circumstances I think. And we expect the share of gas to grow. How quickly it grows will depend on the growth in the onshore gas. By the middle of the decade, and certainly contributing to 2017, 2018, we'll have more big LNG coming on stream, so Prelude and Gorgon will make a difference. And we hope, of course, that we'll have various other gas developments, but offset by liquids-rich shales, deepwater, maybe the Arctic.</p>
          <p>So while it will probably increase from low 50s, it will not go to 60% and beyond in terms of the gas oil. And we're saying, of the gas production today, about three-quarters of it is actually priced against oil exposure. So our total exposure in terms of the price exposure is very much oil linked not gas.</p>
