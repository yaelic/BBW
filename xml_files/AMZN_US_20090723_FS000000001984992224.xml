          <p>Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Second Quarter 2009 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2009 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. As Jeff is traveling today, Tom and I will be available for Q&amp;A. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 23, 2009, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.</p>
          <p>During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2008. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12 month free cash flow grew 89% to $1.54 billion. Return on invested capital is 42%, up from 29%. ROIC is trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 451 million shares, compared with 446 million.</p>
          <p>Worldwide revenue grew 14% to $4.65 billion, or 20%, excluding the $227 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $2.44 billion, up 1%m or 7% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to 2.07 billion, up 35%, or 41% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 45% of worldwide sales up from 38%. Worldwide unit growth was 28%. Active customer accounts exceeded 94 million, up 16%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.7 million, up 21%. Seller units were 30% of total units.</p>
          <p>Worldwide gross profit was $1.13 billion, up 17%. Now, I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&amp;A combined was $829 million, or 17.8% of sales, unchanged year-over-year. Fulfillment was $389 million, or 8.4% of revenue, while tech and content was 253 million, or 5.5% of revenue. Marketing was 124 million, or 2.7% of revenue, up 23 basis points from the prior year.</p>
          <p>Now I'll talk about our segment results and, consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or our stock-based compensation, or other operating expense income net line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 13% to $2.45 billion. Media revenue was flat at $1.15 billion, with declines in some categories, particularly video games and video games consoles, offset by growth in books. EGM revenue grew 29% to $1.19 billion, representing 48% of North America revenues, up from 42%.</p>
          <p>Kindle sales continue to exceed our expectations, and we reduced the price of Kindle, the number one best-seller in our consumer electronics store, to $299. North America gross profit grew 20% to $672 million, and gross margin increased 161 basis points to 27.4%, driven by increases in third party product sales, improvement in inventory management, including vendor pricing, partially offset by lower prices for our customers, and changes in product mix. North America segment operating income increased 30% to $125 million, a 5.1% operating margin.</p>
          <p>In the international segment, revenue grew 16% to $2.2 billion. Revenue growth was 28% adjusted for the $221 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 3% to $1.29 billion, or 12% excluding FX, and EGM revenue grew 45% to $882 million, or 60% excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. EGM now represents 40% of international revenues, up from 32%.</p>
          <p>International gross profit grew 13% to $461 million, or grew 27%, excluding FX. While gross margin decreased 56 basis points to 20.9%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix, partially offset by improvements in inventory management, including vendor pricing and increases in 3P product sales. International segment operating income increased 20% to $179 million, and 8.1% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international segment operating income increased 43%. CSOI grew 24% to $304 million, or 6.5% of revenue, up 51 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $30 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 37%.</p>
          <p>Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense income. GAAP operating income fell 27% to $159 million, or 3.4% of net sales. Second quarter 2009 operating income included the impact of our settlement with Toys R Us for $51 million, substantially all of, which was expensed during the quarter. A one-time payment from Amazon.com will take place in third quarter 2009. Additionally, included in the second quarter of 2008 GAAP operating income was a $53 million noncash gain recognized on the sale of our European DVD rental assets.</p>
          <p>Our income tax expense was $39 million in Q2, or a 22% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $142 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared with $158 million, and $0.37 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $831 million year-over-year to $3.21 billion. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consist of cash, government and government agency securities, AAA-rated money market funds, and other investment grade securities. Such amounts are recorded at fair value. Inventory increased 20% to $1.32 billion, and inventory turns decreased to 12.4 from 13 a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories.</p>
          <p>Accounts payable increased 28% to $2.51 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 65 from 58 in the prior year. Our investment and net fixed assets increased $330 million from a year ago to $981 million. Our Q2 2009 capital expenditures were $78 million. Yesterday we announced the acquisition of Zappos. Zappos is a customer-focused company. We see great opportunities for both companies to learn from each other and create even better experiences for our customers. I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance.</p>
          <p>Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends we've seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.</p>
          <p>As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues, such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance excludes Zappos financial results and assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.</p>
          <p>For Q3 we expect net sales of between 4.75 and $5.25 billion, a growth of between 11 and 23%. This guidance anticipates approximately 150 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange rates; GAAP operating income to be between 120 and $210 million, or between 22% decline and 36% growth. This includes approximately $95 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.</p>
          <p>We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $215 million and $305 million, or between 7% decline and 32% growth. We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time with some variability, including from changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.</p>
          <p>We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks, and with that, Rob, let's move to questions.</p>

          <p>Great, thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&amp;A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And we'll go first to Mark Mahaney with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, I'd like to ask about North American trends, particularly gross margins and media sales, and to what extent there's a link there. Last quarter you had a pretty positive gross margin trend. You repeated it this quarter, but last quarter it seemed to be because of some access to, unusual access to inventory. Was that, in fact, still in place in the second quarter, or is there something going on in terms of the mix shift within media sales towards digital products that's really boosting those gross margins? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark. I'll start with the gross margin question. We saw in North America and in international we saw a very solid 3P, product sales, so 3P is certainly impacting margins. We had very good execution on a lot of other areas, including inventory management. You know, we had very good pricing with our suppliers, which was offset partially, certainly by lower prices for our customers, as well as product mix. So, that's really what is driving the gross margins.</p>
          <p>In terms of the North America media growth, we saw, just as a reminder, as I mentioned on the last call, we had very strong revenue growth Q2 of last year, which includes, if you look at it versus really any other quarter over the past several quarters, it's our strongest quarter, including the growth that we saw in North America media, which was up 25%, and we had some declines in some categories, particularly video games and consoles. Video games and consoles were very, very strong last year, and we had both console growth and video games themselves seeing strong growth.</p>
          <p>Three of our four best releases of last year were released during Q2, including Wii Fit, and so that was included in our Q2 last year and was driving the growth last year, and we're overlapping that. And so what you're really seeing is an industry slowdown in video games and consoles. And then we had books growth offsetting that decrease, so those are the factors that were included in there.</p>
          <p>And just another note on the video games, even though we saw a decline, we're actually very happy with that category. We have added a lot of selection since last year. Our in-stock levels have improved dramatically from last year, and there's a number of other things that the team has done to make that customer experience even better. So, we're very pleased with the customer experience we're providing there, and what we're seeing is an industry slowdown which we saw the effect of that in our growth rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go next to Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, good quarter. A couple of questions. As you look at Fulfillment by Amazon, I guess can you talk a little bit more about the impact you're seeing from FBA on the businesses in the form of just margin contribution, is it in the form of unit growth, or just a pick-up in customer growth that gets a little bit more on how FBA so far is influencing the business or affecting the business?</p>
          <p>Second, if you look at Prime internationally, I guess is Prime internationally helping to drive kind of the same behavior trends by region in the U.K. driven and Japanese markets as you rolled it out, and you've been in there for about a year and a half to two years now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those two programs, specifically, we're extremely pleased with. Prime on a global basis is doing very well, and in international, we are seeing very similar trends to what we saw when we launched in the U.S. It's been very successful for us. When you look at our international growth rate, up 28% year-over-year on a local currency basis, and that's with &#x2013; actually if you look, compare to Q2, you saw 20% growth rate as well in Q2, but we had a favorable comparison with the Easter holiday and an unfavorable comparison in Q2.</p>
          <p>So we had very strong growth rate, and certainly, Prime is helping that growth rate. In terms of FBA, there's not a lot in terms of specifics from a margin standpoint I can provide today, but Prime is growing very well, and it's certainly impacting our third party growth. And our third party growth from a units perspective was 30% as a percentage of total units, which was up by year-over-year again in Q2, so we're pleased with the growth rate and certainly, FBA is contributing to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the biggest influence on units or customers, customer adds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's not a lot I can add to that. I apologize.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go next to Mary Meeker with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. I had a couple questions. First to extend on Mark Mahaney's question a little bit, are you, you said in effect you're not really seeing a slow down in your media business from any digital transitions that are taking place in music or video? So that's sort of a question.</p>
          <p>And another question is, your EGM business is doing extremely well. Can you correlate any of the things that are going on with digital media transitions with upticks in your products that play those products, if you will, and then on mobile &#x2013; and a question for Jeff &#x2013; we're seeing tremendous e-commerce momentum in other parts of the world, and we haven't &#x2013; we're starting to see it in the U.S. You have a great app for Amazon on the iPhone; you have a great Kindle app; you have a great Stanza app. Is it your view that mobile can be a material portion of Amazon's revenue in the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the media one first. Certainly, there's industry &#x2013; there's some certainly slowness in some of the media categories. And we're seeing some of that slowness reflected in the North America results that you see. But in terms of what's happened recently from a trend standpoint, it's clearly the challenging pair that we had, versus last year, as well as the video games impact that I mentioned.</p>
          <p>In terms of digital, it's still very early. We're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of growth of our various digital products that we offer, text, video and music, but it's still very early, and we're seeing very good unit growth there, and we're very pleased with what we see there. From an EGM perspective, there's not a lot I can give you in terms of the individual growth rates of some of those items that you mentioned. But we're seeing very good, broad-based growth within EGM. We did see some slowness to some of the higher selling priced items, but outside of that, we're very pleased with what we're seeing. Overall unit growth globally remains very strong, so we're very pleased with that.</p>
          <p>In terms of mobile, it's a great question. I apologize, Mary. Jeff is not on the call today. He's traveling and, just from a scheduling standpoint, it didn't work. But, again, we certainly think that mobile is an opportunity. As you mentioned, there's a number of applications that we have. We're going to continue to innovate in that space, and it's difficult to say how big that could be over time, but it's certainly something that we're excited about, and we're investing in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Tom, this is Scott. I had just one follow-up, if I could. The operating margin guidance that you gave, the midpoint was 5.2%, and this quarter, in the second quarter, the midpoint of your guidance was 5.3. You did 6.5, which was the highest operating margin since the third quarter of '05, so I understand there is some one-time dynamics going on in the industry right now, but you didn't have great visibility to that overperformance in 2Q, and I was just wondering if you could speak a little bit to the conservatism in the mid-point of your operating income in 3Q. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, we gave guidance of 215 to 305 from a CSOI perspective, which is implied operating margin of 4.5 to 5.8%. So, from the upper end of the guidance at 5.8%, that's about 40 basis points above last year. And so, again, that reflects the right range for the quarter. One thing to keep in mind, though, is as you look at Q2 to Q3, you know those numbers that we were just talking about was the absolute, and then comparing them year-over-year.</p>
          <p>When you look at sequentially from Q2 to Q3, keep in mind that Q3 historically is a quarter that we're getting ready for our largest seasonal quarter, Q4, and so there's certainly expenses that are included in that quarter to get ready for, for example, adding additional capacity. And certainly, with the growth that we've seen, particularly in international, we are adding capacity to get ready for Q4. So, that's reflected in our Q3 guidance, and it's typical at this time, to be doing that, based on getting ready for Q4. So, again, that's one of the reasons you saw a decline last year as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="0">

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And we'll go next to James Mitchell will Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks for taking the question. Looks like your sales and marketing costs picked up a little bit as a percentage of revenue both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. Can you talk about what's going on behind that? And also, if you could just discuss your effective tax rate. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. From a marketing perspective, it was 2.7% of revenue. The range over the past several quarters have been in the low two's, 2.2 I believe to 2.7, so it was a little bit on the higher end of the range. But again, I wouldn't read too much into that. It's just based on the opportunities that we saw within the quarter, looking at new customer acquisitions. So, again, I don't think there's anything really meaningful to talk about there.</p>
          <p>In terms of effective tax rate, the way I'm thinking about it is if you look at the effective tax rate for the half, it's a little bit over 25%. Keep in mind that we had a one-time item, Toys R Us, which was $51 million. Substantially all of that would be in that number, which is tax effected at the U.S. tax rate, so that's bringing it down a bit. It's a one-time event. So, if you back that out, the tax rate would be a little bit higher than that, which would reflect essentially the projection for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>And we'll go next to Imran Khan with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. It's Imran. Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions. I think in the past you talked about how you are not seeing cannibalization from Kindle. I think you talked about like how average Kindle owners are buying 1.8 books. Can you give us an update on that number, what kind of trend you are seeing now that you have a larger Kindle owner? And secondly, I think, Tom, you talked about that you are seeing healthy growth in the third party and international business, but international gross profit margins, I believe, was down on a year-over-year basis, roughly 50 basis points, so could you give us some color to understand why? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I'll take the third party first for international. What you're seeing there is we are actually &#x2013; we did actually see very good third party growth in international. One thing to keep in mind is when you look at our overall growth rates in international, we saw extremely strong EGM growth accelerated to 60% year-over-year on a local currency basis. Many of those categories, if you look back over the past few years, we've launched a number of new categories in EGM and international, and when we launch new categories, oftentimes the gross margins are lower, again, as we're starting out in those categories.</p>
          <p>So that's reflecting the product mix. But if you look at our overall international gross margins, we certainly saw strong third party growth, very good vendor management, very good inventory management, but certainly partially offset by the mix that I'm talking about, as well as lower prices for customers.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Kindle units, we're not doing any updates in terms of the units, in terms of specific numbers today, but we're seeing very, very good growth, and we're extremely happy with the growth that we're seeing there. And it's exceeding our expectations.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. There's been a lot of talk about the tax rate, and some third party affiliates and the impact, and some of the jockeying around where taxes ultimately go in terms of sales tax.

        <plist>
          <p>It's one of these where we've been working for quite a few years with the states just on the Streamline Sales Tax Act. Beyond that, it's really hard to comment on what will happen going forward, here. I think it's important to remember that more than 50% of our business is conducted in areas where consumption tax, the VAT taxes, or the equivalent of sales tax, are taking place in our international geographies and we now collect sales taxes in five states in the United States. So, we have very strong businesses in our international businesses. You can see from today's results.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A couple things. First, on the media sales decline, when you think longer term, do you think you might see some pressure on revenues, but the overall gross margins per unit hang in there because of digitization, and could you actually see a margin improvement offset, maybe lower prices for in-sales? And then, secondly, Tech and Content looks like it picked up 24 million quarter-over-quarter. I wonder if you had any comments you could share with us on maybe where you're allocating that money. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The way I think about the gross margins for our digital businesses, if you look at our overall digital business, it's very early. Think of it that we're investing, in the investing mode, and over time we think that we can get very good returns for shareholders. And we think that there's a lot of room for us and content owners and publishers to do well there. We think that those are &#x2013; that we'll get good returns over time.</p>
          <p>In terms of Tech and Content, there's a number of things that are going in there. You can see from our employment numbers, that the growth is approximately 14% year-over-year. It's slowed from past quarters, but we did still see a sequential increase of about 400 people. Some of those people are certainly going to Tech and Content and investing in areas like digital and web services and other areas, which is certainly reflected in the Tech and Content costs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Tom, can you comment on the unearned revenues line and, in particular, it looks like you've had a very good consistent trend there over the last several quarters, which I believe is probably fuelled by Prime and the Kindle, and you said that you're pretty comfortable with where both of those products are. But basically, we're seeing from 1Q to 2Q a flat number in unearned revenues, so if you could provide some clarity on that, I'd appreciate it. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's a number of things that go in there, including the items that you mentioned. We do amortize the sale of Kindles over two years in the month following the sale. We are amortizing the Prime subscriptions. There's also other partner relationships revenues that could go into that line just some amortization. And beyond that, it does bounce around a bit, as you can see from the trend, but beyond that, there's not a lot I can add from a color perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you mentioned earlier just that you were, that Prime growth was pretty good. I mean, is there any reason to think that there's any slow down here in terms of new members coming on board?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in fact, Prime growth is very strong, and obviously, from our other discussions, Kindle growth is very strong so, no, we're seeing strong growth in both areas.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Two quick questions. Tom, you've lowered prices on Kindle, on Kindle 2. How should we be thinking about the driving force there? Did you get enough cost scale to still keep margins relatively unchanged, or did you lower price really to just increase penetration? And secondarily, on the affiliate question, as you pull back out of certain states, so I think North Carolina, Rhode Island and a few others, are you using other affiliates in other states, or are you moving some of that money to other ROI channels like search, et cetera. And which one has better ROI? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we use a number of different channels on the marketing side, and we're just looking at what's the most effective way to make that spend, and where do we think it drives incremental value to shareholders over time. And so that's not something new. There's no change there from that perspective, and we use a number of different channels. From a paid channel perspective, we also have our associates channel as well, so there's not a lot new there from that perspective. And then your other &#x2013; in terms of Kindle, with the price change, we certainly are getting better economies, and given the growth in Kindle devices, and we think that that's an appropriate price for customers. And we think that that's certainly helpful given the growth that we're seeing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. Two things, could we ask &#x2013; could you give us any sense of whether Zappos is going to be dilutive or accretive to earnings, and could you give us a sense of the post merger integration planning for that acquisition, and how we should think about it going forward, particularly if it is going to be dilutive to earnings? And then, second, could you tell us have you got any plans to take Kindle overseas? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, in terms of Zappos, we're extremely pleased with the announcement that we made yesterday, and we're not discussing the dilutive or accretive nature of Zappos. I guess the way you should think about it is this: They had approximately 635 million worth of revenue last year. They had a small profit, and that would certainly be before any of the acquisition costs, which include intangible amortization, as well as stock-based compensation, which would be post acquisition. But we're, in terms of integration, the way you should think about it is, it's going to be a standalone business.</p>
          <p>We're very, very excited about the value that they bring the customers. It's very unique. We're very excited about helping that team build the brand. And we think it's a unique brand new culture and it would be a great fit with Amazon. We think that we can grow &#x2013; it's a great way to grow our overall shoe and apparel business, and so we're very excited about it, and we've got a great team there, overall team, a great leadership team, and we're extremely happy to be able to make the announcement yesterday.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in terms of Kindle, are you taking it overseas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last part? Kindle, international? International... In terms of Kindle international, you know, it's certainly an opportunity. Our customers have certainly expressed it's an interest, and we have a long standing practice of not talking about what we might do. But certainly it's clearly an opportunity.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Just have a follow-up question regarding Zappos. Tom, could you just talk a little bit more about just the strategic rationale behind Zappos and leaving it as an independent brand and company? That's a little bit of a departure, I think, in terms of how you've historically grown your business under the Amazon brand? And then, secondarily, as part of that, even though it's going to be an independent unit within Amazon, are there any cost savings that we should be expecting from maybe a fulfillment perspective? Any clarity on that would be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Actually, the way we're thinking about it is this: We have Zappos and 6 p.m. which will join us. We have Shopoff, we have Endless, and we certainly have Amazon.com, all selling in soft lines, in shoes and apparel. And so we're very, very excited to have all of those websites with, if you take a look at those websites, they have many different brands, they have different customers, they have a different customer experience associated with each of them, so we're very excited to have all those. And from our standpoint, we're looking to learn from each other, and we think that those categories are very interesting. And we think there's a lot of growth opportunity, and that's why we're doing that. And so this is not a &#x2013; this is not an acquisition that we're talking about.</p>
          <p>You mentioned synergies. Certainly we'll be smart about it. If there's fulfillment centers that &#x2013; fulfillment centers that they have, if they have additional space, we'll certainly look to use that. Or if we have additional space that Zappos can use, we certainly will look at those opportunities. But this is not about synergies. This is about growing in categories that we think are very interesting, and so we're very excited about it. I'd also add that this really isn't that much of a departure at all, or is not a departure at all. We've done a number of acquisitions over time.</p>
          <p>Shopoff, as I mentioned, is one of those, is an acquisition that we did about three years ago, that's in the same similar category, certainly in the soft lines. It's more of an apparel, fashion for women's apparel and shoes website and accessories. And so we've also done a number of acquisitions as we look at some of our country launches, the last one was Giro.com was our launch in China, so again, we've done a number of these. Our strategy, as it relates to acquisitions hasn't changed. It's the same it's been for several years now. And, again, we saw it was a great fit, and we're really pleased to be able to make the announcement yesterday.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Tom, as eBay continues to transform its marketplace, what does that mean for Amazon? I know you already talked about Prime membership doing very well, but I guess are you seeing any signs of weakness in the new enrollment of Prime membership or any visible changes in the total third party merchant enrollment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a long standing practice of not talking about other companies, but in terms of our seller business, we had our, as I mentioned, third party units were 30%, percentage of total units, which is up over last year. Our sellers grew 21%, which is the fastest growth rate we've seen. In Q2, it was the fastest growth rate we've seen in many quarters. And our seller team has continued to focus on how to make that customer experience for our sellers as good as it possibly can be.</p>
          <p>FBA is an example of that. It's a great example where we can provide services for sellers. It's great for customers because they get to get sellers the use of our multi-node fulfillment network, which allows them to get shipments using our Super Saver Shipping and Prime programs, and so, again, our seller team is continuously focused on trying to make that experience better, and that's reflected in the metrics that you saw today, that I mentioned, as well as the gross profit growth that we mentioned earlier, as well.</p>

          <p>I was wondering if you could discuss the private label that you're creating for some products and just discuss the strategic value there, and any issues that that may bring up with some of the 3P partners, and then also any update you may have on your used video game efforts?

I don't think there's a lot to talk to, but again, there's &#x2013; we're certainly doing some, and we'll see what traction we get there. In the used video game, that's something, certainly it's one of the things when you look at our total customer experience for video games, the team, again, as I mentioned, has done a great job of improving the customer experience over the past few years, and that's just another example of one of the things that they've done.</p>
