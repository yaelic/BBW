          <p>So, good morning everybody and welcome to our Quarter two and Half Year 2009 results. I'm joined here by some other people from Unilever, I have first of all Jim, Jim Lawrence, our Chief Financial Officer and James Allison, sitting here our Head of Investor Relations. In the audience we also should have Vindi Banga &#x2013; I don't remember if Vindi, Vindi is here, Vindi is responsible for all of our categories, welcome Vindi, good morning. And Genevi&#xE8;ve &#x2013; I don't know if Genevi&#xE8;ve,  Genevi&#xE8;ve Berger who is our Chief R&amp;D Officer; we have Mike Polk, President of the Americas; we have Harish Manwani &#x2013; where is Harish &#x2013; President of Asia, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe; we have Sandy Ogg, our HR Manager and I see Steve Williams, our Legal Counsel sitting next to Sandy as well. So welcome everybody.</p>
          <p>Jim will cover our performance in a minute, and after that I'll give you my perspective on the developments of the markets, where we stand versus our priorities and obviously how we measure up against the targets we've set for our business.</p>
          <p>Before I pass to Jim to go through the details, let me just briefly summarize what I consider to be some of the highlights. But first obviously I have to draw your attention to the usual disclaimers relating to the forward looking statement and the non-GAAP measures.</p>
          <p>Let's go to the highlights, we set out to reignite volume growth whilst protecting cash flow and margin. Although early days, I am encouraged by the progress we have made. Organic growth of 4.1% in quarter two was well balanced with 2.1% coming from price and 2% coming from volume. The volume growth represents a clear step up from the negative trend we've seen in the previous quarters. Although helped by, a little bit by the strong ice cream sales in June, this turnaround has not come about by accident.</p>
          <p>Our growth is solid and of good quality, as it is mainly driven by improved execution and stronger innovations backed by higher A&amp;P spending. And volume growth is widespread, across all categories and countries, with share trends showing a positive momentum in nearly 60% of our turnover. We have closely aligned the business behind our priorities and I believe that it is starting to pay off.</p>
          <p>Price remained positive in the quarter, but the year-on-year trend and underlying price growth is down. The bulk of this as you can imagine is to carry over effect from tremendous price increases we did in 2008, but we have also had to correct some prices, that I talked about in the last quarterly announcement particularly in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Specifically in categories such as spreads and dressings commodity prices have reduced significantly from the peaks we've seen in 2008 and where appropriate these savings have been passed back to the consumer.</p>
          <p>As commodity costs escalated in the second half of 2008, we also took some price increases in some of the markets, which were frankly not followed by competition. This weakened our consumer value proposition and we've now brought our prices back in line and are broadly happy with our relative price positions we hold currently.</p>
          <p>A&amp;P spending increased by 50 basis points in the quarter as we stepped up support behind innovation and market development initiatives. Both, actually A and P, were significantly higher despite the lower media costs, which I believe will strengthen our relative position.</p>
          <p>Operating margin, before restructuring, was down by 60 basis points in the quarter reflecting the stepped up A&amp;P spending of the 50 basis points and 30 basis points negative impact of dilution from disposals. Savings continue to be strong helping to offset the still higher commodity costs we've been facing over the first half.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operating activities, improved by 1.6 billion in the first half as we tightened our grip on working capital. I believe that our priorities are the right ones and I'm satisfied that the focus we are giving to them is helping us to improve performance. But I'd be the first one to say that there's more to be done. Although our share momentum is improving, there are still too many markets where we need to do better. The same holds true for our cost structure which is not yet sufficiently competitive. I'm determined that we will continue to make progress in these areas.</p>
          <p>So with these few opening words I'll now pass it on to Jim to take you through the details of our performance. Jim?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. Thank you, Paul. Let me start by reviewing our top line performance. Turnover in quarter two was &#x20AC;10.5 billion that is 0.8% ahead of last year. There was no currency impact in the quarter. Net of acquisitions, disposals, net of acquisitions reduced turnover by 3.2%. And this left underlying sales growth of 4.1%, as Paul said volume was up 2.0% and price was up 2.1%.</p>
          <p>Volume growth was restored in all of our three regions. Turnover for the half year was &#x20AC;20 billion, which is similar to last year.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to the regional highlights, we'll start with our largest region Asia, Africa CEE. Underlying sales growth was 8.2% in the quarter with 3.3% volume driven by innovation and market development initiatives. Our strong portfolio of brands typically covers the entire range of price points in the major segments of our key markets. Our price growth came down to 4.8% in the quarter, as we lapped the price increases which were taken during last year. Volume performance improved in most countries across the region. India retuned to positive volume growth, while Indonesia, Russia and Vietnam continued to deliver strong double digit sales growth underpinned by strong volume growth. We have not yet seen much improvement though in our markets in Central Europe.</p>
          <p>Underlying operating margin improved by 130 basis points in the quarter, with cost savings, the carry-over pricing and the operational leverage from higher volume more than offsetting the adverse impact of higher commodity costs.</p>
          <p>Underlying sales growth in the Americas was 4.9% in quarter two, with volumes up 1.6% and price growth of 3.2%. In the United States, we have adapted quickly to changing consumer needs. For example, we've increased investments in campaigns emphasizing consumer value and addressing increased demand for in-home eating. This has led to the second consecutive quarter of positive volume growth in our U.S. consumer business. Sales in Foodservice were down, partly from the exit of unbranded business, but also frankly because fewer people are eating out-of-home in these troubling economic times. In Canada which is now managed as part of our North American Multi-Country Organization, MCO, our performance has improved strongly which was driven by innovation as well as by better execution. Latin America grew by 9% with higher volumes mainly driven by good performance in Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Economies in Central America, a bit like Central Europe, economies in Central America remained particularly weak and our sales were actually down although not as much as in quarter one. Underlying operating margin improved by 10 basis points and I should note that this is despite a negative 80 basis point impact in this region from disposal dilution.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to report that Western Europe returned to positive volume growth, with volumes up 1% in quarter two, and that is after five consecutive quarters of decline including quarter one which was down 3.7% in volume that now sequentially turns to 1% positive volume in quarter two and that volume growth was broad based. Ice cream sales in the first half of the summer season have been strong, but even without those volumes in our consumer business we would've been slightly up. In addition, all key countries showed an improving volume trend.</p>
          <p>Underlying sales were down 1.1%, with price growth 2% lower as we adjusted prices to reflect the anticipated easing in commodity costs and we corrected prices where we've been uncompetitive.</p>
          <p>Our Pan-European SAP system, our ERP system for Europe, has been fully in place since the 1st</p>
          <p>of January of this year and it allows us to share and utilize information more efficiently and is a key enabler for our continued progress in customer service. Underlying operating margin in the quarter was down by 340 basis points, which reflects higher commodity costs, the depreciation of sterling and a step up in investment to reignite volume growth.</p>
          <p>Let me now go through our performance by category. Savoury, dressings and spreads sales were flat in the quarter; they were up 1.4% for the first half. In spreads, we have lowered the prices of our products in a number of markets which reflects the easing of edible oil prices and to close gaps &#x2013; to close competitive gaps where that was necessary. We've also reinforced the nutritional value of our Family Goodness brands such as Rama with a further roll-out of our 'goodness of margarine' campaign. In Central Africa, we've introduced more affordable margarine tubs to our Blue Band range.</p>
          <p>In dressings, we have seen good growth from the roll-out of new Hellmann's light "double whisked" mayonnaise; it utilizes a proprietary citrus fiber technology. In savoury, we've introduced new Knorr Stockpots in several more markets in Western Europe. And here consumption is building and repeat purchase rates are particularly encouraging. We've also launched a new range of Knorr rice seasoning mixes and soups into Latin America.</p>
          <p>Turning to ice cream and beverages, here we grew by almost 5% in the quarter, 4.5% for the first half. Ice cream sales picked up in second quarter and were aided by the good weather that we enjoyed at least through June, but also we had new communication campaigns for innovations such as Magnum 'Temptation' which is now also available in multi-packs for in-home consumption.</p>
          <p>Inmarko, our recently acquired Russian ice cream company delivered a strong double-digit performance and is nicely ahead of our acquisition plan. In Latin America we continue to build on the successful re-launch of Magnum and we're extending the range with new variants. Tea is one of our fastest growing categories and innovations here include new Lipton green teas which were launched in the U.S. and we've had a further roll-out of our Lipton Linea slimming teas into Russia and China.</p>
          <p>Home care grew by 9.2% in the second quarter and it was 9.9% across the first half with strong performances both in laundry and household care. Surf has delivered another strong performance driven by its clean and fresh offering and it is a great value price for consumers. In Asia we continued to roll-out new improved formulations of our 'Dirt is Good' brand into a number of markets including now China. And in fabric conditioners our comfort naturals have been launched with ingredients which are kind to the skin.</p>
          <p>Finally in household care Domestos '24 hour protection' and Cif 'actifizz' delivered strong growth and we've recently rolled-out Cif creams into India. Personal care, personal care grew by 5.4% in the quarter, 4.6% in the first half of this year. Deodorants continue to perform strongly across both developed and developing markets. New variants include Axe Instinct with the scent of leather, Rexona No White Marks 'invisible ice' and Dove hair minimizing deodorants have also been rolled-out into North America and that's after a successful launch in Europe and Latin America in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Hair care is performing better. TiGi sales are ahead of last year and Clear has now been rolled-out to Argentina and Colombia and the new mix is also now available in India. We have added Nutrium Moisture technology to our Dove shower gels in North America. This is a new proprietary technology, which significantly improves moisturization by penetrating into the skin and repairing damage. Our Lifebuoy range of anti-bacterial hand wash and soaps have performed well across Asia, with specific marketing campaigns addressing consumers' heightened hygiene concerns.</p>
          <p>Now, before I review the drivers of operating profit, may I say a few words about commodity costs, savings and pricing. Commodity costs were higher in the quarter two than they were in the same period of last year, this time by around &#x20AC;400 million. Currency accounted for two-thirds of the cost increase. This 400 million follows a 600 million year-on-year increase, which we saw in first quarter. While the benefit of lower edible oil prices and lower crude oil prices will flow through the income statement in the coming quarters, we will continue to have an offset through the impact of currency devaluation in a number of our key markets. Inflationary pressures though are also evident in a number of commodity types such as tea, fruit and vegetables and certain food ingredients. So, in the second half of the year we now expect commodity costs to be a tailwind. For the year as a whole we expect commodity costs including currency to be up by a few hundred million Euros.</p>
          <p>Savings for quarter two were more than &#x20AC;300 million and now stand at &#x20AC;600 million for the first half. And half of these savings are coming from better buying, one third are coming from restructuring savings and the remainder from local efficiency savings programs. We expect our overall saving programs to deliver in excess of &#x20AC;1 billion for the year as a whole. Restructuring costs for the first half of 2009 now stand at just over &#x20AC;350 million. We continue to expect restructuring charges for the year as a whole to be nearer 1 billion.</p>
          <p>May I now say a few words about pricing, building on what Paul mentioned at the beginning of the presentation. The carry-over impact of price increases taken last year contributes between 2 and 3% to price growth for 2009 as a whole. Between 6 and 7% fell in Q1 and that will drop-off to close to zero by quarter four. And, in addition, as we mentioned we have adjusted prices where we've not been competitive and prices have come down in some of the categories which have been most affected by the reduction in commodity costs.</p>
          <p>The impact of carry over pricing and these adjustments will mean that price growth in the second half of this year will be flat or perhaps even negative, slightly. This is a natural consequence of the change in commodity costs up last year down this year.</p>
          <p>So, now let's turn to operating profit. This chart shows the up and down elevators of operating profit for the second quarter. It's expressed in constant currency, and we compare the same period last year, second quarter. You can see that the benefits of volume and mix are partly offset by the lost contribution from disposed businesses. Price increases and savings largely, but not completely, cancel out the increase in commodity and other costs. You can see the step-up in investment in advertising and promotions and this left operating profit before RDI's down &#x20AC;90 million at constant exchange rates year-on-year.</p>
          <p>The underlying operating margin was down 60 basis points in quarter two. Gross margin, although 20 basis points lower than in the same period a year ago, showed a marked improvement versus the previous quarters. And this trend will continue in the second half as the lower commodity costs flow through the income statement.</p>
          <p>Advertising and promotion expenditure was 50 basis points higher than in the same period last year. Overheads came down by some 10 basis points and this is after absorbing around 30 basis points of so called un-sheddable costs from disposals. And this reflects the benefits of our ongoing restructuring program. The underlying operating margin for the first half of 2009 was 50 basis points down. And the details are included in the appendix to this presentation as is that up and down elevator chart for operating profit. You have that in back of the pack.</p>
          <p>Now, having covered the operational performance for the second quarter, I'd now like to review earnings and cash flow for the first half. Earnings per share for the half were &#x20AC;0.53. Before the impact of restructuring, disposals and impairments, the earnings per share reduced year-on-year 13%. The key drivers of the reduction are 3% from disposals, 6% from the increase in pensions finance charge, and 3% from a higher tax rate in the first half of this year versus last year. The underlying tax rate in the first half was 28.5%. We expect this to be lower in the second half and for the tax rate before RDI's, for the full year, we now expect that to be 27%, which is slightly above our longer-term guidance of 26% which does in fact remain our longer-term guidance.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operating activities was 2.5 billion in the first half. This was a 1.6 billion higher than last year and was largely driven by improvements in working capital. I have to say this is versus an easy comparator, but nonetheless, our cash conversion cycle has improved by 15 days versus the same period last year and of that 13 days came from reduced inventory.</p>
          <p>Net debt was 8.9 billion at the end of June that is 1.3 billion lower than at the same time last year and 900 million higher than at the start of the year. We continued to issue new bonds to refinance our debt and we did so at very competitive rates. In June, we added two new bonds an 8-year 400 million sterling bond at the rate of 4.75% and a 4-year 450 million Eurodollar bond at a 3.125% interest rate. The net pension deficit increased in the first half by 300 million to &#x20AC;3.7 billion. This mainly reflects an increase in pension liabilities which are due to lower discount rates. Our estimate of the cash cost of pensions for the full year 2009 remains unchanged at around 1 billion. Our financial strategy and strong cash flow generation are a source of competitive advantage. Our cash flow and strong single A credit rating support competitive financing costs and a highly attractive dividend policy while providing ready financing for possible bolt-on acquisitions.</p>
          <p>For example, the acquisition of Baltimor, the leading ketchup manufacturer in Russia, was completed at the beginning of July. We also completed the acquisition of TiGi in the quarter and we bought out the minority interest of our Vietnam operation. And with that I'm going to now hand back to Paul.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, before I give you the overall brief impressions that I have on the results, let me just say a few words about the economic environment that we're actually operating in. Although many keep quoting the increased amount of green shoots that are coming up, we'd just like to continue to be realistic, hopefully, proven wrong, but I'd like to plan the business accordingly. This is, without any doubt, the longest and deepest recession we've seen during the post World War period and, whilst it might have bottomed out, we do not believe that there are any signs of a fast recovery. In fact, we expect that many parts of the world such as Western Europe, Eastern Europe will still soften before they bottom out. The World Bank has continued to lower its forecast of global GDP growth, which now is standing at minus 2.8%, and even if the outlook for 2010 is slightly more positive, which is by no means guaranteed, we are still well behind the levels we've seen in 2008 and before.</p>
          <p>For us, the most important indicators are consumer confidence and unemployment. Consumer confidence remains low. A recent Nielsen survey showed that 48 out of the 49 countries experienced a further drop in consumer confidence over the first half of 2009 versus the previous half of last year.</p>
          <p>Unemployment has risen fast and will continue to rise especially in the U.S. and Europe and it will take a long time before here again we go back to the historical levels. Whilst major ticket items will undoubtedly be affected first, we also see grocery spend drop by about 10% when unemployment hits. Fortunately our categories are less affected and we believe that this will continue to be the case as we move forward. However, the rate of growth in our category volumes have clearly slowed from the periods prior to the recession and we expect it to stay at these levels for a while.</p>
          <p>Volume growth in the developed world has stopped altogether or, in the case of Europe, it might even be negative. In the D&amp;E markets, volume growth continued to be robust at 3%, but this is still down from the higher levels experienced in prior years.</p>
          <p>In this new world, there is definitely a re-calibration of the value equation, and we expect a tougher competitive environment from both private labels, who are benefiting short term, as well as from branded competition. Whilst we believe that there are ample opportunities in this environment for any of us, one size does not fit all. The way we respond to consumer needs will differ within different categories, between different countries etcetera. A prerequisite for all of this &#x2013;  to do this is a very deep understanding of the consumer needs and behaviors that I've talked before.</p>
          <p>Let's just take an example. We looked at research in the U.K. and Germany and that shows, that it's not always private label that benefits. While some consumers undoubtedly are trading down, they're not necessarily fleeing to discounters; rather they're looking for value without frills. But in those countries an equally large section of the population is moving up, looking for premium positioned market leaders that are well supported, differentiated and have strong innovations. So, the average might look fine, but the business is not happening at the average any more. It is this deep understanding of the consumer that, over time, will separate I believe the winners from the losers.</p>
          <p>Driving innovation behind our leading brands, strongly supported with A&amp;P, continuously shaping the value equation, whilst rigorously maintaining focus on costs, continue to be our key objectives. In this context we're making sure and steady progress. If you look at quality of our results, there's been a good improvement in the volume share trends, which as I said nearly 60% of the business now contributing positive momentum. Growth is wide spread across categories and countries, underpinned by more A&amp;P support and as Jim explained better innovation.</p>
          <p>And the fundamentals of our cost structure continue to improve as well. We're pleased with the progress in developing and emerging markets with volumes growing over 3% after two consecutive quarters of decline. CEE, however, Eastern Europe continues to show negative volume, but even here we saw some improved performance in quarter two. Russia and China, our priority markets for the company continue to perform well.</p>
          <p>In the developed markets, volumes grew by close to 1% after five quarters of consecutive decline. North America is performing well, and despite the growth of private label, we believe we've actually increased share somewhat. Western Europe without any doubt remains difficult market, but we have shown in places like the U.K. that we can do well even in tough conditions.</p>
          <p>Our shares in Western Europe continue to improve although they're certainly not yet at the level that I would find satisfactory. Our volume performance in the second quarter was better especially where we had strong innovation roll-outs such as the Dove hair minimizer which is a deodorant product, Magnum 'Temptations' you can't keep your hands off and Small &amp; Mighty liquid detergents which provide a better performance in our competitive set. But we need to do more before we feel comfortable that we have turned the corner in Europe. So, we're pleased and encouraged by the progress, but we have to set the bar higher for the long-term results.</p>
          <p>Let's now take a closer look at the four key drivers of improvement in our business performance. First, and most importantly strengthening our brands and categories. We're improving the innovation success rates by focusing on fewer projects and then backing them up by stronger advertising and claims. For example, the complete removal of the trans fats from our soft spread margarines in the U.S., position us well both in terms of market leading nutrition and taste and certainly provide the best margarine choices now for consumers and the market. Our Pond's anti ageing range of skin creams, which provide younger looking skin in seven days, are preferred by consumers, versus other leading prestige brands, across Asia. Our Small &amp; Mighty range of detergents provides consumers with better performance whilst being kinder to the environment. It actually also provides our customers with a better profitability proposition than our competitors have. And our range of new Dove Liquid with Nutrium technology has proven to be the most effective natural nourishment that we've ever delivered in a body wash.</p>
          <p>We will also continue to roll-out innovations to more markets, more quickly. Clear is now sold in 33 markets, which is 13 more than we had at the end of 2008. And Dove Hair Minimizing Deodorants are now in 37 markets, with seven added in the last quarter alone.</p>
          <p>We need to work on our product quality. Product quality is being improved in many markets. For the French amongst us you'd be pleased to know that Amora Dressings has improved its quality. For Americans we've put more chocolate in Klondike ice cream bars, and our 'dirt is good' formulations in Asia have been strengthened; all examples, but there're many others. We also have to play better the full pricing piano.</p>
          <p>The price piano is being played better. We spoke before about the initiatives we've taken in South Africa including the extension of our laundry range to more attractive price points. In Russia we've launched a range of herbal infusion teas under the Beseda name, specifically positioned in the value segment. And, as we've said already, we've corrected prices where needed, in order to restore or improve our competitiveness and this has largely been in Western Europe. But let's not kid ourselves, challenges remain. There are still too many markets, category combinations, or cells as we call them, which are not performing. And our brand equities need to be stronger, so there's still a lot of work to do.</p>
          <p>Let's just look at another key driver which is the end market amplification we've talked about. It's great to have great innovations and brands, but you also have to be able to make them come alive in the market. It's in essence, ensuring that discipline in the sales fundamentals and helping our customers grow that I'm talking about, helping them grow more quickly by agreeing with them jointly beneficial business plans.</p>
          <p>We've been focused on driving increased customer service and on shelf availability and we're starting to see results coming through. If you look at our customers, of our top 10 customers, eight are actually growing faster than the company average as we work even more collaboratively on our plans together to grow their business and ours.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. we're leveraging our newly opened Customer Insight and Innovation Centre and many of you hopefully will have the opportunity to be there later this year at our Investor Conference that we will be holding in Englewood Cliffs in New Jersey. We're pleased with the results of this Innovation Centre and we will expand this concept of our Customer Insight and Innovation Centre to Europe and Asia as well over the balance of the year. So again, I'd say good progress, but we have more to do on the basics, especially on the in-store and availability. We also need to be acutely aware of the challenges which will come from increasingly more aggressive low cost and local competitors that are local or regional and from increased private label penetration.</p>
          <p>The third important driver of business improvement is cash and cost. I always say cash up and cost down is the way to easily remember it. You've seen already the improvements we've been making in working capital management that Jim talked about. We are accelerating our already ambitious restructuring programs, most particularly in the areas of overhead where we are going to achieve the overhead head count targets this year, which we had previously set for end of 2010. And as Jim has explained, commodity costs, a severe headwind for the last six quarters, will hopefully become a tailwind in the second half of 2009. Our cost savings programs are functioning well and are ahead of plan at the half point in the year. So again, good progress, but the reality is that we're not still fully competitive.</p>
          <p>The final part of the jigsaw puzzle is the organization. There are three areas where we are continuing to drive important changes. The first is to build further accountability and responsibility throughout the organization. In the last six months we've appointed one-third of our top managers to new roles, with more challenge &#x2013; changes still to come. And we've simplified and aligned the way in which we track and reward performance.</p>
          <p>The second change we're making to the organization is to further instill a bias for action and to build speed in all that we do, to help &#x2013; to do this we actually have to continuously reduce complexity wherever it does not add value. And that's not just complexity in formulations, packaging and SKUs, but also complexity in the way we run the business. We have implemented the 30-day action plans with clearly defined owners and this is helping us to take decisive actions quickly in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>The third organizational imperative is to continue to drive consumer and customer thinking to the heart of our business. And to further align the organization on growth and driving out all activities which frankly will not add value for consumers and customers. We will also increase the focus on our core brands further and we will further strengthen the links between brand building and brand development to ensure that we continue to increase our seamless operations and drive that to higher levels. We're doing better in each of these areas, but cultural changes will take time and we don't want to build the organization on quicksand either. So, it's better to do it well for the long run than to go after quick short-term runs.</p>
          <p>After six months as a CEO I should say that I'm thoroughly enjoying the opportunity of leading this great company. It's certainly demanding, but I relish the challenge and feel stretched and growing. All-in-all I am pleased with the speed with which the organization is responding to the directions we've all set together as a leadership team. However, as a Dutch saying goes, and I've been corrected many times by English because apparently they have a different saying, but I'm Dutch, so in Holland we say 'an early bird doesn't make a summer'. We don't talk about worms or swallows, 'an early bird doesn't make a summer'.</p>
          <p>So, we've here &#x2013; we've been here before that we showed good results, but what we need is consistency, consistency of delivery of these results and what matters here is not the fancy words, but it's the results themselves. With the continued hard work and dedication of everybody I have no doubts that we can become a consistent winning organization. Our principle focus continues to be the restoration of volume growth whilst protecting cash flow and margin for the year as a whole. With that we'll just open it up to questions now. Thanks for your attention.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, a question for Jim, just relating to the volume growth issue. What do you think is the weighted average volume growth of the categories you're playing in globally? And what do you think is happening to your volume market share in those categories, just trying to understand it on a structural level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure. Obviously there's always a little bit of trailing in the data, but I think the market growth in Europe in the categories that we're competing in is probably about minus one, in the U.S. it's probably around one, and in the rest of the developing world, it's probably about three.</p>
          <p>So, if you take that average you might get to 2% in the weight that we have our business, slightly less than that, which does mean that we think that we are slightly building share in the U.S., that we in Europe are losing less share I would say, but that we still have to do things &#x2013; I'm talking about value share here &#x2013; volume share is slightly better now in Europe. And then in the developing markets overall you'd say building share, but obviously overall doesn't exist. You have to look at each country and each cell. So, we have areas where we need to do better and areas where we're growing our business.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Simon Marshall-Lockyer from Jefferies. Just in terms of this second quarter volume of 2% and that very big recovery from the first quarter, we've seen in the reporting season so far, that maybe the abatement from some of the de-stocking affects in the first quarter were actually having a larger role in the second quarter. Is that something that you've perceived and sensed, particularly in your more mature market franchise, Europe, in particular?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the numbers have to be a little bit measured.  We've had a good ice cream season in June actually. You wouldn't believe that now if you look outside, and for last few weeks that at least I've lived on this part of the planet. But we've had probably continuous de-stocking, and we don't talk about that. We had more people eating at home and we have our food solutions business probably underperforming, for that reason. We don't talk about that.</p>
          <p>We just rather focus on how we build the business. Which is if we do it continuously good innovations and spend behind it, stay close to the consumer, we can build businesses in the toughest environments. We're building good business in Russia right now. Others are reporting on that differently. We have good business growth in places like Indonesia and Brazil.</p>
          <p>So, where we do the right things for what we get paid for, we get the results. And I don't really want to go into all these other trends that will happen anyway.</p>
          <p>This is an industry that I think has been relatively relaxed on the total working capital tied up in the supply chain, on the total inventory. You see what we are doing on working capital, how we have made a step change, albeit from a low base. We were frankly bad last year. But still having said that the organization has improved and should take a lot of credit for that. And this is an industry that has 65 days in the supply chain. Some of our best suppliers are running it with 10. You will not get to 10 days. That's impossible as a total, you understand that.</p>
          <p>But, there will be continuous improvement. And that's good. If you're a food business that means fresher products, if you're in innovative business that means getting these innovations faster to the consumer. So, we have to continue to build-in with something that not all of you might have always done, but continue to build-in more efficiency in the supply chain.</p>
          <p>And obviously when there is more focus on cash flow in this environment, as you well understand, then that process is probably accelerated a little bit. But we deal with that in stride, as we do with all the other things.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Celine Pannuti from JPMorgan. I have two questions.</p>
          <p>The first one is on input cost. Why is it that &#x2013; I think the guidance is higher from what it was before. And I think your &#x2013; one of your &#x2013; a big competitors of yours has &#x2013; 2 billion negative tail &#x2013; headwinds last year is getting to 1 billion. Can you give us &#x2013; a tailwind for the next fiscal year. Can you give us an idea of what it could be for you in 2010?</p>
          <p>And my second question is emerging market. Growth remains quite good overall in those markets. To which extent are these better ground for most of the FMCG could mean much higher competitive environment, and whether pricing would really be an issue, i.e. negative pricing, in order to win over those emerging market consumers? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that was good. And so the two questions on commodity costs and emerging markets. I'll let Jim expand on the commodity cost side. But the one thing that we do here is, on our commodity cost, we've always been prudently conservative, as some people have always run ahead of themselves. And we've always said that we don't think commodity costs to go back to levels we've seen in 2007 or before.</p>
          <p>On the food side, the trends are not there, the dynamics are simply not there. If you look at climate change, alternative demand, population growth, the dynamics are a turn from the upward. And we continue to say that. We've never seen tea prices going down for example. So you have to be careful when you look at companies like that to look at not only just at milk prices, because we just don't have that much of it.</p>
          <p>The other thing is the currency effects. In the developing markets, when we import dollar-based materials and the real goes from 180 to 240, you have 30% currency effect that we put into commodity costs. So, over the year, we've seen nearly $1 billion of currency effect that we estimate that we have to deal with. But as Jim has mentioned before, commodity costs are coming down over the second half and we expect a tailwind from that. I don't know if you want to add to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the &#x2013; what I'm not going to do is give guidance for 2010.</p>
          <p>As it was at the end of Q1, we thought that the increase of the first half would be equaled by a decrease in the second half, and that's turned out to be wrong. And as it is today, we have gotten through a half year and we've had about a half a billion of increase in commodity costs, but we've also had a half a billion of Forex impact.</p>
          <p>And so taking the Forex where it stands today and taking the commodity costs where they stand today, we look forward into the back half and we see about a 0.5 billion of improvement year-on-year, but that nets out obviously to a full year increase, which is not what we thought.</p>
          <p>So, that's how we see it as of now, and we're not going to try to speculate about 2010 at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Developing markets continue to be strong. We have a 10% growth the first quarter. Roughly if I remember, we produced more or less 9% growth &#x2013; overall sales growth and also, and they're 50% plus of our business. So, they continue to be strong, and at the same time, you see it's built on solid foundations, if you look at the operating margin improvement as well.</p>
          <p>Undoubtedly, that's where the next billion population is going to be in the next 15 years, and competition is seeing the attractiveness on that as well. That's good for the consumers then &#x2013; they need it more than anybody else. If we will get increased choice and competitiveness, the consumer usually benefits from that, and we just need to be very close to the consumer, and do a little better job than our competitors.</p>
          <p>We're starting from a very strong position, but we need to continue to work on that. The main challenge we have there probably is not even our global competitors, but it's our local and regional competitors, often at the low end of the market, that we need to deal with. And that's not a new phenomena for us, and we will continue to have to strive to do better to compete against those people.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi it's Warren Ackerman from Evolution. So can I ask a general question on Europe, obviously volume's better in the second quarter, margin's still down, you want to set the bar higher in Europe. But where do you want to get that business to on a sort of three year view in terms of growth, market share, margins? And what milestone should we be looking for from your European business?</p>
          <p>And the second one is in terms of your assessment of the innovation in R&amp;D capability of the company. What's being done, what still needs to be done to get Unilever to better than class?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Warren, on Europe, it's actually interesting because you look at 'Temptations' and Magnum 'Temptations' we're doing very well there. You look at the pyramid bags that we've just introduced on our tea products doing extremely well. You're looking at Small &amp; Mighty detergents in Europe doing well. Stockpot we've now rolled-out across Europe, which is a liquid bouillon more natural &#x2013; doing very well.</p>
          <p>So, Europeans are also human beings, and as we innovate and spend behind that we can grow as well. We've had a lot of restructuring in Europe that we need to finish now, and we should benefit from that. We've set up a different structure in Europe to run it more efficiently, including a supply structure. And that is coming to an end, that setup, so we should start to benefit from that. And we're investing behind these innovations to get the growth back.</p>
          <p>It is not surprising that the growth, if you peel the onion of Europe, the numbers look better or the trend is better, but it's not where you want it to be. But if you look at where the growth is, it's where you have the innovations that makes sense and you spend behind it.</p>
          <p>So, in Europe there are ample examples of success, but the market continues to be tough, the European population is shrinking, the economy is not certainly in the healthiest state compared to the rest of the world. So, we have some tougher things to deal with, but I think if we can get Europe just into a situation of continuous growth &#x2013; it would be unrealistic to expect that to be mid-single digits or upper single digits, because the dynamics are not there. But if we just get it into a consistent growth, so that we don't have to go into perpetual restructuring, because that's not just the way to build shareholders value. It isn't.</p>
          <p>Europe also, even with the investment that we are now making, partly correcting high pricing that we've done in 2008, partly behind the investments to grow, still has very decent margins. I'm sure you've taken your pencil and looked at the margins by three regions, and our European business is very structurally sound. So, it's not that we're betting the bank either, but I think we should be getting to consistent growth.</p>
          <p>On your second question on R&amp;D, we've obviously made significant step changes in the organization already over 2008 that we're now benefiting from. We've appointed Genevi&#xE8;ve, the first time we have an R&amp;D Director at Board level, that combines total food and HPC. It's tremendous and we're starting to see the benefits from that already in terms of the innovations.</p>
          <p>Vindi who is responsible for all of our categories is driving fewer and bigger innovations across the markets. And I think you see with a little bit more confidence that we are getting things out there that really differentiate our products increasingly versus our competitive set. So, also there I feel that we're making progress.</p>
          <p>Yes, there's more to do and I can &#x2013; that's a separate topic that will take a lot of time, but we will continue to look at going for fewer innovations, bigger ones, rolling them out faster, increasingly more discontinuous. And that should happen over time. And more important in today's market than it probably was in the past.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jeremy Fialko at Redburn Partners. Just following up on the question about the cost base. A couple of times in your presentation you mentioned that you had an uncompetitive cost base.</p>
          <p>To what extent do you think this is going to be something resolved by the restructuring program you've got currently in progress? And kind of beyond that, how do you think the best way of dealing with it will be? Would it be further restructuring charges or is this just going to be more of a kind of continuous improvement sort of basis?</p>
          <p>And then just a second aspect to this, when you look at the un-competitiveness of your cost base, is it more on the kind of manufacturing and supply chain side, or is it more on the administrative side? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's a moving average, because the other guys, if I read the results, they're also talking about it. So, and the consumer is asking for it. And so, if we want to continue to win the hearts and minds of consumers, I think I'll always be talking about it, just to be very clear about that.</p>
          <p>But the way to get there is not with continuous restructuring. I think we're starting to get to a industrial footprint now that is competitive. We have set up the supply chain structures. We're just completing, under Harish's leadership, the supply chain structure set up in Singapore for Harish's whole area, and Mike is working on his. So, I think we're getting to a competitive structure that I hope we can run the business by always looking at improving efficiencies, but not anymore with big restructuring announcements, and really make it part of the ongoing operations.</p>
          <p>Now, how do you become more competitive? The answer is discipline. If we grow our business within our ambitions and continuously capture that growth with discipline in the cost items of the P&amp;L, we will become over time more competitive. We have some work to do still in our indirects which is our own overheads, whatever you want to call them, where we need to be better. We have some product categories that we can be more competitive as we want to compete increasingly at the different parts of the price piano.</p>
          <p>So, we will be looking at all these elements as we move forward, but make them part of ongoing operations, and have it built in with discipline in the system, so that as you grow at whatever rates that may be, you capture the benefits of that growth in terms of efficiencies that you can then share with the consumer, either in better products or in better value. And that's the consumer goods model that works best over time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I might just add to Paul's comments that the current restructuring program that is in place, we expect to come to an end by the end of 2010. In terms of substantial restructuring charges, come to an end by this year. We will have restructuring charges in 2010 &#x2013; you'll always have restructuring charges, but more in the sort of the 50 to100 basis points rather than a 2.5% or the sort of rate that we've had in the last couple years.</p>

          <p>Going to take a couple of calls from the lines now. We've got Marco Gulpers on the line from ING. Marco.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning to you all there in London. This is Marco from Amsterdam. I've got two questions if I may.</p>
          <p>The first is on the step up in the competitive landscape, which you alluded to. How do you actually see that panning out in the remainder of the year? And how do you &#x2013; as I read across from the P&amp;G comments yesterday, see that occurring in your price and volumes?</p>
          <p>The second question I have is on hair care. In my view, you are having some good successes there with Suave in the U.S., maybe you want to elaborate on that. But also elaborate a bit more on perhaps some weak spots in Europe in hair care? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Marco. One second, I'm just writing down your questions so that I answer them fully.</p>
          <p>The competitive landscape, we obviously look at that. If you look at competitive results and obviously ours, then I'm glad to see that where we've done well in these results, it's been driven by innovation and by spending behind that. And that's the best way of doing it.</p>
          <p>We feel broadly competitive with our pricing and if I read the competitive results there are probably always individual cells or countries that they look about but I got the impression that they are also broadly wanting to drive the business behind innovation, and that's a good thing for all of us. I honestly believe that. It doesn't mean it's a zero-sum game. A lot of innovations will hopefully expand the brands, for us -or the markets, sorry.</p>
          <p>For us, the biggest opportunity with our business especially in the developing markets, but believe it or not also in many other places of the world, is market development, expanding the pie, and that's obviously a lot of our focus, and I think it will be the same for our competitors. There's no doubt that in the tough economic environment that we live in, everybody has to adjust its strategies accordingly, and we'll be looking closely at our competitors as we sharpen our own strategies.</p>
          <p>In terms of Europe and hair care and the U.S. hair care, it is true that Mike Polk and his team in the U.S. have done a great job on Suave and hopefully continue to do a great job on Suave, since Mike is in the audience. And &#x2013; but Suave is very well positioned as a brand. The American consumer, more than ever, knows what value for money is, and Suave is a very good value for money brand. In fact, it's the best brand in the U.S. in terms of performance and value, and the consumers as well as the retailers are rewarding us for that, and I hope we will continue to get the benefit from that.</p>
          <p>In Europe, with a few exceptions in a few countries, we've had a relatively weak portfolio in hair care, as we probably managed it more for its financial return only, and not for its growth. We now have some very good innovations coming that we feel increasingly confident that we can invest in. So we have to look at what that means for Europe as well, do that in a way that is financially responsible for our shareholders. I'm not saying that we will all of a sudden have Europe and hair care at the best performing region, but we have to, as we see increased success of hair care that you alluded to Marco across the world, we will also have to look at what some of these technologies mean for Europe, as we want to build our business globally.</p>

          <p>You are not expecting to introduce a value offering in hair care, like you have in the U.S. with Suave, in Europe? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we do, in Holland, for example, which is your country, that we do extremely well with a brand called Andrelon as you well know, which is a value offering. And pretty much what we do on Suave would also apply to a brand like Andrelon, which is very well &#x2013; Timotei in some other countries, Harish is rightfully reminding me. Those are brands that are well positioned on the bottom end of the categories.</p>
          <p>But I want to be clear &#x2013; in hair care, it's not only a bottom end story. We've just acquired TiGi and Mike has the responsibility for that right now. And we're producing good results there. We're by all means pleased with how that business is performing, since the acquisition. And the family, who's still actively involved, is doing a tremendous job, helping with the transition, but not only helping, but also continuing to come out with innovations to keep driving that business, and we're seeing positive growth there as well.</p>
          <p>The hair care market is probably a little bit driven to the top end in retail, as people come in from professional. And the bottom end, where people seek better value propositions. And that's where we just need to be sure that we have offerings for the consumer.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks it's Alex Smith from Nomura. I had a question on your plans for reinvestment in the second half of the year. I think it sounds to me like you've got 2 to 300 basis points of input costs benefit in the second half. You're suggesting pricing is flattish, maybe slightly down. So, it seems to me your gross margin should recover quite nicely. And if I look at your operating margin guidance or projecting operating margin suggests that's up 50 basis points.</p>
          <p>It seems to me that there's a lot of room there to accelerate further marketing spend ahead of the 60 basis point increase we saw in Q2. Would that be fair or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I don't know, what's fair in life. I cannot do the calculations for you. But what is clear is we've said is that we will reignite volume growth without compromising operating margin and cash flow.</p>
          <p>Operating margin over the first half is down 50 basis points. So, that's still compromising operating margin. Good second quarter, because it's A&amp;P driven and the disposal effect, gross margin's moving up. So, we're doing the right thing. So, part of the tailwind that we get in the second quarter or second half, excuse me, should go to delivering on what we clearly give as guidance to the market. And that should be &#x2013; cannot be clearer.</p>
          <p>And secondly, we will continue to invest behind our brands in A&amp;P to continue to bring these innovations to life. And that's how we run the business.</p>

          <p>Xavier Croquez from Exane. Two questions. The first one is between Q2 and Q1 there is around 350 bps of positive volume swing. Can you shed some light on what the picture is like by categories? And the second thing, in terms of brands, if you do a review of H1 for the my top five brands -- I'm happy to hear a different top five -- for Dove, Lipton, Knorr, Hellmann's and 'dirt is good'? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You want to do the volume part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The volume drive in the first half was obviously the innovations, which we've sited through the course of Paul's presentation, and mine. We did in fact support strongly with A&amp;P. There's a big change from A&amp;P down as a percent of sales in the first quarter to up as a percent of sales in the second quarter. And of course that doesn't even account for the fact that media rates are down at least 5%, down even more elsewhere, so we put a lot behind those innovations.</p>
          <p>We said at the first quarter that the phasing of innovations was going to come a little bit later this year than it has in the past, so look for of more of them in the second quarter and look for more support and that's exactly what we did. I think that &#x2013; and particularly in Western Europe we had a correction of prices where we were uncompetitive and I think that undoubtedly helped. We were helped by the weather and ice cream, so that has to, has to figure in there for part of it.</p>
          <p>But the final thing, which I mentioned, which I think is very, very important is disciplined sales execution. You saw in one of Paul's charts how our in-store performance is improving and I think that discipline which has been improving quarter-by-quarter manifests itself and the combination, the multiplicative effect, of good innovation at the right price backed by A&amp;P, executed well to the &#x2013; the delta from the first to second quarter.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which category, which category drove the &#x2013; the biggest positive swings Q2, Q1...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously ice cream, which was up. Tea is up nicely, personal care up, and then household, a very, very strong growth in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the brand side, Xavier just to be very quick, we saw some very good results behind the Small &amp; Mighty, Dove is good brand that obviously drives that, but also the Surf brand in the U.K. for the people in the U.K. here it's a very well performing brand again on a better value proposition than other alternatives out, and our Lipton brand continues to grow well, both for ourselves and for our partnership that we have with Pepsi.</p>
          <p>Our deal business as you can imagine, we've had the good initiatives from the hair minimizer and now going in, I can't believe it myself, but as I said the 'smell of leather'. So, someone told me very attractive, so I'm going to use that from now on.</p>
          <p>So, all these things are on the key and you're free to use this samples of it. The, all these things are driving our brand. So, I'm pleased to see that if you look at the top 15 brands that we look at other top 13 brands of &#x20AC;1 billion or more in turnover that we actually have turn off them growing faster than their company itself. So, that is a good thing and that's how we want to keep it.</p>

          <p>Final question, Harold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Harold Thompson, Deutsche Bank. I've just got two questions. One is a slight pick-up or follow-up question on the opportunity for long-term growth. Do you think, if you had to kind of size the opportunity of winning market share and particularly using your numerous category and regional leadership position to drive category growth. How would you rank the two?</p>
          <p>And the second one is you've talked about the portfolio before, you've done some small acquisitions, just the broadest topic of M&amp;A. Could you maybe somewhat explain, clarify your ambitions there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I apologize, because for the first part of the question I didn't understand your two, category growth, market development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Market development versus gaining market share? If you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you want to grow long-term, is it more market share gains driving the growth or is it more the driving the pie bigger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm sorry &#x2013; I'm sorry, I understand now. The, I think the bigger opportunities longer-term is market development, for most of the categories that we're in, very few exceptions where it isn't the case. So, it is enlarging the pie if you want to. I would expect in doing that, that the leaders who lead the market development would also benefit from that, which is usually the case in share. But the biggest opportunity that we will have for a long time to come is the development of the market.</p>
          <p>If you look at the penetration of many of our products that are here in front of you, be it deodorants, be it the hair care, be it oral care products, be it lot of the food products actually all of our savoury products, all that in the developing market which is 70-80% of the world. Are markets that are actually very small, if you compare that versus the U.S. or Europe and so the biggest opportunity we have. But that's also true actually for many of our products in Europe. Many opportunities still to drive deodorants uses higher or etcetera. So, that's definitely the &#x2013; there's no comparison.</p>
          <p>And then on the M&amp;A opportunities, I think Jim talked about it already. The core &#x2013; the key priority for us to build shareholder value is to strengthen the brands that we have. So, the organization needs to focus on continuing to strengthen the business in the tough environment. So, that's quite a task, it's easy for me to stand here and talk about that. But it's a lot of work that needs to be done. And then we look at selective bolt-on acquisitions to complement a portfolio and you've heard many of those today and we look at that very strategically now. It's not &#x2013; we might look at lot of things, because as a Dutchman I always say it doesn't cost any thing to look, but we are very careful in where we invest to strengthen our positions. So, that's how we run our M&amp;A thinking and obviously behind that is a very strong financial position which is important in today's environment that Jim has talked about thus far.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>With this, I think we'll have to close, I apologize. I'm sure on the road shows we have more time to go a little bit more in detail as you digest the numbers, as we digest the numbers and engage in a deeper discussion.</p>
          <p>I just want to thank you for your time this morning to be with us, but above all I want to thank people in Unilever, who produced these results, because you can get &#x2013; you cannot get these results which are good results overall, result of hard work and dedication of all 175,000 people that work for us day-in day-out, often beyond the call of duty. The markets are tough. The markets will continue to be tough. The competitive environment will continue to change. The private-label environment will put further pressure on that.</p>
          <p>So, again I'll end with my Dutch saying an early bird doesn't make a summer, bare with us and it's the numbers that we will hopefully will let speak for you for the quarters to come, more than any thing else. But thanks for your support again once more and safe journey home. Thank you.</p>
