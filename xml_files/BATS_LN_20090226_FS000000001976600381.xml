          <p>Good morning everyone. I'm Jan du Plessis, Chairman of British American Tobacco. Also with me this morning are Paul Adams, our Chief Executive, and Ben Stevens, our Finance Director. Thank you for coming. A warm welcome also to those of you who may be listening on the conference call or watching via our website, bat.com. After taking you through our results, there will as always be an opportunity for people in the audience to ask questions.</p>
          <p>When you look at the headline numbers, 2008 was an outstanding year for BAT. Group volumes were up 4.5%, or 1% organically. And our Global drive brands continued their strong growth, up 16%. Revenue and profit rose 21 and 24% respectively at current rates. At comparable rates of exchange, the revenue rose by 11% and profit from operations excluding adjusting items was up 14%. Our adjusted earnings per share rose 19%, mainly as a result of the strong growth in profit from operations and favorable exchange movements. These results have enabled us to recommend a 26% increase in dividends taking the payout ratio to 65% of sustainable net earnings. And finally, free cash flow rose by just over 30% to &#xA3;2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>I know we've always been recognized as a business capable of producing lots of cash. 2008 was not a bad year and wish to remind investors of our credentials in this regard. Our achievements during 2008 follow many years of consistent earnings growth. In fact as you can see from this chart, compound annual growth in EPS for the past five years since 2003 has been 13%. This track record comes from the successful execution of the group's strategy to create shareholder value by achieving industry leadership based on growth, productivity, responsibility and winning organization.</p>
          <p>We had made good progress with all four elements of the strategy last year. Firstly, growth, and Paul will talk about organic growth in a few moments. However, it must be remembered that the successful execution of attractive acquisitions is an integral part of our overall growth strategy. And in this regard, 2008 was an important year.</p>
          <p>In June and July, we completed acquisitions of the Tekel cigarette businesses and the cigarette and snus businesses of Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni. These two transactions have transformed the group's position in the Scandinavian, Polish and Turkish markets. However, a successful M&amp;A strategy is not just about negotiating and securing a deal at the right price. Deals often succeed or fail during the post-acquisition period when it is essential that the risk controls are put in place and the acquired businesses are fully integrated into the organization. As far as both deals are concerned, the integration has been carried out successfully.</p>
          <p>It is not just the operations and head offices that need to be integrated. Combining the sales forces is equally important. In all markets affected by the acquisitions we now have just one face to face customers offering both the pre-existing British American Tobacco brands and the acquired brands. Both deals are performing in line with our expectations and were marginally earnings enhancing during 2008.</p>
          <p>However, I also want to touch briefly on the other elements of our strategy. Ben will report later on the progress we are making on our productivity targets to deliver a further &#xA3;800 million of cost savings by 2012 over and above the &#xA3;1 billion delivered in the five years through 2007. The annual report and account, which will be published in early April, will discuss at some length the good progress we have made with the important areas of responsibility and winning organization.</p>
          <p>An important development for shareholders in 2008 was a restructuring of the 30% R&amp;R shareholding in the group. We co-operated with Richemont and Remgro to enable both companies to spin-off their British American Tobacco shares to the underlying shareholders. As a result, we listed British American Tobacco on the JSE and today just over 11% of our shares are held on the South African register. We now have a more diversified shareholder base with an index rating that rose from 75% to 100%.</p>
          <p>During the period leading up to the restructuring, there were naturally concerns that a stock overhang might unduly depress the share price. I think the process has been well managed, and the group's 34% out performance against the FTSE 100 during the year would support that belief.</p>
          <p>Putting it all together, the strategy has enabled us to build an excellent record of delivering shareholder value. Shareholders have been rewarded through superior returns. For instance, over the last five years since 2003, dividends have grown at a compound rate of nearly 17%. In previous years, we have used share buybacks to support distributions to shareholders. However, in order to preserve the group's flexibility during a period of economic uncertainty, the Board has now decided to suspend the share buyback program for the time being. In the current environment, we believe that is a prudent thing to do. We will nevertheless be seeking shareholders' approval at the AGM to resume the share buyback in case conditions change.</p>
          <p>Dividends have been an important driver behind our outstanding record of delivering superior total shareholder returns. &#xA3;100 invested in British American Tobacco five years ago on a total shareholder return basis would at 31 December 2008 have been worth &#xA3;286. While &#xA3;100 invested in the FTSE 100 index would have been worth &#xA3;118. A similar investment 10 years ago in British American Tobacco would have produced a total shareholder return of 486% in contrast to a return from the FTSE 100 of just 2%.</p>
          <p>On that note, I'll hand you over to Paul Adams who will review with you last year's performance in more detail. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jan. Good morning, everybody. As Jan said, it has been an outstanding year. On all of the key measures, the group has performed well. But before I get into detail, let me point out that the results shown reflect the old regional structure after the 31st of December. There is a chart showing the regional segmentation for 2008 on the new basis in the supplementary slides at the back of the presentation. But for the purposes of today's presentation, it's better if we keep to the old regions.</p>
          <p> Volumes rose 4.5%, reflecting six months of acquired volume from ST and Tekel, and organic growth of 1% in line with our long-term targets. The global drive brands grew an impressive 16%, ahead of the growth target of high-single figures even if you exclude the successful brand migrations.</p>
          <p>The group's revenue was 21% higher as a result of improved pricing, better product mix, favorable exchange, and the acquisitions. Organic revenue growth at constant rates grew 7%, ahead of our long-term target of around 3 to 3.5%. Similarly, the adjusted profit from operations was 24% higher. But if you strip out acquisitions and currency, the growth was 10%, well ahead of our long-term target of around 6%. Operating margin improved to 30.7%, and Jan has already commented on the 19% growth in adjusted earnings per share, an outstanding year indeed.</p>
          <p>Looking at volumes and revenue across the regions, volumes and revenue in Europe benefited from the ST acquisition. Asia-Pacific continued to grow volumes with strong growth in Pakistan, Bangladesh and South Korea. Latin America had good revenue growth in both constant and current terms despite a 2% decline in volumes as a result of Mexico and Venezuela.</p>
          <p>Excellent performances by many markets in the Africa and Middle East region, together with the acquisition and integration of Tekel helped boost volumes by 19% and revenue by 22% at constant rates and 24% at current rates of exchange. The decline in industry volumes in both Canada and Japan depressed volume and revenue at constant rates in America-Pacific. All regions contributed to the operating profit growth at both constant and current rates of exchange. The strong growth in profit in Europe was a result of the ST acquisition, a more favorable pricing environment, an improved product mix, and exchange rates.</p>
          <p>In the Asia-Pacific region, strong performances in Australia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Vietnam, together with favorable exchange led to strong profit growth at both constant and current rates. Despite a fall in volume, profits increased in Latin America, aided by an excellent performance from Brazil, together with favorable exchange. Profits grew nearly 20% in Brazil, reflecting higher margins, an improved mix, higher leaf margins, and a stronger local currency.</p>
          <p>The results from the Africa and Middle East region includes the acquisition, but also benefits from a good performance in Nigeria and the Middle East. South African profits were affected by the weaker exchange rate and lower volumes following the termination of the Chesterfield license at the end of 2007. Improved pricing in both Canada and Japan, together with favorable exchange rates, produced a good result from America-Pacific despite a 4% decline in volume.</p>
          <p>The global drive brands continued to build on their track record with a strong growth of 16% with a quarter of that coming from brand migrations. Kent and Pall Mall each achieved sales of over 60 billion sticks for the first time, and premium priced Kent remains the Group's biggest brand. Completing a strong all around performance, Lucky Strike increased by 9% and Dunhill by 7%. Kent had another strong year, it's sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Kent grew 18%, or 16% excluding migrations. Kent Nanotek, which was originally launched in Russia in 2007, accounted for 50% of Kent's total growth in 2008.</p>
          <p>Successful migrations included Benson &amp; Hedges to Kent in South Africa and Peter Stuyvesant to Kent in Malaysia. Dunhill rose 7% driven by good performances in the GCC markets, South Africa, South Korea and Italy. Volumes were also up in Taiwan, Russia, and Romania, and were maintained in Malaysia leading to an increase in market share. Innovation continues to be an important driver behind Dunhill's success.</p>
          <p>Lucky Strike grew 9% with double-digit volume growth in seven of its top 10 markets. It's main markets of Spain, France, Italy and Argentina all experienced volume and share growth. In Germany, its share has stabilized at a shade under 5%, while its share of the premium segment has grown. Pall Mall delivered an excellent performance in 2008, up 22%. Migrations played a significant part in Pall Mall's performance with sizeable volume increases in Mexico and Pakistan, but there was also solid organic volume and share growth across the regions.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the regions in more detail, Europe had another strong year with excellent performances in Russia, Romania, Uzbekistan and Spain. Higher margins, reduced overhead, favorable exchange and the ST acquisition resulted in very strong profit growth. In Italy, volumes were impacted by the decline of local brands and the disposal of some brands in 2007. However, profit rose on reduced costs and favorable exchange. Industry volumes continued to fall in Germany, but profit increased as a result higher margins, overhead savings and lower product costs. Both profit and volumes grew in Spain due to an excellent performance from Lucky Strike. An improving product mix in Russia helped increase profit significantly. Volumes were impacted by the decline in local and low-priced brands following price increases, which were not immediately followed by competitors.</p>
          <p>And in anticipation of the first question I'm likely to get this morning, have we seen down trading in Russia? Well, this chart shows segment trends in Russia based on Nielsen Retail Audit data. As you can see from the red line representing the premium segment, there has been no change in the trends seen over the last three years. Low, Ovals and Papirossi continued to decline while the medium sector benefits from uptrading. Other markets where the premium segment grew in 2008 include Ukraine, Romania, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil, Venezuela and South Korea.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Asia-Pacific, volumes were 5% higher. Profit rose by 132 million to 804 million. In Australia, profit growth was achieved with improved margins and exchange movements, which partly offset competitor discounting activity. Despite declining industry volumes in Malaysia, we increased our market share with good performances from Dunhill, Pall Mall and the successful relaunch of Kent. Profit also increased due to pricing, better mix and productivity savings. A good performance by Dunhill in South Korea helped lift both volumes and market share. Profits also rose despite a weakening currency due to improved margins, higher volumes and mix. Volume and market share continued to grow strongly in Pakistan.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, the region delivered an 11% growth in profit despite a 2% decline in volumes. Brazil saw strong growth in profit due to an improved product mix, higher margins and a stronger local currency. Volume and share declined in Mexico. Profits also fell after a price increase in January, failed to fully recover, an earlier excise increase, together with increased marketing expenditure. Excise increases at the end of 2007, coupled with price increases in early 2008, continued to affect volumes in Venezuela. An increase in illicit trade also led to lower market share.</p>
          <p>Profit in the Africa and Middle East region grew by &#xA3;69 million to &#xA3;536 million. This was as a result of the Tekel acquisition and the good performance from Nigeria, GCC and Egypt. In South Africa, a weaker exchange rate led to profits being only slightly higher than last year. At local currency, profits grew as a result of higher pricing and improved mix. Volumes and share declined due to the termination of the Chesterfield license at the end of 2007. Dunhill and Peter Stuyvesant both delivered strong performances. Nigeria had good volume growth and this together with exchange, improving mix, higher margins and improved productivity led to an increase in profit. The acquisition of Tekel in Turkey was completed on the 24th of June, 2008, and as Jan said, its integration is well on track.</p>
          <p>Profit in the America-Pacific region grew by 15%, aided by favorable exchange. Higher pricing in Canada and lower distribution costs, together with a stronger exchange rate, were partially offset by lower volumes and a weaker mix. Overall share was slightly lower at 52% as the decline in the premium segment was not offset by the growth in the low price segment. A strong performance from Kool, together with stable market shares from Kent and Lucky Strike, helped to improve share in Japan. Volumes, however, were lower as a result of the decline in total industry volume. Higher pricing, an improved mix and favorable exchange helped to lift profits.</p>
          <p>And at this point, I'll hand over to Ben to delve deeper into the numbers.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul, and good morning everyone. 2007 was the last year of the five-year program of cost savings, achieving annual savings of just over &#xA3;1 billion. The new five-year target of 800 million was announced a year ago and with &#xA3;245 million delivered in year one we're on track to achieve the target by 2012. The areas which we are focusing on are supply chain efficiencies, back office integration and management structures.</p>
          <p>2008 was a very good year for profit from operations, which rose 24%. Paul has taken you through the regions' results, so just a word on unallocated costs. These are simply net corporate costs not directly attributable to individual regions, and they were slightly higher than the previous year at &#xA3;110 million. I'm sure you'll be delighted to hear that from this year unallocated costs are to be allocated to the regions by reference to the region's share of net revenue. This used together with the move away from quarterly reporting should make life easier for all concerned.</p>
          <p>Items which we exclude to arrive at the profit from operations comprised costs of &#xA3;160 million in respect to the integration of the Tekel and ST businesses and restructurings announced previously, the &#xA3;102 million charge arising from the Canadian resolution announced last July, an amortization charge of &#xA3;24 million in respect to brands acquired in the ST and Tekel deals, and a gain of &#xA3;141 million as a result of the disposal of the group's interest in the non-cigarette and snus businesses of ST. The profit from operations including adjusting items was &#xA3;3.6 billion, up 23% on the prior year. This represents an outstanding year of growth in revenue and profit for us.</p>
          <p>This is the last time we'll be reporting profit and revenue growth excluding the acquisitions of ST and Tekel since they're now fully integrated into our business. In the six months their businesses have come to be consolidated as subsidiaries, they've contributed 4% to revenue growth and 4% to profit growth, respectively. The translation of our results into sterling added a further 10% to growth rates.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we translated our U.S. dollar earnings at an average rate of $1.85 and our balance sheet at closing rate of $1.44. Similarly for the euro, the average rate was 1.26 and the closing rate was 1.03. In the second half of 2008, while many of our key currencies weakened against the dollar, they've strengthened against the pound. If we translated our 2008 earnings per share at current rates of exchange, it would have increased by a further 11p per share or 9%.</p>
          <p>We make no predictions on how foreign exchange rates will move during 2009. However, it is worth remembering that because many of our end markets pay certain of their raw material costs in foreign currencies, often in U.S. dollars, depending on how their currency moves against those currencies they will make so called transactional foreign-exchange gains or losses.</p>
          <p>Losses are mitigated by contract hedging and natural hedges where they have dollar exports, for example leaf or finished products. However, the cost of hedging in some currencies is simply prohibitive. When we quote constant currency figures, these are constant translational currencies but they do include the effect of transactional gains and losses on imports and exports by end markets. It's impossible to give guidance on this issue because it depends on the unhedged movements between local currencies and the currencies of countries from which they import and export. Indeed, this is not a new phenomenon, and we'd expect our end markets to mitigate these losses through pricing and cost savings. We'll give you a more detailed update on this issue at the half-year.</p>
          <p>I'll cover the increase in net finance cost on the next slide. The contribution for associates was &#xA3;61 million higher at &#xA3;503 million, including net favorable adjusting items of &#xA3;26 million. Our share of these items at Reynolds American amounted to &#xA3;13 million and include brand impairment charges, restructuring costs and the benefit from the termination of the joint venture.</p>
          <p>In addition, associates income included a &#xA3;13 million benefit from the accounting of an additional quarter's income at the ST Group during the year before the acquisition in July. Profits before tax was &#xA3;3,684 million. Net finance cost was &#xA3;391 million, slightly lower than the &#xA3;400 million guidance given at last year's interim. The 45% increase in net finance cost principally reflects the cost of financing the two acquisitions and exchange rate movements.</p>
          <p>Clearly, net finance cost will be higher in 2009 as a result of having a full 12 months of acquisition financing cost. Net finance costs were &#xA3;120 million in quarter four 2008. I might suggest that this quarterly run rate is a reasonable guide for 2009. However, that guidance is obviously sensitive to what happens on exchange rates.</p>
          <p>The tax charge for the group's subsidiaries rose from &#xA3;790 million to &#xA3;1,025 million, resulting in a slightly higher underlying tax rate of 30.8%. The rise in the underlying tax rate was due to one off tax credits included in 2007 following the successful resolution of tax audits overseas. With regard to 2009, we expect the underlying tax rate to be around 30%.</p>
          <p>Profit for the year rose 16% to &#xA3;2,659 million and the minorities charge rose 29% to &#xA3;202 million from higher profit in Brazil and Malaysia and the effect of exchange. The adjusted earnings per share calculation is based on an adjusted profit figure of &#xA3;2,582 million divided by the fully diluted shares number 2,005 million to give 128.8 pence per share, which is up 19% over 2007.</p>
          <p>The strong profit performance at constant rates of exchange, up almost 10%, was the main driver behind the growth in adjusted earnings per share. Acquisitions were slightly earnings enhancing while net finance costs, excluding the impact of the acquisitions and exchange, were broadly neutral. Associates benefited EPS by one pence, and taxation was a negative 2.4 pence affecting the increase in the underlying tax rates.</p>
          <p>Minorities were a negative one pence and the share buyback program, which bought back 22 million shares at an average price of &#xA3;18.12 benefited earnings by 1.6p. Favorable exchange rates benefited adjusted earnings per share by 10p or 9.3%, giving the total adjusted earnings per share figure of 128.8p.</p>
          <p>Moving on to cash flow, net cash from operating activities before restructuring costs rose significantly to &#xA3;3.75 billion. This reflected the growth in underlying operating performance and the working capital synergies arising from the ST and Tekel acquisitions, further benefits arising from the introduction of the global leaf pool, as well as the timing of working capital movements and higher dividends from associates.</p>
          <p>Net interest flows and dividends for minority interest were similar to last year. In spite higher net capital expenditure, free cash flow was &#xA3;893 million higher with &#xA3;2.6 billion, an increase of 52%. Free cash flow per share increased 55%, and the ratio of free cash flow per share to adjusted earnings per share rose from 77% to 101%.</p>
          <p>I'd remind you that free cash flow is after adjusting items and dividends from associates, whereas adjusted earnings is before these items and includes profit from associates. For these reasons we won't be able to consistently replicate the outstanding performance of 2008 but we will continue to focus on driving free cash flow per share to adjusted earnings per share from a high of 70% of earlier to a level somewhere in the mid 80%.</p>
          <p>As far as the use of cash is concerned, in the years 2004 to 2007 all of the free cash flows were reported to the dividend and the share buyback program. In 2008, we scaled back the share buyback program from &#xA3;750 million to &#xA3;400 million in anticipation of the ST and Tekel deals. The two acquisitions resulted in outflows of 2.1 billion and after the payment of dividends and the share buyback and other net flows, there was a net outflow of &#xA3;1.5 billion. However, the higher level of free cash flow and lower rate of share buyback resulted in sufficient cash being generated during the year to cover around one-third of the cost of the acquisitions. As Jan mentioned earlier, the share buyback has been suspended for the time being.</p>
          <p>Our net debt grew from &#xA3;5.6 billion to &#xA3;9.9 billion. Bcause we match our debts to our sources of earnings, there is a foreign exchange hit that offsets the FX gains from earnings. The foreign exchange impact at the closing spot rate at the year-end was &#xA3;2.6 billion and was a major factor behind the increase in closing net debt.</p>
          <p>Briefly on financial policies, we targeted long-term ratings of Baa1, BBB+ with a gross interest cover of between 5 and 9 times. We're currently undrawn on our 1.75 billion revolving credit facility. And as you can see from this slide, our guaranteed debt portfolio has an average life of 5.5 years and the balanced maturity profile being out beyond 2024. We substantially prefinanced our 2009 maturing bonds in November, leaving the refinancing of the Tekel acquisition facility later this year. We expect to refinance approximately 60% of this in the bank market with the remainder being retired mainly from cash generated by the business.</p>
          <p>Finally, as Jan mentioned earlier the dividend payout rate has now reached the target level announced in 2006 of 65%, raising the pay out ratio from 61% to 65% in respect to the 2008 dividend, which resulted in a 29% increase in final dividends and a 26% increase in the dividends for the year.</p>
          <p>That's the end of a long presentation. So I'll now hand over to Jan, who will start the question and answer session. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Ben. Before we take questions, may I say that it clearly was a wonderful year and indeed we clearly had a wonderful decade. The sad thing about life is that we know that investors are scared off <mark type="inaudible" /> If it's any comfort to you, so do we.</p>
          <p>But I thought I would just say before we take questions that <mark type="inaudible" /> expressed in cancelled my interview. As you know, we have never given short-term guidance. Unless you've got a good sign for change it's a rather good habit. But I will therefore only just briefly [re-state] sentiments expressed in our statements this morning.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we remain very much alert to the possibilities of down trading. And we are very much aware of the potential challenges that we face. But we do believe that given the inherent state of our business, our brands and our people, that should make us more resilient than most.</p>
          <p>So on that basis, I'd be glad to take some questions. What I'll do, as is our custom, is I will briefly summarize your questions for the purpose of the webcast. So when you do ask your first question, kindly just also state your name and the name of the organization that you represent. <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

          <p>Hi, it's David Hayes from Nomura. Just to not disappoint I'll come up with a downtrading question. And you obviously talked about 2008 with no change in trends. We've heard from competitors they maybe in the last few weeks they've seen some changing trends particularly in the Russian market. I'm just wondering if you can comment on whether that is something you would concur with or whether --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question does indeed relate to downgrading and the question is a only a very, very recently any changes in the downtrading of things. It's all relative. So, Paul, I will let you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at downtrading and indeed uptrading, remember that there's still substantial numbers of markets that are still uptraded. And generally speaking, those markets which have historically uptraded are still uptrading, and those markets which have historically downtraded are downtrading, for example Western Europe.</p>
          <p>I think in some markets we have seen a slight deceleration of the upgrading, Russia being a prime example, and maybe a slight pickup in the rate of downtrading, but not to any significant degree. I mean for example in Russia, we are seeing a slowing of the uptrading trends. That's principally driven in the rural areas rather than the urban areas.</p>
          <p>And the other thing to bear in mind is that the price increases that we took as an industry in 2008 were far in excess of the price increases that we've seen in the previous three or four years. There were significant price increases in Russia.</p>
          <p>Now to split out how much of that deceleration of premium in Russia is down to a much more accelerated price increase environment in Russia, and how much of it is down to the consumer generally slowing up is, pick the bones out of that.</p>
          <p>But I think the logic given the macroeconomics is that consumers will start to slow up on down trading and will start to speed up on down trading. And that would be an obviously logical conclusion, but we haven't seen anything significant yet.</p>

          <p>Jon Fell, Deutsche Bank. Hi. Last year's scaling back of the buyback program in anticipation of the Skandinavisk and Tekel acquisitions, is the stopping of the buyback program for the moment also in anticipation of money you might spend? Or is it more affecting liquidity and cost of refinancing at the moment?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm asked to comment on the decision to suspend the buyback program which last year we said was in the context of a proposed acquisition. It's just the common sense thing to do in these times. These have been interesting economic times as we all know. Our Board has taken the view that it's the sensible, prudent decision to take at the current time.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe that buybacks can provide flexibility in how you manage your balance sheet. It's a flexible way of returning cash to shareholders. But at the current time, we think we'll suspend that. We are going to ask for a renewal of the authority to conduct buybacks at the AGM so that should circumstances change, we are quite prepared to resume the program. But we don't see that for the moment.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Adam Spielman from Citigroup. Could I ask you a couple of questions about your expectations for marketing You've obviously migrated a lot of brands and I was wondering when you've taken a brand that's going nowhere and migrated it to a global drive brand, has that actually within those markets tended to accelerate growth? And I'm thinking for example of Barclay in Western Europe going to Kent.</p>
          <p>And a second completely separate question, Mexico has been a big problem for you for a while. My understanding is that you've gotten new management, you're investing a lot in it. Can we -- are you finding that's beginning to work? And also is there chance any that you can explain the loss in Turkey would be the other one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously the first is a question for Paul to comment generally on the success of our various marketing strategies, specifically to actually comment on the actions  we see to brands that have been migrated and how they've performed subsequently? And the second question is a comment on the situation in Mexico. I think you also mentioned Turkey.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, I would say the success of our marketing, rather than the success or otherwise of our marketing, you only have to look at our brand performances suggesting there's some success there. But referring specifically to migration, as you know when we migrate we lose roughly about 90, 92%, sorry we gain 90 to 92%, and lose about 8 to 10%. So when we migrate, that is an overall drag on our group volume. There's some idea that you're getting a free ride through migration isn't correct.</p>
          <p>And we do migrations because it enables us to move a brand which is not doing particularly well, move it into a global drive brand guidse, and then that enables us to put the innovation that we're putting behind our global drive brands behind that particular brand. And that can give it a shot in the arm. So the growth that you're looking to achieve will come in subsequent years and after the migration rather than immediately. In the year of the migration you in fact hurt your volumes. So the fact that each year we are migrating brands has a drag effect on our global volume growth.</p>
          <p>And we have done a major review of our previous migrations. And those previous migrations have shown generally, not all of them have been wildly successful, but generally taking them, all those migrations have been successful and they have produced more volume on those brands particularly bearing in mind that those brands unmigrated would have continued to decline. So it has been a very successful thing to do.</p>
          <p>In terms of Mexico and Turkey, Mexico we're digging in. We are migrating Boots to Pall Mall. We are reconstructing the brand portfolio priorities, we have increased our marketing spend, and we spent money on DST in the Mexico City.</p>
          <p>We are seeing some improvement in our shares as a result of that. When I say improvement, the decline has reduced significantly as a result of that. I think we're going to have to allow Mexico another couple of years to prove the success of that exercise.</p>
          <p>And in Turkey, well I think you're pretty fast out of the box, we've had the Turkey business for six months to expect us to turn around a decade of decline on those grounds in six months, it's <mark type="inaudible" />. But I'm pleased to say that there has been some slowdown in decline in the last six months principally driven by what we've been able to do in terms of our direct distribution in Turkey and what we've been able to do at point of sale. But we've yet to bring our brand marketing to bear and hopefully that will improve things even more so.</p>

          <p>If I can come back to that migration question again, would it be fair to say that the sort of volume drop off after migration once you're past the initial period may be a couple of percentage points <mark type="inaudible" /> roughly?</p>

          <p>Hi, Eileen Khoo from Morgan Stanley. Two questions. One in your commentary you talked about having an artillery in new innovation for 2009. Would you be able to comment a little bit more about that? And then secondly, could you comment a bit about your growth outlook for '09. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions as I've done before for the webcast, the first question is to ask Paul to talk about our opportunity of innovations in the pipeline. And secondly, Paul is encouraged to give us some indication as to the volume outlook for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, I'm not going to give you too much details on the innovations we've got panned for '09 and there are others other than friendly investors and analysts who listen in to these things. But we have what we believe are strong innovations across our portfolio of global drive brands, and all of them. And therefore we look forward to '09 and think that we have a lot that we can bring to the market.</p>
          <p>I think it's important because we're talking about down trading or the potential for down trading. If you are going to stop consumers down trading, you have to give them a reason to stay with premium brands. You can't just sort of do what you've done before and expect them to stay with you. You have to give them added value. You have to give them a reason to stay. And that's why innovation is important, and that's why we got a very strong portfolio of innovation across our global drive brands for 2009. So that gives us quite a lot of confidence.</p>
          <p>Which brings me on to your second point, which is about growth. I think we will get growth in our premium brands and that we will get growth in our global drive brands in 2009. Not so sure about volume because a lot of that is driven by cheap brands. And if we have the opportunity to take price increases and sacrifice low price volume for the benefit of revenue, then we'll do that because what's more important for us is revenue, less so overall volume.</p>
          <p>So we're interested in revenue, we're interested in premium, we're interested in global drive brands, and much less interested in overall volume growth. There will come a point where we will be static on overall volume growth, maybe even slightly decline. And that's going to be okay as long as we're getting what you want on revenue driven by premium growth.</p>

          <p>Robin Asquith, JPMorgan Asset Management. Two questions. First, on European pricing [which I guess...profit] And second question is on, can you just describe or explain the coupon you paid on bonds issued last year, obviously based on balance sheet, your cash flows, et cetera? Can you explain why you decided to take on such heavy debt [inaudible]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions for the webcast. First for Paul, we've been  asked you to comment on the absence for the European price increases in the course of 2009. The second, Ben, you're asked to comment on why we agreed to pay what is described as relatively high coupon on the bond we issued last November.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have to be careful when talking about pricing. So to put this in a slightly historic context, I mean pricing momentum continues to be good. I mean over the last two or three months, we've seen price increases in Russia, Italy, UK, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and other countries outside of Europe. And the pricing momentum remains good. And we would expect that to continue. Elsewhere we've had price increases. So I'm reasonably optimistic about that, if that helps</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a word on the bonds, I mean basically you price what the market charges you when you raise capital. And we had a &#x20AC;900 million bond to refinance in February. We certainly didn't want to go in to the year without the cash to refinance that. And therefore it was a good decision to take at that time.</p>
          <p>Had we hung on we might have shaved a small amount off that coupon. But quite frankly I think we all slept better at night knowing we had the money in the bank to refinance the &#x20AC;900 million bond that's literally being done today with it. So we're not really here to speculate on refinancing rates. We're here to sell cigarettes. We'll finance our business in the market at whatever it bears.</p>

          <p>Rogerio Fujimori, Credit Suisse. I have a question about the level of profitability in Western Europe that you've now disclosed, &#xA3;160 million over a revenue base of 2.2 billion in sales. It was a little bit below kind of 1.24% margin, a little below what I was kind of expecting, and certainly below your peers. Did it have much to do with price position or are there kind of cost scale for re-investment and <mark type="inaudible" /> basically impacting the '08 performance? And perhaps a follow-up would be drive segment exposure in Western Europe essentially different than your global average of 1.13 and 1.35? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, for the webcast, Ben, can you pick up the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It talks really about effectively talk about margins and profitability in Europe. The question suggests that margins were slightly lower than expected. So is that a function of higher cost? Or is it a function of lower pricing? That's for you.</p>
          <p>And the second question is for Paul. Paul, can you please comment on the general structure of pricing regimes where one third high, medium, low in the rest of the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just on Western Europe, no, we're also a wholesaler in Western Europe so the entire turnover of that wholesaler, including other companies, products placed for turnover, we make a low margin on that. So the margins in Western Europe will always be lower than the group average because of other businesses and we accept that. We think the difference in the profits are nil. And then we've had a little down trading experience in Western Europe over the last few years. And those are the reasons for the lower margins in Western Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't know. We don't split out Western Europe. I never look at Western European figures, never look at Southeast Asian figures, or southern tip of Africa figures. I would think that the percent of our volume that's in premium in Western Europe will be slightly less than it is as a group average. We don't have a strong position in premium in Western Europe as we would like, but I don't know what the figures are.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nico Lambrechts from Merrill Lynch, Banc of America &#x2013; Merrill Lynch. First question on pricing first of all, Is there no &#x2013; was it the timing of the price increases last year no further price increases, will there be a significant roll over effect into '09? First question on pricing.</p>
          <p>Ben, your earlier comment when you said overall volumes flat, growth in global drive brands slow in premium. I get the sense that you are planning to formulate  the mix regardless of what the down trading would be in the industry.</p>
          <p>Third question is just on cost savings, which I know you don't like to answer, Paul. But what was the savings? Was it similar, or was it more? What's the run-rate at the end of the year and the cost savings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if I can summarize these questions or answer them. I think the first question is for Paul where Nico wants you to comment on the savings of price increases on the basis if you achieved no further price increases. He's trying to get a sense of what that might mean for us for the year as a whole.</p>
          <p>Second I think is probably also for Paul, will you talk about last year's the sort of flat volumes, the change in mix, the better performance in premium and the less good performance of the bottom of the market.</p>
          <p>And finally I guess, Ben, you're going to comment on the question of cost savings and again the question of sort of the run-rate, I guess that would be the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We already have the 40% of the revenue that we're looking to achieve because if you take the price increases in 2008 and roll them forward, we've already made a very good start. In terms of what we're looking for in terms of pricing, we're about 40% already there, which is comforting, but there's still a way to go.</p>
          <p>I actually didn't say that we were going to achieve flat overall volumes. I didn't proffer a view as to what our overall volume would be. I said that if was flat it wouldn't bother me because we know that it will be flat.</p>
          <p>We don't know what's going to happen in terms of the consumer downturn and when that will happen and how much of that happen to have an impact. All we can say is looking from this point in time we are pretty confident that our ability to grow premium and our global drive brand volume. So that isn't irrespective of what happens in the global downturn, just saying it's best we can figure looking at it from this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just take it if you don't mind because, Nico, we could also find out going forward we would find an increase improved mix at the expense of volume growth. Is that your question or am I putting words in your mouth?</p>

          <p>Longer-term. We may get to a point longer-term where we see that our overall volume is down. And that doesn't bother me. I'm not predicting we'll get there. What I was trying to say that our priority is more around revenue than it is around overall volume, because a lot of that volume is low priced volume. And if we have to improve our revenue by focusing on premium and value for money and pricing opportunities around that and that causes a decrease in volume, then we'll take that opportunity.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> you're not expecting down trading the market, et cetera, but I get a sense you are planning for positive mix, i.e. as a group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we will have positive mix because if we're going to grow our premium and grow our global drive brands, which are predominantly premium, in a down trading market we should get some positive mix, absolutely.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any cost savings?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we always get asked this question what is our methodlogy about spend back and then fail to give any real figures.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm trying to be more helpful than that. I think we need to look at the whole cost-saving programs together, the 800 million we announced over the next five years. And if we say half of that will drop through to the bottom line, so 400 million, then we'd be looking at an overall margin that goes from 30% in 2007, which is 3 billion profit on 10 billion net turnover, up to about 34% by 2012. There are sort of "cost-savings that hang in mid-air" and spend back figures. I think we should say we should be looking for a growth in our operating margin of about 0.8% a year, or up to 34% by 2012.</p>
          <p>Now, the one thing I can promise you is it's not going to happen in nice, regular easy, bite sized chunks. In good years, we tend to spend that more of the saving, so it means operating margin increase will be less, but the profit increase will be greater. And if it's a tougher year, we'll tend to have more savings drop to the bottom line. So maybe profit increase would be less but the margin increase will be greater. I think we just set a target for ourselves by saying that our operating margin should grow to 34% by 2012 on the back of the cost-savings dropping through.</p>
          <p>Now there are other impacts on operating margin as well of course. I mean regional mix makes a difference. If Western Europe has a good year, the operating margin will be a bit thinner as a result of that. As people trade up to premium, operating margin will grow. But strongly considering the cost-savings, I'd be very disappointed that we hadn't hit a 34% operating margin by 2012. I think that's probably the best guidance I can give you on the cost savings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I might ask one more, if you analyze your final quarter cost-savings <mark type="inaudible" /> and the cost savings that you achieved, which is approximately 30% of the total, was that a planned phasing or did you actually accelerate it due to the conditions that you faced in the global economy?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Excellent. Okay. And the following question talking again, picking up on the mix question, in the past you had negative geographic mix and you have positive brand mix. And the feeling we got is that the negative would be slightly more than the positive. In 2008 I don't know if you can -- 2008, 2009 may be too hard, is it tends to be true that your brand mix much more than offset the effect of a negative geographic mix?</p>

But if we can hold, if our brand mix can offset our geographic mix in the year, we think we've done pretty well. This year we slightly more than compensated for it. This was a very good year for this.</p>

          <p>Jon Leinster, UBS. A couple of questions. First of all you talked about the innovation program, does that mean in March program we're going to see a big increase in marketing or does reflect economic trends?</p>
          <p>And secondly, Italy you talked for a number of years about the international brands rising while the local brands declined what is the percentage of the actual 25% of the market is now local brands versus international, when is that going to turn around?</p>
          <p>And lastly, if I can remember what it was before, I think on the economic, do you think there is a chance that's currency is going to become a much bigger issue given the fact we're now in a recession and we've obviously got currency fluctuations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions there. Not entirely sure I heard the first. Firstly the question is whether the, whether our determination to continue to pursue innovation will lead to a significant increase in marketing expense? Second, in view of the situation in Italy and comment on the performance, relative performance of international brands and local brands in Italy? And thirdly, the question is, do we believe that the recessionary environment in which we operate might be inclined to lead to a further growth in illicit trade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, behind the innovations we are planning an increase in marketing. Of course it's <mark type="inaudible" />, we don't see that, but there is going to be an increase in marketing in 2009 behind those innovations. And that's the plan.</p>
          <p>In terms of Italy, yes, our global drive brands continue to do well in Italy. Pall Mall is up, Dunhill is up, Lucky Strike is up in Italy. They represent though a much smaller proportion of our overall volume in Italy. And so although they're increasing, they've not increased enough to overcome the decline.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I mean I think MF is stabilizing and it's really the tail brands which we've got in Italy doing most of the damage. And that is declining, but the decline has slowed, which is a good news.</p>
          <p>But to answer your question, it'll be some years before the growth in our global drive brands compensate for the decline in the local brands in Italy. I can't answer your precise question on the percentage split because I don't have that number.</p>
          <p>Yes, I think illicit trade, I think there's a real danger that illicit trade will increase in the economic environment. Two reasons, A, because there's less money around. And secondly because of the variability of exchange rates. And we've already seen there's lot more movement of goods between the Ukraine and Poland. And the cross border shopping from Germany into Poland will change depending upon what happens to the Ukrainian hryvnia and the Polish zloty relative to the euro. And so there's quite a lot of volatility around trading and because of exchange rates. And I think there is a fear that depending on what happens to exchange rates that there will be an increase in contraband in Central Europe particularly.</p>

          <p>Yes, well there isn't a great deal out there actually after Tekel. And Tekel, they were privatizing for about 20 years before they finally sold it. Couple of smaller markets in North Africa, <mark type="inaudible" /> is one particular one that's probably closest to coming on to the starting block. But other than that, there is very, very little in terms of state owned tobacco company privatizations out there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's David Hayes from Nomura again. I actually have three questions. Just on the transactional FX impacts. You've got the 9% translational impact <mark type="inaudible" /> ther e will be some offset. I mean can you give us a feel for what that offset would be if current rates were nevre to change for the rest of the year? I guess also <mark type="inaudible" /> to talk about this, whether at BAC is unique in some way that we think about in terms of more vertical integration than others, et cetera. Maybe we should take that into account.</p>
          <p>The second one just on pension, is there any funding in terms of uplift in either cash or P&amp;L impact on pension cost?</p>
          <p>And the final one just on the guidance, I mean you talked in the past about vintage years, you talked about not having years below the average 6% kind of guidance. You're saying you're going to be around that. Would you say 2009 is possibly a vintage year, or definitely be a below year, or do we wait and see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of 2009, David, BAC is still uncertain. And it you find anyone out there who is certain, let me know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The first two questions, Ben, I'll give it to you, the first of these I think you can just sort of generally expand on your comments about the differences between translation gains and transaction gains on FX. And secondly also just on our pension situation, the potential for further cash contributions and what the consequences may be for the <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In transactional FX, well first of all, I mean the point is we come into this year with a big tailwind on foreign exchange, we feel it like close to 9% on EPS was exchange rates two days ago, we actually used the closing rates because the balance sheet have would have been more than double. So time has strengthened a bit in the last two months. But even with that stronger time position on translational effects we would see about a 9% or an 11p uplift in earnings pershare. And that will be offset.</p>
          <p>Couple of points to remember on transactional FX, I mean most of the markets will hedge foreign exchange requirements anyway. So we're not talking about every country, we're only talking about those countries where it's prohibitively costly to hedge foreign exchange, so it's like Russia and Ukraine. Some of those markets will have offsetting natural hedges. For example, Russia exports a small amount of its production in dollar pricing so that offsets their transactional FX.</p>
          <p>The third thing to say is that this is not new. Every year our markets face transactional FX hedge and we tell them, guys, you've got to make it up with pricing and managing your cost better. So there's a sort of management hedge as well there.</p>
          <p>If we could draw a line two days ago and say what's the net transactional hit? Transactional hit, was about half of the translational gains, that's a sort of feeling to the size of it. But that's a feeling that applies on the 23rd of February. By advice today it may well change because it's all about cross currency movements between the ruble and dollar and then translating the earnings into sterling.</p>
          <p>So we genuinely can't give you any guidance on the impact of transactional FX, except to say that it's considerably smaller than the translational gains we expect to make. But we do expect our end-markets to offset those through savings. And some of our end-markets actually have natural hedging in place anyway.</p>
          <p>And lastly, I'd say that to the extent that all of the industry, your third question, is facing the same thing, as of course we are, you would expect the industry to wish to recover that in pricing. And for example, two days ago, JT took a price increase in Russia and that's probably to offset some of the transactional FX affecting that pricing.</p>
          <p>So are we hitting the other companies? Not in terms of transactional FX, except for the fact that we do have an integrated supply chain so we make gains on these, except for the fact that a big portion of our cost basis is in sterling, of course, which is helpful. And of course, we report our numbers and pay our bills in sterling, which is a lot better place to be than paying in yen or in dollars at the moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on pensions, Ben?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On pensions, yes, I mean obviously we did a revaluation of our pension scheme in March of this year. Obviously, it showed a bit of a deficit compared to where we were the last time we did it. But it is very small compared to our market cap, it's like 1.5% of our market cap. We'll prop it up over the course of the next seven years to get it back to being fully funded, but you won't even notice the difference on the cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can sort of just add to that rather vaguely, not talk about numbers, but philosophy. We have always been quite upfront and transparent about our results to the relation to decline in reported currency and in constant currency. And I think that this year and last year in particular when we had a big currency tailwind, we have not in a sense asked to be given credit for the benefit of the change. So that's always been a part of it and that's not about to change.</p>
          <p>But we live in a very interconnected world where I think it's becoming sometimes a <mark type="inaudible" /> oversimplified world in looking at price. Because if you look, for example, look at what's happening in the world, financial markets and economic situation last year, that is almost certainly because of fears and risksin the world has increased, strengthening of the dollar, that as you know is going to have an effect onfunding costs and that is <mark type="inaudible" /> European currencies.</p>
          <p>So I'm really just saying that it's a very complicated, interconnected world we live in. And therefore to some extent just measuring us in terms of sort of achievement in constant currency terms is no indication of the real world. Ultimately, your results are what they are what they are. Do you know what I'm saying? And I think that's sort of what I would ask you to keep in as you look at next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question here, which I think is <mark type="inaudible" /> the webcast. It's a question of litigation in particular in regard Florida and whether more generally <mark type="inaudible" /> sort of indications <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I think with respect to the hedge case, which I thought you're referring to, which is the first of the Engle Progeny cases to be tried in Florida against Philip Morris. This is very, very early days indeed. And there are a quite few thousand Engle Progeny plaintiffs out there.</p>
          <p>To say on the results of one case there is in fact a trend I think is not likely to be the case. I think it's very early stages and I think it's the start of what would be a relatively lengthy process in terms of clarifying what the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida when it de-certified the Engle class action actually meant, which is not clear to anybody. And so I think it's the beginning of a very, very long process rather than the indication or any sort of crystallization of a trend.</p>
          <p>And on the impact of the recession on litigation, I think your guess is as good as mine. I think the whole drivers of people's willingness to litigate or otherwise is purely on the cost of the benefit that they may see by doing so and the dis-benefit of putting themselves through a rather long, lengthy, and in most parts of the world, expensive process, which historically has not really driven many gains. So I think it's very difficult to generalize that as the world gets more difficult, people will get more inclined to litigate.</p>

          <p>You referred earlier to living in the real world. Could you give us some insight into how you think about pricing in Poland, Ukraine when since November to-date after today you said you had a depreciation of 13% in Poland versus the euro, Ukraine 15%. How much of that do you try and recover? What do you take into consideration? When does it become viable to put it in a truck and ship it across the border, et cetera? Do you cover all of it, half of it? Just a bit of management's thinking process?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Management's thinking is that we like profits to grow. We like profits to grow in every single country where we operate. And that doesn't change. So if there are circumstances which cause costs to go up or difficulties in trading, we would look to recover that in pricing.</p>
          <p>The issue of course is can you take your consumers with you and will the competition also do the same thing? And I know they're two big unknowns. Or rather they eventually become known. But our orientation as Ben was alluding to was that we would expect local management to grow profits and to do what they need to do on pricing in order to do that.</p>
