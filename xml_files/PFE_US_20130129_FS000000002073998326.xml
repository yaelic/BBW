          <p>Good day, everyone and welcome to Pfizer's fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's fourth quarter and full-year 2012 performance.</p>
          <p>I'm joined today by our chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Olivier Brandicourt, President and General Manager of Emerging Markets and Established Products; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Geno Germano, President and General Manager of Specialty Care and Oncology; Amy Schulman, General Counsel and Business Unit Lead for our Consumer Business; and John Young, President and General Manager of Primary Care.</p>
          <p>The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our home page at pfizer.com by clicking on the link for Pfizer quarterly corporate performance fourth quarter 2012 located in the Investor Presentations section in the lower right-hand corner of this page.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2011 annual report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.</p>
          <p>The discussions during this call will include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today, January 29, 2013.</p>
          <p>In addition, we will offer some brief comments regarding the potential IPO Of a minority stake in our Animal Health business, Zoetis. As I'm sure you will understand, we are not going to be able to respond to questions on that subject in light of the quiet period imposed by the securities laws.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the progress we made in 2012, improving the performance of our innovative core and in creating value for our shareholders. I'll also discuss our focus for 2013.</p>
          <p>2012 was a year of very strong operational financial performances, especially given our LOE [Loss of Exclusivity] challenges. We drove operational growth in many of our key products in the patent-protected portfolio, including Lyrica, Enbrel, Prevnar 13, Celebrex and Sutent.</p>
          <p>Operationally, Emerging Markets grew 12%, Animal Health grew 6% and the consumer business grew 8%.</p>
          <p>Also during 2012, we executed on our plans for allocating capital in ways that enhanced shareholder value. We reduced our total adjusted cost of sales, SI&amp;A and R&amp;D expenses on an operational basis by approximately 10%, which is nearly a $4 billion reduction versus 2011 levels.</p>
          <p>We realized significant value for our shareholders through the sale of our Nutrition business to Nestl&#xE9; for $11.85 billion. And we're on track, subject to market conditions, to unlock value from our animal health business by completing our IPO of Zoetis in the near future. And we returned nearly $15 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>Our focus on creating a productive and sustainable innovative core is yielding results. Our fourth quarter was highlighted by two important product approvals, Xeljanz in the U.S. and Eliquis in the U.S., Canada, the E.U. and Japan. Along with our partner, Bristol-Myers Squibb, we're looking forward to launching Eliquis in the U.S. shortly and believe its strong clinical profile can establish this medication as an important new treatment option in the high-need area of stroke prevention for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.</p>
          <p>Our Specialty Care business is in the initial phase of launching Xeljanz in the U.S., a first-in-class compound with a compelling clinical profile and oral dosing. We believe these factors will position it competitively within the moderate-to-severe-rheumatoid-arthritis market. We are prepared to invest in both of these products at competitive levels to support their launches.</p>
          <p>In addition to Xeljanz and Eliquis, during 2012 we received approval for three additional new medicines: Inlyta for advanced renal cell carcinoma in the U.S., the E.U. and Japan; Bosulif for CML in the U.S.; and Elelyso for Gaucher disease in the U.S.</p>
          <p>During the year, we also advanced our early-stage and mid-stage pipeline, most notably in oncology and vaccine areas. We moved forward in Phase-III studies with dacomitinib for non-small-cell lung cancer, and inotuzumab for aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</p>
          <p>We reported encouraging Phase II data for our CDK-46 inhibitor for advanced breast cancer. This asset, formerly known as PD-332991, is now called palbociclib.</p>
          <p>We commenced a Phase-III study for inotuzumab for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and we began a Phase-III study for meningitis B vaccine for individuals aged 11 to 25.</p>
          <p>I believe we are entering 2013 with one of the most robust pipelines in the company's recent history. The actions we set in motion in early 2011 to improve R&amp;D productivity are starting to bear results, and we look forward to additional progress during 2013.</p>
          <p>We have a pipeline that I believe includes high-value assets at all stages of the development continuum across our key therapeutic areas. As of late last year, our pipeline contained a total of 78 programs, including 59 new molecular entities. There were 17 programs in Phase-III clinical testing and 8 in registration.</p>
          <p>Throughout 2012, we concentrated on advancing our pipeline, reducing our cost structure, and returning value to our shareholders. I believe that through the dedication and focus of Pfizer colleagues, we have delivered on each of these goals.</p>
          <p>Turning to 2013, as I've discussed with you on previous calls, we have two distinct operating models within the developed markets. One model supports our innovative-driven business, Primary Care, Specialty Care and Oncology. The second model supports our value-driven business that compromises the off-patent products within our established products unit.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Emerging Markets, our operational model has a geographic focus that supports both the innovative-driven and the value-driven business. This is working well in these high-growth geographies.</p>
          <p>That said, as these markets evolve, we will evaluate if our Emerging Markets operating model should more closely mirror the two distinct approaches we have for developed markets, and the Consumer Healthcare business continues to be important as we pursue Rx-to-OTC switch opportunities.</p>
          <p>We believe these are the right models for achieving the best performance for Pfizer over the next several years. During this time, we will be able to focus on the market success of our new products, advance our early and mid-stage pipeline, drive continued growth in Emerging Markets in both our innovative and off-patent portfolio.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we will have put behind us our most significant LOEs. We will also continue to use business development opportunities to supplement both our research and internal product efforts. Our primary focus remains bolt-on acquisitions that are projected to meet or exceed the return on investment of share repurchases. More specifically, in 2013 you'll see us focus: on continuing to maximize the value of our in-line portfolio including key in-line assets such as Lyrica, Celebrex, Enbrel, Viagra and Prevnar 13; maximizing the performance of the products approved in the last two years; continue to advance the mid- to late-stage in vaccines, oncology, cardiovascular, inflammation; focusing on the high-growth, high-margin, off-patent opportunities; focusing opportunities in key growth markets such as China, Brazil, Russia, India, Turkey and Mexico; continuing to work on managing our expenses and driving ongoing efficiencies within our manufacturing network so we have a lower and flexible cost base that allows us to respond to pricing pressures and our upcoming LOEs and continuing to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>In summary, our results in 2012 demonstrated that we are focused on the right areas and are making visible progress towards sustained value creation. In 2013, we must maintain our momentum by continuing to execute, by delivering on the potential within our pipeline and by demonstrating fiscal responsibility in how we use or our capital. We are committed to helping patients by delivering innovative medicines and creating value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Frank for additional details on the quarter and our 2013 financial guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone.</p>
          <p>As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. I want to again remind you that the Nutrition business is presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. As you know, discontinued operations are excluded from adjusted financial results, consequently throughout 2012 until its sale on November 30, the results of the Nutrition business have been excluded from adjusted results.</p>
          <p>Now let's move on to the financials. Fourth quarter 2012 revenues of approximately $15.1 billion decreased 7% year-over-year reflecting a 2% negative impact from foreign exchange and an operational decline of approximately 5% driven mainly by the loss of exclusivity of several key products in certain geographies, notably Lipitor in all major markets.</p>
          <p>Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.47 decreased 4%, primarily due to the previously mentioned decrease in revenues, which was partially offset by an aggregate operational decrease of 9% and adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&amp;A expenses and adjusted R&amp;D expenses primarily resulting from cost reduction and productivity initiatives and fewer weighted average shares outstanding due to our continued share repurchases.</p>
          <p>Reported diluted EPS was $0.85 compared with $0.19 in the year-ago quarter. In addition to the factors previously mentioned, reported diluted EPS was favorably impacted by the gain on the sale of the Nutrition business to Nestl&#xE9; and lower overall costs which were partially offset by the negative impact due to the loss of exclusivity of certain products in several geographies and higher restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter revenues by 2% or $271 million and unfavorably impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&amp;A expenses and adjusted R&amp;D expenses by $161 million or 1%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.05.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2012, Emerging Markets biopharmaceutical revenues were approximately $2.7 billion, which reflects operational growth of 20% and the negative impact of foreign exchange of 3%. The revenue growth in Emerging Markets this quarter was driven primarily by strong volume growth in China, overall Emerging Market growth, as well as the timing of government purchases of Enbrel in Brazil and Prevnar 13 in Turkey compared with the year-ago quarter.</p>
          <p>Volume growth of 22% in Emerging Markets was partially offset by price reductions of 2%, resulting in the 20% operational growth. Of the fourth quarter Emerging Markets biopharmaceutical revenues, approximately 42% was generated by established products, 34% by specialty and oncology products and 24% by primary care products.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter biopharmaceutical revenues in the BRIC-MT markets were approximately $1.2 billion, which reflects operational growth of 26% and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 4%. Of the fourth quarter BRIC-MT biopharmaceutical revenues, approximately 46% was generated by established products, 29% by specialty and oncology products and 25% by primary care products.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, biopharmaceutical volume growth of 30% in the BRIC-MT markets was partially offset by price reductions of 4%, resulting in operational revenue growth of 26%. Full-year operational growth in the BRIC-MT market was 16% versus the year-ago period reflecting volume growth of 20%, partially offset by price reductions of 4%.</p>
          <p>As you can see in 2012 we met or exceeded most components of our financial guidance, including achieving the top-end of our full-year 2012 revenue guidance and exceeding our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Our 2012 adjusted R&amp;D expenses of $7.3 billion reflect opportunities to accelerate investments in promising late-stage pipeline assets including palbociclib in advanced breast cancer. However, I want to point out that we expect full-year 2013 adjusted R&amp;D expenses to be in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion. And as I previously mentioned, reported diluted EPS was primarily favorably impacted by the gain on the sale of the nutrition business.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to our 2013 financial guidance, which incorporates the full-year contribution from Zoetis, I'd like to comment specifically on a few elements of the guidance. First, we expect reported revenues to be in the range of $56.2 billion to $58.2 billion. I want to point out that this range includes the absorption of an anticipated $4 billion negative impact due to the loss of exclusivity of certain products in several geographies and to the near term expiration of certain co-promotion agreements.</p>
          <p>In addition it's important to note that approximately $200 million of 2012 revenues associated with products that Pfizer is contributing to the Pfizer Hisun joint venture in China announced in 2012, will not be recorded as Pfizer revenues in 2013. The results of the joint venture will be recorded in Other Income.</p>
          <p>We expect 2013 SI&amp;A to be in the range of $15.6 to $16.6 billion, the midpoint is less than the 2012 actual spending level. This range includes spending in support of key product launch opportunities, such as Eliquis, Xeljanz and Prevnar 13 adult. These are significant product opportunities and we intend to appropriately fund and support these launches to be competitive. In addition, we plan to essentially offset those incremental expenses through our cost reduction initiatives.</p>
          <p>We also expect our 2013 tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 28%, which among other items, includes the federal R&amp;D tax credit renewed by Congress under the American Taxpayer Relief Act for both 2012 and 2013.</p>
          <p>Finally, we expected adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.30. This range includes a $0.02 unfavorable impact for certain ongoing costs associated with the potential separation of Zoetis, including the interest expense on Zoetis debt, certain duplicative costs for corporate support and manufacturing functions and other costs as well as a $0.02 negative impact reflecting the difference in actual foreign exchange rates in 2012 compared with the mid-January 2013 exchange rate. As always, we will continue to monitor foreign exchange fluctuations and will update the potential impact, if any, on our 2013 expectations.</p>
          <p>I want to point out that, with all other things being equal, the inclusion of the $0.02 of cost related to the separation of Zoetis and the $0.02 impact of recent foreign exchange movements has negatively impacted our 2013 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.04. Excluding these items our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range would have been $2.24 to $2.34.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to key takeaways: we achieved the top end of our full-year 2012 revenue guidance and exceeded our adjusted diluted EPS guidance; our initial 2013 financial guidance includes the full-year contribution from Zoetis; we recently completed a $3.65 billion offering of Zoetis senior unsecured notes and remain on track to complete a potential initial public offering of up to a 19.8% ownership stake in Zoetis in the near future; in November, we completed the sale of our nutrition business to Nestl&#xE9; for $11.85 billion; during the fourth quarter, we received U.S. regulatory approvals for Xeljanz and Eliquis.</p>
          <p>We continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. In 2012, we purchased $8.2 billion or 349 million shares. As of December 31, 2012, we had $11.8 billion of authorization remaining under our current repurchase programs. Overall, we returned almost $15 billion to our shareholders in 2012 through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2013 and beyond.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back to Chuck.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks for the commentary, Frank.</p>
          <p>Operator, at this point, if we could please poll for questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. On your tax rate guidance in 2013, can you say what it would be without the double counting of the R&amp;D tax credit? And you had at one time, actually at the time of the Wyeth merger, suggested a longer-term rate of maybe 30%. Seeing what Bristol-Myers has done on lowering its tax rate remarkably, I'm wondering if you have any ability to restructure any of your legal entities as well.</p>
          <p>And then a second question, it's obviously one that you get asked about a lot. But you can give us your latest thoughts on potentially carving up the drug side of the business into truly separate companies like you're doing with Zoetis? You've been alluding to this possibility for quite some time now but I think investors don't really know what sort of odds to assign to it. So, would you say it's higher probability, is it coin-toss odds or is it lower probability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tim. I'll ask Frank to take care of the tax rate guidance and any &#x2013; the 30% tax rate and any other comments you want to make on taxes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So Tim, on the 28%, which is down from 29.3% in 2012, even if we didn't have &#x2013; I'll call it the double benefit of the R&amp;D tax credit in 2013 &#x2013; our tax rate would be closer to 28% than to 29%. So, that's the way to think about it.</p>
          <p>By the way, what will happen in 2013 is we'll record the 2012 benefit in Q1 and then the 2013 benefit will record throughout the year. Just in terms of the accounting mechanics of the R&amp;D tax credit.</p>
          <p>In terms of, you know, legal entity restructuring, the way I think about that is our tax planning. We do tax planning all the time. If you look at our tax rate over the last couple of years, it's gone from 30% to last year, slightly higher than 29% and now our guidance for this year is approximately 28%. We'll obviously continue to do tax planning, but the one thing I think I'll say is, you know, trying to project tax rates beyond 2013, given everything that's going on with the uncertainty with just corporate tax reform I think is not a prudent thing to do. So, you know, our current guidance is approximately 28% and obviously we'll do everything we can to meet or exceed that guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, on your additional question on the business models, I think I've been talking for some time now, when discussing this with investors, that I see that we have two models or two businesses within Pfizer today, major segments. One being the innovative core and one being what we call value, which is basically post-LOE products and we have made that operational separation in the developed markets: in the U.S. and in Europe and Japan and Australia and Korea and places like that.</p>
          <p>We haven't made that separation in Emerging Markets where we run it from a geographic basis. Although, in the major markets, we are moving towards creating units within those geographies that specialize in oncology or primary care or established products. I believe at some point, the markets will separate globally and there will be an innovative market distinct from an established market and I think Pfizer will continue to evolve into being managed that way. So, you know, I hope that answers your question.</p>
          <p>Right now, as I think I said in my opening comments, Emerging Markets is working well. Our structure in the developed markets is working well. We are focused on the new launches, the pipeline, our capital allocation, expense discipline and we'll continue to evolve our model as we see value opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you, Ian. Next question, please, operator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks very much. Just two questions here. Maybe one just kind of following up on Tim's questions. I think you've talked about as the Emerging Markets evolve that we might see the business model evolve. Just following up on that, does it make sense for Pfizer to keep both a value and innovative core under the same umbrella if we get to a point with the Emerging Markets that structure doesn't &#x2013; the current regional structure does not make sense?</p>
          <p>And the second question is coming back to the bolt-on acquisitions. Can you remind us how large a bolt-on acquisition you'd consider at this point? What are the priorities for you and when the company &#x2013; if a larger deal were to come along with the right fit, is that an opportunity for Pfizer or is that really not in the cards as we consider capital deployment over the next couple of years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris. Going back to the possibilities that the EM and why it would make sense for Pfizer to have those two businesses, you know, I think there's not really a lot of point on speculating over this. Today we have both businesses. You certainly, in an innovative side, need to be careful that you have &#x2013; it tends to be more volatile and the established products allows you to take short-term movements and volatile in the business. But that being said, you know, we will look at it, we'll &#x2013; I believe we'll move towards a separate management and at that point, we'll be able to evaluate whether shareholders would prefer to have the option to invest in two distinct companies or not. I don't think that is a short-term priority right now for us. The priority is to evolve our internal model and measure how successful those businesses are and what management and leadership they require and are they distinct enough to go further.</p>
          <p>On the bolt-on acquisitions, we've said that we are focused on generating shareholder returns and I'm going to make a few comments and then I'll ask Frank to add to it, if he wants to. So, we use &#x2013; we look at bolt-on accusations as a way of adding high value businesses or intellectual property to Pfizer that can generate positive returns to shareholders above what we see as opportunity of share buybacks.</p>
          <p>Bolt-ons, I don't want to give you a precise number. We did King, it was $3.7 billion. So, what's a bolt-on? You know, middle multiples of that number, you know, you pick it. Our market cap is $180 billion, what would you consider a bolt-on for that size of company?</p>
          <p>Now as regards larger opportunities, you know, we look at everything from the point of view of does it add value to Pfizer shareholders? If it adds value, we never say never. We consider opportunities. But right now, we continue to be focused on running our internal business and looking for bolt-on opportunities.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And I'll just add maybe three items to Ian's comments. I think first, the way we think about Bus Dev in general is it is not a strategy in and of itself, it's an enabler of our strategy. So that would be point number one.</p>
          <p>I think the second thing in terms of bolt-ons, I think Ian sized it perfectly. King was several billion dollars, we viewed that as a bolt-on is the way to think about that.</p>
          <p>In terms of the priorities, which is something you asked, no changes. I think our priorities remain our focused therapeutic and disease areas, including the emerging markets. That is clearly where we've been biasing and that's where we'll continue to bias.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of, you know, the large deals, just to punctuate what Ian said and there's no new news here. We always say we never say never but our focus has been and continues to be on bolt-on acquisitions.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Jay Olson on behalf of Jami Rubin. A couple of questions. First off with the focus on optimizing both your innovative and your value-based businesses and we appreciate the significant progress being made in the innovative side with new product launches and pipeline progress, we wonder if you could elaborate a little on some of the initiatives you're taking to optimize the value-based business.</p>
          <p>And second of all, I understand your comments may be restricted, but could you help us understand what might be a fair timeline for your potential decision to monetize the remaining 80% of Zoetis and would a share exchange be something you would consider if Zoetis shares trade at a premium to Pfizer? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jay. I'll ask Olivier, who runs the Established Products business and Emerging Markets, if he can comment on the work we're doing to grow what we call the value business and then Frank will answer a question on Animal Health.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. What we're trying to do in the established business division is to maximize the performance of those products in the LOE space and supporting their life cycle potentially with line extension and enhanced product formulation. We also have recently built on the opportunity to quickly provide very reliable source of product in shortage situations and we've been very active in the U.S. market in that space. We made also a move on sterile injectable. We think it's a high-value space for the post-LOE market.</p>
          <p>And in the space of differentiated formulation, I don't know if you've seen recently, but we launched Quillivant XR in January, the first and only product which is in liquid formulation and extended release for kids between 6 and 12 years old with ADHD and we think we're going to be, through that enhanced and better formulation, very competitive in that marketplace. So, just providing few examples of what we we're doing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Olivier. I'd probably add to that, we also have an active program in biosimilars which I would consider probably in the post-LOE space. Frank?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>So on Zoetis, I just want to reiterate what Chuck said at the beginning of the call, which is, we're in a quiet period, so I'm very limited in what I can say.</p>
          <p>What I can say is we remain on track to complete a potential IPO for up to a 19.8% stake in Zoetis in the near future. The road show is taking place. And, you know, relative to beyond the IPO, assuming one is completed, we'll have a number of alternatives that are available to us for distributing the remaining shares and obviously we'll do what's best from an after-tax return to our shareholders.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Apologies for that. Maybe I can ask a couple of pipeline and product-related questions. Number one, on PD-991, I think this is the first earnings call since the fantastic data a month or two ago. Just wondering if you can clarify your plans in terms of filing timelines and also if you can help us understand the market opportunity for that, that would be great.</p>
          <p>And then also two major product launches this year at Pfizer, arguably the highest profile launches in all of biopharma with Xeljanz and Eliquis. I'd love it if you could give the investment community any advice or wisdom when we think about those launches and maybe compare and contrast them. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So on PD-991, palbociclib, I would ask Geno to comment on that and on that, as you say, outstanding data we got in the first of the Phase II trial and then perhaps Geno will make some comments on how we see the evolving launch of Xeljanz and then John Young could make some comments on the launch of Eliquis. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so for palbociclib, as you mentioned, we had some really terrific data that we were able to present in San Antonio last year. That trial is, you know, continues into this year. There are two patient cohorts. The one &#x2013; the first patient cohort has completed and the second patient cohort will complete later this year. We're expecting to present data &#x2013; full data by the end of the year. And as the data emerges, we will continue to discuss the data with the agencies around the world and determine the best pathway to bring this product to patients.</p>
          <p>Our current focus is on the ER-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer patient population. We expect to initiate a Phase III trial in this population to confirm the results that we saw in Phase II in the very near term and we're anxious to proceed with that program. We also have plans to initiate additional Phase III programs in other breast cancer patient populations and then to explore the utility of the drug in tumors outside of breast cancer as we go through the rest of this year.</p>
          <p>With record to Xeljanz, we're off to a very good start. We're pleased with the execution of the launch plan so far. It is early days but the response from physicians has been very favorable. They're particularly pleased with the second line indication and the ability to use Xeljanz without the need for methotrexate. These are recurring themes that we're hearing. We did expect that the majority of initial trial will be in the post-TNF patient population and we think that that's reasonable going forward, although we are hearing of physicians trying the drug in both the post-methotrexate and the post-TNF patient population.</p>
          <p>Most physicians are putting a handful of patients on the drug and want to see the patients come back to evaluate them and we're pretty optimistic that when they see those patients return, that they will be pleased with the results given the outcome of our Phase III trials and in particular, the feedback from patients on patient reported outcomes which were actually very favorable in our Phase III program.</p>
          <p>So we're on track and feel good about Xeljanz. Sorry. And I guess with that, I'll turn it over to John Young.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Geno and thanks for your question, Mark.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we're very excited about the opportunity that we have with Eliquis along with our partners, BMS. And I think clearly since the last call in a little more than six weeks, Eliquis received back-to-back approvals in the U.S. the 27 countries of the E.U., Canada, Japan, South Korea, for reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. We've already launched in the U.K., Germany, Denmark and the launches will progress in the E.U. over the coming months.</p>
          <p>In terms of the profile, which you know very well, clearly Eliquis is the only oral anticoagulant that's demonstrated superior risk reduction versus warfarin in the three critical outcomes of stroke prevention, <mark type="ph" /> meteor (35:25) bleeding, and all-cause mortality in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. So as a result, we certainly believe it offers a compelling profile for cardiologists and primary-care physicians, as reflected in our approved labels.</p>
          <p>We expect Eliquis to be widely available in most U.S. pharmacies by the end of January. Our U.S. sales teams from Pfizer and BMS are at the internal launch meeting as we speak, and will be on the road speaking to physicians on Monday next week.</p>
          <p>And overall, we really believe that Eliquis's differentiated profile, combined with the extensive experience that Pfizer and BMS bring to the cardiovascular commercial market, certainly positions us well to succeed. Given the strength of the Eliquis data, the superior risk reduction versus warfarin in those three critical outcomes of stroke prevention, we believe that payers will certainly want to ensure that patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation have access to this clinically important medicine, and we expect steady progress as we penetrate this market over the course of 2013 and beyond.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three questions. First is for Ian. Do you see opportunities for the industry to remove excess capacity and infrastructure from within its EM and established market products through a reorganization <mark type="ph" /> or let's say a (36:37) consolidation of distribution channels?</p>
          <p>Second for Mikael &#x2013; for Frank &#x2013; I'm interested in how tax-efficient you think your existing EM established-products business is? And how much would alternative business structures potentially enable you to optimize that?</p>
          <p>And then finally for Geno, my apologies, could you just talk to whether there is a pre-planned interim analysis for your recently initiated first-line PD-991 trial? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andrew.</p>
          <p>Excess capacity in Emerging Markets. I think right now, probably if you go back to the U.S. market in the 1990s, most companies are focused on trying to get a &#x2013; you know, as large a share as they can in these quickly growing economies. So I don't think people are focused right now on taking out infrastructure. However, I do agree with you that, just like we saw in the U.S. and Europe, there clearly will be, at some point, opportunities to rationalize infrastructure in those geographies.</p>
          <p>As the second question I didn't really understand. EP and emerging &#x2013; perhaps you want to have a &#x2013; did you &#x2013; I didn't really understand, I'm afraid, Andrew. Perhaps you can come back and reposition it.</p>
          <p>Geno, could you comment on palbociclib?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In the Phase-III program &#x2013; again, we're in ongoing discussion with the agency. And our focus is on finding the best way forward to reveal data that will enable the best decisions on making the drug available to patients. So we will discuss interim analysis as part of that assessment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I could just say on Emerging Markets and EP, we have a clear vision of both businesses. We're getting what we believe are strong results.</p>
          <p>You know, in EP you can see the successful switch-to of Lipitor. You can see the Quillivant launch, focus on sterile injectables, focus on major markets. And in Emerging Markets, we have strong geographic-based organizations that are driving value in both our innovative and our post-LOE products.</p>
          <p>Olivier, do you want to add anything to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is a strong integration of EP products into EM. And as we said, they are very valuable. They represent basically about 45% of our revenue. Growing very strongly, this quarter, as you've seen, at 21%.</p>
          <p>And very often that is the result of combining innovative and EP products into the same sales force. For instance, cardiovascular sales force have both Lipitor and Norvasc. And in many geographies, Lipitor is still &#x2013; in EM, is still protected where Norvasc is not. But you do optimize the two brands that way.</p>
          <p>So there are plenty of synergies to build on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It is Gregg Gilbert. Thanks.</p>
          <p>The first question is on Emerging Markets growth in 4Q. I realize that can be a lumpy growth line. So perhaps you can set the bar what a reasonable growth rate goal would be annually in 2013 and possibly beyond?</p>
          <p>My second question, along the lines of maximizing value for the value business, the strategy so far for the developed-markets portion seems to be focused on Pfizer brands that lose exclusivity, coupled with alliances with generic companies that do generic R&amp;D. Going forward, could the strategy also include, one, internal development of small-molecule generics, and/or, two, outright acquisitions of companies in that space? Again, I'm thinking more about developed markets than the emerging piece. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>OK. Olivier, could you take the fourth quarter, and also refocus the comments on the strategy in the developed markets with VEP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thank you, Gregg.</p>
          <p>So you've seen &#x2013; we posted 20% operational growth. And that is the result actually of very good results across geographies. BRIC-MT have actually posted 26% operational growth, but 30% in volume, and offset by pricing.</p>
          <p>But very strong across geographies and portfolio. Specialty is running at 45% growth this quarter, and as I mentioned before, Emerging Markets at 21%.</p>
          <p>Now, having said that, you have a lot of one-time items this quarter, right? Especially Enbrel in Brazil, and Prevnar in Turkey and Mexico. And if you exclude those one-time items, you get to 16% growth for the quarter.</p>
          <p>There are still volatility quarter-to-quarter in Emerging Markets. And we remain committed to grow our Emerging Market division by high-single-digit growth in the coming years. So that's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the established products in the developed markets, what are the key strategies to grow the business, such as sterile injectables and launches of Quillivant, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So we remain focused on established products, to your point. We are not focusing, in the generic portfolio, outside the U.S., where we have a strong position where, as you know, with Greenstone.</p>
          <p>Outside the U.S., it is mainly established products. And we're looking to bring sterile injectable, and as I mentioned before, new and differentiated formulation of established products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I suppose in the developed market, we would say that business is a combination of Greenstone, a quality supplier that closes market gaps, with quality product.</p>
          <p>We've done that also in the oncology space. We bring important and sterile, injectable products. We're trying to launch innovative formulations. And as distinct from established products in the emerging Markets, where it's still a primary-care business, it's field forces. It's selling quality and it's selling the brand name of the products and Pfizer.</p>

If you were to proceed with full separation, how should we think about the margin expansion for Pfizer?</p>
          <p>And then on the CAPiTA trial, we know it's expected this year. I'm just wondering if you have a narrower timeline for it. And if you could provide us any insights as to how we could quantify the adult opportunity? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so on the impact of Zoetis on our numbers &#x2013; and once again, I'm limited in what I can say. But the intent here is, assuming we were to complete an IPO, we would issue &#x2013; we would revise our guidance in early April, after Zoetis has filed its 10-K, which would be at the end of March. So at that time, we would revise our guidance by line item, and therefore you could see the impact it would have on our numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>With regard to CAPiTA, the program &#x2013; the trial continues to accumulate patients.</p>
          <p>As you know, it is an event-driven trial so we really don't know what the date will be when the final event has been identified. Once we have all the events accrue, we will complete the assessment, you know, do the analysis and report the data. We expect that to happen later this year.</p>
          <p>With regard to the magnitude of the opportunity, assuming positive results, we think that having a vaccine with a demonstrated ability to prevent non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia would be a valuable asset. There are over 300 million adults over 50 years of age in the developed markets, and I think the number expands to over 700 million in the global marketplace. So we think that the opportunity is substantial.</p>

          <p>Second of all, Olivier, I'm curious &#x2013; in the Emerging Markets, given all the cost-cutting going on in the overall company, I was curious how much investment is occurring in the emerging markets? Where have we invested significantly more for 2013 versus 2012?</p>
          <p>And then maybe we could just get what the key Phase-II read-outs are for 2013 for data? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So Geno, oncology. Olivier, if you could make some comments on the question there. And Mikael, will you do the Phase II?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for oncology, just a couple of comments about Xalkori. We have got a full year now in the U.S. Xalkori achieved $100 million in sales in 2012, primarily in the U.S. It's now approved and launched in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and several other smaller markets.</p>
          <p>Sales are continuing to grow as adoption of molecular testing continues to expand. We started out with about a 10% testing rate. Now the testing rate is over 60%. We think in the past year, we captured about a quarter of the potential patients in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing an expansion in the duration of treatment as we're identifying patients earlier in their disease. So we're happy with the progress of Xalkori and looking forward to expansion in new markets in the world.</p>
          <p>Inlyta has also gotten off to a very strong start in the U.S. where it has already established the leading share in second line. In Japan, it's the second-most-prescribed drug for metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and with a 10% share and 40% in the second-line setting.</p>
          <p>So in general, we're seeing good growth of Inlyta, continued progress with Xalkori, and we're just getting started with Bosulif.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Olivier?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, so for Emerging Markets, definitely they represent an important growth opportunity. So we have been investing quite significantly in this market in recent years.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest in order to remain competitive. However, we are putting transformation programs to ensure that we are optimizing our sales force and we have the best potential deployment, especially in support of the new products which are going to be very important for Emerging Market and the new launches. In addition to putting in place go-to-market models when it comes to brand marketing.</p>
          <p>So while we are investing, we are also beginning to get positive leverage from those investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Olivier -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So we have a very exciting Phase-II cohort reading out more than 10 studies over the next 12 months. I'll share a couple with you.</p>
          <p>Immunology, we have our best-in-class IL-6 antibody with data coming in lupus and also in Crohn's disease. We have a MadCAM antibody for Crohn's disease, a small molecule p38 oral inhibitor for COPD.</p>
          <p>In diabetes, we have a pancreatic glucokinase activator with a really unique profile reading out in diabetes and glucose control, and we also have a novel PD-5 inhibitor for diabetic nephropathy.</p>
          <p>In vaccines, we are expecting data from staph aureas.</p>
          <p>Our efforts in biosimilar are starting to move very nicely. We recently had positive data on trastuzumab, which is exploring plans to go into Phase III, while this year, we expect data from our second biosimilar, rituximab, after finalization of Phase II.</p>
          <p>In some smaller areas, we're strengthening our portfolio in rare diseases and have a read-out on GMI-1070 in sickle-cell crisis. Also PCSK9 had a positive read-out that we reported last year, and we have Phase-IIb data coming, which underpins then our path forward to Phase III.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Just sticking with the pipeline, Dr. Dolsten, if possible, will we actually get the read-out of the Phase-III study ARCHER with dacomitinib this year?</p>
          <p>And then second, I guess for Geno, going back to Xeljanz, some doc feedback to us &#x2013; and again, it is limited &#x2013; has suggested that patients do not actually know about the drug. Is patient awareness important at this early in the launch? And is a DTC campaign actually in the cards? Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I can mention, we're very excited about dacomitinib. As you know, it's a pan-HER inhibitor, irreversible binding and did very well in our Phase II data against Tarceva. The ARCHER trial that you refer to is event-driven and we expect the data probably more during the first half of 2014 to have accrued the number of events required to close the trial.</p>
          <p>In addition to that trial where we, you know, go against Tarceva, as we did in our Phase II, we also have another partner trial against refractory non-small cell lung cancer. So it's, you know, run by The National Cancer Institute of Canada. So, it's a nice study set behind dacomitinib and we look very much forward to see that data come for possibly a new generation of EGFR inhibitors.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to awareness on Xeljanz, fortunately within the first few weeks of launch we have near 100% awareness among the prescribing community, which is terrific and as I mentioned before, a lot of enthusiasm for the drug. Patient awareness is much lower and we haven't done a lot of work with consumers. But we expect to roll out a consumer program around the middle of this year in keeping with the pharmaceutical guidelines to hold off on direct-to-consumer advertising for the first six months of launch. But we do think that, you know, consumer communication will be an important driver. We know that consumers are excited about the idea of having an oral option and also excited about the potential to have an effective therapy without the need for methotrexate.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink Swann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, thanks for the question. So first for Ian, Ian, can you just maybe clarify your comments in terms of the separation of the managements? Are you planning to actually tighten down the management from the multi-tiered organizations to now officially providing reporting at some point around the structure of the two businesses as you describe them, the innovative core and the value business?</p>
          <p>And then separately, Geno, can you help us understand, you know, back when Prevnar 7, there was a decision at Wyeth way back when, to not to continue forward with Prevnar 7 in the adult setting in large part because of herd immunity that is created by dosing infants. How do you see herd immunity influencing the adult indication for Prevnar 13 and is it just really more a timing-related issue as we think about the impact of herd immunity with Prevnar 13? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Seamus. On the &#x2013; what you were really talking about was segment reporting. Right now we have the management split and the responsibility split in the developed markets. We don't have that split in the emerging markets so it is really, I think, premature at this stage to look at segment reporting but we'll continue to review that so as to give shareholders the transparency they need with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Seamus, just regarding Prevnar, my recollection is that we chose not to go forward with the adult indication on 7 because we were so focused on advancing and broadening the serotype coverage and getting to a 13 ahead of our competition. Once we &#x2013; once we achieved the formulation for 13, we were anxious to proceed to the adult vaccine.</p>
          <p>With regard to herd immunity, we know there is some herd immunity with the vaccination of children. There are a variety of epidemiologic studies that show different rates of herd effect. There are surveillance programs as well under way to identify the herd effect and what we see is that there is a residual disease burden that we think that the adult vaccine will help prevent in the adult patient population and the opportunity remains significant.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I have some questions on Xeljanz and then on Emerging Markets future growth prospects.</p>
          <p>So with respect to Xeljanz, we're going to try to benchmark the prescription trend ramp and I just wanted to understand your sampling program because, on the one hand, I understand that you're giving 30-day samples, but on the other hand, for virtually all drug launches, drug companies give samples. So, I don't know if your sampling program is unusually strong relative to other product launches such that we should expect unusually low reported prescriptions.</p>
          <p>And then with respect to the once-daily Xeljanz, which is entering Phase II in 2013, could you help us understand whether Pfizer plans to run bridging studies to shorten the timeline to a filing and when do you plan to file that once-daily for approval?</p>
          <p>And then changing gears to Emerging Markets, the operating performance growth was 12% in 2012, including a huge fourth quarter, which seemed to be driven by some anomalies. And I know that you're sticking to your high single digit growth target operationally for Emerging Markets. But is that too conservative because you reported 12% in 2012 and it looks like high single digits growth going forward would be below market growth or should we think about potential upside to that target for high single digit emerging market growth going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Geno, could you answer the Xeljanz issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. With regard to the sampling program on Xeljanz, there's really two components. One is we have a patient support program to help patients access reimbursement and to go through that process, which is very similar to any of the other drugs that they would be using in rheumatology. So, there is a 14-day supply that we make available to patients to ensure that they can start therapy as soon as possible while they're going through that reimbursement process.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, we identified a group of rheumatologists who we wanted to have access to drugs right away so that they can gain experience immediately and we gave 30-day supply bottles to that identified population of rheumatologists to use, to gain that early experience. Now whether we'll continue that program into the future or not is unknown at this point, but the very initial impact of the two sampling programs will, you know, range from, you know, a fairly short period of time.</p>
          <p>With regard to the once a day program, we're going to want to have the once a day have adequate labeling to enable use across all of the indications that we're pursuing. The program is a robust program and we're still in discussion, actually, with the agency on the exact protocol.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. David, on the Emerging Markets, you know, I would agree with you that most multinationals are growing at slower than the overall market rate, as these markets are very local in their healthcare delivery and there are strong local competitors who given the lack of intellectual property in the last 25 years have broad portfolios and add to those portfolios very fast. So I don't think it's reasonable to expect a multinational will outgrow the marketplace.</p>
          <p>That being said, you know, we have had accelerating growth. I was very pleased with the growth in the fourth quarter. However, I still believe that, you know, it is appropriate and aggressive to maintain a high single growth rate in Emerging Markets.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I wanted to ask you a few things, first of all, could you comment on your strategic interest in the eye business for the right price and also tell us when we're going to hear about your dry AMD [Age-related Macular Degeneration] program and then just some nuance on the CDK, I don't think we got to, is if the part two study comes out as positive or directionally the same as we've seen for part one of your ER-negative &#x2013; ER-positive HR-negative study, would you presumably go to FDA for an accelerated approval path? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eye interest. I don't believe that the eye is a stated strategic disease area for us. So, you know, that would probably answer that one. On macular degeneration, can you comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, you know, we have more opportunistic efforts in ophthalmology based on the, you know, scientific spin-off opportunity. The particular program we have, RN6G, is an antibody against amyloid that we made some findings seeming to, in the models, play a role in dry AMD. The study is up and running, but we don't have any data coming this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on palbociclib, which is the CDK-46, look, you know, I think Geno's commented on this, I'll just reinforce it. We have great data in the first trial we have a second trial running, which is a different cohort of patients. We expect to be able to give you the results of that trial in the second half of this year. And as the data evolves, we'll continue to work with the FDA and other agencies and we will clearly try and work with the regulators to bring this product to patients as fast as is appropriate given the data we have.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, a couple of follow-ups. First, has the strong flu season increased the event rate in CAPiTA and has it changed the timing from the Q3 conclusion, which I think is what the company had said previously?</p>
          <p>Secondly, has the decision by many payers to pay for Xeljanz post-TNF failures been mostly dictated by price, by lack of real world experience or by some other factor. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve. Geno?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it has been a robust flu season this year and generally that is associated with a higher number of events. I can't confirm or deny whether or not there has been an acceleration of events in the trial. Clearly the sooner the events accumulate to the target, the sooner we'll have results. So we'll let you know as soon as we know something there.</p>
          <p>With regard to reimbursement for Xeljanz, actually the reimbursement coverage has been very favorable. Most of the plans are reimbursing out of the gate and will conduct, you know, category reviews over time.</p>

          <p>The second that Ian alluded to, rituximab is going to complete in this year Phase II studies. So, you can see it is good momentum. We're using the deep skills in biopharmaceuticals and manufacturing at Pfizer to provide quality data.</p>

          <p>Thank you, just a quick question. With regard to the guidance, can you talk about what your share repurchase assumptions are for the year and in addition, speak to the timing of the buyback? Is it weighted more the first half versus second or more should we assume evenly spread out throughout the year?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So Kim, the assumption is mid-teen billions relative to buybacks. And in terms of the rhythm, I think the way to think about that is, you know, throughout the year.
