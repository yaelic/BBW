          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.  Thank you for standing by and welcome to the 2007 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call.  <mark type="Operator instructions" />  At this time it's my pleasure to turn the conference to our host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Ron Stovall, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom, and welcome to everyone.  We appreciate you all of us joining us for today's discussion.  As usual, it's my job to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subjects to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.  The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements included in the company's financial and other goals are set forth within today's earnings press release which was filed in an 8-K report and in the Company's 2006 10-K report already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter 2007 earnings release and supplement which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com and on file with the SEC in an 8-K report we have provided information that describes the company's managed basis and other non-GAAP financial measures and the comparable GAAP financial information.  And we explain why these presentations are useful to management and to investors.  We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.</p>
          <p>Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of American Express will provide some introductory remarks highlighting key points related to today's announcement.  Once he completes his remarks we will turn to the moderator who had announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&amp;A period.  Up until then no one is actually registered to ask questions.  While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time.  Based on this we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&amp;A.  With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ron.  And thanks to everyone for joining the call today.  As usual, my remarks today will mostly focus on the results for the fourth quarter as you are already familiar with our results for the first three quarters of year.  However, during the Q&amp;A I will happy to respond to any question you might have on our full year results, in addition, to your questions on the quarter.</p>
          <p>Have you seen in the earnings documents our fourth quarter results reflect a continuation of the strong business growth we reported throughout recent years.  As you know, these results reflect the benefits of our multi year investments in a broad range of business building initiatives which have yielded industry leading performance for the quarter and over the past few years.  When you compare our results from continuing operations to the fourth quarter of last year, net revenues grew 10%, income decreased 6%, and diluted EPS of $0.71 decreased 3% but was in line with our previous announced expectations.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2007, we reported income from continuing operations of $4 billion, up 12% from 2006 and diluted EPS of $3.39, which rose 16%.  ROE for the prior 12 months was 37%.  The results for the quarter reflect the significant items that we highlighted in our recent announcement and include the recognition of 700 million after-tax reduction in operating expense from the $1.1 billion initial payment in the company's litigation settlement with Visa, 89 million after-tax of incremental investments in marketing, promotion and other business-building initiatives, 46 million after-tax of litigation related costs pertaining to the lawsuit against Visa and MasterCard, 31 million after-tax of additional contribution to the American Express Charitable Fund and a 274 million after-tax credit-related charge which reflected the impact of the weakening economy during the latter part of the quarter.</p>
          <p>In addition, the quarter included a $430 million after-tax charge to increase the Membership Rewards liability based on our decision to adopt more of an actuarial based method to estimate the ultimate redemption rate of Rewards points earned by Cardmembers. Last year's fourth quarter included a 42 million after-tax gain related to the rebalancing program within the Travelers Cheque and Gift Card investment portfolio and 45 million of after-tax benefits related to certain foreign losses and the finalization of state tax returns.</p>
          <p>In addition, both quarters included reengineering costs totaling 10 million after-tax in the fourth quarter of 2007, versus 42 million of after-tax last year.  During the quarter and year-to-date we returned 99% and 88% respectively of total capital generated to our shareholders through repurchase of shares and dividends.  Since 1994, we have returned 71% of capital generated to shareholders which is above our 65% long-term target.</p>
          <p>The 10% revenue growth in the quarter reflects strong double-digit increases in a number of revenue categories including discount revenue and Cardmember lending finance revenues.  This growth rate was somewhat suppressed by our higher interest expense.  As far as our consolidated results go, they continue to be driven by strong growth in Cardmember spending, loans, and cards-in-force. Billed business growth for the quarter remains strong, even with the slower growth in December that we discussed with you two weeks ago. Each of our customer segments and geographic regions contributed to the 16% growth worldwide, or 13% growth on an FX adjusted basis.</p>
          <p>Let me give you some more details. In our U.S. proprietary business, consumer spending grew 10% for the quarter, small business spending increased 14%, and Corporate Services volumes improved by 11%.  In total, U.S. volumes for retail and everyday spend grew 14%; this category represented about 72% of the U.S. billings.  Travel &amp; Entertainment related spending, which accounts for the remainder, rose 9%.  Outside the U.S., proprietary billings billed business grew 11% on an FX adjusted basis.  This was driven by 9% growth within our consumer and small business activity and 14% growth within Corporate Services.  Within Global Network Services billed business rose 39% driven by continued robust growth both in and outside of the U.S.</p>
          <p>Worldwide cards-in-force rose 11%.  We added 1.7 million net new cards during the quarter and 8.4 million net new cards since last year.  This reflects 5% growth versus last year in proprietary cards and 35% growth in network partner cars</p>
          <p>Spending per proprietary card rose 8% worldwide even with the suppressing effects of the substantial card additions over the past few years.  Our average discount rate of 2.54% decreased slightly from last year and consistent with seasonal patterns declined three basis point versus last quarter.  Net card fee revenues increased 14% through the strong growth in cards as well as higher average fee per card.</p>
          <p>Travel commissions and fees increased 14%, reflecting an 18% increase in travel sales. Once again, we saw our strong growth in Cardmember spending generate a high level of loan growth.  Worldwide lending balances on an owned basis rose 26%.  On a managed basis, balances grew 22% on 23% growth in the U.S. and a 15% increase in our non-U.S. portfolios.</p>
          <p>This growth continues to reflect the flow through of particularly strong spending levels within our co-brand, lending on charge, and other credit card relationships as well as successful acquisition efforts surrounding these products.  In the U.S., some of this growth is also related to the slow down in payment rates, which we believe is consistent with the weaker economic environment.  While we know that some of you have questioned the logic of such strong growth in this environment, we are confident in the attractive underlying economics of this business growth through the cycle.</p>
          <p>Securitization income decreased 6% as higher finance charge and fee revenue driven by a greater average balance of securitized loans was more than offset by higher write-offs and a decrease in the valuation of the interest-only strip that was included in this quarter's credit related charge.</p>
          <p>Cardmember lending finance revenues rose 27% on growth of the owned portfolio.  Interest expense increased 34%.  This was due to a 35% increase in funding costs within the lending business and a 33% increase within the charge card and other interest expense line.  Most of this reflects the volume increases within the business.  However, as we discussed with you during the year, the higher interest expense was also driven by the expiration of some fixed rate debt and hedges at the end of 2006.  Specifically, fixed-rate debt and hedges within the U.S. card business declined by $11 billion. The effective funding rate on that amount was 3.2%.  It was replaced by funding based on higher market rates of approximately 5.1% in the quarter.  This resulted in about 48 million of incremental expense in the quarter versus last year.</p>
          <p>Marketing, promotions, rewards, and Cardmember services expense increased 57% reflecting the charge to increase the Membership Rewards reserve and the incremental investment in marketing and promotion resulting from the Visa settlement.  The increase also reflects higher volumes related to rewards costs.  As you can see, within our segment results, our marketing efforts this past quarter were again somewhat more focused on spending outside of the U.S. versus the more U.S. oriented investment activity during the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>The increase in reward costs continued to reflect our strong spending growth and increasing Cardmember participation. The charge taken this quarter increases the global ultimate redemption rate assumption for the program participants-- the assumption for current program participants within the reserve model to approximately 90%.  We believe this is consistent with the increased usage of the program by our Cardmembers and our plan to continue to vigorously utilize rewards as a centerpiece of our competitive strategy.</p>
          <p>Human resource expense increased 6% due to merit increases, greater benefit costs and a higher number of employees, primarily resulting from customer service initiatives and an acquisition within Corporate Services.  The growth in the remaining operating expenses reflect the impact of increased volumes within our technology and Cardmember service activity and shows the underlying operating expense is continued to be well controlled.</p>
          <p>The total provision for losses and benefits increased 70% versus last year as the lending provision increased 100% and the charge provision rose 51% and the other provision decreased 2%.  The increase in lending provision reflects the credit related charge, higher loan volumes and increased past due and write-off rates in the U.S. portfolio.   Delinquencies for the U.S. Card Services segment increased from 2.9% of managed loans in the third quarter to 3.2% in the fourth quarter '07, and write-off rates on a managed basis for this segment also increased from 3.7% in the third quarter to 4.3% in the fourth quarter '07.</p>
          <p>As we said, the changes that we saw in the credit performance are reflective of the external economic environment and don't specifically stem from individual products or Cardmember tenure of segments.  Although, as you would expect, we have seen greater deterioration in geographic areas where the housing market has contracted more severely, such as California and Florida.  We have also seen a somewhat higher level of weakness in accounts that have not yet gone through the natural seasoning process, as well as in lower FICO bands within the portfolio.  The increase in the charge card provision also reflects the credit-related charge and volume growth.  However the deterioration we saw during the quarter here was less than we experienced in the lending portfolio.</p>
          <p>The consolidated tax rate of 26% for the quarter compares with 25% rate last year.</p>
          <p>With that, let me conclude with a few final comments.  While the quarters' earnings growth reflect the negative impacts of the significant items I referenced earlier, we did deliver strong revenue growth and excellent returns, while continuing to invest in key business initiatives, and maintain balance sheet strength, and for the full year, earnings were strong, despite the fourth quarter impact.</p>
          <p>Business metric performance, like growth in billed business and loan balance, continues to be in the top tier of the industry. The gap between our growth rate and that of most major competitors demonstrates the effectiveness and ongoing benefit of our marketing and rewards investments over the past several years. While losses and past due levels within the U.S. lending portfolio have trended higher, our credit quality indicators compare favorably to the industry, and continue to reflect the benefits from our focus on the premium market sectors.  As we've discussed before, our write-off rate calculations include principal, accrued interest and accrued fees, versus the principal- only calculations that our competitors generally publish and utilize.  This serves to overstate our comparable rate by about 20%.</p>
          <p>As previously disclosed, our business plan for 2008 assumes a moderately weaker U.S. economy, and reflects the slowing billed business growth and rising write-off rates that we saw during the latter part of the quarter.  We assume billed business growth of 8 to 10% compared to the 10% FX adjusted growth we saw in December. We also assume that the managed U.S. lending write-off rate will be in the 5.1 to 5.3% range for the year versus the 4.3% in the fourth quarter.  In addition, we expect to pull back on certain discretionary expenses and assume marketing and promotion expense will be somewhat below the 2007 levels.  We believe that spending at this level will allow us to capitalize on competitive opportunities and position the company to continue to gain share over the medium to long term.</p>
          <p>The interest expense levels that impacted us in 2008 are obviously dependent upon credit market environments.  However our plan does not reflect last week's Fed rate cut.  The plan also considers the availability of the 70 million per quarter settlement related payments from Visa.  Here we are optimistic that the U.S. GNS business is well positioned to meet the quarterly performance criteria necessary to receive these payments.  This provides us with the additional flexibility within the plan.  So if the business is performing at the strong end of our assumptions, we will likely invest these payments.  But if performance is at the weak end we can use them to bolster the bottom line.</p>
          <p>In this type of business scenario, we believe the flexibility that we have built into our business model generally positions us to grow EPS in the 10 to 12% range.  However, given the comparisons to a year that included several significant positive items, the plan assumes 2008 reported EPS will increase in the 4 to 6% range.  The quarterly year over year EPS comparisons are likely to show significant variances, with the 2008 first quarter earnings level forecasted to be below that of last year, in part as a result of the relatively low level of marketing spending in the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>These results are based on the assumption that the billed business growth and write-off rates in the plan are met and that macroeconomic indicators such as employment, consumer spending and funding costs do not deteriorate significantly from current levels.  But we do recognize that the plan assumptions that we've made will have to change if the economy varies from our expectations.  In that case, we will consider what the economic environment is, be focused on the long term health of the franchise and we will take actions that are appropriate depending on the circumstances.  Our investment optimization process positions us to identify opportunities to increase or decrease our business building investments quickly and thoughtfully.</p>
          <p>We have a strong planning and forecasting process which dynamically incorporates changes in the environmental conditions, and we remain focused on reengineering, which in recent years has yielded a far leaner expense base.  Collectively, we believe these efforts will help us to maximize our ability to invest in key growth opportunities even in a difficult economic environment.</p>
          <p>We will continue to manage the company for the long term interest of the shareholders, and be guided by our on-average and over-time financial objectives.  Since we set our targets in 1993 we have generally performed consistent with those goals and in fact have out performed them in recent years.  While we expect our 2008 EPS growth will fall below our 12 to 15% targeted growth range, we continue to believe that this is still an appropriate target for the medium to long term, and despite the tougher environment our plan for 2008 anticipates that our return on equity should be consistent with our 33 to 36% target.  Given our industry leading results in recent years and the product, customer and geographic breadth of our franchise, we believe we are well positioned to execute against our growth opportunities in a manner that continues to appropriately balance our short, medium and long term business objectives and financial goals.</p>
          <p>Thank you for listening.  We are now ready to take questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question today comes from the line of David Hochstim representing Bear Stearns.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi.  I wonder could you give us some sense of how billed business growth was in January, or January to date, and could you kind of clarify or maybe speak more about what the trend was like over the month of December?  Was it appreciably worse in the last two weeks or just dropped off December first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, David, I think in December, as we indicated, it was a sudden drop, dropped about 300 basis points from a level that was running at about 13% down to about 10%.  We saw the drop over the course of December, although it was probably a little bit more noticeable towards the end of December.  In terms of, you know, what's taken place since the forecast that we made the announcement of our targets for 2008, which was about two and a half weeks ago, things are dimensionally the same as they were at the time that we shared with you our forecast for 2008.  So I would say things are dimensionally the same currently as they were at the time of our forecast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then could you just clarify what you were saying about marketing spending in '08?  You reported 2.7 billion roughly in the fourth quarter and that included, I guess, the $685 million expense.  Is there anything else in that number?  So it's little over 2 billion then if you take that out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so I think what we've said is we anticipate that marketing promotion expenditures in 2008 would be slightly below what we spent in 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Including the 685?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just to clarify, in the fourth quarter, I thought you said it was running at about 13% rate for the quarter.  Was it 13% in the first two months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think what we said, we saw a sudden drop in December of about 300 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And next we will go the line of Meredith Whitney with Oppenheimer.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, I had a couple of questions and I hope I'm not re-asking David's question, but this is going back to the last question, so, again I have two questions.  This is just to clarify something that you had said about a slow down in spending.  Is it possible that there is a numerator-denominator effect going on that changed your previous budget to the extent that the numerator is tracking along as you guys had expected in terms of the level of charge offs, but because the slowing slowed down on a pronounced basis, so our spending slowed down on a pronounced basis towards the end of the December, the net effect results in a higher charge-off rate?  Because I want to clarify in the Master Trust data, I don't see a material drop off in payment rates.  And as someone who looks at that as a leading indicator, I look at the rest of the card issuers and you also don't see a material drop off in payment rates.  So I'm just trying to connect the dots here, and then after which I'd like to, after your response I'd like to ask a follow up question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So, I don't think it's a numerator-denominator effect.  I think the denominator stays pretty much the same.  I think we saw an increase in write offs, and that's what's leading to the higher write-off rate.  Now, as it relates to the Trust compared to the owned portfolio, the accounts that are in the Trust are more seasoned.  Okay.  Last time we added accounts to the Trust was in October of '06, and the accounts we put in at that time have been in the franchise for a little while.  So most of the accounts that you have in the Trust have been with us for probably two years plus.  So the new accounts that are being added are really on the owned side, and in that you'll see the normal seasoning that takes place there that you're not seeing in the Trust.  And that's why I think you're probably seeing not the same level of change in write offs in the Trust that you're seeing in the owned portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, would that suggest, though, Dan, that the accounts originated over the last couple of years when you had the accelerated loan growth are in fact performing worse, because in the last call you said that they were performing like the others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think if you look at the, using FICO scores as an indicator, the accounts that we are acquiring in 2007 have the same quality make up as the accounts that we acquired in 2006.  So we haven't changed our criteria in terms of the customers that we bring in from a credit worthiness perspective, but and what I said last time is that we saw a deterioration really across all categories although we saw it a little bit more in those categories where people were kind of going through the normal seasoning process. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, that's just a general, as you look at the whole portfolio.  If you want to compare the Trust to the owned receivables, then what I said a minute ago comes into play, in that the folks in the Trust are probably more tenured.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I got that.  So here's my second question which is a nuance question to the extent of regulators and accountants this credit cycle versus last credit cycle.  As the accountants and regulators now require you to basically provide as charge-offs, I maybe have a quarter, it seems like a quarter horizon in terms of expected charge-offs &#x2013; do you assume and this is an industry question, that that then will be responsible for more or less predictability in earnings.  Is that a contributing factor at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have not changed our methodology for providing for credit losses any time really in the last several years.  We use historical information as the guide post in terms of establishing our reserves. Now, our policy also has a factor in there that to the extent we see a trend that's not being captured in the historical information, then we use management judgment.  And so in the fourth quarter that's exactly what we did.  We looked at the increase in delinquencies, and we looked at what that would do if we stayed simply with our models in terms of driving coverage ratios down.  We said we didn't think that made sense given that we've seen deterioration.  And so we actually put up a provision to bring our coverage ratios back up to a level that we thought were appropriate.  So what we did in the fourth quarter has nothing to do with changes from either accountants or regulators.  It's management exercising their judgment to bring coverage ratios up to an appropriate level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  All right, thanks, Dan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And next we'll go to Chris Brendler's line with Stifel Nicolaus.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good afternoon.  Can you just give us a little more color on what you're seeing in the charge card business?  I was a little bit surprised to see not necessarily the delinquency trend there, it's a 90-plus number, but maybe beneath the surface if you could talk about the credit trends in the charge card business?  Because the reserve bill was quite substantial, more than I was looking for.  I would think that portfolio would be holding up better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the charge card portfolio is holding up better than what we're seeing on the lending side.  We did see a little bit of change in the credit metrics.  And so again we exercised judgment as it relates to that portfolio to ensure that we continue to show the same kind appropriate coverage ratios just like we did on the lending side.  So we did see some movement from a credit metric perspective.  We think the impact will be less there than on the lending side, and as we go forward in terms of our ability to manage the charge card portfolio is very high because every charge that a Cardmember looks to make, we're basically making a decision about whether we let that charge go through or not.  So we think we have a very good ability to control credit on the charge card portfolio.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And along those lines and a follow up to Meredith's question on the growth in the credit card business, and the deterioration that you're seeing on the on-book recently originated portfolio, I mean, how do you -- how can you tell if your models are calibrated to sort of a higher quality customer and you're encouraging spending, how do you try to limit spending when the cycle turns, it turns out to be spending and loan growth that you didn't want?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let's take a longer view of history in terms of the decisions we've made to put customers on the books.  So I think we have been investing heavily over a multi-year period to bring in new customers.  The result of that is our cards in-force growth has been very strong over the last several years.  Our billings growth has been very successful and notably above what our competition has accomplished.  And as a result we've had the flow through of that into our loan portfolio.  The economic gain that we've realized over the last several years by outperforming the competition in terms of both billings and loan growth is substantial.  We think we continue to have good credit capabilities.  We are monitoring the behavior of our customers very closely.  And so we think those decisions are valid, and we have good underlying economics to the investment that we have made.   So we're very comfortable with what we've done to date.</p>
          <p>Another way to look at it would be what were our expectations when we decided to bring on groups of customers in either 2005, 2006, or 2007, and based on the assumptions of how many cards we would get, what their spending would be, what loan balances would be, and what write-offs would be, they're very attractive from a financial perspective.  Even if you took those same models and plugged in much higher write-off rates for 2008 and 2009, they continue to be very attractive financial decisions.  So I think the investments we've made have done very well for us, put us in a leadership position.  And now if we have a down cycle in the economy, we just have to manage our way through that very smartly in terms of who we allow to spend and at what levels we allow them to spend.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think we are very focused on certain geographies where there has been a greater deterioration in home prices.  We are also focused on certain industries that may be more inclined to have a downturn.  So we're being very targeted in terms of how we're controlling spending.  But at the same time on a broader base we're being very focused in terms of the what are the right credit criterias we should use even for the broad population.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You said that you're not really -- you didn't factor in the Fed ease or any prospective Fed eases into your model, and then you talked about how you would treat the 70 million quarterly payments.  Can you speak to how you see the Fed easing impacting the model going forward now that it's happened, and any perspective the sort of 50 that's highly expected and any perspective from here both on your P&amp;L?  And how your consumer's ability to pay in the last quarter or two may be impacted?  And also whether or not there was any pricing or interest rate changes you may put into place, you know, based on what you did in the last recession?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, obviously, to the extent the Fed eases prices, that's a clear benefit for us.  But, as you know, the credit markets are pretty volatile right now and while Fed has improved, we have also seen credit spreads above LIBOR that we pay expand, which is moderating or mitigating the benefits that we're seeing. In our business, there's something of a built-in hedge here.  To the extent credit gets worse you have easing on the Fed side and you have lower interest, which helps to mitigate what you're seeing from the slow economy in terms of credit losses.  So that's kind of a built-in hedge in the process.</p>
          <p>So as we go forward in evaluating what level we continue to invest in the business, we will certainly take into effect both the benefits that we're reaping from the lower Fed rate, what's happening on the credit side, and what knock-on effect the actions by the government will have on the broader economy in terms of their ability to pay.  So, we don't ever manage the business by looking at one line.  You really need to look across all the lines, what happening in billings, what's happening in credit, what's happening in interest rates?   And as I say, we feel we have a very strong ability for forecasting and integrating these changes in the environment into our forecasts that help us to react to all the things that are happening both in the marketplace, and within our business.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, just a follow up on that question on the funding costs.  I mean LIBOR's moved down quite a bit year to date and I was just wondering how should we think about that in terms of flowing through to the net interest margin in the first quarter?  I think it's down over 65 basis points.  And then also secondly just on international credit quality I thought that was a pretty marked improvement in the charge off rate internationally on the lending portfolio?  Just wondering if you could comment on that?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So, I think if you look at the curve we certainly are going to have a benefit, based on the curve the biggest benefit actually does flow in the first quarter.  So we're taking that into consideration in our thinking as we move through the quarter.  But we have to take into effect all the other aspects that are taking place at the same time.  And, again, we have a pretty good ability to react from an investment point of view.  But that generally takes some lead time, a couple of months to actually react.   So there is some movement in external factors that are going to flow through our P&amp;L.  We can mitigate them or adjust to them to some extent, but not necessarily fully in all cases.  But we try to do it as thoughtfully as we can.</p>
          <p>You also have to be careful though that you don't look at a couple of days or a week or two as a trend because just in the normal course of the business there's a certain amount of bounciness in daily or weekly information that we receive.  As it relates to your observation on international, you're absolutely right.  Our international credit metrics are improved from where we have been.  I think there's been an emphasis in the international markets on our lending portfolios in terms of controlling credit well.  And an emphasis on the premium sector, and I think this emphasis on the premium sector is actually paying dividends to us. And you're seeing that in the results, in particular the credit metrics that you see there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a specific region that saw more improvement than others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the spot, I don't recall specifically, but in our conversations there wasn't a cull out of a specific region that was acting differently than the others.  So I think it was pretty broad-based although I will remind you that last year we probably had higher credit losses in the UK, and possibly in Taiwan as well.  So there's an absence of those higher losses in our current numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great and then, sorry, just one last question.  In the marketing line, are the one-time sort of boost in incremental business building costs; is that in the rewards line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the line in the P&amp;L is marketing, promotions, and rewards.  So the incremental boost in the fourth quarter would be on that line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So that's in addition to the rewards liability increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  So let me just go back to a question that someone asked before.  When you think about, when I was talking about marketing and promotion being slightly below 2007 levels, you shouldn't be looking at that total line because that total line includes rewards.  It includes the 685 million that we've put up.  I'm not talking about either rewards or that addition to the reserve.  I'm talking about the marketing and promotion aspect within that line being slightly below 2007 levels.  So if I didn't answer that precisely before, I just want to clarify.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Just to get back to some of these funding issues, are you contemplating any change in the mix of how you fund the business given the current volatility in the credit markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we borrow both short-term instruments and commercial paper.  We do some unsecured lending that ranges from one year up to ten years, and sometimes a little longer.  We also fund with some deposits as well with securitizations.  So as I said before, we've kind of come through this funding, even though there's a lot of stress in the marketplace, very cleanly.  We've been able to fund at the levels that we desire to in commercial paper and short term.</p>
          <p>In the unsecured longer term, kind of ten-year money, there's money there and we've been able to fund in securitization or ABS at the levels that we want to.  Since July the unsecured one- to five-year market really hasn't been there or only been there in limited amounts.  So as we go forward if that continues to be the case we would tend to do some more funding in the unsecured ten-year tenure and possibly do higher levels of securitization than we've done in the past.  So as we think about our funding, that's how we're thinking about it as we go through 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that mix imply -- I'm just trying to think about that but does that mix imply sort of a naturally higher funding cost given the longer duration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to the extent that we put a ten-year deal on and credit spreads are higher than normal, you know, that would drive the rate up.  On the other hand, today we're probably a little bit below what historical levels are, right?  So those two might balance off.  If we borrow in the ABS market, we actually did a deal a couple weeks ago were we did a AAA piece of a securitization for 2.5 billion and we were about 45 basis points above LIBOR, which is a pretty good trade.  And the securitizations generally tend to be, again, in the three- to five-year range.  So to the extent you had to pay up on spread there it would roll off a little bit more quickly.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks I wanted to clarify two numbers quickly, then a follow up, a strategic question.  On the marketing spend I'm sorry I was unclear.  The 2.7 billion that you spent this year if you back out the 685 you're at 2 billion.  Is it slightly less than the 2 billion you expect to spend in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 2.7 billion is a quarterly number that is both marketing promotion and rewards including the 685 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So looking at the full year including the 685 you expect to spend a little bit less than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  So I'm not being successful here.  So that line has marketing and promotion, and rewards cost.  So rewards would be Membership Rewards costs.  Those are two elements on that line. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not talking about the 685. I'm talking about marketing and promotions. So marketing and promotion only, not the rewards piece; in 2008, we think we will spend slightly less than what we spent in 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I wasn't addressing the 2.7 billion in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then on the 4 to 6% EPS growth is that on the 342, on top of the 342 from continuing operations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's 339 is our continuing operations diluted EPS and the 4 to 6% on a reported basis would be off that in the 339 number.  Again, I'll remind you that in 2007, there's a number of significant benefits that we've culled out for you in the past, and if we excluded those or if we think about just our ability, our business model, we would think with the elements that we've laid out of 8 to 10% billed business growth, 1.5 to 1.3 write-off rates our business model has the flexibility to generate between 10 and 12% EPS growth.  However, because of the significant items, gain items that we had in 2007, that would convert into a reported growth rate of between 4 and 6% off of the 339.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I got that.  And then on the international business and the long term growth, I guess of the international business your cards outstanding were only up 3% year-over-year.    During the course of the year, I don't recall, is there a reason why the card growth is only 3% internationally?  It would seem that you should have much higher opportunities to grow outside the U.S. but maybe just with the brand name being American Express or you don't have the same type of growth opportunities that a MasterCard or a Visa may have. Otherwise we'd be seeing faster growth rates of the cards and I think long term of the billed business and profits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so I think the 3% is an average for the year.  I think we have been improving as we go through the year.  I think it's a reflection of what I spoke to before.  I think we have been very careful in terms of our lending business in terms of how we grow that and there has been more of a focus on the premium market and so the quality of the cards we've been bringing in we think is very good.  I think that's reflective of what you'll see in terms of the fees per card, which have been improving so I think it's a reflection of our focus on the premium sector, why the card growth rate is not higher internationally.</p>

          <p>Good evening, thanks for taking my question.  Regarding small business, I think in the past it's been referred to kind of as an early indicator of overall credit tends in the economy.  Can you talk a little bit more about small business credit metrics that you're seeing?  The spend looked pretty strong, maybe expectations for small business spend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In prior slowdowns we have seen that small business was kind of a leading indicator.  However, in 2007, that was not the case.  So this is different than the slow down that we saw in 2001.  That was led by business.  There was the 9/11 event had a dramatic impact on travel in particular.  Now this is a different type of recession.  It was started by housing, and subprime mortgages.  And the way it's rolled out to us we had small business was not a leading indicator.  And as we've said we saw a sudden drop in December in the U.S. of both consumer and small business so small business behaved very similar to what we saw in the consumer segment in the month of December.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  One follow-up question regarding tax rate.  I guess it was 27% for the year in '07 about 30% in '06.  Do you see it holding stable about where it is today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we've said is we would normally expect our tax rate to be around 30 or 31%.  This year, there were a number of tax benefits that we realized in the earlier quarters.  We broke those out separately so that you could see them.  So this year in the second quarter, we had a gain of 65 million related to an IRS settlement and we also had a tax benefit in the third quarter of about 75 million.  So against that we did some investment spending in the second quarter but those two large benefits that were recorded in the second and third quarter is what really took us down below that 30 or 31% that's the norm in 2007.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, so we saw the normal 300 basis point drop or three basis point drop from the third quarter to the fourth quarter which is seasonal.  We did see a slight drop year-over-year of one basis point from last year to this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>And separately, you were talking earlier about the differences between your Trust and your owned portfolios indicating the Trust was a little more seasoned.  The Trust also has a relatively high proportion in some of those high risk HPA markets like California and Florida I think 17 and 9% respectively can you give us some view of what the owned portfolio looks like relative to geographic exposure?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's something that we haven't historically disclosed.  I don't honestly know those numbers off the top of my head.  I think the other thing as relates to the Trust is those write-off rates are not shown net of recoveries.  As we've indicated, you know, another thing that we've seen is a little bit of slow down in pay down.  You see that coming through the owned portfolio but you wouldn't see it in the Trust data.  So that's another thing to think about when you compare the two.</p>

          <p>So that's something we'll think about in the terms of Financial Community Meeting whether that's a disclosure we might be able to make.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just finally, I know there's been a couple of questions about where your expense levers are in that marketing promotion and reward line. I understand that you don't disclose -- you don't break that out for competitive reasons, but yet how are we to assess how effective you've been at managing that expense when in a given quarter maybe the marketing and promotion is down but rewards are up and they offset.  Is there a way you're gong to give us some visibility around your ability to manage expenses during this tougher time?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>I guess I'll go back to the first quarter of 2007.  We've said we have the ability to be pretty surgical in terms of where we have to adjust our investment spending so that whatever changes we make minimize the impact on our metric and our future growth.  I think in the first quarter we dropped marketing expenses pretty dramatically and as you saw in the second, third, and fourth quarter, that we really didn't see a drop off in metrics so we think we have very good capabilities in terms of where we need to make adjustments either reducing or increasing or even shifting so we can possibly be shifting spending, investment spending within the U.S. consumer business to markets that are not seeing the deterioration of housing or to our B2B businesses where we haven't seen an impact yet, or to the international markets.  So I think we have some pretty good tools here.  I think we demonstrated that in the first quarter of last year.  You know, if there's in fact a decline and a slowdown in the economy in '08, we'll utilize those skills again.</p>
          <p>Now when we have a drop in marketing, it doesn't necessarily mean we have an increase in our rewards cost.  Our rewards cost should generally be driven by volumes and be increasing at the same rate as our business is increasing.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Great. And then just one last one before I let you go.  In your response to one of your earlier questions, I think you used the word recession in the present tense.  Are you saying that we are in a recession right now and even if you're not what do you think unemployment rate goes through by the end of '08?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I don't want to try to be an economist because I'm not and I'm not intending to make any statement about whether we're in a recession or not in a rescission or forecast whether we will be in the future.  I think we set out the guidance that we did, which we said was basically based on what we saw in December and a modest, deterioration in the economy, and that's really the basis for our forecast.  I'm not attempting to make any statements about the economic condition today or what it might be over the course of 2008.</p>

          <p>So, could I just &#x2013; Tom, can I just -- let me just make a few closing comments before we leave.  So before I sign off, I'd like to say, overall 2007 was another year of strong business and financial results.  The benefits of our multi-year investment strategy continued to produce business metrics that are in the top tier of the industry.</p>
          <p>It's clear that the economic environment this year will be more difficult. Fortunately we have experience managing through different aspects of the business cycle and we're facing this environment from a much stronger competitive position than in the past.  As we did in 2002, our focus will be on working to prudently enhance our competitive position.  This will entail a continued tight rein on our operating expenses, close management of credit risk and careful management of our investment activities.</p>
          <p>While we plan to invest somewhat less in our marketing and promotion activities in 2008 than in 2007, we still plan to spend at a healthy level.  This level of spending should help us to position us to emerge from a downturn in a strong competitive position.  It provides flexibility to react to further changes in the economic environment and to capitalize on opportunities in selected consumer segments among small business, in international markets and in the B2B sector.</p>
          <p>Thanks for joining us.  I look forward to speaking to you again at the Financial Community Meeting next week.</p>
