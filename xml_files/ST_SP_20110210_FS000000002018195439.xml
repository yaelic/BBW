          <p>Good morning. A warm welcome to all investors and analysts. You are listening to SingTel's Earnings Conference Call for the Quarter Ended 31st December, 2010.</p>
          <p>My name is Yang Fong, and let me introduce panel members on the call; Ms. Chua Sock Koong, Group CEO; Mr. Allen Lew, CEO Singapore; Mr. Paul O'Sullivan, CEO, Optus; Mr. Hui Weng Cheong, CEO International; Ms. Jeann Low, Group CFO. They are also assisted by other members of the management team from Australia and Singapore.</p>
          <p>Before we start taking questions, I would like to invite Sock Koong to share some highlights from this set of results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Yang Fong. And thank you for joining us today for SingTel's results for the quarter and nine months ended 31st December, 2010.</p>
          <p>Let me just give you some quick highlights for the Group performance. Group revenues were up 6%. Both Singapore and Australia operations continued their revenue momentum, and we were also helped by the stronger Australian dollar during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Net profit was stable at S$998 million. Underlying net profit was actually down 2%, and that reflects lower earnings on the associates. If we exclude the impacts of Bharti Africa, the Group's underlying net profit would have been stable.</p>
          <p>Singapore revenues were up 7% on continued growth in mobile and EBITDA grew during the quarter, although at a slower pace compared to the top line growth, and that's due to the increase in mio TV content cost, acquisition of job credit that was offered by the Singapore government.</p>
          <p>In Australia, Optus revenue grew 4%, and that's also been driven by growth in mobile. EBITDA was up 5%. We &#x2013; and we did achieve higher EBITDA across all three business segments. And the Group and its associates continue to register strong customer growth. We now have 383 million mobile customers.</p>
          <p>Earnings from the regional mobile associates, as I mentioned, declined 13%, and that's due to the impact of Bharti Africa and fair value losses on foreign currency denominated liabilities compared to gains that we've recorded last year. If we exclude impact of Bharti Africa, earnings from the regional mobile associates would have declined 7%.</p>
          <p>Overseas operations now contribute 74% of proportionate EBITDA with Optus contributing 32% and the regional mobile associates contributing 41%. Our VC fund, our corporate VC fund, Innov8, which was set up in September last year made its first investments, and we expect Innov8 to help the Group stay relevant to customers' needs by gaining earlier sense to new technological development and application.</p>
          <p>Some of the key highlights for our business this year and for this quarter. mio TV in Singapore crossed the quarter million mark. And that on the back of the Family Channel Pack launch, which provide 28 channels across different genres as part of the basic mio TV service for new customers. We also launched De!ite, an interactive e-magazine app for tablet, which has been rated one of the top app in Singapore.</p>
          <p>And in Australia, Optus launch updated digital services for consumers, including a TV and video application that streams live video of the Australian Open Tennis. Optus also partnered with two local to offer online advertising and business listing services for SMBs.</p>
          <p>And amongst associates, Bharti achieved a key milestone with the successful launch of its new Airtel brand identity in 19 countries across South Asia and Africa. And that will allow Bharti to project a similar and unified identity to customers across borders.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me hand you then over to Yang Fong for the Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Sachin, DBS, Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the call. I have a few questions actually, first could you give some color on the non-iPhones, especially that you're promoting the Sony, Samsung phones? What I am hearing is that iPhone 4 is still in demand and people are not really going for the non-iPhones?</p>
          <p>Second question is on the roaming contribution, I just want to check, is it because of business related or because of tourism related? Is it fair to link it to the IR resort? And related question is, do most of the tourists automatically roam to SingTel network when they arrive in Singapore or how actually &#x2013; how do they roam actually when they &#x2013; or it depend on the country of origin?</p>
          <p>And my third question is on Australia, I heard about some network problems at the Vodafone Hutch, which is known as VHA, do you think that business at VHA may benefit you further?</p>
          <p>And my last question is on the mio TV. We saw that mio TV subscriber addition of 19k, it was slightly below your target of at least 20k. So, and the revenue was also lower sequentially, is it due to promotional packages or is it &#x2013; which you are offering now or, and should we expect a pick-up in the revenue soon? Yeah, these are all the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me answer the first, second and fourth question, and then I'll hand over to Paul <mark type="inaudible" /> question &#x2013; answering your questions. Firstly on non-iPhone 3 that we don't disclose what percentage of our smartphones, iPhones versus non-iPhone, I think we have a good mix of different operating systems in terms of the smartphones used by our customers.</p>
          <p>Today, we are seeing a more than 80% of our recontract and new ads being on smartphones, and they are good mix in addition to iPhones or BlackBerry operating systems, Android operating systems and now Microsoft Windows 7 operating systems. I think we are seeing a very good pick-up of customers. Those who want open systems and access to open applications and open content, picking on the Android and the Microsoft operating systems. So I think from that perspective, we are encouraged as a network operator to see the participation of smartphones increasing, and now exceeding 50% of our postpaid base.</p>
          <p>In terms of roaming, the bulk of our roaming increases primarily due to business reasons, Singapore being a regional center, we have a large number of business customers that because of the pick-up in economic activity in the different parts of Asia, particularly in China and in India and Indonesia, are traveling a lot more and that's pushed up a lot of our roaming calls.</p>
          <p>When customers from other network come into Singapore, there are some networks where we have preferred roaming arrangements, and these customers who obviously roam out to our networks; for the other customers, it depends on when they switch on their phones, which frequency they logged off in their home country, who has got the stronger technology, airport or the seaport, and that's an area where we do have our antenna in this major locations to make sure that we get significant share of this incoming roamers to Singapore.</p>
          <p>Finally, I think with regard to mio TV, mio TV takeaway is 19,000. I think in the month of &#x2013; in the quarter Q3 we have December, which is a big traveling season, a holiday season for Singaporeans, so typically during that time the pick-up rate of Pay TV services would decline seasonally. Compared to last year, in fact primarily just last year we had some early-bird offers from BPL. The reason why the revenue is valid in the previous quarter is primarily because previous quarter we had World Cup and World Cup had quite a significant revenue, so I think I hope that answers your three questions for Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will hand over to Paul to answer the Australian question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Sachin, and thanks Allen. Just speaking up on that, look it's been quite widely publicized within Australia that there is a high level of dissatisfaction with BHA customers and their current network provider. I'll just contrast the way we handle our network over the last few years and the view we've taken of it. Obviously mobile is very important to us as our largest business. So we've invested very heavily in both capacity, quality and coverage over that period.</p>
          <p>We've done a very significant increase in metro sites over the last few years, and that's the first time we've built metro in over a decade. But that was recognized in the need to carry extra capacity for wireless broadband. Over the last 12 months we've acquired extra spectrum, both from Qualcomm and from regional apparatus licenses. We've effectively doubled our spectrum holdings in the major capital cities.</p>
          <p>We've built our network guys from 96% to 97% of the population on footprint. And we've done a major upgrade of all our backhaul transmission, with the majority of sites that we have on net now on five to 61. All of that has allowed us to deliver a strong level of quality and to manage a very good experience for customers. And in fact we also provide service qualification for all of our wireless broadband customers right down to store level, whereby we check a customer's address in some detail before we deliver the product. I would say that's a very strong contrast in terms of investment approach and in terms of managing the customer experience compared to BHA.</p>
          <p>I think the strength of our numbers on postpaid this quarter was 155,000 postpaid net adds, is a strong then say 150,000 I should say, is a very strong demonstration of we able to capitalize on the opportunity right now. That's one of our highest postpaid net add quarters, if you look back over the last two to three years.</p>
          <p>I'll leave at that, Sachin, unless you got any follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Richard Eary, UBS, Australia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. Just a couple of questions with regard to just to Optus. Obviously that &#x2013; despite obviously the postpaid growth, we've seen a slowdown now on service revenues to obviously we've actually have a dip quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. And I think if you actually look at the voice revenues, obviously there's been more pressure on that if you back out the data numbers. So just give us some ideas in terms of what was the &#x2013; how you expect to basically revitalize that revenue growth or can we expect that to continue to sort of soften?</p>
          <p>The other part is obviously that with the softening in the revenue line, I would have thought we would have probably seen maybe a stabilization in the margins, but clearly the margins now on the mobile space below 24% of the lowest that there has been in Optus. So just some ideas in terms of whether that's actually going to rebound or not?</p>
          <p>The third one just on MVNO strategy. Clearly there is obviously a lot of talk in the market, particularly about the launch of <mark type="inaudible" /> and we understand that those sub numbers are pretty good. So just an understanding of what Optus' MVNO strategy is, and just a feel in terms of margins on MVNO versus the core business. And lastly, Paul, maybe just an update in terms of your thoughts on NBN.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, lot of ground to cover there, Richard, but lots of good questions. I think your first question was relating really to initially I think prepaid, but then generally attempted to where we saw the revenue at the time. Naturally we don't give forecast or qualify guidance in terms of revenues, but what I would ask is that Murray might talk briefly around what we saw as the key drivers of our prepaid performance in the quarter, and also probably point to some of the ARPU trends we are seeing in our postpaid.</p>
          <p>And second one, in terms of stabilization on margins, I will let Murray continue on that, but I will just remind you that our margin performance is very heavily driven by our level of acquisition in postpaid. And then we have had a very, very strong quarter on that. And the third thing is MVNO. I will take that up, and fourthly I'll come back as well on the NBN.</p>
          <p>Murray, would you like to talk a little bit about some of the revenue trends and also how we see &#x2013; sorry, about the margins and what they reflect in this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, Paul. Richard, in relation to your question around service revenue growth, service revenue growth for the quarter at 7% is a reflection gain of continuing strong customer growth, particularly in relation to postpaid, and you continue to see we draw a higher value postpaid customers, because the ARPU postpaid after excluding while the broadband continues to grow at around 2%.</p>
          <p>In relation to the softening at full-year, what we are seeing in relation to prepaid, we would context that in the marketplace generally where you are seeing the leaders in the market being ourselves and Vodafone, both reporting negative net adds in that quarter as a consequence of the dynamics in that marketplace. Also in this particular quarter we've been impacted by international calling plan, international calls for less rate plan, which has a very high churn level, because these are customers that are using that particular rate plan, similar they use a fixed calling card they are using the included value and not recharging, and so under our established churn policy, we are now trying to see significant levels of disconnects for those customers, which is a result of in the overall net add decline as a consequence of those disconnects.</p>
          <p>Also those customers will be not recharging. That has had an adverse impact in relation to our overall prepaid ARPU. So really that is a predominant issue or the reason for you're seeing some of the softening in relation to our overall service revenue growth.</p>
          <p>The question on margins, if you look at our overall margin in mobile, as you say they are at the 24%</p>
          <p>mark, but we context that again as well in relation to the subscriber acquisition cost per unit sec is up quarter-on-quarter end, 19%. This is a reflection of the fact this is the first quarter where we've had full impact of iPhone 4, so we've had higher acquisition and retention activities during the quarter. And particularly we've had a higher mix of smartphones in the quarter, which has driven the units back up.</p>
          <p>Again, as we said previously, we continue to price our plans in the marketplace, so that we drive a positive in TV over the contract term of the customer, and so we do &#x2013; we expect those customers to continue to drive incremental EBITDA for us, and as we've clearly demonstrated and clearly in this quarter's results we've been able to grow our mobile EBITDA in absolute terms in this quarter 4% but in prior quarters one level higher than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Murray. And, Richard, maybe if I were to summarize how we view the trends in the mobile industry right now, I think you've got two very different trends. You've got a lot of price compression and aggression coming through in voice. <mark type="inaudible" /> done a major set of price reductions over the last quarter. Vodafone have launched their Infinity plans. Despite that I think what we are seeing is a bit of a schism in the market at the moment, in reference to Sachin's question. There's definitely a perception I think that Optus and Telstra are operating more on the quality network end, and that there is a difference in what you buy between that and Vodafone.</p>
          <p>But we certainly see that price compression and aggression very visible in the market, and as Murray has said, our strategy is all around giving people reasons to trade upfront ARPU that we think is positive and strong, and we are not &#x2013; we don't see ourselves at this stage as reacting by trying to get them dirty in terms of price.</p>
          <p>In terms of the second trend we see in the market is very much around content and app. That's a very early trend but over the next two to three years, we do expect that a greater percentage of revenues in the industry are coming from the delivery of content and apps over the networks.</p>
          <p>To pick up your third question, which was around MVNO, we do MVNOs because they are positive for us in a profitability sense and they are very much enhancing in terms of our performance. The key for that balanced growth of an MVNO is that we do not have the customer acquisition or customer management cost to look after. In the case of <mark type="inaudible" /> the advertising, the billing, the customer management is all looked after by them, and that's obviously something that's quite attractive to us compared to having to run the retail side of the business.</p>
          <p>We don't disclose individual wholesale margins, but it is core to our strategy also being able to target at different segments of customers by using <mark type="inaudible" /> A lot of their service is built around an online model. And at this stage in the market they provide a level of service that people probably would want more human interaction on if they were with Optus.</p>
          <p>If you look at our MD&amp;A on page 42, what you can see is that the percentage of customers coming through wholesale hasn't really changed in terms of its trend line over the last year. It's gone from 8% to 9% to 10% over the last few quarters. So it's very much a smaller part of our mix but an important part of our mix and does make a good contribution.</p>
          <p>On the NBN overall, a key development in the last quarter was the pass through the federal parliament of the competition safeguard bill, which we saw as a very welcome development. It's now on the ACCC and the regulator with the sort of power that we think would bring about a much better industry structure, and allow much more level of playing field. We are very positive about our reform. We think it's an important step forward.</p>
          <p>On the NBN itself, the legislation for that is now in front of parliament. We think again that the developments associated with that are positive for what we would call for very publicly is that the details of the arrangements that have been reached between Telstra and the federal government and NBN Co. are fully disclosed and made public. So that we can make sure that this major investment of public fund around the NBN is associated with delivering a proper level playing field market.</p>
          <p>We would not want to see those funds expended then return to sort of disadvantages and limitation that competition have had over the years of Telstra owning the fixed line market, that clearly would not be in a national interest.</p>
          <p>So you will hear us call very publicly for that level of disclosure. Aside of that we remain positive of the opportunity this will represent for us as the NBN rolls out, as markets become more available to us of, Optus will absolutely take advantage of that opportunity and be a very strong player in acquiring revenues by the NBN.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I always like to contrast our style with that of a former CEO in the sector who likes to have all his negotiations on the front page of the paper. So we do ours very much out of sight and in private. We are in ongoing discussion with the NBN on many issues. I think, I've said in previous calls like this that, so if the NBN did want to talk to us about the migration power of our HSC on to the NBN, we are open to that, but at this stage I've nothing substantive of materials to disclose, but yes, we have a very positive and fruitful dialogue on many issues going with the NBN.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I have a couple of questions. Firstly, I was hoping to get an update on AIS and the claim that Todd had made, it seems like a pretty big number. Just wondering if you could us a little bit of background and just how you expect that to play out?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just wondering if there is any updates at all on the Telkomsel towers deal, haven't heard anything on that?</p>
          <p>And just lastly, Paul, for you in Australia, you resigned the deal with Foxtel and we have seen those pay-TV subscribers of yours declining for the last few years. Are we to take that the terms of the deal are positive enough that you are going to start to grow your pay TV presence aggressively in Australia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Hui. On the AIS issue, <mark type="inaudible" /> has released announcement to <mark type="inaudible" /> like demanding payment of the additional revenue share for the Amendment 6 and Amendment 7. AIS <mark type="inaudible" /> reasons and is around I think for us to view that we do not see any reason for having to pay that. The contract Amendment 6 and 7 has been done on both DoT and AIS contractually and from AIS standpoint is binding by the contract that has already been entered between both parties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So does that mean that you expect the client to be trying out, what do you think they will have to go into negotiations and have it arbitrage it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the contract between AIS and DoT, any disputes will have to follow the legal <mark type="inaudible" /> and the first step will be through arbitration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much. Just a few questions, firstly, Paul, I guess it's a good results given Telstra has spent close to half a billion dollars, and doesn't look like &#x2013; doesn't sound like they are looking to slow down either. So any thoughts on if the market is likely to pay out and what if Optus looking to do a different play to differentiate, anything on the cost would be good as well. I don't see much of a reduction in the cost line for awhile now?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I guess, for management, if you look at the associates results, apart from AIS, trainings have gone backwards so it's a pretty much every other business for the past three months and for the past nine months as well. I understand that the FX and the acquisition et cetera but the underlying trends have been &#x2013; they had been pretty challenging as well. So, the question I guess is at the current run rate and the outlook, does it change your view on how you are thinking about this investment? And I guess the last question, if free cash flow is still very, very strong, any thoughts of moving to potentially a quarterly dividend? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Hi, Sachin, it's Paul here. Actually we did <mark type="inaudible" /> the couple of questions from the last caller as well, which we might be able to kick-off on the Foxtel question that we were asked, I'll let Mike answer that. And then I will come back to Sachin's question on what we see as the developments in the market?</p>

          <p>So I will jump in Sachin, Michael Smith here. Alex did ask a question in relation to Foxtel deal and review getting of that. The negotiations with Foxtel did bring that business back to a viable business source. I think previously we talked about that not be viable, where customers are interested in bringing on pay TV business, we will work to drive that both on our cable network and moving forward in off-net areas. But most importantly for us, TV remains part of an integrated strategy, so we remain focused on driving the core on that broadband business as well as mobile <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And back to Sachin's question on how we see things off? Yeah, I think absolutely, I think that today we have seen an important set of results from our major competitor but I think this thing is yet to play out. We focus very much on sustainable ongoing growth over the last four years. We've demonstrated ongoing revenue and profit growth over 16 consecutive quarters. Yes, our major competitor has reacted to the market share over a considerable period with a significant sacrifice of profit.</p>
          <p>I think the key question is for everybody, how do you drive sustainable growth in both subscriber and corporate? And in some ways, we see there are current profit sacrifice as a very extreme reaction to the success of our strategy over the last few years. We do of course take them very seriously, so how do we see the market going forward. Well, first of all we are very focused on making sure we continue to drive sustainable growth in mobiles. We do believe very strongly that more and more smartphones will be sold into the markets, customers will be increasingly focused on applications and content and on the ability to converge those across fixed and mobile and numerous devices. And obviously our existing work in operating our own cable infrastructure has set us up well to work our convergence in an NBN type of world.</p>
          <p>But moving forward, Optus will continue its strategy, which is never to look to be the cheapest on price but to be the one that if you prepare to make a significant commitment in ARPU gives you the best value, and that will be continuing a core part of our strategy. On the cost side, I would argue, Sachin, that actually you can see quite a few metrics that show us working to make sure cost to manage correctly. For example, nearly 38% of our customers across our mass market divisions are now on paperless electronic billing, and that's been a significant change over the last 18 months.</p>
          <p>We have been able to drive significant savings inside the organization in a number of areas through our process redesign, although that's actually been focused on driving up customer experience as much as it delivered benefit in terms of cost.</p>
          <p>I think if you look at page 49 of the MD&amp;A what you will see is that actually aside of selling and admin, that most of our costs are very well contained, and in fact for the nine months year-to-date, our total costs are only up 2.7%, which is I think quite a respectable number considering that includes a selling and admin costs overall. But I don't deny, moving forward we see that continues to be a very important area. And focusing on getting more and more customers online, more and more processes that are automated and finding ways in which to take cost out of our business will remain important.</p>
          <p>So with that I'll pass over for your other question which I think related to our &#x2013; eventually on Sachin's questions. Okay, we now pass back to the operator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sachin this is Sock Koong here. On your questions on the investments and associates, may be I should just take the opportunity to talk through what our investment strategy is. And if you &#x2013; we're a long-term strategic investors and you'll see us working through the partners to create value and we're always picking the long-term view of the businesses that we invested in. And if you look at our track record I'd like to &#x2013; you can see that we have consistently delivered value.</p>
          <p>Of course, we operate in a different market, the markets will go through stages where you see an increased level of competitive intensity. And as a long-term player you work through and you want to end up coming  as business, as you go through this competitive intensity, competitive period during the market. So a good example is, if you look at Bharti in India, Bharti went through the price war in India. And if you look at India's performance in this quarter, EBITDA is actually up 7%. I know the numbers have been distorted by the <mark type="inaudible" /> launch cost. And it looks like the numbers have gone backwards but if you look at annualized earnings, EBITDA in India has actually gone up by 7%. And if you look at the EBITDA margin in India despite the price competition, Bharti has actually helped the EBITDA margin on its mobile business very steady, we saw declines overall of only about 1% despite the price competition.</p>
          <p>And if you look at Bharti Africa, which of course is operations that everybody is watching very closely. I think in the quarter where Bharti had moved in that management, we've already seen early signs, very positive. Bharti had picked up 1% revenue market share in Africa as that after periods where that under it's previous owners they were losing 7% to 8% revenue market share. So we're actually seeing improvement in the revenue market share, we're seeing improvement in the operating profit, it went from a loss to a profit position in this quarter. So I think the early signs are good. And what they have been able to do to accumulate traffic, I think on the cost management that will take a bit more time. But they have already put in place the various contracts for outsourcing whether it's IT, with IBM, with the shared services outsourcing and a network, so I think we would see periods of competitive intensity in the different markets.</p>
          <p>I think what differentiate the operators is a <mark type="inaudible" /> to go through this competitive period and be able to deliver returns on a sustainable basis. So they are not put in chart. We haven't changed our views on the investment in the emerging markets. I think on the other question on the cash flows, we have a very clean set, the group has being able to deliver very strong free cash flows across all three different parts of our business, and they don't &#x2013; and we've actually been steady, been quite diligent in reviewing how to handle our dividend.</p>
          <p>So you have seen that we've actually moved from a yearly dividend to semi-annual dividend, and whether we'll stick on a quarterly dividend, I think is something that we will review, but I think we are just moved to half-yearly dividend with actually add the dividend payout ratios this year. So one thing at a time, Sachin. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks a lot for the opportunity. I had actually three questions. The first was with regard to Pakistan, we see that there are some debt restructuring initiatives going on there, and you've also mentioned that there are certain debts that are guaranteed by SingTel. If you could give us some indications on what kind of numbers are involved here, both from the total entity perspective as well as from SingTel perspective, that would be great?</p>
          <p>Second, I also wanted to get your sense of the latest competitive dynamics in the Indonesian market, obviously the fourth quarter was a challenging quarter for telecom sales, but do you have any reasons to believe that things are stabilizing, or do you think that this market could go through a tough patch for a reasonably longer period of time?</p>
          <p>And then the third question I had was on Singapore that your margins have obviously improved quite a bit on a sequential basis and that too presumably in a quarter when subscriber acquisition costs are high. Is it right to assume that some of the cost pick up that we have seen in that market because of your longer term strategic initiatives by kind of speaking out and probably the margins therefore they might be bottoming out. Any thoughts on that could be appreciative too? Thanks.</p>

          <p>This is Jeann. I will take the question on the <mark type="inaudible" /> facility. We have disclosed that in our MD&amp;A &#x2013; in the page 60 of our MD&amp;A, but in short the outstanding principal under the loan facilities that are the subject of restructuring discussion is roughly around, is about 100 &#x2013; US$750 million and US$90 million of that US$754 million is in fact guaranteed by SingTel, and the balance in US$512 million will be guaranteed by the other shareholder groups &#x2013; by our partner.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the competitive situation in telecom sales. Yes, 2010 has been a very tough market for all the three operators. The market face heightened competition from two price war. We see in the early part of the year this SMS price war, that is following second half, basically the third &#x2013; at the end of the third quarter we have voice price war. <mark type="inaudible" /> we've seen 5 rupee &#x2013; rupya per minute followed by later on nearly end of the fourth quarter, zero rupya for the first 30 seconds. Both our second and third quarter with many new aggressive promotions to maintain the market share. As a result of this, operating revenue was down by 4%.</p>
          <p>The reduction in the tariff has not increased the tariff &#x2013; have all increased the operating minutes. The operating minutes is not sufficient to offset the reduction in the tariff rate. Moving forward in the first quarter this year, we continue to see quite aggressive pricing in the market. So we expect that this quarter the competitive situation will be fixed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to your question regarding our Q3 margins and whether our cost for multimedia services has picked up? I think it's important to note that Q3 we saw a big jump in our content cost, primarily because of mio TV and accounting for the spot packages. We also saw some increasing cost because of installation of our mio TV and also a little bit of fiber as well. And there was some increase in it to support some of this multimedia services. Going ahead in sequential quarters we will continue to have this same level of mio TV content cost, but that will continue to increase would be cost to support our multimedia businesses in the homes like fiber and some of the other initiatives that we have.</p>
          <p>We are going to go ahead and manage that cost within the envelope of revenue that we get from these respective services. So I can't say too much more about whether it's peak or not, we do see a major initiative of ours is to push aggressively to become a multimedia service provider in the home. Obviously it is very important for us and our ability to establish our presence there. So we will continue to invest in this initiative. And we will make sure that we do in line to start revenues that we get from this kind of service.</p>

          <p>Yes, also a question on the power business in Indonesia, although there is not much development as for the last quarter, <mark type="inaudible" /> in discussion with SingTel and Telkomsel, and the discussion is still ongoing. As shareholders of Telkomsel, both have common central conduct, regulatory views of their concerned business operations in future direction, both were <mark type="inaudible" /> disruption to telecom's operations, so discussion on the total business is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Thank you, ma'am. Kelvin Goh, CIMB. Malaysia.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the opportunity. I have three questions, first one is on the lower acquisition cost in Singapore. You did mention that you have optimized your cost out there. I am wondering also if the higher margin was also attributed to the base effect where you introduced your iPhone 4 in the previous quarter. And if you can also give us some color into what actually you did to optimize your cost.</p>
          <p>Second question is on roaming, you said that ARPUs increased because of roaming, I'm wondering how much of that &#x2013; how much the increase was in in the dollar terms in terms of ARPUs? And relating to that if you can give us an update on the cut in roaming charges between Singapore and Malaysia. And lastly is that, if you can just run us through your thoughts on the NGNBN. And how that has &#x2013; if that has affected or changed the dynamics of competition on a fixed broadband type? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll answer your three questions; with regard to a lower acquisition cost, I think this is something that we &#x2013; acquisition cost is something that we adjust from time to time depending on our level of competitive activity. I think for us in the mobile space, in particular, which I think is what you are referring to, we see emergence of smartphones as very important. It is important for us to put these devices into the hands of our customers because we have not only upsell them the data plan, but more importantly we can upsell the whole suite of lifestyle applications and concept to them as well. So we will continue to acquire these customers, and depending on the level of competitive activity we will adjust.</p>
          <p>So I think quality happened to be one we were still able to achieve a significant number of net adds. You can see our net adds for the quarter was 41,000 postpaid compared to our competitors had announced these results on last week, was significantly less than that. So I think this is ability of SingTel to do a couple of things. I can't share the details because of the competitive intensity in this market.</p>
          <p>Number two, in terms of roaming, I think roaming has increased primarily from the business segment because of increased travel activity due to the growth in the economy surrounding us. In terms of the dollar increase, we can't disclose that, we don't separate that information out right now. So I think unfortunately I can't share too much color on that.</p>
          <p>In terms of the cut in roaming charges with Malaysia, this is something that has been announced by the ministers of Singapore and on Malaysia in terms of the intention to do that. I think now the operators will have to go into a discussion to see what is feasible and what can be done and what is the impact of some of these. So I think right now the policy statement has been made. I think the operators are in discussions and if there are any developments, I am sure we'll update all of you.</p>
          <p>Finally, on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Before I just, can I check what the &#x2013; you traffic flow is like between Singapore and Malaysia in terms of roaming, are you in terms of net traffic between the two countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't share the details of that at the moment. I think when we finally do reach some kind of conclusion with the Malaysian operators, I think when we make that announcements, we'd try and disclose a bit more details with regard to the traffic flow, regard to the impact to us. Obviously, there will be impact in order to negative or positive depends on how low you have to cut the roaming rates to in level of price sensitivity.</p>
          <p>With regard to your third question on NGNBN, I think its early days on NGNBN. I think at the end of December it's about 60% on homes and businesses that have been passed. We see different operators, there are about three or four different RSPs out there and all having different offers. I think its important that at this stage we are out there, we have a differentiated offer for anybody because we are the only service provider that bundles an application or a content with broadband internet access, and that has allowed us to get the higher ARPU customers on to our fiber network. I don't think official details on market share have been released yet but I think we are reasonably positive that we are getting, we are still the largest provider of fiber services.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of the impact on our business segment, it's actually extremely neutral, we don't see significant pick up with our fiber amongst the small and medium enterprises, and I think even though they do pick up fiber, we have the lion's share of the market. So I think in early days but I think we're well prepared to see what happens and we will defend and attack, use opportunity to attack our competitor if necessary.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you for the call. Several questions from me. Firstly, can you talk about your M&amp;A outlook in the emerging markets, is there any geographic focus now for SingTel? I noticed in the press release that Bharti is talking about market consolidation?</p>
          <p>Secondly, domestic EBITDA margins did see a material recovery quarter-on-quarter, I was wondering what's your thoughts are on the key drivers behind this, and if it can be improved further in the subsequent quarters. I understand on the previous question that costs may have stabilized the mio TV, but are there other cost items that should be looking out for?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, I am wondering where we are in NGNBN rule up based on your participation in OpenNet. Are you confident in meeting the government targets and have you seen any acceleration on in competition in this side?</p>
          <p>Last question I had is with regard to your emerging market strategy. Now some of these markets maybe not be undergoing cyclicality of volatility, but rather structural changes, would you consider monetizing on some of these investments and looking out for new ones in other markets <mark type="inaudible" />? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe let me talk through M&amp;A opportunities and your last comment on whether we monetize this investment that would, whether we are going to sell this investment in short. I think we, as a SingTel I just mentioned earlier in the call, we are long-term strategic investors, we look to how we can grow businesses with our local partners in each markets. So we've continued to look for investment opportunities but we're always very disciplined in &#x2013; we've always been very disciplined. We will only make an investment if it's going to be value accretive. And of course if you look across the region, you've seen that valuation in the lot of emerging markets had probably gone up so unless you can find an investment that we think will be value accretive.</p>
          <p>We don't have to force ourselves to make an investment. I think the other area that we continue to look for group opportunities is of course growing our core business in Singapore, Australia and in the existing investments that we already made. It makes sense for us to make an acquisition to increase our &#x2013; to improve our market effect to different product or customer segment or allowed us to bulk up the business in respective markets, we'll be prepared to look at them, again of course, if it makes sense for us to do so. I mean the last investment that we made of SCS to back up our IT business in Singapore is a good example of another kind of investments that we're prepared to look at.</p>
          <p>Looking at monetizing our assets across the group, I think that is something that we as a disciplined investor do look at. And certainly where we think that the valuation is very compelling, our strategic objectives are not compromised, we're prepared to look at that but adding in the end is all around driving the shareholders value. Let me pass on to Kung Yang to talk about EBITDA in Singapore.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yes, EBITDA growth in Singapore on a sequential basis was largely result of the strong revenue growth that we saw that might move out business, and also coupled with the lower acquisition cost that we talked about earlier, maybe optimized level of subsidies and looking at the different customer segments.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there was a question, this is Jeann. I think there was a question on the OpenNet. OpenNet actually had released some news on February 15th &#x2013; on February 1 that it had reached, as of December 30th, December 31st it had already reached 50%. And that it is on track to complete the rollout where it is opposed to the next months it is 95% by the middle of 2012.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of pickup level, I think it's probably still very early, I think we're seeing certainly in the consumer segment we're seeing some initial early adopters taking it up, especially taking it up with some of applications that we combine with it, with the fiber especially may be our over-the-top service and also over-the-top TV service and also our portal service that had centralized email and centralized IM capability. So I think the real level of activities though probably happened towards the end of this year, early part of next year. So I think we're using this opportunity now to test the market with different options and see what's on the most popular ones. At the same time we're also developing a few other applications and content that can be put on to the fiber service.</p>

          <p>Hi, Thanks for the call. I have got two questions for Sock Koong or Jeann. Firstly, with the net debt to EBITDA at 0.8 times, are you comfortable with the current gearing level, and do you think you've already created sufficient flexibility in the balance sheet, or would you want to see the net debt EBITDA come down a bit further in the next chop between four months? Also is there also a flow level where you would not want to see the gearing levels falling below?</p>
          <p>Second question also with regard to the capital structure. As the recent crisis changed your mind on the financial risk that you think SingTel can afford to take in the balance sheet, and if you guys were to embark on a big M&amp;A, for example, would you still be comfortable to gear up &#x2013; to gear up the balance sheet to the long-term target of 1.5 to 2 times net debt to EBITDA? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The net debt to EBITDA of just under one time is, I suppose is probably not optimal at this stage, but we had to increase our dividend payout, ordinary dividend payout and we are also -- we had also stated that we would continue to want to have funding flexibility for either future uptake in our assisting investments on other M&amp;A opportunities that will be value accretive, so the need for funding flexibility is still very much desired at this point. We do have grossed that level of about S$6.6 billion, and we do have some refinancing that will come due in the course of this year.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. That's Rama here from Daiwa. I have two questions. Firstly both on Singapore. Firstly, if I can get a comment on the traffic expenses especially in relation to the leases they are going south, how should we think about it, especially given that mobile revenue growth continuous to be quite strong. But the second thing has to do with the data services revenues in the Singapore segment, and if I could just get a comment on the shift in the revenue mix between international lease lines as well as the margin &#x2013; as well as the managed services, what kind of impact do you foresee the margins to have as we go forward on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me answer the second question, data services revenue and where we see that going in the shift. And I will ask my CFO, Kung Yang to answer the first question on traffic expenses. With regard to the data services revenue, I think the shift between IOC to managed services is primarily driven by customers. Customers are basically moving from having dedicated point-to-point services unless they really require a level of service and performance to what we call international virtual private networks.</p>
          <p>The ability to use these on a network wide basis is much more cost effective and then greater redundancy build. And so I think we are seeing that shift and also within that shift we are seeing our ability to once we provide such network to upsell network-based managed services. So we are seeing a very strong growth in the area that being offset by IOC due to the first reason, being the customer needs are shifting. And the second important thing is that we are also seeing that at the end of the day that's actually aggressive type competition in this region because of the availability of a lot of capacity, <mark type="inaudible" /> cable capacity.</p>
          <p>Getting shifting our customers to IP VPN is also best beneficial for us in the Singapore business, primarily because the IP VPN relationship opens the door for the customers who upsell more managed services, beyond just network based managed services even client site managed services where with the abilities that we have in our MCS IT services subsidiary, we are able to get greater share of spend of the customers on IT services wallet.</p>
          <p>I'll hand you over to Kung Yang to answer the question on traffic expenses.</p>

On your traffic expenses I think your question was over the leases, and the reduction that you see on the year-on-year perspective as well as on quarter-on-quarter perspective is more to do with our overseas data revenue that Allen was referring to just now. And we are seeing a reduction in the cost of goods <mark type="inaudible" /> in line with the kind of revenue prices that you see. Of course, we also have the impact of the weakened U.S. dollar as well, so those are the some of the reasons behind that reduction that you saw.</p>

          <p>Okay. If I can just follow-up on the data services question, I understand that the revenue mix and the shift in the revenues there, but what kind of impact do you see on the margins for the segment given this kind of shift in revenues?</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, our margin is stable here or would we see a decline in the margins for the segment?</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that what we are trying to do is that IOC margins will always decline but IOC is a commodity service, and of course with greater price competition, there will be a pressure on the top line. The managed services we have some flexibility to add more value and compete beyond that price because that when you are managing, you are also looking after their routers, their onside equipment and all that. So the customer looks that you are more than just a provider of a type. So I think from that perspective, we can manage the decline in the margins for the managed services a lot that IOC. I hope that answers your question.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon &#x2013; good morning, sorry. Thanks for taking the time. I started come back to the questions that one of the former callers is asking about that balance sheet earlier, and you mentioned or you communicated that you have a longer term target of 1.5 or 2 times net debt to EBITDA. Under what circumstances would you be prepared to may be exceed that target to perceive a specific strategic transaction given that transactions in the telecom industry can't be very sizeable? What I am trying to get a sense of is, to what extent would you be prepared to lower your credit ratings to pursue your strategic objectives? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It is very hard to give you a good response because it really depends on the investment opportunity at a point in time that will cost us then to evaluate what will be the optimal way for us, given the value that we would see coming from pursuing that particular investment opportunity. So I think it is quite academic at this point in time. Clearly, when we look at investment opportunities, we will always look at the impact on our cost of capital and when we look at our capital structure. On the...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. May I follow-up &#x2013; may I follow-up by saying then or asking then, is there a absolutely maximum level of leverage that you prepare to tolerate or a minimum rating that you prepare to have, is that in the single A range, is than in the triple B range. Do you have any comment you can make on that, please?</p>

          <p>We have commented on investment grade rating and we have always stated that, hence the range of 1.5 to 2 times debt to EBITDA have always been a policy that we've communicated.</p>
