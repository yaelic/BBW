          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is, as always, a great pleasure to see you all here, this time for the presentation of Nordea's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Report of 2011. We will, to everybody's surprise, follow the same procedure as last quarter, and that is we will start with Christian Clausen, Group CEO and President of Nordea, who gives a presentation of the results. After that, he will be willing to answer overall questions on the results and Nordea's performance.</p>
          <p>As always, we will webcast this conference, so I would be very grateful if you would state your name and the media or company that you represent when asking questions. After that, analysts are invited to go down to <mark type="ph" /> Nordea's hall (0:51), where they will be able to ask questions to Fredrik Rystedt, CFO, and Ari Kaperi, CRO of Nordea. And media are invited to go over in that direction and make one-on-one interviews with Christian.</p>
          <p>So with those words, Christian Clausen, Group CEO and President of Nordea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, and I'd like to welcome you all to this fourth quarter result presentation, and let's go straight into it.</p>
          <p>The main message today is that we are delivering on our New Normal plan and our focused relationship strategy. We have increased efficiency in costs, capital, liquidity and funding, and I will demonstrate how. We still have a very good business momentum, solid profit development, and we have strengthened our capital position. This, of course, is based on an all-time high customer activity, which I will demonstrate, and we can also show that we've actually mitigated a number of the effects and the new costs of regulation for our customers in various ways.</p>
          <p>So let's dive into the numbers. First of all, the income line is up. This is a very long perspective since 2007 and it's interesting to note the underlying growth rate is actually quite substantial. Also remembering 2007 was high economic growth and high interest rates. Do you still believe those days or remember those days, back when growth rates were sort of 3% to 4%, interest rates were like 5%? And now, we, of course, have very low growth rate and very low interest rates, so the environment is, of course, not as easy to work with.</p>
          <p>It's clear that it's based on a strengthened customer relationship. Actually, we can say we have in this period of time growth our customer relations by approximately 30% on the household and also on the corporate area, which is significant.</p>
          <p>The actual numbers you have already read. I will only highlight the net interest income, which is going up. Total income is up and is a record level both on the quarter and on the year. Total costs are also up year-on-year, but when we look at the quarters this year, they are actually flat, which I will come back to. And this all means that net profit is more or less unchanged and risk-adjusted profit is up somewhat.</p>
          <p>Let's look at each line and let's start with the net interest income, which is up 3% on the quarter. It's based on higher lending volumes. We also have somewhat higher lending spreads and lower deposits from spreads and funding cost is more or less unchanged in the quarter, but, of course, still at a very high level.</p>
          <p>The fee and commission income is also stable. We have increased the assets under management in the quarter by 5%. Lending commissions are up, but we also have some commission expenses for state guarantee fees, particularly in Sweden.</p>
          <p>Net fair value is coming back to a very high level after Q3, which was very low. Customer areas are still performing. Customer activity is high and it's with high profitability, but also other areas are delivering well this quarter, both in the trading area, but also fee recognition in life and pension areas have been much better this quarter, all in all, giving a good relation here.</p>
          <p>Expenses are under strict control. You probably remember we said during the autumn that we will keep cost unchanged now for a prolonged period of time. And as you can see, when we look at the last four, five quarters here, that costs are approximately unchanged. We have taken down the number of FTEs in the quarter, with more than 2% or more than 700 people and the cost to income ratio in Q4 is 49.</p>
          <p>Credit quality is still good. Loan losses are higher this quarter. They are slightly higher than the average over the cycle and it can be concentrated to Denmark and Shipping.</p>
          <p>We have identified previously the problem areas, so we know them very well. But what has happened is that collateral values have gone down further. So when we work these customers who have challenges, both in Shipping and in Denmark, and we start to unwind the engagements and the collateral values have gone down. And we had chosen this quarter to reserve up for this risk, which is there. But overall, it's important to state that the credit quality is good. Rating migration is positive in the quarter, so all in all, in general, the book is looking good, but this problem area exists and, of course, we all know that in particular in Shipping, some segments are having a tough time right now.</p>
          <p>This is also seen in the broader perspective in the longer time horizon, our credit losses since 2002. And you can see both in the first and second half year of 2011, loan losses were actually slightly below the average over the cycle or expected loan losses. And this part of the cycle, loan losses will be, when they are at this fairly low level, they will be somewhat up or somewhat down per quarter. That is to be expected.</p>
          <p>We are generating a lot of capital. We have, during the years since 2007, after dividend, built 9.2% capital. That's nearly one Core Tier 1 percentage point per year and this is continuing, showing the earnings capacity of Nordea. So we are expanding our Core Tier 1 ratio this way, not least based on the fact that risk-weighted assets are unchanged, &#x20AC;185 billion. And this is despite the fact that we in Q4 have implemented Basel 2.5 or CRD III.</p>
          <p>So we actually have absorbed Basel 2.5 in full with the same RVAs and this means, of course, that the capital level is up and as you can see, we have nearly built 1% in Core Tier 1 per year. This we have done in previous years as well and nothing suggests that we cannot continue to do that. The Basel 2.5, the increase was actually close to &#x20AC;4 billion which have been absorbed. I will come back to this a bit later.</p>
          <p>We have very strong access to funding. In all month, we have been attracting funding both from Europe and from the U.S. So we have extremely good access and we have one of the lowest funding costs among European banks.</p>
          <p>The return on equity is up above 12%. We have this strong focus on ROE. I will come back to that a bit later. Our 15% ROE target remains under the assumption that we will have normalized conditions with some growth and somewhat higher interest rates and assuming 11% core Tier 1 ratio. Of course, we don't have normalized conditions right now. I hardly have to explain why. We have very low growth rates and extremely low interest rates. So the 12% compare fairly well to this objective. But our plan, of course, will deliver an increase in ROE going forward each quarter.</p>
          <p>Dividends will be in line with the dividend policy. 40% of the profit will be paid out, which will be &#x20AC;0.27 in dividends.</p>
          <p>Let me say a little about each business area and not too much about the numbers, but more about what we have done. In Retail Banking, we have a real solid development and a very positive development compared to the New Normal, which we are facing. So we have more Gold and Private Banking customers again. We are changing the distribution setup in a very strong way, so now 40% of all branches have been converted into service branches or advice branches.</p>
          <p>And this is the way forward that we &#x2013; our customers go to a service branch if they want to get serviced a new card, a transaction, a question, whatever, or to an advice branch when they want to have advice and sit in nice surroundings and get professional advice.</p>
          <p>This is something that the customers appreciate a lot, and at the same time, we have developed our mobile platform significantly. We have actually quadrupled the number of phone visits this quarter, and the number of service is going up. So this new distribution setup is very much liked by the customers and is extremely efficient in terms of the way we use our resources.</p>
          <p>We have also increased lending volumes in retail by 2%, and as I said, lending spreads are somewhat up, deposit spreads are somewhat down. Still remembering that these spreads do not represent a profit margin, they represent a cost towards this LIBOR. When we add in our real funding cost on these lending margins, the picture is, of course, different as you know. And our costs are down in retail banking.</p>
          <p>Also, wholesale banking is having very solid customer activity, despite the very difficult economic environment. The focus here is very much been in increasing the operational efficiency and they have managed capital in a very good way. This is one of the very capital consuming areas, so of course, here, it's more important than in most areas to ensure that we put in our capital in an efficient way. So the activity has indeed been good. We have some weaker segments and Shipping is, of course, one of them.</p>
          <p>Stable lending development and very strong deposit volume inflow, we have seen in CIB, also high activity in trading, in foreign exchange and fixed income and of course, we have further enhanced our customer relationships.</p>
          <p>Wealth management also strong. Assets under management is up 5% with good inflow, improved investment performance and 77% of our composites are performing its benchmarks, which is better than the European average. Income growth is also very good this quarter in life and pension, and we have been able to recognize fees, despite the difficult markets in most portfolios and also, the profit sharing.</p>
          <p>Let me say a little about the New Normal update. We presented our New Normal plan last year and we elaborated on it during the autumn at our Capital Market day and it's very much about ensuring sufficient profitability to make it possible to attract capital and attract funding, so we can, even in a new environment, supply our customers with lending at reasonable prices. That is what the disciplined ROE focus is all about. This requires we become much more cost-efficient, more capital efficient, and also more efficient in the way we deploy our long-term funding.</p>
          <p>And this is cascaded all down the organization. We are working in each business unit on this, making plans exactly how we can mitigate the effects from new regulation, which is considerable. In each segment, we are reviewing the business model, how we can we best reengineer products, concepts and so on to make it cheaper to service our customers. And finally, for each individual customer, we're actually looking through how we can best serve their interest by giving them products which do not over-consume capital of funding, i.e. with the right profile for the right customer.</p>
          <p>And this thing about the ROE focus is extremely important for all banks going forward, and those banks who cannot deliver an ROE higher than the cost of capital will not make it. We're all here to create great customer experiences, to service our customers. Without that, a bank will not prevail. And in order to do that, it is important that we can help customers finance their plans. In order to do that, we need to have the ability to lend money to them, obviously. In order to do that, we have to be able to build capital and attract funding at a low cost. And in order to be able to do that, we have to deliver an ROE which is higher than cost of capital. And if we do that, then we will create great customer experiences and thereby, we can take another round.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, if we don't do that, if we don't deliver ROE above cost of capital in the banking sector, then we will not be able to build capital and attract funding. So we will not be able to lend money in the longer run, and therefore, we cannot finance the customer plans and we will see the customer experience, of course, extremely low, and this will again deliver a lower ROE.</p>
          <p>Now, the cost of capital in the banking sector is, right now, somewhere around 11%. So, of course, if we do not deliver more than 11%, investors will not give us capital and they will not attract funding. This is the reason for this, our refocus. The other reason is, of course, that we have to be more efficient in running the bank going forward. And here, the New Normal have indeed delivered our plan.</p>
          <p>And let me go a bit deeper into what we have actually done. Cost efficiency is, in a bank, very much about the number of people, because such a big part of our cost base is people. And since we launched the plan, we have actually reduced the number of staff by 1,100 people. I can say we are ahead of our plans and we are well into 2012 now in actually making plans with our people.</p>
          <p>So the total reduction of 2,000 is actually very well underway. And I can say, it's working in a very good way. A lot of voluntary agreements, a lot of job matching is going on, moving people around. So all in all, I think this is moving ahead in a good way. And therefore, obviously staff cost is down. Also, other cost areas are coming down now, including IT. And we think we are well underway in the plan to keep costs flat, as we say, for a prolonged period of time.</p>
          <p>This has, of course, also increased productivity and efficiency quite a lot. And no matter how we look at it, income per FTE is up, business volumes per FTE is up, number of customers per FTE is up and cost to serve is down. So overall, a dramatic increase in efficiency, which is, of course, mitigating the effects and the costs of new regulation on the customer.</p>
          <p>The capital efficiency is also very interesting. As I already demonstrated, our risk-weighted assets is unchanged year Q4 over Q4 and the interesting decomposing here is that we have actually grown, because of credit growth, quite significantly. We have been able to provide our customers with financing for their plans. Credit quality is improving, as I said also in Q4, we have positive rating migration. Then we have the Basel 2.5 effects, which is, of course, negative. That is now taken.</p>
          <p>And then we have the RWA efficiency drive from New Normal, where we actually through the review of asset classes and product segmentation, have led to improved data quality and thereby, improved the quality in the way we deploy capital. We have better collateral agreements. We have improved our registration, our data sourcing and we have developed a number of issues on our product side, which is what we call capital-lite, which means that the same products command less capital and are better profiled to the customer. So all in all, this is a good achievement of the New Normal plan that we actually managed to keep the RWAs despite Basel 2.5.</p>
          <p>And we are, indeed, delivering a lot of things to our customers. We have, for our household customers, provided &#x20AC;145 billion in lending. It's up 6% on the year. We have helped 300,000 of our customers to get a new home. We have issued 900,000 new credit cards. We have executed 400 million payment transactions and 1.2 billion credit card transactions. And as already said, we quadrupled the number of mobile phone visits, which is a significant channel going forward.</p>
          <p>And on the corporate side, we have also a very significant lending to our customers. &#x20AC;145 billion (sic) [&#x20AC;154 billion] (17:10), which is up 6% and it's widespread, not only the large corporates with &#x20AC;45 billion, the very large; also, the large Nordic corporates, which is &#x20AC;56 billion, but also the SMEs, which a lot of people are talking about in Europe. We have actually extended &#x20AC;33 billion of lending to the small and medium-sized companies and that's up 4%.</p>
          <p>So we have indeed supported our customers across the board in the Nordic area with financing and transactions and we have helped our corporate customers to raise &#x20AC;37 billion of new capital and we handle more than 800 million payments transactions for our corporate clients. This equals 5,000 transaction per minute, actually, in total in payments. So the bank is operational all the time, and of course, efficiency is important.</p>
          <p>So coming back to the key messages, we are delivering our New Normal plan and the focused relationship strategy is really delivering more efficiency in cost, capital and funding. The business momentum is still there, despite the low growth environment. Our profit development is solid, and the capital position is strengthened organically. So in reality, we can build 1% Core Tier 1 per year. Therefore, we will also, in this plan, be able to meet the regulation requirements.</p>
          <p>Customer activity is high, as I already mentioned, and we are indeed mitigating the effects on the new regulation on our customers. We are developing our products and services. We are realizing efficiency gains and we are taking out the cost for the new regulation in running the bank. Thank you. Questions?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Then we have two microphones prepared in the back. And again, you need the microphone to ask questions, so that it's caught on the webcast and we have three questions over there, so we can start there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Hi, Magnus Anderson at ABG. Just a couple of questions on asset quality. First of all on Shipping, where your loan loss level totals 209 basis points versus 76 basis points in Q3, whether you have made provisions for any specific items this quarter or if this is a level we should expect looking forward, given the weakness in the market also in 2012?</p>
          <p>Secondly, we saw loan losses slightly higher also in the other Nordic countries. The gross problem loans up 5% quarter-on-quarter, despite that you talk about positive risk migration. So the question there is could you say something about risk migration in the various countries and should we expect this kind of levels in Denmark? One example, is there something of a one-off Q4 character in the other numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the more detailed questions we can take afterwards, but in general, I'd like to say that the Shipping is the well-known customers. There are no new problem customers coming up. But as I said, collateral values have come down. It's quite obvious, not least in the Tanker segment, that the value of ships at that segment is very low right now and financing for ships in general have dried out, as many banks are exiting. So when we unwind these customers and help them actually to solve their problems, it's difficult to sell the ships, to put it very simple, at a decent value. So it's very much about collateral values.</p>
          <p>It's more or less the same actually in Denmark. It's not a lot of new problem customers <mark type="ph" /> and more (20:42) when actually these customers which are already reserved for, you can say, then asset values in Denmark have actually continued to drop, both housing and other values. So there's not a lot of tailwind when we actually unwind the customers. So we have chosen this quarter to reserve up for that risk, which is, of course, very difficult to forecast, because it depends so much on the economic development. So I cannot give a forecast.</p>
          <p>The same goes for Shipping. It depends a lot of the Shipping customers. But the fact that rating migration is positive and it's also positive in Q4 clearly shows that the overall credit quality is improving but the problem customers are still there. They are just more expensive when we actually have to sort it out at the very end, and that's what we have reserved for. And the more detailed questions, we can take afterwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Andreas H&#xE5;kansson from Exane BNP Paribas. Sir, I have to go a little bit more into detail on Shipping. Well, I see that your actual non-performing loans are going up quite significantly, almost 200% in the quarter, while your provisions are going down quite significantly, so your coverage ratio is falling, which tend -- would indicate to me that you actually look at an improvement in that segment, which are not quite sharing. So why this drop in the coverage ratio from 42% to 31%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think we should take that afterwards, because it's a lot of detailed explanations of this. But in general, it's exactly as I said, it's not like we're having a lot of new problem customers. It's about the existing ones. We have worked with actually throughout the year, working it out who have this problem in specific segments.</p>
          <p>It's also important to say that, yes, it is higher loan reservation this particular quarter. Shipping is still profitable, so I think the business model is not under threat. But right now, it seems very difficult for some Shipping segments, but we have reserved up now so we are not worried about that situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Can you pass that back from the men in black to the woman in white?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good day, Mr. Clausen. Congratulations on the strong report. I would like to hear your perspective on Nordea's recent status as a global systemically important financial institutions, given the requirements for capital that bears with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's correct that we are one of the 28 banks which was &#x2013; well, was named a global systemic important bank. And of course, this is a fact that this way of handling the big banks have been decided and we are part of the banks, and we will participate in that. The most important effect of that is that before the end of the year, we'll have to set up a recovery and resolution regime for Nordea, which we'll discuss with authorities, which will tell how we will recover Nordea if capital ratios start to drop and how Nordea will be resolved, it will also be part of that package.</p>
          <p>That's actually the most important part, and we actually welcome that whole set-up, which is maybe the most important part of new regulation. It has not been discussed that much so far in media, but actually, what we really needed back in 2008 and 2009 was actually this ability to take out banks that did not perform without having them to cause systemic risk on the financial sector and other banks. So that will happen, that's the most important part.</p>
          <p>Then, of course, the extra capital ratio we need to put in is one that is, of course, an extra cost, but it seems like most countries will also make the biggest local banks systemic, important local banks, and probably give them the same capital requirement. So I don't think the capital requirement as such will be the issue. The issues will probably be that we will be under European supervision from EB in London in terms of the whole resolution regimes cross-border in all the nine countries we operate in, and that will, of course, be something we will have to work out. But as I said, this is probably a good thing that we ensure that the big banks can be dissolved if they have problems going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have a question all the way to the front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter Grabe, Handelsbanken. Two questions. Firstly, looking at the margins, and in particular the margins in Sweden, if you can say anything more about the sort of underlying profit margin, if you would call it that, on the mortgage lending in Sweden, because it looks to be expanding quite dramatically in the quarter/ And the second question relates to the next LTRO, what the strategy is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the profit margins on lending is something we do not report. We report the spread towards LIBOR, and the real profit margins as we write in the report are significantly lower, because our funding costs are significantly higher than LIBOR. So depending on the maturity of the product, if it's a short lending or long lending, then the funding costs will be increasing over the maturity. So we do not report the margin on each maturity, which will be very complicated to do.</p>
          <p>And also because right now, the funding costs move a lot quarter by quarter, because the credit spreads in our funding changes a lot per quarter. So it's not easy to say. We can just say that the real profit margins are significantly lower than the spreads we report, and if so, that in general, our underlying profit margin on most lending products in Sweden is not going up at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the LTRO?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What do you mean LT?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the next auction is to be <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:28) the charges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes. I'm sorry, ECB auction. Yeah, but I think the ECB has done a very strong move in supplying financing for the financial sector in three years &#x2013; for three years at a reasonable rate and I think that has actually been an important part of the calming down of markets as we see right now.</p>
          <p>So banks which cannot attract long-term liquidity for the reasons that they are struggling on capital, they now have the funding available for actually both lending money, but also maybe ensuring that they can carry on holding the balance sheet they have without selling off everything. I think the next auction will also be used in a major way and I think it's good. I think banks are shoring up.</p>
          <p>Maybe they don't need all that liquidity right now, which is also visible in terms of the deposits, the banks then do it <mark type="ph" /> at (27:22) ECB. But I think it is important that we get all this liquidity out. It's certainly helping the market to be functional again, and this is not very different from what happened in the U.S. back in 2008. And I think it's exactly the right way they have gone to ensure that in the short run, it's not necessarily this long-term financing that is the real issue. Right now, the real issue is capital for most European banks and that's what they are working on towards June to ensure that they are up to the 9% capital ratio on the Basel 2.5.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jan Wolter, Deutsche Bank. Question, how should we think about costs in 2012 when you say unchanged costs for a prolonged time? Should we compared with the 2011 level then of &#x20AC;5.2 billion or should we look at the fourth quarter or the second half or how should we think about that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a little seasonality in the numbers, of course, but unchanged is sort of unchanged, of course, it will be variability per quarter. It will not be the same number. But roughly unchanged year-on-year going forward is what we expect for the level of volatility per quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:05). You are head of the European Banking Association, right? And I wonder, how do you feel or what do you think about these plans or ideas about separating investment banking from the rest of the banking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a discussion which has peaked already. I know in the UK and the U.S., they are working with their plans, the Dodd-Frank and the <mark type="ph" /> Glickas (29:38) Report. But they were also the countries worst hit by exactly some of the problems caused by investment banking and toxic products and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>In Europe and the trend in regulation is very clearly that with the new regulation, where capital requirements on trading books and other things and counterparty risk have gone up dramatically, in some areas to eight to 10 times what it was previously, then the problem is being solved by requiring much more capital in those areas, so they do not contaminate the rest of the bank, which is <mark type="ph" /> in reality (30:14) what you want to avoid if you separate.</p>
          <p>So I think that discussion is not live in Central Europe. I also think it's wrong. I think it's better to ensure that they post the right capital for the right type of risk, which is actually what is being done. And then in general, I also strongly believe you have to have the whole bank coming together. Because what we do in investment banking is of course to service our corporate customers, so separating that does not make any sense in a financial market. So I think the Americans and the Brits are, of course, moving ahead on this. But I don't think it's the right solution. I also think Europe will abstain from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hampus Brod&#xE9;n, Enskilda. I was just wondering if you can make a clarification. I'm not sure I heard you right. Did you actually say that you did not see any product margin expansion in Sweden? In that case, could you go into a bit of details why that is, you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I said that the &#x2013; depending on the maturity, our funding cost is, of course, higher. The liquidity premium is higher with maturity. We saw last week when we raised the covered bond at 62 basis points above LIBOR, that of course, we don't fund our mortgage lending at LIBOR. We fund it at LIBOR Plus, in that example, plus 62. So, the profit margin is not the spreads we report. Now, this varies every week, every month. The credit spreads have developed significantly during the autumn to a much higher level than previously. So, of course, these funding costs are coming in. Now they may come down a little again, so they vary a lot. But in general, our profit margin on these longer lending products is not up. If anything, it's unchanged or maybe even slightly down.</p>
          <p>So, it is, in the new banking model, not very easy to make a strong profit margin on long-term lending products which have to be financed long term, which they will under new regulation. On top of that come all our costs for distribution on capital and so on. So the real profit margins are down and actually, that was also reflected yesterday in the media. TT reflected that the real profit margin I think they said around 40 basis points or something, maybe it's slightly higher. But it's not at all close to what the real spread looks like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But in the quarter, the NII is still up without help from deposit margins, so something is happening in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are expanding lending and we're having more customers and we are also making more efficiency on our funding areas. Of course, we are working to improve it. But obviously with the new capital regulation which now knocks in and with the outlook to higher risk weights, not least in Sweden, which have been announced, I think, coming up, then more capital require higher margins going forward. I think that is to be expected.</p>

    <section name="MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION">
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I would like to welcome you to this analyst meeting, which is also webcasted, where we'll have a short introduction of Fredrik Rystedt, Group CFO, and Ari Kaperi, Group CRO, and then we will open up for questions and answers.</p>
          <p>Fredrik, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Rodney, I will just take one additional slide. You've already heard the main contents of the result, of course, in the quarter, so we can come back to all your questions relating to everything. One thing that was not shown by Christian was, of course, the bridge of the net interest income and as you can see, we actually had a positive influence on the net interest income, both from the volume and from the margin side, and of course, volume-wise, we grew both lending and, of course, also deposits in the Retail side quite significantly. So a reasonably good month, not evenly distributed among the countries, but actually quite stable and good development in particular on the corporate side on the lending.</p>
          <p>If you take the deposit margin, throughout this quarter, we've had two interest rate cuts, so 50 basis points by the ECB. We've had rate cuts in Norway and we've had it in Sweden. And of course, that, as you can see here, has had an influence on the deposit margins, particularly on the <mark type="ph" /> transient (38:19) accounts. So we will, of course, see more of these in Q1.</p>
          <p>But the impact here is well known to you, of course. But we did actually increase the margins on lending in quite a few different places in the group. The question here was raised before, did we actually increase margins truly? And I think if you actually, just to clarify that discussion a little bit, if you actually look back in time, what you saw in 2008 was increasing margins both on the corporate and the lending side initially.</p>
          <p>But as you have also seen, funding costs both on the covered bond side and also senior unsecured, you can see that the spread or margin has actually, on a full-funding cost basis, been flat or even actually declined. So it has not been, in true terms, an increase of margins over the long period of time. Rather just compensation for higher funding costs, and that's been the case for all banks.</p>
          <p>Now in Q4, it was actually a true margin pickup. So for the year as a whole, it was not. But for the fourth quarter, it was actually including funding cost, a true margin pickup. So those are the backgrounds. And then you have treasury, pretty insignificant contribution in this particular case. So these were the main elements. And with those words, Ari, on the credit side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we thought that we will give a little bit more background information on the credit losses, because as we saw, they are now higher in Q4.</p>
          <p>One issue I want to highlight is these impaired loans. So as you see, actually, there is some increase in the impaired loans, but not any kind of significant, that we are talking about the 5%. And that is more also indicating this, what Christian already said, that we are not seeing so many new customers coming in <mark type="ph" /> in the Danish krone (40:11). It's more or less that they're &#x2013; all customers, they are not recovering, so that now what has happened in Shipping and also in Denmark is that another difficult market environment has lasted for some time. Meaning that then, those customers who were weak when the crisis started, they are not in a way recovering. They also seem &#x2013; and when the collateral values, they are coming down, then actually, we have to increase also loan loss provisions accordingly. But we don't see so many new problem customers entering, even in these two areas.</p>
          <p>This is now then showing that why we say that these areas of higher concern are limited to Denmark and Shipping. These are the country-specific information on the impaired loans. We have cleared up Shipping from these figures, so that this is Retail and this is our large corporate customers. So that impaired loans, they were &#x2013; they have been up in Denmark for some time. They were a little bit stabilizing in the Q2, Q3 this year. But now, again, a little bit up in Denmark.</p>
          <p>But then again, in Finland, in Norway, and in Sweden, the development is relatively stable in terms of the impaired loans. If you then show the same information in terms of loan losses in various markets, in Denmark, these are absolute euros. As you can see, you have these loan ratios in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:52).</p>
          <p>In Denmark, yes, it was up in Q4. But actually, it's not anything dramatic compared to the previous quarters. So that what we saw in Q2, Q3 was a little bit increasing trend, but now unfortunately, the situation has not &#x2013; let's say, coming better into Denmark. Actually, it's coming more or less a little bit worse. We see little bit signs of increased unemployment in Denmark. We also see some downward trend in housing prices. There have been increasing trend of for-sales in the household &#x2013; in the mortgage market and so forth, so that is the reason for what is these increased losses.</p>
          <p>But then again, in other countries, as you can see, and in Finland, in Norway, in Sweden, yes, there was one comment that they are also up in other markets and that's right. They are up from Q3. But actually, they are still at very moderate low levels.</p>
          <p>And as you already pointed out in the other questions, was that okay, where this &#x2013; why we have the positive rating migration? That is visible in all countries, even in Denmark, where you see the positive corporate rating migration, as well as in Finland, Norway and Sweden. That comes from the fact that actually, now when we do the business and when we are growing the business, that is coming from the highly-rated customers. And then actually, the volumes are going down in the lower-rated customers, so that the activities amount to the highest, strongest customers. And then again, still we see a trend of more up ratings than down ratings, so that actually, the average quality in the Nordic corporate portfolio and among Nordic corporate customers is relatively strong and are still improving.</p>
          <p>Then, this then is loan loss, so &#x20AC;118 million is split between Corporate and Household segment in this way. So that earlier, we have seen that in Denmark the losses have come from mainly this kind of local SME customers, corporate customers. That's still the case, so that we saw some increase in Q4 from these local SME corporate customers, but actually, it is not very high level even now in Denmark. So that what is driving now the losses in Denmark up is, in the last two quarters, is Household.</p>
          <p>We said to you last quarter that actually, we <mark type="ph" /> again did (44:33) our Household portfolio in Denmark and we started to increase loan loss provisions in Q4. And actually, that has now continued in Q4 &#x2013; Q3, we started this and it has continued in <mark type="audio gap" /> (44:44). So this is what is happening in Denmark.</p>
          <p>Then two same slides from Shipping. Yes, you observe that there is a quite substantial increase in impaired loans in terms of percentages. If you take a look on absolute, let's say, euros, that the increase is roughly &#x20AC;70 million, and actually that is coming, more or less, from one individual customer, a little bit larger Shipping customer which was now impaired in Q4, and that is also that we made a loan-loss provision for that but not with the same coverage ratio than the average coverage ratio is in our allowance ratio, is in our loan book. So that is explaining this other question that why the impaired are up and then allowance ratio is down. Actually, this is, we are still talking about the relatively small, let's say, lending book in terms of euros. Our Shipping book is only 4% of our total lending and it's more or less &#x20AC;13 billion, so that in a way, they're &#x2013; one individual customer can effect these ratios.</p>
          <p>And then net loan losses, of course, correspondingly they are up. This is now at the level of 200 basis points. But please pay attention that even with this level of loan losses, you can make a profit in Q4, so that we have been able to increase the, let's say, price of risk in terms of credit margins and then even with this level. Of course, we are not satisfied. I'm not saying that this is a very difficult market environment and that this is especially coming from the Tanker segment, but nevertheless, it's still profitable business we are doing in Shipping.</p>
          <p>And in Shipping, still at what is now that the areas of special attention, they are very much limited, especially, in our case, to the tanker market. The 80% of the Q4 loan-losses in Shipping was from tanker market and the tanker customers, whereas we are still having, of course, very strong Shipping areas in the loan book and on this double medium-risk areas in the loan book. So that thereby, I just want to indicate that these problem areas where the increased loan losses came in Q4, they are limited. They are well-known, we know how to handle with those customers. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>So with this, we open up the floor to questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It works now? Yeah, coming back to your Shipping question, I appreciate that that's the reason why now down to the 31% coverage ratio, but could you explain the thinking around the 31% coverage ratio? To me, not being an expert in Shipping, of course, that sounds really low. Could you explain, how do you value &#x2013; is it the ships that you think the collateral is so fine or is it the cash flow or the corporates that you think are fine, or what makes a justified coverage ratio in the riskiest portfolio of just 31%? Second, also related to similar areas, that what is happening with Finnish retail NPLs that went up quite significantly in the quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The starting point in the Shipping financing is that, that's fully collateralized. So that means that usually the provision ratios, allowance ratios, they are quite low as a nature. But as we said that now, actually when the customer is in problems, when the market is weak, then, of course, the asset values are coming down and then, of course, we start to make provisions, if we think that the, well, let's say, collateral value is not covering the whole credit.</p>
          <p>But the starting point is always actually that we have more collateral than we have credits, so that means that this is not any kind of unsecured lending. So it's not comparable, for example, those type of, let's say, ratios where we &#x2013; what we see in the large corporate side or anywhere else. So, that is more or less the underlying reason.</p>
          <p>In Finland, actually, there is not this kind of one individual explanation for increase. It's more or less coming from here and there. In Finland, it's a little bit more problematic economic environment. The growth is not as strong as in other Nordic &#x2013; or in Sweden and in Norway, so that's many small issues, it's not been, again, anything specific.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But given the provisions in Finland are flat, you don't feel that you had a provision need against the increase in NPLs in Finland? Because we can't see that by country, rather by sector.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have made the necessary &#x2013; this type of collective provisions already in the previous quarter. So at least, I don't foresee that we will have a big need of increase in provision levels right now in regards to the Finnish book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, Mats Anderson followed by <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:10).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Mats Anderson, Cheuvreux, please, could you discuss a little bit the deliberations that you made concerning the dividend going from &#x20AC;0.29 to &#x20AC;0.26, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mats, I can do that. We have &#x2013; it's been fairly obvious that the capital requirement and coming regulation has triggered a debate that would suggest that we should increase over time our capital ratio. So as you have seen also from Christian's presentation earlier, we generate a lot of capital every year. So from 2006, 9.2% after dividend every year, so we're a strong company in the sense that we generate a lot of equity. But we think that at this stage, it's obvious that the trend is to build up capital ratios even further. And then we thought it was a prudent level to be at, which our cap or dividend policy stipulates 40%. So it was no more than that behind the decision to stay at our dividend policy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, Magnus at ABG again. Just finally from me at least, on the Swiss migration, is the rating change you've seen during the quarter, is that based on financial data from the companies for Q4 or is there a possible time lag effect here? The background to my question is obviously that you have resolved group price provisions for more than &#x20AC;200 million in 2011 and I would like to get a feeling for what we could expect into 2012 there? Secondly on the Swedish mortgage market, do you feel that the competitive situation has changed in any way during Q4, i.e. after the high capital requirements or proposed capital requirements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start from this rating migration, now those read ratings we are doing in Q4, they are not based on 2010 figures, for example. They are based on the, let's say, information we have from the customer at the time. How do we see, for example &#x2013; what was the Q3, how we see the outlook going forward, which is also affecting to the rating. So that, it's not &#x2013; I would not say that we are late in acting or reacting, if there's a need for reiterating, so that we are on time. And now actually, this is what has happened.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up. So I understand correctly, there could be some quarterly delays here? That's what I meant, actually. So you based that on Q3 figures rather than Q4 figures, the rate of migration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We base that always in the latest figures available, plus we take into account, in a weighted forecast, the outlook we see for the customer, so that it's, in a way, both. But naturally, we have to have some starting point and that's more or less latest financials we have from the customer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the mortgage market, I think it's fair to say that the mortgage market will always be a fairly fierce market from a competitive standpoint. And of course, that has to do with something we've discussed many times before. It carries the relationship, to a large degree with household customers, so I think it will remain always fierce.</p>
          <p>Then of course, things that impact cost levels in the banking system, including turbulent markets or credit spreads and of course, also to some extent, anticipate the future capital levels will cause banks to behave somewhat differently. So if anything, I think the competitive level has been somewhat less fierce maybe in Q4 than it was before. But in all honesty, I don't think it will ever become a non-competitive market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jan Wolter, Deutsche Bank. Regarding the &#x20AC;5.4 billion risk weighted asset drop there on the back of the optimization that you're doing, I guess there is no effect there from the portfolio being approved, thus &#x2013; okay? And secondly, could we then expect further drops like this going forward? I know it's hard to say, but you know yourself the &#x2013; sort of the level of improvement you can achieve in your risk-weighted asset management there? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second one is on the outlook for Denmark and the Shipping in a sense that if collateral value start &#x2013; continue to fall in Shipping segment, Tanker, et cetera, then should we expect that you have to continue to take losses like this due to that fact? Or have you marked down the collateral values now way below the market values on ships? Or where do you stand? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think the answer to your first question is pretty much yes, I certainly hope so, that there is more where that came from, so to speak, because if you recall from our New Normal plan and the Capital Markets presentation we just did, there were several buckets for our capital work or capital efficiency work. And, of course, one of them was model changes that we anticipate, including the advanced IRB approach.</p>
          <p>Then there's a second component, which is basically working with our customers to identify solutions that are good for them and, of course, capital-lite also for the bank creating a win-win situation. And the third part is pure capital efficiency issues, such as collateral registration or updating or it taking away non-use credit limits or things like that. So, the efficiency gains that you've seen in the quarter, as Christian alluded to, is a little bit of a mix of the latter two. There is no, so to speak, model changes in this, but just very hard work on efficiency in various ways. So, including what was stated there, collateral management and registration, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So we will continue that work and, of course, it's a kind of a cumbersome thing. It takes a lot of time to work through a number of engagements in the bank in a number of different places. We will continue that process. And I think the other part of it is, as we elaborated on, work with every customer ensuring that we have the right product mix, and we have on optimal product portfolio for that individual customer. So I &#x2013; as anticipated, we believe we were going to be able to actually save quite some capital through all of these measures, and you've seen us executing now pretty much in line with our plan so far, but those will also continue in '12 and '13.</p>

          <p>And when it comes to, let's say, future in Denmark, and Shipping in terms of our loan losses, as you know, we are not giving any kind of firm forecasts on the rate loss outlook. But the way we evaluate or assess the value of our collaterals is the current market value with some safety caution, safety margin. It's not that we are not valuing those to zero. We, of course, we have to have at least, kind of more or less market value, also &#x2013; of all kinds of accounting principles, but we have certain safety caution.</p>
          <p>But of course, if those markets, if they are going worse, if they are not recovering, of course, we are affected, so that we will see losses from these segments also in the coming quarters. But it's very much related what is happening in the market outlook and in those <mark type="audio gap" /> (58:29). In the Shipping, of course, the main problem is specialties, special attention areas is that the global demand is now low, so that there is no demand for more or less enough, and then again, the supply is still too high, because there still new ships coming in the market, and in these segments, that's the kind of oversupply in the new, let's say, ships. They are roughly 15%, 20% for the time being, the way we see it.</p>
          <p>So that &#x2013; but that is now also improving by that fact that now that the weakest players, they are now &#x2013; they have defaulted or are defaulting and then all ships are now being scrapped, so that there is also, let's say, that we see that capacity is going out from the market. So you more or less see from this impaired launch and, let's say, this kind of market descriptions that these areas for the coming period are areas of special attention. But it's very difficult to say that what will be the level of the losses coming from those areas.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on seasonality in the loan loss line. There is a tendency among banks to report some seasonality in the loan loss line in Q4, I suppose syou look closer at the books at the end of the year. So my question is, is there any element of that in this quarter, in your view?</p>
          <p>My next question is, in this quarter, you managed to offset quite a lot or roughly half of the increase in loan losses in Denmark, you managed to offset by increased asset spreads or interest NII. Do you expect to be able to continue to offset meaningful portions of increased loan losses in Denmark with asset spreads?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's no seasonality, at least in our loan loss provisions. So that if I remember correctly, for example, Q4 last year was relativsely low, so that &#x2013; and on this year, it was then high. So that we are, during every quarter, we are going through our loan book customer-by-customer basis, let's say, updating our, let's say, calculated models, how we determine to the collective provisions. That's a very prudent procedure every quarter, so that thereby, there is no seasonality now, especially &#x2013; and this negative market environment more or less started in Q4, and then it, let's say, speeded up this negative circle towards Q4. That is the reason for this type of development, especially in Shipping and in household, Denmark.</p>
          <p>When it comes to, let's say, pricing up, that the increased risk, that is what we try to do, of course, all the time. And as I said, all that goes also &#x2013; that's very visible in Shipping also. We have been able to increase the average credit margin from &#x2013; that's has been increased by 80 basis points in 1.5 years. So that's now close to the level of 200 basis points average credit margin in Shipping. For the time being, was it 190 basis points or something like.</p>
          <p>So that is, of course, what we are doing, if we see that price of risk is &#x2013; or the risk levels are increasing in the various parts. But of course, then we have competition, we have market there against, so that then, of course, that's very much affecting.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I suppose competition from other banks, both in Denmark and in the Shipping segment, is unusually weak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and that is especially true in Shipping and that's the reason that the, of course, the margin is &#x2013; we have been able to take the margins up. But then again, we still have to remember that that maturity of our Shipping customers and the portfolio is still very strong, and they are very, let's say, highly rated strong customers. So that, of course, there's a limit.</p>

          <p>So Peter, followed by Andreas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. Firstly, regarding the target of 15% ROE on 11% Core Tier 1? How should we read it? Should we assume that &#x2013; should we read it such as that you don't expect the 12% plus kind of cyclical buffer limit in Sweden or floors, but the FSA will actually come into play or how should we read that?</p>
          <p>The second question, sorry for repeating, but regarding the long-term <mark type="ph" /> REIT (1:03:11) facility from the ECB, how would you reason if you would participate? Would you use that money to extend the average maturity of your funding profile or would you take part of <mark type="ph" /> carriage rates? (1:03:21)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me start with the first question. I think &#x2013; I'm not sure I 100% understand it but let me try at least to start with an answer. I think when we set the targets of 15%, our understanding was that 11% core Tier 1 ratio was an adequate level. Then, of course, lots of things have happened after that and that sort of changes the arena in some way. It actually changes it in many ways. I think it changes the competitive landscape and, of course, it changes the cost picture for not only us, but also for other banks. And the actual impact for Nordea and for other banks remains, at least for us, pretty uncertain for a couple reasons. First of all, it's kind of a long way out until it actually is imposed. Second, we don't know what the other countries will do. We don't know what Europe or the U.S. finally will actually do.</p>
          <p>So, how that will play out is pretty much impossible. So we have elected to not to sort of change the target we have set out of 15% under normalized circumstances. However, having said that, it's pretty obvious that the situation at this stage with very low interest rates, kind of weak macroeconomic development, is not a normalized situation. So it'll take some time for us to get there and, of course, the impact of coming capital regulation and how that will impact us, we will have to work with as we go forward and become more knowledgeable.</p>
          <p>Then as it relates to your other question on the LTR or the ECB funding line, that is a situation which we're pretty ambivalent. We can say we're &#x2013; it's actually difficult to fully analyze that situation. First of all, Nordea, as you already know, have very, very good access to funding markets in general, so we actually don't need Central Bank funding. This was designed for other banks with more significant needs. And that is also something that we feel is important for us to be not in any way dependent on Central Bank funding, and that's why we chose not to participate in the first round.</p>
          <p>Now what actually took place in the first round was that a lot of banks that were in a similar situation or at least in a good situation also participate for carry trade reasons. So the estimate was that approximately about a third of that issue was roughly carry trades and you can also see that by so much of that 500 roughly being on the balance sheet of ECB.</p>
          <p>So I think there are &#x2013; you can say from many angles, it's an easier thing now to participate for pure cost reasons and we are, as Christian alluded to, we're considering doing that. We haven't made up our mind and it will also depend on the choice of collateral position from National Bank of Finland, et cetera. So we are still in that process.</p>
          <p>It doesn't actually prolong our funding profile, because in all essence, we have a longer funding profile than that on the long end. And of course there is the other issue which all banks need to face is that you need to stage your maturity profile in a reasonably good way. So having too much on a three-year facility and you've got lots of redemption can actually create some sort of financial stability as you approach that redemption. So this was a long answer to you, Peter, but I think it &#x2013; in all fairness, yes, I think in the second round, it is much more attractive from a pure cost position for us to actually participate, and we may do that, we haven't made up our mind yet.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Andreas from Exane again. Just, we've been hearing you talking about the funding of mortgages in Sweden from quite some time and that the cost for Household having variable mortgages going up because you now have to fund it longer term and swapping it back. And we, of course, all understand well why you're doing that, to reduce the risks and all that. But if we look at Denmark, where I would argue it's a riskier mortgage market because of falling house prices and overleveraged households and all of that, you continue to fund your mortgages very short, while, of course, the life of the mortgage is roughly the same as in Sweden. How long will you continue to do that and how do you reason around it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's &#x2013; well, you know all the details on all that, Andreas, since before. But, of course, it's a mix right? So you have short funding and long funding. And, of course, the functionality of the Danish market is a very different one towards the Swedish setup. So it's actually not the bank funding, it is the individual lenders or borrowers that actually is the borrower.</p>
          <p>So, I think that over time &#x2013; and also depending a little bit on the regulatory environment, I think we will probably go back to a more longer funding of the Danish market over time. And again, once &#x2013; it's just important that one understands the functionality. The margin is pretty much fixed in the Danish environment, so whether we fund it longer or shorter is more a customer decision and, of course, our margin is pretty much stable regardless of which kind of setup, if it's an F-loan or if it's a longer-term loan. So I think the trend going forward would probably be triggered towards the longer end of the market. I don't think it has a huge implication for us, though.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not so much concerned about your margins. I'm just wondering when we see a deterioration of household asset quality already, if you're going to move people onto longer funding that's going to be significantly more expensive, of course. And what...</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, this development that the Danish household has gone for this kind of short-term interest rates and funding has been very fast in the past years. And then the tradition in Denmark is different. It's long-term and on fixed rates and all that. And I think that at least now, even the regulators, they are now in a way pointing out that perhaps, we should take down that type of interest rate risk in the mortgage market in Denmark. I expect that, that will happen gradually. We are going to the longer maturities for funding and on fixed interest rates in Denmark. But it won't happen very rapidly, but little by little and you are right. It may have some kind of at least a short term <mark type="ph" /> neck (1:10:19). But it won't happen very fast.</p>
