      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to everybody. Many thanks for being here for our Year End Results presentation.  As you can see, we are here with first of all the Investor Relations team, then the Deputy CEO and the CFO, so we will be more than happy to answer all your questions at the end of the presentation. We are responsible for claiming &#x2013; we are all the staff is here.</p>
          <p>We will talk of the year end results but before talking of the year end results as usual we want have a short executive summary. 2007 results confirm our group capability in terms of delivering results in a challenging market environment. The net income is 6.6 billion; normalized, and then we will explain what does mean normalized, 7.3 billion.  We have a very strong EVA generation; it's 8% up year on year to 2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>The earnings per share normalized; again, that means excluding integration cost, capital gain on Mediobanca, one-off impacts of the tax reform in Italy and Germany and the PPA, will be &#x20AC;0.55 per share. That means that we are in line with what we have always said. The earnings per share without Capitalia would be &#x20AC;0.62, significantly more than the original plan, 17% higher than the previous year.</p>
          <p>Operating profit is up by 11.4% year on year.  We had quite a good growth in commercial banking thanks to our diversification coming from all the different areas of the group and this is more than offset in the markdown in MIB markets.</p>
          <p>The core Tier 1 after the year end results because of PPA the cleaning up also of balance sheet in Capitalia withdrawal rights we have in our books is 5.83%, slightly above 2006 despite acquisitions and as I've said the Capitalia withdrawal rights.  This has also been achieved thanks to organic capital generation.  So also all the issues on the need for incoming capital and some are completely out of the screen after this number.</p>
          <p>Asset quality, net impaired loans were down by 15% year on year.  It's quite a significant improvement in terms of quality of our balance sheet. The coverage ratios are up by 3% year on year to 54.5%.  You will see later on also the fact that the lower provisions here are due to the fact that we had cash in, so our real payments we received from customer in <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>Capitalia, right-sizing there is quite quick and above expectations, paving the way for higher than anticipated synergies, 1.3 billion integration costs booked in '07. And this is higher than the original plan only due to the fact that we have 7,800 people more than expected that are leaving.  So we decided to book all these one-off costs in 2007 to speed up the integration process.</p>
          <p>We'll talk of the results, some key topics, and updates since we think that there are some topics that must be specifically addressed; Capitalia integration and synergies focus and a short outlook on 2008.</p>
          <p>Starting from the results, here we have the overall numbers: total revenues 29.6 billion; operating costs 16.3; operating profit 13.3; integration costs 1.3; so we had a pre-tax profit of 10.5. Net income for the Group pre-PPA is 6.6; 62 million of PPA. The net income is 6.5. Normalized, as I said before taking away the integration costs that after tax are 840 million; the capital gain on Mediobanca, 550 million; the one-off impact of the tax reform in Italy and Germany, 360 million; and the PPA would be 7.3 billion.</p>
          <p>What about the 2007 results vis-&#xE0;-vis the expectation? The earnings per share pro forma is &#x20AC;0.50. There are 2 basis points of the tax &#x2013; Italian reform. This is a tax deferred asset that had a lower value. That means that in the future, we will pay lower taxes, but we had to book the one-off costs in the first year. It's exactly the same for Germany, 1 basis point; PPA, 0.5 basis point; 2 basis points on integration cost, and net of the gain of Mediobanca, we go up to the &#x20AC;0.55. When we were talking at the end of the third quarter, we were still foreseeing &#x20AC;0.56.  &#x20AC;0.55 is quite clearly &#x20AC;0.01 less, but as we know, in the fourth quarter the spread then we will talk specifically on investment banking enlarged quite significantly. So, we had a negative mark to market in the portfolio, indicated in the portfolio. But overall, the rest of the bank performed better than expected, so we are where we are.</p>
          <p>Without Capitalia, we are at <mark type="inaudible" /> You remember that the original plan was &#x20AC;0.56. So, we think those results are pretty good. The core Tier 1 ratio is 5.83. We had 9 basis points coming from the withdrawal rights of Capitalia, so we have the treasury shares in our portfolio. And we have acquired ATF at 28 basis points. So, summing up these two numbers, we are exactly in line with the plan, which was 6.2, again despite the overall market turmoil and the fact that risk weighted assets grew up more than expected, so also in terms of capital generation. I think that we are doing very, very well. Dividend per share, yesterday the Board has approved a proposal to the AGM a dividend per share of &#x20AC;0.26, which is also a clear demonstration on the confidence we have on the strength of the group.</p>
          <p>Comparisons versus the previous year; I think that this is quite important.  The total revenues went up by 5.1%. I think that it is better to be focused on the '06 comparison of costs and the <mark type="inaudible" /> perimeters unless we have a change of perimeters. The operating costs are flat, 0.4% up, and despite the significant branch opening process we had in Central and Eastern Europe. So it's also a good demonstration on the capabilities the group has in terms of controlling the cost. So the operating profits are above the previous year of 11.4%.</p>
          <p>I would like to stress the fact that also if we compared the first quarter '07 vis-&#xE0;-vis the fourth quarter '06 in terms of operating profit, we are flat.  And considering the market conditions, I would say that this is not at all a bad result. We are quite happy with that.  We have also to consider the fact; we'll talk later on of that; that all the impact for us in terms of the evaluation of the credit trading portfolio are in the trading profit, while we know that many other players have moved their portfolio in the banking book so they are not booking these numbers in the operating results. So I think that this is quite important. I will talk later on our investment banking. I want stress the fact that we have not changed any accounting standard. This is a key element and then we'll talk about the valuation process. But I think this is a very, very important element for you to understand our results.</p>
          <p>So talking of net write-downs; we had a reduction in the fourth quarter.  We are flat on the previous year.  This is based on cash recoveries, mainly in investment banking and to say quite clearly, the cost of investment banking has been positive because we had the repayment by customers. These repayments are mainly concentrated in Germany; this is quite an important topic. Integration costs are significantly higher than the previous year. As I said before, we have decided to book all the costs this year also for the higher and higher than expected retirement, the early retirement acceptance by our employees. So we go down to what we have seen before in terms of net income and normalized net income. The cost/income ratio is 55%, 2.6% lower than the previous year. So I would say that these are not bad at all numbers.</p>
          <p>Talking of the different revenue lines, we had very good revenue lines, good revenue growth both in net interest income and net commissions. I'd like to stress the fact that also net commissions are higher than the previous year in the fourth quarter; and quite clearly, this is not an easy environment for such kind of revenues, so the trading income are negative and we will see afterwards what about the credit rating portfolio. This is really an amount negative <mark type="inaudible" /> we had was due to the enlargement of spreads.  As we know the enlargement of spreads is continuing also in the first quarter of this year and in a quite significant way.</p>
          <p>You are business or market people so you know better than me what is the condition in this spread environment.  We can discuss quite a lot on the reasons why there are these spread divisions. We have that this is mainly a liquidity issue more than a credit risk issue and because quite clearly the spreads are so significant that in terms of credit spreads are not justifiable.  Today we are AAA. AAA in terms of rating today, asset with the spread that is larger than junk bond 12 months ago or significantly larger than junk bonds.  So quite clearly, there is a dislocation of the market that is related to a liquidity topic more than a credit risk topic. How these spreads will move is unforeseeable, so this is clearly one of the main issues all of us we do have. We have to manage properly this position and meanwhile to continue to be focused on all the rest of the activities.</p>
          <p>What about the revenue growth in the different business lines?  It has been quite good everywhere.  Quite clearly we have this negative change in MIB due to the structured credit impact, minus 431 million in the year '07, partially offset by strong results in the other business lines.  We have an increase into the asset management; quite clearly asset management in the other areas which is affected by the actual market turmoil. All the other commercial lines are doing quite well, starting from Central/Eastern European region with close to 17% growth, going to private banking, retail, and corporate. But later on we'll talk more deeply and also I'm sure that you will have questions for our colleagues.</p>
          <p>Costs, as you can see, we have a reduction in staff expenses also in the fourth quarter due to the reductions we're having in terms of total people and also due to the fact that the variable compensation in MIB is lower but clearly following the market turmoil.  Other administrative expenses are going up.  We have split this year the region where we have increase of 9.5% in constant FX and Perimeter, driven by the opening of branches, so we are adding many in Turkey, Russia, and Hungary.</p>
          <p>As you know, we have significant plan in terms of opening new branches. The timeframe for the repayment in the opening of these branches is quite short; so we are sure that this is the right way to go in these growing markets. The rest of the group is up by 3.6%, mainly driven by project developments in Holding.  For instance, Basel II is a quite an expensive project that will have a significant positive impact in terms of the reduction of capital and then we have higher cost for outsourcing IT and back office, mainly in Germany. As we know, we have outsourced the payment system to Postbank we are outsourced the GBS business.</p>
          <p>Depreciation is down year on year, thanks to the fact that we have completed in 2006 the ICT system depreciation in Bank Austria.</p>
          <p>What about the non-operating items?  We have 753 million provision for risk and charges; 1.3 billion for integration costs; 2.5 the net write-downs; then 1.7 net income for investments or the main capital gain are related to Mediobanca, 603 million; Custodian Business in Germany, 292; Indexchange, 138; and other non-strategic holding by 315.  The tax rate is likely higher than expected due to the one-off effect of German and Italy tax reforms and the adjusted tax rate would be 26.7; and we have minorities and the PPA.</p>
          <p>I think that this chart is very, very important because it gives you the strengths, the main idea of the strengths of the group, which is related to our diversification I would say both in terms of business lines and in terms of geographies.  Maybe the graphical diversification is not very visible here because as you know, we are organized by divisions so we are leading the group by division and more and more within the division by business clients.  For instance in the retail division, we have outsourced financing; therefore this is a quite important product.</p>
          <p>In the corporate business, we have leasing and global transactional banking but I think that this shows you the clients in terms of diversification and also the fact that all the divisions were very positive marginal RARORAC, which is also quite important.  Despite the market turmoil, investment banking also in '07 had a positive marginal RARORAC of 10.5%, which means &#x2013; net profit generation on the cost of capital. So I think that this is a key indicator of the strengths of the group.</p>
          <p>Retail, quite clearly has the major delta year on year because of construction in process in Germany and in Austria is a going ahead quite well; so a positive EVA also in Germany retail, which is something that I would say is pretty good you see in the market. So I am looking for the best of that. I think it's again also quite important.</p>
          <p>An update on the key topics, which are the four key topics I think are and as a stoplight; the first one is capital and funding; so finally we hope that this rumor continuously going on that the need of a capital increases would be completed right after this presentation.</p>
          <p>MIB division performances, which again is also quite important because: one, a week ago there was in London a rumor on that fact that we are having a 5 billion write-down in the structure of credit portfolios; so again I hope that everything will be clarified. Purchase price allocation, which is quite important because we will talk of Capitalia and the balance sheet of Capitalia. As you know we can talk of cleaning out he balance sheet of Capitalia goes in this voice so it is not in the profit and loss but is in the equity and finally the asset quality.</p>
          <p>Capital and funding; here we have a comparison on December '06 &#x2013; December '07. I'd like to draw you attention just for a second on the footnote because when we are talking of December '06 capital risk within asset and ratios is not pro forma, therefore they exclude Capitalia.  EVA includes Capitalia. This is important because unless we would compare <mark type="inaudible" /> and it is important for you to know.</p>
          <p>EVA, we went up by 8%, which is quite good, with the marginal RARORAC up by 16 basis points.  Since the delta EVA is the financial number which is more related to total shareholder returns and for us it's important, the return we have capable to generate to you is a key number, so this is a very important base for all our and hopefully your analysis.  The core capital is significantly up; the total capital as well.  Total risk weighted assets grew significantly both for organic growth and capital integration.  What is important is fact that the Core Tier 1 is at 5.83 despite the acquisitions we have made, many at the Tier 1 levels, and the Capitalia withdrawal rights.</p>
          <p>Tier 1 ratio is 6.54.  The core Tier I ratio and hopefully I will not have to explain again is an internal number.  As you know, it is not a regulatory number and is a number where we have defined a target in order to go back to AA rating.  Then as we know perfectly, there are players with a lower core Tier 1 ratio with AA because it's related to many different factors: for instance, how the integration process is going because a bank that has just made an integration where operationally there is a desire than a bank that has not made an integration. So there are many different factors on which the rating is calculated. But again, our capital generation has been quite &#x2013; the total capital ratio is above 10%.</p>
          <p>What about of '08?  In '08, quite clearly, we have activities that will absorb capital, namely the organic growth in risk weighted assets, which is always quite important; the squeeze-out in Germany and Austria; and the acquisition of Ukrsotsbank that we have finalized in January.  We have activities that we know will generate capital. The net profit returns remain very clearly. The disposal of Generali that if I remember correctly is the 5th or 8th of December, we let them with the expiry of the convertible bond; the disposal of BPH and the disposal of Capitalia branches. So we are considering all these things and we know that we will be in line with our expectation because we have this organic capital generation.</p>
          <p>Talking of liquidity, in terms of short term liquidity position, we have a sound and comfortable short term liquidity position for us. The liquidity position is the one month liquidity position, further improving in the first months of '08.  If we would consider 100 as a base at the year end, at the end of February we are at 180. So, we continue to improve this position.</p>
          <p>We had a significant growth of the intragroup flows, which is quite important because it gives an idea on the how effective is the group cash pooling. And finally, the short term funding base is very, very diversified both in terms of instruments and in terms of the geographical base. So to date, the short term liquidity is not any more an issue as a matter, just to be clear. So, I think that this is quite an important topic.</p>
          <p>The medium and long term funding, also here we are quite diversified both in terms of instruments and in terms of currencies.  Clearly the euro is the main currency we are using.  It is 84% of our total funding activity. So it's very clearly the main currency which we are working.  As you can see also our resources are very well diversified. And we have not &#x2013; so we have a very balanced structure on the different areas. Mainly is the institutional area, which is the main source for us.</p>
          <p>We have been able also to go to the market in a quite positive way.  In the second half of '07, we issued a 2 billion subordinated loan, which has been well accepted by market. And in February '08, we went to the market with 2.5 billion senior bond &#x2013; 5 year senior bond.  Also that is quite important; we had demand of 6.4 billion; so it is quite important in terms of acceptance of the market.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet is not mismatched. This is also quite important.  The liquidity ratio limit is above 0.90. This is also quite important because to date having back a liquid market in the short term, there could be a mismatch that in theory is favorable in terms of economics for sure will increase the liquidity <mark type="inaudible" />. We continue to have very sound policy also in this perspective.</p>
          <p>Talking of the MIB performance, quite clearly this business line has been hit by the market turmoil. This was quite natural. I would say that comparing with our peers, we have performed quite well. The first half has been a record performance and the second half has been hindered by the weakness in the structured credit portfolio with strong results in the other business lines.</p>
          <p>Structured Credit; there has been a significant spread widening impacting the diversified and high quality 15.8 ABS portfolio. 98% of this portfolio is investment grade. We have very low exposure to the US.  It is the more or less 10% of the total portfolio. We have negligible US subprime; it is more or less 1% of the total portfolio. So again, we don't know how to say that subprime is not an issue for us. The portfolio is marked to market with strict price verification process. There is a chart on what is the valuation system we have and the profit and loss is impacted primarily on a mark-to-market basis versus incurred losses. We will provide also for you the number on that.</p>
          <p>If you ask me what can happen in terms of mark to market, I'm unable to answer because quite clearly the enlargement of spread is still having a negative impact. This is completely clear to all of us. I think the examination finance plan that's in your city. So there is or maybe even as a secondary school. So it's quite clear to me &#x2013; to all of us.</p>
          <p>If you ask me what is foreign capital on the market, if I would able to answer, I would be a very rich man. I'm not so it is quite clear that it is not possible to answer. So and if you have a crystal ball, please give it to me; we will try to use it.</p>
          <p>We have a very modest exposure to the other critical areas; 5.1 billion our sponsored conduits, down by 70% since June '07. We have no losses and have been fully consolidated by the year end.  In the 5.83 of Core Tier 1, there is a full consolidation of the conduit. There is only one conduit that has not been consolidated.  It is Bavaria TRR because the 21st of February, as we have said to you in June, is expired, so it is not there anymore. We have less then 75 million net exposure to third party SIV. We don't have SIV sponsored by us. 24 million direct exposure to monoliners and the LBO underwriting portfolio features high quality credit stories.  We'll spend some words also on that.</p>
          <p>Talking of markets, as you know, the organization in investment banking is market investment banking and principal investment. Talking of markets, here we have the performance in '07,+ the full year.  As you can see, revenues went down by 33%. We have negative results in the fourth quarter vis-&#xE0;-vis positive results in the fourth quarter of '06. You can see how has been the performance in fixed income currencies in this business line and the equities line year on year and the structured credit performance year on year.  We had a positive performance in '06 and a negative performance in '07.</p>
          <p>The realized losses in the fourth quarter have been 149 million. The mark-to-market negative is 277 and the other is negative by 50 million. It's only related to the spread widening; more than 90% are held for trading of this portfolio. So it is clearly having &#x2013; and we have not changed any classifications. So this is exactly what we had at the beginning of the year; is a negative mark to market that if the spread will go back, quite clearly it's not easy to say when this can happen, will have a positive impact.</p>
          <p>Portfolio composition, as I said before, the total portfolio is 15.8, for us gross and net is exactly the same because we don't have any hedging. We have made, as you can imagine, a significant analysis on the reporting of all our competitors.  Being one of the latest, we have this advantage; and then have to comment also why we are one of the latest because the number of information we have to provide is dramatically higher than for any other country because this is country driven, the level of information. And we have to do the consolidation line by line for all the companies of the group, while for instance in other countries is accepted the suite consolidated concept.</p>
          <p>As you can imagine having I think 1,300 companies, many are nearly 1,300, more than that, companies to book consolidated line by line is something which is very, very complex and then you have all the reporting.  It is not a matter that we are lazy, not at all.  The problem is that we have a very significant set of information. But this brings us also some advantages because we have the opportunity to analyze the reporting of all our competitors.  And in many cases, we have seen that there are significant portfolios that are in the banking book today.</p>
          <p>There is no explanation on the structure of the portfolio or not always is this completely clear.  And in many cases there are hedges, so we know that there have been significant losses on the fact that the correlation went past. And so, the hedging strategy was not paying the hedging losses on the hedging side.  We don't have any idea.  This is also the reason why we are so low exposure to the monoliners we got the hedging strategy in many cases has been on the hedging activity with them. So for us, gross and net is exactly the same.</p>
          <p>Out of this 15.8 billion of total market value, 1.7 is US and of this, 164 million is subprime. As I said before, there are no hedging risks.  A very significant portion, close to 90% is still today we have with people at 'AA' rating. 97.6% is investment grade, also this is I think is quite important.</p>
          <p>In terms of the valuation, we have the front office valuation, as you can imagine; and then we have an independent price verification process, which is used to value the structured credit portfolio. The lack of liquidity following the turmoil in the credit markets has further highlighted the importance of an independent pricing methodology for structured credit products. What we do, HVB and MIB use an independent price verification process to provide an independent check of front office prices.  On a monthly basis, market risk controller compares prices from the front office with those of leading data providers and external counterparts. Positions are also ranked based on data sources and then on top of that to take account of potential liquidity constraints, a fair value adjustment may be also added. Results are analyzed and reviewed with the front office.</p>
          <p>The combination of independent price valuation and fair value adjustment is used to generate prudent valuations.  I think this is quite important and the results are important because to give you an idea on the quality of this valuation; in January, we have sold 24 million of the US subprime exposure.  At the end of December, the number was 154.  At the end of the February, it is 118, so it is even lower than the 164.  We have sold 24 million without negative impact on the profit and loss. That means exactly that the independent price valuation works pretty well.</p>
          <p>I think that this is again quite important.  We have being always consistent because at the end of August, we have communicated the 354 million; so this is your risk. I want to stress that this is a stock because this morning I received a question but the 154 million are the losses not this is a stock we had at the year end, so which is different and today is even lower.</p>
          <p>Conduits, as I said before, the conduits are fully consolidated.  Bavaria TRR, completely expired the 21st of February; there is no meaningful impact on quarter one.  The profit and loss impact in '07 of the overall conduits has been close &#x20AC;20 million; so it is completely negligible.  Again I think this was one of the main worries when we are talking one day and in fact there was a rumor that we would have other 40 million &#x2013; 40 billion, I don't remember what.  Again, these are the numbers that are fully consolidated. So, there is not any more any potential worries; we didn't have any even before but I think the matter is completely clear.</p>
          <p>SIV, today we are 74 million in third-party SIVs.  Profit and loss impact in '07 has been 100 million. Also on that, we have been very conservative if in the future, there will be any cash back.</p>
          <p>Monoliners; we do not use monoliners in hedging strategies. So we don't have CDS with monoliners as a direct counterpart. The direct exposure by direct issue bonds to the 5 monoliners is 24 million as a total. We don't have any exposure to ACA, direct or indirect. The indirect exposure to high rated US municipalities via Tender Option Bond programs is 535 million. We have underlying backed by the five monoliners.  That means that the monoliners are insurers although these municipalities, sorry the second lien to creditworthiness of each municipality. So we think that our exposure is limited and indirect and well diversified.</p>
          <p>Talking of investment banking, their performance has been pretty good during the year, plus 39%. There has been a very good performance also in the principal investment area. That has been quite positive for us but also the financing has been pretty good.</p>
          <p>And finally, talking of the underwriting portfolio, we are at 4.9 billion. 99% is Europe.  As you know, 3 billion is alliance with and Valentino to one &#x2013; alliance with Valentino. Also on that, we received many questions of why this is not marked to market. Our credit portfolio is in the banking book. But we have done the valuation is net of these, and so it is 98. We go through an impairment test every month.  The credit stories are quite good. So we don't have any issue in this portfolio.</p>
          <p>Purchase price allocation. In terms of process just to be clear, purchase price allocation is a process where there is a firm auditor that manages the process.  It has been PriceWaterhouse. Then is a check with us and with our auditors.  This is quite important.  We made an adjustment on the loan portfolio of 600 million.  We made an adjustment on Trevi of 500 million.  There is a positive fair value adjustment on other owned securities, other assets and performing loans by 1.4. We have an adjustment, negative adjustment; the sign '+' is a negative; it's "a reduction" of the capital. The positive &#x2013; the negative sign is an increase of capital. Liabilities for 200 million fair value adjustment on liabilities and accounting alignment, mainly legal cost and non-used holidays. Fiscal effect at 100 million; so in terms of total impact Core Tier 1 is zero basis point; it's rounding.  The adjustment on the credit portfolio, I think that this was the main issue on which we were continuing to discuss, has been 1.1 billion, so the portfolio has been cleaned up.</p>
          <p>Asset quality; Capitalia asset quality, we had this reduction in terms of net impaired loans and coverage ratio on impaired loans is also due to the PPA of 600 million, as we were talking before. So there has been a significant improvement of the coverage ratio.</p>
          <p>The Trevi exposure is down to 1.370 billion.  For the Trevi 1 and Trevi 2, we do expect to unwound the position though there are not any more bondholders; so during the year they will cut loose. It will come back on our books.  It's important for us because in this way we'll reduce the cost of managing the vehicle in terms of external cost.</p>
          <p>In Trevi 3, there are still external bondholders, so we will keep the vehicle. To date with this adjustment of 100 million and with a coverage ratio of 73% and collateralized exposure of 33%, we think that the Trevi topic is not anymore a topic for our discussion. UniCredit is managing the old portfolio. We have closed the joint venture with Goldman Sachs, so it's managed by our very efficient workout unit.</p>
          <p>HVB is still reducing significantly that our portfolio. This is the last time we'll report on the RER portfolio. We have a 2.1 gross volume billion at the end of February. This is an estimation at the end of February.  The net is in the range of 400 million. So we don't report anymore on the RER portfolio.  Also, the special credit portfolio is going significantly down.  This is quite important both in term of risk rated weighted assets because as you remember, this is the pro forma portfolio which is not positive in terms of value creation. So the fact that have been able to reduce by 8 billion since the creation is quite good in terms of funding where clearly this reduction is an important element.  So we think that HVB has been very successful in managing these two items.</p>
          <p>So the total net impaired loans at the group level went down by 3 billion, which is in our opinion very, very relevant. We are down by 75 basis points since December '06, which again is not bad at all; and the coverage ratio went up by 3%. So we are at 54.5%, which is a significant improvement in the year.</p>
          <p>Cost of risk is stable. On the previous year, we had reduction quarter on quarter.  As you can see, this is due mainly to Germany were we had very positive cash recovery, mainly in MIB and in Corporate. Austria, the reduction is due to the fact also that in '06, we had an exceptional write-off in the retail portfolio; so it went down quite significantly.  But without the one-off the reduction is less relevant.</p>
          <p>Capitalia Integration, we have three main areas.  Business model, the integration of the former Capitalia network in our model is doing quite well. This is very, very important for us in terms of the homogenization of quality service for us and also for having the right efficiency in the activity of redesigning the portfolios of customers assigned to each of the portfolio managers.  We had a significant reduction of the need for portfolio managers.  That is quite important to be able to increase the number of new customers that we will be able to manage with the portfolio managers because we have bringing up people.</p>
          <p>In terms of our restructuring, there is significant room for cost reduction of human resources, right-sizing.  As we said, we have 7,800 people that accepted our early retirement plan.  It is 14% of the Italian employee base, so it is quite a lot. The unification of back office, Central Functions, Product Factories, and IT is well ongoing.  You will see the plan for the migration.  By the end of October, everything will be realized. So you remember that we have signed the contract the 1st of October so it's 13 months to complete the restructuring of 2,000 branches in the last 13 months I think is quite good.</p>
          <p>We have significant growth related to the alignment of productivity and penetration gap in Retail and Corporate.  So we see some numbers. First of all, in terms of aligning the business model, what we have already done, we have done the Private virtual carve-out and the Corporate Big Bang, so banking for corporate customers.  We have redesigned Bipop, Banca di Roma, and Banco di Sicilia in order to have the private banking customer as a corporate customer already managed by people that in spite of the fact that they are still in these banks where there is a close connection with the private banking people and the corporate people.  Quite clearly, this has been done with a strong analysis in terms of compliance, which is quite important for us. This is the right way to have them immediately in alignment in terms of service model and also to avoid problems in terms of competition on the corporate customer mainly because as you can imagine, where a corporate customer followed by more than one bank of the group can create issues in terms of a service model.</p>
          <p>The business real carve out will be realized the first of November.  As I said before by the end of October, we will have all the migration so we do expect to have the merger and the spin-off of the different activities.</p>
          <p>2,000 people already went out. 2,800 are expected to leave the company in '08; 1,600 in '09; and 1,400 in '10.  Again, we already said that but I think that the fact that we have been able to add 2,000 people leaving with the retirement window of the 1st of October at the same day we signed the agreement is something exceptional. I think it's very important because to give an idea on the effect, we are apparently quite capable in managing the structure and process and so it always embarrassing to say something positive of the &#x2013; but we have 2,000 people that are accepted the early retirement plan before the signing of the contract of the merger, these things that we have negotiated with the trade unions. We have agreed with them. We have sent out the invitation letter to the eligible employees. They have accepted and it was pretty complex.</p>
          <p>We have the integration of Bipop Carire in the second quarter, Banca di Roma if I remember correctly the Ferragosto day, Banco di Sicilia by the last weekend of October. We need a weekend for our integration for Banca di Roma, which is the larger bank; we use three days. It's quite important that these things are very well planned because you have very small windows for realizing the integration.  But by end of October, everything will be completely realized.</p>
          <p>In term of synergies, we do expect to have higher synergies both as a total; here we are talking of cost synergies, and in '08.  These are more or less as the same amount that we have been able to anticipate at the beginning and is mainly related to staff costs but also other costs. So 76% of the hire reduction, 120 million in '08, is staff costs due to the exits we have seen before.</p>
          <p>Customers, here is a short snapshot on retail.  We have significant room for improvement both in small business and in the household areas in small business. We have significant room for increasing the number of customers with credit lines, which is quite important because at the end, it is a long base which creates the most significant profitability area for the small business activity and also there is very significant room for improving the capability of acquiring new customers.  Here we have a comparison of what happened in '07 in Banca di Roma and in UniCredit Banca. The numbers are completely different. The possibilities were exactly the same.</p>
          <p>In retail, these are the three areas where we do see good room for revenue growth in the current account, revolving credit cards, and Bancassurance.  Just to give you an idea on what's happening, for instance, in summary in '08, here we have a gross margin from sales of investment products in the first two months of '07 and the first two months of '08. If the first two months of '07 were a base 100, we are at 140. The consumer lending new products sold are up by 11%. This is a total volume in January, February. And while the 25% credit consumer protection &#x2013; sorry, Credit Protection Insurance in '07, now 75% do have a Consumer Protection Insurance.</p>
          <p>The loan stock &#x2013; short term loan stock in small business in two months went up by 7%. This is also quite important and is due to the fact that we have reorganized the portfolios, as I was saying before.</p>
          <p>Also in corporate, you'll remember that talking of the revenue synergies, we were not talking of corporate because we were not capable to analyze the corporate numbers from outside.  Now we start to have some numbers and we think that there is significant room for improving the profitability of the corporate business both on the revenue side of the corporate and the cost side.</p>
          <p>Talking of revenue and loans in Capitalia and we are talking about Mid Corporate, the revenues on loans were 2.7% while in UniCredit Banca d'Impresa we are at 3.2. And we are talking of the same customer base in terms of dimension, because quite clearly this can change significantly if you add the last corporates. To be honest, Capitalia was quite good.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost/income ratio, the cost/income ratio fraction in Capitalia is almost twice than the one we have at UniCredit Banca d'Impresa, so also in terms of cost that we think that there is significant room for improvement in the corporate area.</p>
          <p>2008 outlook, we are expecting &#x2013; we are seeing a very good performance of commercial banking overall with Central Eastern Europe and former Capitalia banks growing at the stronger pace. There is this strong dislocation of financial market which is severely impacting the first quarter and it might be a result due to the enlargement of spreads. So we have overall very low visibility on '08 development for MIB and asset management.</p>
          <p>We have a distinctive restructuring potential in Capitalia in Italy, Pekao-BPH in Poland, and we will continue to work quite clearly also on HVB and Bank Austria. The capital position will be strengthened by year end thanks to what I said before, internal capital generation plus the disposal of the assets I was talking of.</p>
          <p>Now, with the colleagues, we will really happy answer to all your questions. Thanks a lot.</p>
          <p>Sorry, as usual we have before the question of analysts that are in the room, afterwards analyst that are connected in video conference or teleconference, and finally journalists. Sorry if we follow this order but this is just a way for managing the discussion in the best way. So thanks a lot.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Yes, just a few questions from me. The first one is for Mr. Ermotti on the MIB division. I'm just wondering whether you can give us some guidance on the profitability of the division.  We have seen 1 billion net profit in 2006 increasing to 2.1 in 2007. You still have &#x2013; I understand the target was 1.6 billion, but I see the consensus of the analyst is actually much lower is around 800 million &#x2013; 1 billion of net profits for your division. I'm just wondering whether you can comment on these and reconfirm your targets.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the trend of the net interest income, which has been very good in the fourth quarter.  We have seen 450 million in your division against an average of 350 million in the previous quarters. The other two questions are on the <mark type="inaudible" /> I'm just wondering whether you can confirm you capital targets for 2008 and whether you can give us any indications of risk weighted asset growth in 2008? We have seen 3% growth in 2006, roughly 6% growth in 2007.  This year, I think, the securitization market is shut.  I'm just wondering whether you can give us any indications and finally on the 1.2 billions on one-off write-offs on Capitalia, if you can give us a breakdown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the outlook for MIB for 2008, as Mr. Profumo quite clearly mentioned, I think we are not in a position to do forecasts at this point in time. I think it's quite clear that the first quarter is quite disruptive compared to Q3 and Q4, particularly compared to Q4, where you still have some I would say strong activity by clients across all their asset classes outside credit. We are starting to see deterioration of the activities like any of our competitors and therefore I think that trying to forecast 2008 is absolutely not appropriate at this point in time. I can only reconfirm that the first quarter has been quite challenging, to say the least, for the same basic reason; i.e., spreads widening even further compared to Q3 and Q4, and total reduction of activity across the board. So for sure, the outlook at this point in time is quite difficult to be made and in any case, can be very positive.</p>
          <p>In respect to the net interest income line, partially due to the fact that still owning the 5 millions in the LBO portfolio that are for under-writing; this is generating interest income. Otherwise, I would say that there is also some movement between trading line and interest line depending on the position you are owning in trading but otherwise, there is nothing particular.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you had questions on the capital and risk weighted assets. In terms of risk weighted assets, we expect 2008 to be a modest continued growth in risk weighted assets. We expect mid-single digit growth in risk weighted assets. With regard to the capital position, we don't have a specific target now. You know that we have a long term target that remains at 6.8% at Core Tier 1, which obviously will not be achieved. We don't expect that to be achieved within 2008, but it does remain a meaningful long term target for the management. We do expect the Core Tier 1performance to continuously increase, and so we would expect to be above 6%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Francesca Tondi from JPMorgan. I also have a few questions. Going back to your trading line, you had a large trading loss &#x2013; or you had a trading loss in Q4 at the group level. I look at the investment banking division and I don't see a trading loss there. I'm thinking to reconcile a little bit that where that is.  Also implied, it would seem to me that the markdown is larger than the 470 or 80 million you have on the structured credit portfolio. Did you have a markdown on your vanilla bond portfolio? Were there some losses there as well? If you can just reconcile that for us a little bit.  Also, how is your sensitivity that you gave us; 1 basis point, 6 million loss that you gave us as an indication in Q4, has that changed in Q1? Has anything changed in terms of the structure there? And what do you have in the 21% other assets in your IBS portfolio?</p>
          <p>And then couple of questions on capital and risk-weighted assets. How did you manage to keep risk-weighted assets flat in the fourth quarter, better than the third? You consolidated in the ATF bank. Were you able to sell or how did you actually manage that trend? Question on capital; your core capital that you gave us on slide 28 is 33.5 billion. The 13 point pro forma that you gave us end of '06 is 33 billion. That's a minimum 3.5 billion retained earnings. You consolidated more, so you have some parts of goodwill, but it was still coming at least 1 billion higher than what you have. PPA I can see is neutral. Can you just reconcile capital without &#x2013; what is missing in between? Do you have an available reserve that has gone negative or has been reduced? I don't know if that is an explanation, if you just can give us some visibility there. This is it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You should take this question because I don't know what she is talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Trading profits that we have at the total Group level are largely determined by the MIB division. Obviously, the MIB division normally are securities obviously outside the structured credit. There is a portion of trading profit that is negative that is accrued affecting the Corporate Center and that's simply what I would say the treasury operations and some of the securities that have been obviously marked down. Taking into account that also plain vanilla bonds obviously have had enlarged spreads and to the extent that <mark type="inaudible" /> for trading obviously those of in markdown even if there is no impairment upon that from a credit standpoint. However, the majority &#x2013; the large majority of total credit &#x2013; trading profit actually accrued to the MIB division in the fourth quarter and specifically within the MIB division through the HVB and obviously the remaining portion obviously to Bank Austria, where the MIB division is split between HVB Germany and Austria.</p>
          <p>Now in terms &#x2013; if I understood correctly the question on the Core Tier 1 in terms of how that dynamic obviously has actually taken place between &#x2013; the performance clearly brings a lot of other elements that come into the Core Tier 1 because there are also deductions as well as positive aspects in terms of both available and reserves. But the reality is that the majority of the performance needs to be actually attributed to both organic; i.e., net income generation; obviously offset whether we spread it out as growth as you have seen, plus obviously treasury shares, in this case with extraordinary withdrawal rights, so treasury shares that we bought back effectively thus reducing the capital or the group; there is no denying this point that we have showed. Clearly, you have the acquisitions specifically of ATF and Capitalia, so when you look at it's not only the risk weighted assets that bring with the acquisition, but also the deduction of goodwill associated with acquisition itself.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just a follow-up for Mr. Ranieri, can we just assume that the difference between the trending line negative at the Group and what is shown as the write-down in the MIB division than if the markdown on your bond portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, sorry if I can the trading profit in MIB is negative for &#x2013; slightly more than the Group negative in profit. So, because we have not provided the quarterly results division by division &#x2013; but remember, if I add this 345 negative for MIB and the Group is 321; so there is a slightly positive difference of 24 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct, but there are also some positive differences beyond what the portfolio says so the majority of the trading losses are in MIB and there is a portion of bond which is in the Treasury operations of the Group.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. When I looked at the quarterly numbers on a divisional basis, it seems likely a bigger difference.  But I will take your word for that and I'll check my numbers again. My question on the 21% breakdown of the ABS was pretty much what is in there, is it mix of assets?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning Guglielmo Zadra from Morgan Stanley. I have three questions, I guess the first one for Mr. Ermotti.  If we take specifically the 1.7 billion of US ABS exposure, can you give us up breakdown of that; identify the subprime what else is there?  And I don't know is it possible to get a gross number? I don't think the 1.17 is the net exposure or is it the gross?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry, Guglielmo; as I said, we don't have any hedged; so gross and net is exactly the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>100% the same...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Specifically before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and so if we can have a breakout of the type of the positions of the exposures in the 1.7 billion. Second again on the MIB, it's a question that was already asked before, but can you be a bit more precise because there is a 120 million increase fourth quarter on third quarter, which means a 42% Q-on-Q NII growth.  As you say, it's partially due to the portfolio underlying, but what's &#x2013; I guess if you are seeing a slipping of the yield curve, probably part of profit go up as NII accounting wise. Can you try to quantify what you would say the trading portion of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You already got the answer. First of all I think is partially what I mentioned to your colleague and the second part is due to some normal shift from trading lines to interest line.  And last but not least what you say that kind of macro hedge; during the crisis we took position on the stiffening of the yield curve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you know how much that is in terms of euro, like 100 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a good portion of this, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. On the retail, I have two questions. If I look at the quarterly data, it looks like Germany and Austria both in terms of total revenues, it's the weakest quarter of the full four quarters of 2007; so if you can just elaborate on those negative trends in the fourth quarter both for Germany and Austria?  And in Italy, I see a pickup in cost of credit in the fourth quarter, which is quite substantial in the retail Italy. Is it just accruing ahead of the deceleration we are seeing in the macroeconomic scenario or it there something more specific to that?  And the fourth, the risk and charges, I'm not sure if maybe I missed the explanation, it's quite substantial in the fourth quarter.  Is there maybe any over-provisioning ahead of Parmalat's settlement? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I take your question on the breakdown of the US portion. I think that student loans 8% and residential mortgage 10% and commercial 19 and CLO 31.  Those are the main categories of IU breakdown to 1.7.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also in Germany, fourth quarter was a little bit a softer in terms of increasing commissions on the asset gathering side, as well as we had a little bit of stress effect in the &#x2013; also especially in Austria in the deposit taking activity. As far as the variation in the cost of risk in Italy, it is mainly related to one position with the public authority where we took an additional increase of coverage.  It was a position already classified where we increased the coverage level. And there is &#x2013; but it is really not so sizable, some slight increase in the mortgage provision in Banca per la Casa; that is not a very significant impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you are not seeing any deterioration in your consumer lending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No; currently we are seeing in reality positive trends in our consumer lending activity. We have seen a stable trend in all small business activities.  And mortgage, where we had some deterioration in the first half of the year in terms of classifications, now it's quite stable also as a result of our changing commercial policy that we undertook in the course of 2008 &#x2013; sorry, '07.  And that is continuing this year where we are reducing the portion of third-party originated mortgages and increasing instead the portion of spontaneous, so own customers' mortgage penetration.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Enrico Racioppi from Cazenove. I have a first question.  Do you have any structured credit products within your asset management division? For example, <mark type="inaudible" /> given the outflow that you're experiencing and the poor performance of operating profit? Second question is, we know that the LBOs helped too much everything but we know also that it experienced &#x20AC;0.90 on the market. Can we have some specificity on the potential write-downs on the less than &#x20AC;10 million LBOs in the banking book? Last question is, you stated that the positive will offset the negative in terms of Q1 next year?</p>

          <p>First of all, on taking the proxy of &#x2013; on the banking book, we have 5 billion across 40 different underlying creditors. So we are taking &#x2013; being part of the overall banking book, we are taking a quarterly review on the performance and we do impairments. So using the index in any case would not be appropriate since it's not a meaningful figure.</p>
          <p>In respect of marking the underwriting portfolio to same level, I think that again one should focus on the fact that we are a clear European story.  It's 5 billion, clearly concentrated into &#x2013; with two insurers. And taking the proxy, which includes mainly US huge problems in that sector, would be totally inappropriate, not only in reference of the marking policy, but also in having continuity with the fact that we have been adopting across the board in any assets classes a very stable policy in accounting. So, we have been always treating this position in this way. We are not recognizing fees ahead of the potential syndication or movement into the banking book.  Therefore, we are comfortable with this position.</p>

          <p>You asked about the capital outlook for 2008. Clearly obviously, our projection is based on our expected capital organic generation, taking to account that, as I said, yes indeed; there are some let's say "acquisitions" in terms of <mark type="inaudible" /> BA-CA, and HBV plus the growth funds which are already based obviously in the projection across <mark type="inaudible" /> which will be already in the first quarter.  We do expect that between the net capital generation &#x2013; net of the risk weighted asset growth plus the capital gains that are included or disposals because some of the disposals may not generated a capital gain but may free up capital, would indeed provide us the path to increase our Core Tier 1 target from the one that we have basically finished in 2007. So, our projections, as I said before, are in line consistent with those acquisitions we have performed and obviously with the business plan of the year. I would like also to add that these numbers are obviously Basel I, so they don't take yet any benefits of Basel II implementation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we will be aiming Basel II advance model for the Italian segment excluding Capitalia and that will be done as of first quarter 2008, providing the disclosure because it needs to be approved by Bank of Italy. We don't know yet whether it's going to be in time for the first quarter reporting cycle.  But indeed as of the first quarter, we will be on Basel II. The expectation is that Basel II would generate a net benefit in terms of risk weighted assets and therefore obviously on Core Tier 1. Net benefit clearly, but you know that in terms of Basel II, obviously, it is also dependent on the overall credit environment because obviously there are some elements of cyclicality for Basel II; but our expectation is that there will be a net benefit on the Core Tier 1 already accruing in the first quarter.</p>

          <p>Hello, Sarah Gentleman from Sanford Bernstein. A couple questions, three questions actually. Firstly investment banking; given the uncertainty around revenues and the outlook for 2008, do you have any restructuring plans or changes in strategic focus that result from this? Secondly, a question on Eastern Europe and Poland; could you comment on the risks within the region, specifically referencing foreign exchange lending risks, which we hearing quite a bit about at the moment?  And thirdly, you've made some relatively bold statements ruling out major M&amp;A. I wonder if you could comment again on those and say if there are any situations in which you would reconsider, particularly in light of what happened to <mark type="inaudible" /> talked about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer immediately to the third question quickly and the answer is no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going to your question in terms of restructuring charges vis-&#xE0;-vis I think we are clearly looking at &#x2013; practically what we can do in terms of strategic shifts, I have to say that we are not anticipating any major shifts in our strategy vis-&#xE0;-vis investment banking is very clear. We want to stay very focused geographically speaking and being aligned on what our corporate clients are in the group; therefore, leveraging the strength of the group in Italy, Germany, Austria, and Central and Eastern Europe. We have stayed focused on a few asset classes as you saw in the presentation. So, where we have I think something that we think we can compete and add value to our clients and shareholders. So in that sense, we are not really planning to make any changes following this environment. So of course: one, we would look at an even more selective way and stringent way to basically contain basically lack of bottom line generated by the revenues environment with further action on cost, but I have to say this will not impact our strategy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>ForEx and currency, our overall exposure is significantly more prudent than most competitors.  As you know for instance in Poland, Bank Pekao in the past has been always very, very strict on this activity. BPH was a bit more aggressive, but we are moving quite strongly towards Pekao's attitude, so that currently new FX-based mortgages effectively only given to affluent customers with more than adequate credit worthiness.  Also the activities that we have in another countries is quite prudent in FX.  Where we have it, it is almost exclusively in euros, so no Swiss francs or yen or exotic currencies. And when it's made, credit criteria are must stricter than in domestic currency lending.  It means, for instance, salary, installment over salary is lower loan to value or lower et cetera, et cetera. But generally speaking, if you compare our policy with our competitors, you clearly see a much more prudent stance. Also regulators in certain countries like Romania are starting to give indications to all players to move out from this activity to reduce <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

        <plist>
          <p>Allow me to complement my answer vis-&#xE0;-vis restructuring.  For sure, one of the things which we are contemplating doing is isolate. The effect of the ABS portfolio ups and downs to the rest of the business, just to make sure that both internally &#x2013; particularly internally, externally we can explain, but internally we don't create an environment where we throw out the baby with the water because clearly the business &#x2013; the underlying business is still performing and serving our client base but these major swings in the P&amp;L may force or give the idea that we take action which would be totally inappropriate across the entire business lines.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Marcello Zanardo, Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. I have three questions.  The first one is on net interest income and business allocation. The second is on provisions, and the third is on Eastern Europe. And then, a fourth one actually is a detail. Starting from provisions on page 34, you disclosed your provision breakdown by country. Mr. Nicastro partly committed before just on the retail division. I was wondering, if I look also at the divisional breakdown, which you provided via email, I looked that despite small numbers, Poland in Q4 provided only 9 basis points on the Q4 numbers and the rest of CEE, you provided 42 bps. So my question is, in Italy the provisions are going up.  Considering the terrible situation we're in and I understand your difficulties to forecast on MIB but at least from the year end until the first part of 2008, what are you seeing especially in the Eastern European market on the provisional line? And if you could give us some more details on the positive provision you are seeing in the German division? Is it just a one-off; is it the trend you are seeing? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question on NII, banks that are lucky and good enough to have retail depositors I think are thinking very carefully what to do because on the asset management for instance in Italy, I think part of the disaster we are seeing is also a spontaneous choice by the bank. They're saying we put the deposit, net interest income is cheaper to finance; so mainly to Mr. Nicastro if you could tell us how you're changing your strategy for 2008 where visibility is low. On a risk adjusted basis, in which countries and in which product, corporate, retail, small business, are you pushing more loans because you can reprice more adequately the asset spread or you think your deposit spread will continue to go up because at the movement, net interest income is contributing a lot and if we see fees getting weaker because of the market, that's the choice I think you'll have to do. So that's the second question.</p>
          <p>The third question is on Eastern Europe, if you could give us &#x2013; we hear a lot of negative talks on countries which do not contribute a lot to your profitability so that's good, Romania, Bulgaria and also on the Baltics. But it would be interesting to see what you see on the ground, both on the revenue side considering volumes which were phenomenal in the last two years and considering provisions, so just overall trends in the Baltic, in Rumania and Bulgaria.</p>
          <p>And the detail question, the PPA; is now Capitalia fair adjustment a one-off or are we going to see PPA on a yearly ongoing basis according to market conditions? Is it all done or is it recurring clearly the amounts would be...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can take the PPA question. As you know, PPA as we know so, every year you cannot have a PPA because a PPA technically closes within 12 months of the appreciation. So in any case, the PPA will be closed by the fourth quarter or the window of PPA will be closed by the fourth quarter of 2008. The PPA does not allow adjustment for events subsequent to the merger date, which is the 1st of October. So, any deterioration as you said that tomorrow may happens, this will go through the P&amp;L , even if that deterioration happens. So you cannot charge the PPA for events that are subsequent to the merger date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, a few questions on CEE loss and so on. So as far the provision level, we see in 2008 in CEE some increase, but not very different from the increase we expect in the top line, so not let's say something that can impact negatively the division or the region P&amp;L. The effect we saw in the course of 2007 has been as a whole it was overall a good year. We saw some increase in some of the new countries. So for instance, Kazakhstan had a significant increase mainly based on the due diligence that we did in light &#x2013; in the line of the acquisition. But generally speaking, when we look at CEE, currently we are not seeing any material deterioration in the operating environment, in the asset quality, neither on the corporate nor on the retail sector. And even the latest on the ground signals or according to them, are really not showing deterioration. Clearly, when one looks forward, should we &#x2013; a global ramp, the band would translate into Western Europe.  Then clearly that can affect obviously CEE region. But currently really the overall operational performance of customers falls in line with expectations in being quite positive. So, even countries such as Romania and Bulgaria in this moment are not showing material or actual deterioration in the operational performance and in the asset quality.</p>
          <p>Your question on lending policies; as far as Italy is concerned, currently we are still seeing nice and positive growth in the overall small business area. But after a few years in which the small business activity was a bit lower than the past.  Effectively 2007, we are still seeing the beginning of 2008 being some positive revamp. There is a jump back. In this context, we are taking advantage of the situation within Capitalia. Capitalia is thought of as being a low &#x2013; with a low penetration in small business activity. And we have seen quite an interesting opportunity there that we are growing so we expect to continue a nice growth in small business lending, both in the private bank and in Capitalia.</p>
          <p>Looking at consumer lending, there is clearly a slowdown in the overall market growth but the market is still growing quite nicely and we are seeing also this year double-digit volume growth. Mortgage is instead the area in which we have seen a slowdown in new loan generation. The slowdown is driven &#x2013; is due to also a lowering of the amount of housing transactions in the country. And there we have been proceeding in the latest months to a more accelerated risk-based pricing. What we have is both; both an overall increase in the average prices but also better differentiation by risk or credit worthiness of the issuer &#x2013; of the borrower, sorry. The market has not moved yet but we expect also other players have to start and follow this trend. Generally speaking, the expectations for this year are a double digit lowering of the new volumes of mortgage issued. In this context, as I commented before, we have a much higher mix of own customers and new mortgage versus third parties and new mortgages.</p>
          <p>Austria and Germany, instead there, we are quite flatter in terms of small business.  We are not that aggressive in mortgage in Germany, where the spreads are just not attractive enough. In Austria, we are a little bit more proactive in the mortgage business, where instead the margins are interesting. Consumer lending we have the opposite situation.  In Austria, we don't want to grow. In Germany, we see some room for growth and we are pursuing it.  In reality, our <mark type="inaudible" /> and consumer finance has already issued over 100,000 revolving cards after eight months of entry into the country; all of these being HVB existing customers.</p>

          <p>Hello; Arturo de Frias from Dresdner Kleinwort. I wanted to ask about liquidity because I think Mr. Profumo made a couple of very useful comments about liquidity. My first question would be just a number.  What is the percentage of your debt securities in issue of your wholesale debt that is going to maturity, just to have an indication? And then what are your plans if these spreads continue to be so high because I'm sure it's quite painful for you to issue five year senior paying. I think you paid 78 basis points as spread...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>87.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or 87 &#x2013; sorry, 87 basis points over rate swaps which obviously are very expensive price to commit for 4 &#x2013; 5 years.  If the spreads on senior debt do not come down, what are you going to do?  Obviously I guess you are now funding every maturity in the short term and you will continue to do that, no? If you don't see any improvement in the spreads, would you consider growing a bit less in risk weighted assets or would you allow the mix between short term and long term to go up momentarily until you see a better performance of the long term prices? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, the two questions, which of the five questions; in terms of maturity of some of medium and long term, we can say that approximately 20% of my debt expires this year, 12 months.  That's the way we track it.  We do not compromise our structures. We have, as I said, a liquidity ratio.  We don't play the market in trying to guess what the prices of the market or the spread of market will be tomorrow or the day after.  Clearly we try to optimize our different channels to the market. I would like to point out that when we entered the market in September and in October last year, people were thinking that spreads would actually shrink.  In reality, spreads have actually widened. So I think nobody can &#x2013; knows exactly where the spreads are going to go. We have a structured liquidity policy.  We follow that and we don't compromise with that risk. Said that obviously, we try to find the channels and the instruments that are most appropriate and cheapest in the way of access in that market.</p>
          <p>I would like to point out that in Italy during 2008, there will be the new cover bond.  The potential issuance has been approved, but not yet.  Nobody has not yet gone into the market, which clearly provides for an additional tool, possibly cheaper than the one obviously we see when we go into unsecured funding, unsecured institutional funding. So clearly risk policy is what we follow. The cost of funding is higher.  Therefore you need to look at how you can actually manage your risk assets that you bring to the group so to make sure that you capture the appropriate level of profit in the relationship with the customers. It's not only the risk weighted assets in terms of the lending to a customer, but it is the overall relationship with customers. But we don't want to take undue risks on liquidity simply because somebody is assuming that spreads tomorrow may shrink. So within the positive limit, we play with the instruments that we have, but we have not changed our liquidity policy as a result of the market turmoil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A follow-up question on that; I am quite surprised to see that no bank is talking about the ECB window because I hear that the ECB has lent already around 400 billion in Europe.  But no bank seems to admit that they have gone and I think that there should be nothing sinister in having gone to the ECB window, but no bank seems to be willing to say that they have gone. Have you gone to the ECB window?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And by the way, we were going to the ECB window before the market turmoil. I mean let be very clear on that, that the ECB window is not like the UK one with the penalty type of window.  I don't know why the others don't say it. I don't care. I've being going before.  I am going now, but it's short term funding. Let's be very clear, the ECB window is not helping me for any of my medium to long term funding or structural liquidity ratios, right. And to the extent that it's convenient, we will do it.  You know that the ECB window is an auction. So, you may put your price, you may get the money or you may not get the money depending obviously on the price that you put in. But it is not our primary source of funding, so we don't rely on the ECB window for our funding. We have been as we said at the beginning fortunate enough in the market. That means that we are a good credit story, so we have been able to access the institutional short term funding whether it's interbanks or ECBs or any other form of funding.  It is regulated throughout the overall period and as I said even at the beginning of this year, we have even increased our buffer for liquidity going forward and not necessarily using the ECB funding there with it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just finally, could you give us an idea of how much collateral you could have to go to the window, how much untapped collateral or unused collateral?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of our collateral what we call our counterbalancing capacity, we keep that as a safety; so we don't use them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have a policy to try to maximize our cash and obviously, when we look at our liquidity position in terms of what is our capability to raise cash in the future, if need be, we obviously do take into account counterbalancing capacity. And we try obviously to maximize that counterbalancing capacity because that allows us obviously to plan our cash inflows and outflows, but our tendency is not use our counterbalancing capacity in terms of our cash needs.  We try to &#x2013; we manage that from a risk at some point, risk managements at some point, but it's not a way of using to fund our cash needs.  Most of our cash needs are fully financed to our, as I said before, unsecured funding both short term and long term.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you; it's Anke Reingen from Execution. I have four questions and the first is actually a follow-up question.  At the end of September, you quite helpfully gave us some numbers for the impact of rising funding costs and you said it would be 40 basis points to <mark type="inaudible" /> the crisis.  Obviously that was the end of September.  Are you willing to give us any update and how would this feed into the numbers?  Is it like with the 20% within 12 months to your guidance?  And then secondly, can given us a number where your AfS reserve which showed as equity stands and is there any breakdown between equities and bonds and if it's a negative thus is it a Tier 1 equity?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, you said you are quite cautious on the asset management outlook for 2008. How much did performance related fees contribute in 2007?  And I don't know if I got the answer to a question before; are there any funds that you might have to buy-in; i.e., structured products where performance has been relatively weak? And fourthly on the <mark type="inaudible" /> synergies with Capitalia, you have upgraded the cost synergies, but if net synergies remain the same, do you think some of the revenue synergies are now under pressure in weaker markets? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Many questions, I hope I followed all of it.  You asked one of the questions whether we purchase or we did something with our mutual fund.  No, we have not done anything. The second question, guidance on the cost of funding; the cost of funding guidance that we gave, about 40 basis points, is about right. So this is way we look at it in terms of cost of funding, the higher average cost of funding that we have.</p>
          <p>I would like to  mention that it's an average higher cost of funding. We have many as I said instruments.  There are some instruments that are being widened more then others.  Obviously, they don't average &#x2013; that is an approximate right calculation. By the way, I would like to point out that obviously as we look at our own group, already we need to take into account that we have a significant &#x2013; also retail network and obviously deposits are also and the growth deposits are also obviously a way of funding the risk weighted asset growth. Then, if you just can remind me of the questions?</p>

          <p>Good morning, Jeremy Sigee from Citigroup. I just want to come back onto  the ABS question because you seem to giving us quite a bit of warning about what 1Q is going to look like. Two things on it; one is could you clarify which bits of the portfolio have caused you the most trouble in 1Q, US versus Europe; CMBS, RMBS, CDOs?  And second question, could you tell us about how you manage that portfolio?  Are the positions typically put on and held to maturity?  Even though they are in the trading book, do you typically hold them to maturity such that some of these market marks could reverse back over time?  Or are losses being crystallized by sale, by sales of those instruments?  And are you seeing any prospect of likely defaults on them or do you view this as just simply as marking to quite a stressed market?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all I think that there is no particular asset class that has been hinted in the portfolio. I think the spread widening as we are showing in the spread in the chart and as you know it's across the board. Every asset class has been touched and therefore there is no particular area that is suffering more then the others.  I would probably say yes. The most senior tranches are overly penalized in this environment. That's true; the fact that we are penalized on a relative basis by the fact that we have high quality paper that is for liquidation reasons or for liquidity reasons is getting on a percentage basis, even on a relative basis is suffering more.</p>
          <p>Those positions were originally pre-crisis, part of our liquidity book, very liquid stocks available for trading. And for sure all of a sudden they are now becoming, as what I mentioned before, something that given the lack of liquidity, we need to reconsider in the way we want to look at it. We do expect at current market prices, if we own this paper to maturity, which duration is around four years on this portfolio, it can generate substantial revenues and EVA contribution.  I guess to be honest right now, there is no choice other than keeping those positions unless you are totally forced to sell it, which we are not.  We are also highlighting in the chart what component of the losses has been realized, i.e., by selling areas, pieces of the portfolio that we think are more vulnerable. And where you see mark-to-market is because we think that there is value to be realized going forward. I hope I answered.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, I can make maybe a more generic comment; in theory, the players are not forced to do a continuous mark-to-market, because as we said, there is an enlargement of the spread due to the liquidity reason. We don't think that the credit risk implied is shown by the advisory spread. For the players that are not forced to do a continuous mark-to-market, it is a great opportunity for the bank in our opinion. Just to be very clear because <mark type="inaudible" /> are quite good.</p>
          <p>As Sergio was saying, the duration of their portfolios for &#x2013; I do understand that there are many questions on the investment banking and apparently also many worries in terms of future revenue streams and so on.  I think that you are not considering the fact that we have are a significant part of commercial banking. Investment banking is quite important for a group like us because having 400,000 corporate customers, this is a real value added that will reinforce dramatically our strength in terms of cross-selling on the corporate customer base.  As Sergio said, for us investment banking is &#x2013; to be a European specialist, where we are.  So again, it may be that we have a completely different view.  Quite clearly, you are correctly focused on the quarterly results.  We are focused on the strategic strengths of the group.  We think that the paradox <mark type="inaudible" /> today is that the group is stronger than before. And because life will become more and more difficult for the few investment banks that will have a lot of difficulties in financing their book.  Because they don't have deposits, they cannot have access to the central banks.</p>
          <p>And we are becoming stronger and stronger in discussions very clearly with our customers; listen, we are friend.  You are providing us a risk weighted asset with a certain value. You have seen the marginal <mark type="inaudible" /> 4.7%.  That means that above that cost of capital, corporate is a less profitable business. Now you have to provide to us also other revenues.  What are we talking of? Investment banking; that means risk management and advisory. We are talking of cash management. We are talking of trade financing. We are talking of leasing, and maybe we are talking also private banking services for <mark type="inaudible" />  And we are very open today; it is easier to discuss with the customer because they are aware that there world is different and if somebody will say okay, I will ask of you a credit line and I will do the advisory with a pure investment bank, we will say okay, shall you ask for a credit line with a pure investment bank? We are doing that. Also with very long relations.  Before we were not strong enough to do that.</p>
          <p>So again I do understand that in terms of quarter results, we can have a negative impact from the trading profits.  Then we can have base of discussion why we had this credit trading portfolio.  Again apparently we were by far less exposed in other and with by far higher quality. There is only one problem that working on mark to market and <mark type="inaudible" /> as somebody else said, apparently was better the other way around, but we have not changed any accounting standards.  So we have the effect of being <mark type="inaudible" />. So again and we are paid for managing the bank in the long run and to see the <mark type="inaudible" /> of the bank and the value creation of the bank. So also this is a reason why apparently we are by far less worried than you, but again...</p>
          <p>The other business lines &#x2013; it is clear that the world is different, but here also it's quite tricky because if we do say the world is different, then people are saying we are gloomy. If we do say the world is exactly the same as before, you will say we are stupid. So if the choice is to be gloomy or stupid, we prefer to be gloomy. But I think that the fact that the world is different, again it is pretty clear to all of us.  If we see the GDP in Europe you expect in the different countries is lower than one year ago, this is pretty evident to all of us.  And since our value is GDP related, this is a <mark type="inaudible" /> year to all of us.  Then we think that we have restructuring where we have shown to be capable. Also there has been a lot of discussion and also some comments of analysts on our capability in cost control.  Apparently, we are not so bad because we are at 0.4% opening under the branches and so on is not so bad. And the renewal of contracts is on. We are &#x2013; also because the labor contracting in any case we said <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>We have restructuring; we have growth coming from Central/Eastern Europe and from Capitalia. Clearly, we have this question mark on investment banking that to be honest that it is a short term question mark. How much -short term technically &#x2013; some when we were standing was 18 months, 18 months plus one day was medium term. Now it is very, very difficult as I said before to foresee when this mark in this location will finish.  I think that we have to manage the bank being sure that strategically we are well positioned.  When we compare ourselves with the other, there is nobody that has an European platform as we have, to be very honest, with a good combination of exposure to stable countries and growing countries. There is nobody that has the restructuring potential as us.</p>
          <p>So there are all these elements for us are important.  That you want to talk about operating profit; sure, we'll talk operating profit. I think that clearly are important, but there is a small portion of the overall future of the route. This is the view we have, So I think it was important to make this comment after Sergio's comments on operating profit.</p>
          <p>We have to ask for questions from the people connected and then the media.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question is from Ms. Anna Benassi of Banca Leonardo. Please go ahead, Ms. Benassi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Actually another question on the MID; I'm just trying to understand the gloomy scenario as you were saying and disrupted numbers in the first quarter of 2008. Do they relate to, let's say the pre-tax &#x2013; well the 400 million revenues accounted in the Q4 or do they relate on the 340 million trading loss?  Actually, we are talking about write-downs mark-to-market or we are talking about real losses and lack of enough revenues.</p>
          <p>The second question relates to the cost. In the Q4, actually the costs were down more than expected, particularly in Capitalia. So my question is, the cost base of Capitalia was affected by some one-offs or actually there is a view that also in 2008, Capitalia can keep growing with low cost, or more in general for the Group the reduction of cost in the Q4 was affected by lower bonuses on MIB.  So the final question is what we can expect for 2008?  The final question is you talk about 7.3 billion normalized profit for 2008. So my question is; is this a number that we can keep in mind for 2008? Is there any type of guidance you can give us in regards to the 2008 earnings? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I start with the Q1. There is absolutely no effect on what happened in Q4 into the Q1. So the numbers we have shown you are realized mark-to-market or losses to be accounted in 2007. What's going on in the second &#x2013; in the first quarter of the year? As you point out in your last scenario, it's basically two effects. One we mentioned before, the slowdown on the overall activities in capital markets for sure is visible to everybody, probably except the volatility on currencies. One has to look at the rest of the environment being very, very cautious. And the continuation of the spread widening that we experienced from December until today, you can see this on the charts, I mean on any available data, is as big as and large, it's not larger than the one we saw between Q2 and Q3, and Q3 and Q4. So the double effects are clearly creating the pressure on the MIB. But there is no relationship or any carry-forward aspect from Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now in terms of cost, I would like to point out that as I said before with regard to Capitalia, we were fortunate enough to obviously have negotiated the deal with the unions prior to the merger date. So effectively, at the time of the merger date, i.e., 1st of October, we already had the possibility to have a reduction of people which indeed for one quarter obviously had a positive effect in terms of cost. These clearly particularly some type of expenses in the third quarter of Capitalia. I'm not talking about staff expenses, but I'm talking about other operating expenses.  But clearly as they were getting closer to our own standards in terms of accruing cost, specifically for legal expenses, they have charged higher legal expenses in the third quarter than their normal average. However, I would like to point out that from a continuing operations standpoint or capability, the reality is that the integration of Capitalia and the right-sizing of Capitalia didn't start at December '08 &#x2013; '07, excuse me; but it started actually at the beginning of October of '07. So you get some of the benefits already as a result.  On top of that in the third quarter, we assume exceptional legal costs in some and that there we have explained the third quarter quite clearly. We were saying in the third quarter these are one-offs and so it's pretty clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I can just at one number; first in order to justify that the ticket price for aircraft from Vienna to London. In delta Capitalia head count we had &#x2013; we have September '07 vis-&#xE0;-vis December '07 minus 750 but it's a nice signal in terms of how we are managing the overall Capitalia the issues and especially of course as you can imagine the overall headquarters population that we found out in Capitalia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly the costs in the investment banking division, particularly the staff expenses in investment banking division, are affected by the performance.  We know that a significant portion of the staff expense is variable and therefore to the extent obviously, the markets are negative. Obviously you will save a portion of the bonuses associated with that.  I say a portion because clearly there are other segments we may miss in the bank that they have performed well and obviously you compensate people not on the overall results of the investment bank, but obviously on their segment where they have specific responsibility. Obviously, we hope that that is not recurring in the sense that we hope that the investment bank will do better and someone will be happy to pay the bonuses.</p>
          <p>With regard to the basis into which you can try to estimate the growth for 2008, I think the purpose of normalizing some of the performance of 2007 for some of the unusuals is because we feel those unusuals are clearly non-recurring and therefore the tax effect of the changes in corporate tax is still a one-off; it's a non-cash one-off that obviously in my view is appropriate to normalize.  As obviously integration costs of the Mediobanca stake not normalized because obviously we do not expect to charge another 1.3 billion of integration costs in 2008.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I may ask the question in a different way, are there many negative non-recurrents expected in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The answer is no. We don't expect any integration recurrent costs in '08.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Everything is planned. As Alessandro said before, we are flowing our plan in the overall integration plan. We are clearly advanced vis-&#xE0;-vis the program. We're also are cleaning up as you understood the staff will be different also.  Labor and retirement, outsourcing, selling some companies if they are not core; so we are quite confident that we have reached new integration cost synergies that we have already increased and that we understand how much &#x2013; also we may have some additional room during the next &#x2013; during this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>. <mark type="inaudible" /> an idea of what percentage of the Capitalia impaired loans on slide 30 is collateralized or ideally the value of the collateral. The second question is on the portfolio of securities held for trading. So we know it's about 200 billion, of which 15 billion is ABSs. If you can give us an idea of what their SC is, how much is security &#x2013; I mean shares, how much is sovereign debt, how much is corporate bonds?  And then just a technicality, are we to expect still some restructuring charges related to Capitalia or HVB or BPH in 2008 and 2009? Investment banking, if you can give us a feeling of what percentage of the revenues of the investment banking division is captive to the retail division of the group. And the final question is on the ABS portfolio. Can you let us know whether there has been any rating downgrade in Q4 or year to date? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the last questions first while Ranieri looks in to the rest of it.  There have been no meaningful downgrades in our portfolio. I think that whereas we saw some, as I said before, danger of a lack of quality, without waiting for the downgrades, we have been taking action and solved the position ourselves. So it's not a meaningful element of the mark-to-market equation. Also in terms of your question in terms of ABS, you had...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrea, it's Ranieri. The overall assets, I think Andrea, either we take it now, but probably we'll need to get back to you through Investor Relations for a more precise answer because we are talking about the entire bank trading position, the entire group position, so it's not just investment banking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that would be the entire group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the revenue coming from retail is not meaningful in that sense. For sure, the word captive is not something that we use very lightly in the group since whatever we do is not captive. It's always competitive, and we need to offer our clients the best price and the best products that are available. So it's not captive by definition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You asked a question about restructuring costs and whether there would be additional restructuring costs in 2008 to 2009. I would say that the restructuring costs you mentioned Capitalia, you mentioned I think also Poland if I recall correctly. I think the majority &#x2013; the vast majority of the restructuring costs were all expensed in 2007. So, we don't expect meaningful amounts of restructuring costs that will actually flow into 2008 and obviously even less &#x2013; actually I would say nothing in 2009.</p>
          <p>Then you had a question which I am very sure that I cannot completely at least to that level of detail in terms of the split; what I can tell you is that as part of 2007, obviously, you need to look at our trades, what we call in the classification of our balance sheet. We have equity securities, debt securities to the total of 112 billion, obviously we do &#x2013; these are long positions; so obviously because then it is trading activity. We have always in the held &#x2013; net held for trading, we also have 16 billion, but it's related to investment funds, loans and other assets. The actual breakdown of the single asset, how much is sovereign sell and all that stuff, frankly we will have to get back to you in with a more precise breakdown because we don't have that with us at this moment.</p>

And also there have been a lot of questions <mark type="inaudible" /> so it's impossible for us to confirm the target. I should say that the market is discounting significantly these target because if this was the target today, the price would be close to &#x20AC;7.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For us it has been very, very difficult to find the total exposure in many cases. In many cases it also was unclear if it was a net or gross exposure. In many cases or only one case, there is a US exposure. And so I think that there are many differences; so it is pretty clear that the standards had been completely different.  In many cases, it is unclear if all the competitors had been consolidated or not &#x2013; that had not been consolidated; so there are significant differences.</p>

          <p>But I would stress the point that we are gross and if the overall position is not a selection of the portfolio but the overall position we have is 15.8 and the gross positions, we don't know or hedges being part of those numbers.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question as we all seem to have more than one question, given your attractive European platform and restructuring potential, what do you think of the idea that you may be the next acquisition target in Europe following ABN Amro?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that everybody can be a target. I think that if somebody will pay a significant price, quite clearly it's not something that in the case that there is an offer it's up to the management to accept; it is up to the shareholders.  For the management is a choice in the case if to stay or not; and I think that our value is significantly higher than the one you are seeing. Personally, I don't think that we are a target or potential target. I don't see so many players that can pay such an amount.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But one thing which I like to take this opportunity is because as usual, we start to see the second round of the rumors in the market like the 5 billions write-down you experienced few weeks ago. Right now, there is a rumor going through that this 15 point &#x2013; 15 billions may create a 1.8 to 2 billion mark-downs. This is totally, I would say a trap not to say something else is again something that we <mark type="inaudible" /> investigate who is putting down those rumors. I think it's quite clear that there is a correlation between Q3 and Q4 movements of our P&amp;L in relation of spreads widening and one shouldn't take that university course, to extrapolate what happen in Q1.  Therefore, just want to stress there are people in the market spreading rumors based on information we gave that was totally inappropriate. And we hope the authorities will start an investigation on those issues.</p>

      <speaker type="q">

          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. Two questions; one is how is the &#x2013; what's current development like from Q4 to Q1 in terms retail clients?  Do you see good growth and I understand...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you elaborate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roberto Nicastro can elaborate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We keep on seeing very nice growth in the former UniCredit <mark type="inaudible" /> listing in a former Capitalia <mark type="inaudible" />. So the net result is quite positive and they are good customers.  So for instance out of the 140,000 net growth of retail customers, we talk about customers each with revenues exceeding &#x20AC;500. So it's not just a prepaid card customer. We keep on seeing positive growth throughout Italy and coming from a variety of competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you say something about your target for the full year in terms of customer growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had in 2007, as I said, 140,000 net bank negative number in the context of Capitalia. We would like to keep a range of 150,000 as a target for 2008. It means effectively repeating and being flat &#x2013; repeating the positive performance in UniCredit and bring down to zero the amount in the Capitalia perimeter.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand you don't want to give an EPS target or reiterate your previous target but could you say something about the development of the rest of the group excluding MIB since the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are a group so clearly MIB is in the group in terms of net profit. The rest of the group is continuing to grow quite well.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. You excluded the big acquisition. I wonder if you are thinking about more acquisitions and eventually where?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the time being, we are not thinking to do anything.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>About the synergies with Capitalia, you raised the targets if I understood. Can you give out the numbers, the new numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have given before; we have on top of the announced synergies 125 million higher cost synergies which will be implemented in the first year.</p>
