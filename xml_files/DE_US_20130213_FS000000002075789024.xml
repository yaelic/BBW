        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tony. With this morning's first quarter earnings announcement, John Deere has started 2013 on a strong note. Income and sales both reached new records for the first quarter of the year, and this was our 11th consecutive quarter of record earnings. Our results benefited from healthy farm conditions and the strong sales of agricultural equipment.</p>
          <p>Deere's performance also reflected success executing our ambitious marketing and operating plans. Such execution is especially important right now, as we are adding new products and global capacity at unprecedented rates. Finally, our full year earnings forecast has been adjusted upward and now stands at about $3.3 billion. Also, it was a solid start to what is expected to be another good year.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a look at the first quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were up 10% to $7.4 billion in the quarter. Net income attributable to Deere &amp; Company was $650 million and earnings per share increased 27% to $1.65.</p>
          <p>On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were $6.8 billion, up 11% quarter-over-quarter, including an unfavorable impact from currency translation of about one point. Price realization in the quarter was positive by three points.</p>
          <p>Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture &amp; Turf on Slide 5. Sales were up 16% in the quarter on continuing strength in the large Ag sector, especially tractors and combines. Recall, combine production and shipments were back-end loaded in 2012 to facilitate our transition to an Interim Tier 4. Operating profit was $766 million.</p>
          <p>Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at some of the fundamentals affecting the Ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. commodity price estimates that underlie our financial forecast. 2012, 2013 corn, soybean and wheat prices reflect a production shortfall caused by the weather-driven events that affected the 2011 and 2012 seasons and continue to support equipment sales. At this time of the year, it is hard to determine what the 2013/2014 crop year will bring. Clearly, the upcoming growing season has a lot of questions around it. Among other things, it should be noted that existing moisture conditions show the U.S. drought continues to be of significance. Research, however, shows that the moisture situation going into the growing season has virtually no impact on the final outcome. The primary point is that temperature and moisture levels experienced during the key growing season are the most important factors in determining yields. As is our custom at this time of the year, our estimates for the 2013/2014 crop year assume normal weather and trend yields.</p>
          <p>Slide 7 shows planted acres and yields for the 2012/2013 crop year compared to the corresponding forecast for the 2013/2014 crop year. Again, assuming trend yields and normal weather conditions, corn yields are forecast to increase about 31%, while soybean yields are forecast to be up about 12%.</p>
          <p>Slide 8 highlights cash receipts. Driven by strong crop prices, 2012 forecast cash receipts are at a record $389 billion. In 2013, strong crop prices, higher yields, and increased livestock receipts spurred 2013 cash receipts even higher. As a reminder, in our modeling, current and prior year cash receipts are the primary driver of equipment purchases in the U.S. market. With cash receipts at record levels, this bodes well for future farm prospects.</p>
          <p>Slide 9 illustrates U.S. farm gross cash income, which is cash receipts plus other farm-related income. This slide highlights the relatively small percentage that government payments and crop insurance play in gross cash income, as represented by the green and black areas. Government payments in green are included in total cash receipts numbers on Slide 8. For the three years shown, government payments are only about 3% of the total.</p>
          <p>Crop insurance receipts are included in other farm-related income, the black area, and are at historic levels in 2011 and 2012 due to drought-related events. Total crop insurance payments for 2012 are expected to be in the $15 billion to $16 billion range. As of last week, crop insurance industry payouts totaled roughly $13.5 billion. At the high range, this equates to about 4% of 2012 forecast gross cash income. For your reference, 2011 crop insurance payouts were approximately $10.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Our economic outlook for the EU 27 is on Slide 10. We are seeing offsetting trends in the EU. On one hand, strong crop prices are driving higher farm income. Conversely, in the UK, the poor harvest of 2012 and wet weather conditions during the 2013 crop selling season are impacting equipment demand. As well, the overall economic situation continues to weigh on farmer sentiment.</p>
          <p>Financial conditions in Northern Europe continue to be more favorable than in Southern Europe, with Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain all experiencing severe recession.</p>
          <p>On Slide 11, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for a few of our other targeted growth markets. Let's focus on the CIS, where our outlook has changed considerably from one quarter ago. Going into effect today and running through July 5, an additional 27.5% import duty has been placed on all imported combines going to Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus, bringing the import duty to 32.5%. This will have a considerable negative impact on sales of imported combines in these countries.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness in Brazil. It encompasses over 20 different crops and has a high correlation to tractor sales over time. With forecasts for a record soybean season due to an increase in acres planted, higher yields and sustained high crop prices, the 2013 value of Ag production in Brazil is expected to increase about 9% over the 2012 level.</p>
          <p>Our 2013 Ag &amp; Turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 13. Industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are now expected to be flat to up 5% in relation to the healthy levels of 2012. We continue to see strengthed demand, especially for high horsepower tractors and combines. However, our outlook is tempered by drought-related effects on the livestock sector.</p>
          <p>The EU 27 industry outlook is now down about 5%. The number one driver in the decline to our outlook is last year's poor harvest and wet weather conditions that could affect the 2013 crop in the UK. Also weighing on the outlook are overall economic conditions in Europe and the potential for further weakening.</p>
          <p>Industry sales of tractors and combines in South America are now expected to be up 10% to 15% in 2013. With strong commodity prices, forecasts call for an increase in planted acres, resulting in significantly higher crop production. In addition, current government programs in Brazil support higher amounts of equipment sales. Not only is the 2012/2013 subsidy amount allocated to Agriculture higher by about 7.5%, the interest rates are also extremely low. <mark type="ph" /> benami (11:11) financing is at 3% until June 30. Then it goes to 3.5% through the end of December.</p>
          <p>Our 2013 industry outlook in the CIS countries is now down slightly, due to import duties that are expected to reduce demand, as previously discussed. In Asia, we now expect industry demand to be slightly higher in 2013 versus 2012. In China, Ag subsidies are expected be higher and very supportive of equipment sales. In addition, Chinese grain output is expected to increase and farm modernization initiatives are continuing to move ahead. Although the India tractor market remains soft and industry sales aren't expected to improve from last year, it is encouraging that interest rates were recently lowered in order to support the economy.</p>
          <p>Turning to another product category, we now expect industry retail sales of Turf and Utility Equipment in the United States and Canada to be about flat in 2013, reflecting cautious consumer sentiment. Deere expects to outperform the industry with the launch of new Turf and Utility products, especially new utility vehicles.</p>
          <p>Putting this all together on Slide 14, fiscal year 2013 Deere sales of worldwide Ag &amp; Turf equipment are now forecast to be up about 6%, two points higher than our November outlook. 2013 operating margin for the Ag &amp; Turf division is forecast at about 15%.</p>
          <p>Let's focus now on Construction &amp; Forestry on Slide 15. The division's results were affected by lower shipment volumes, higher production costs, including those associated with Interim Tier 4, and unfavorable mix of product. Quarter-over-quarter was a very tough compare for C&amp;F. Normally, the first quarter has low production. In the first quarter last year, especially in November and December, the division had extremely high production volumes of high horsepower machines to facilitate the transition to Interim Tier 4 engines. As a result, mix in the current quarter also shifted to more purchased products, like excavators and the smaller commercial work site machines. Increased R&amp;D and SA&amp;G expenses in support of global growth also impacted the quarter's results.</p>
          <p>On Slide 16, looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, Global Insight has slightly improved its outlook for housing starts and government spending growth. However, our outlook remains cautious, as overall economic growth continues at a slow pace, awaiting resolution of the fiscal, economic and trade issues that are undermining business confidence and restraining growth.</p>
          <p>Global Forestry markets are expected to be about flat in 2013, as weakness in Europe is being offset by improvement in the United States. Fiscal 2013 net sales in Construction &amp; Forestry are now forecast to be up about 3%. Our previous outlook was up about 8%. The decline reflects lower dealer orders, as we see emerging caution regarding inventory levels within our dealer group.</p>
          <p>C&amp;F's full year operating margin is projected to be about 8%. While Construction &amp; Forestry's full year 2013 outlook is slightly stronger than 2012, the improvement is expected to occur in the second half of the year. In the second quarter, we expect lower manufactured volume compared with last year. Higher production costs associated with Interim Tier 4 will have an impact in the quarter, as well as global growth expenses.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to our Financial Services operation. Slide 17 shows the Financial Services provision for credit losses as a percent of the total average owned portfolio at 31 January 2013 was one basis point, reflecting the excellent quality of our portfolios and recoveries from prior years' write-offs. Our 2013 financial forecast now contemplates the loss provision to be about 16 basis points as a percentage of the average owned portfolio. The 10-year average is about 27 basis points.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 18, worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere &amp; Company was $133 million in the first quarter versus $119 million last year. For the full year, net income attributable to Deere &amp; Company is now forecast to be about $540 million.</p>
          <p>Slide 19 outlines receivables and inventory. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter up about $1.2 billion, or approximately 30% of trailing 12-month sales, the same relative to one year ago. The increase year-over-year is predominantly Ag, mainly reflective of higher sales volumes. The C&amp;F increase is mostly related to Canadian consigned and Nortrax inventories. This occurred as dealers rebuilt their inventories prior to the current caution in the market. We expect to end 2013 with receivables and inventory up about $500 million. The increase from our prior forecast relates to a stronger large Ag market in the U.S. and Canada, strong markets in South America and better definition to our Final Tier 4 engine transition plans.</p>
          <p>Our guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales, shown on Slide 20, remains at approximately 74% in 2013. Factors affecting cost of sales include price realization, production or manufacturing costs, raw material costs, engine emission product costs, absorption and effects of foreign exchange. For modeling purposes, keep in mind, price realization, we are forecasting about three points in 2013: Interim Tier 4 product costs, that we've talked about the last two years; lower production than in 2012, reflecting a much lower inventory build than last year, which affects absorption; and the impact on cost of sales from new employees.</p>
          <p>In keeping with our growth plans, Deere hired an additional 5,000 people in 2012, with over 3,000 of them joining us in the last three quarters of the year. These additions are critical to support our growth, both domestically and internationally, and will impact cost of sales, R&amp;D and SA&amp;G in 2013.</p>
          <p>I want to quickly run through January retail sales. Unfortunately, the AEM numbers were released too late to incorporate into our slide deck. For utility tractors, industry sales were up 12%. Deere sales were flat in the month. Industry inventories of utility tractors for the month of December were 48% of the previous 12-month sales. Deere inventories were lower. Industry sales of row crop tractors were up 27% in the month. Deere sales were up double digits, but less than the industry. Industry row crop inventories for December were 28% of the previous 12-month sales. Deere inventories were lower than the industry.</p>
          <p>Moving to four-wheel-drive tractors, industry sales were up 89%, while Deere sales were up triple digits. December industry inventories were 21% of previous 12-month sales. Deere inventories were slightly higher. For combines, industry sales in the month were up 17%. Deere sales were up more than the industry. Industry inventories for December were 11% of the previous 12-month sales. Deere inventories were slightly lower. Deere dealer inventories at 31 January 2013 for row crop tractors were 19% of previous 12-month sales, compared to 12% in 2012. Comparable numbers for combines are 11% at 31 January 2013 versus 5% in 2012. The remaining industry sales for Ag &amp; Turf, the EU 27 and C&amp;F can still be found in the appendix of our slide deck.</p>
          <p>Now back to the slides, looking at R&amp;D expense on Slide 21, R&amp;D was up 14% in the first quarter compared with the same period last year, consistent with our guidance that the increase in R&amp;D spending for 2013 would occur in the first half of the year. Our 2013 forecast continues to call for R&amp;D expense to be up about 3% for the full year.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Slide 22, SA&amp;G expensive for the Equipment Operations was up about 10% in the first quarter. Very much like R&amp;D, the quarter-over-quarter increases for SA&amp;G are heavily weighted to the first half of the year. In fact, about 70% of the SA&amp;G increase will occur in the first two quarters. SA&amp;G expense is forecast to be up about 7% in 2013, no change from our previous guidance.</p>
          <p>The Equipment Operations tax rate was about 30% in the first quarter, with the rate affected by discrete items. While it is not our practice to provide specifics on discrete items, we would note the extension of the R&amp;D Tax Credit for 2013, and it's being retroactive to 2012. For full year 2013, the effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%, representing no change from our previous forecast.</p>
          <p>On Slide 24, you see our Equipment Operations' history of strong cash flow. We continue to forecast cash flow from Equipment Operations to be about $3.4 billion in 2013.</p>
          <p>On Slide 25, we outline our 2013 outlook for the second quarter and full year. Our net sales forecast for the second quarter is up about 4% compared with 2012. This includes about two points of price realization, with unfavorable currency translation of about one point.</p>
          <p>A couple other items to keep in mind as you model the second quarter. As we have stated previously, R&amp;D and SA&amp;G expense are front-end loaded, thus affecting our year-over-year second quarter results, and in last year's second quarter, results were favorably impacted by a reduction in pension and OPEB expense of approximately $65 million. The full year forecast now calls for net sales to be up about 6% compared with 2012. Price realization is expected to be positive by about three points and we have increased our full year 2013 net income forecast to about $3.3 billion.</p>
          <p>In closing, John Deere has entered 2013 on a strong pace. Our key markets remain in good shape, for the most part, and we're looking for another solid year. True, our near-term outlook is tempered by uncertainties over fiscal, economic and trade issues. This is hurting business confidence and restraining growth, but we continue to invest in the future, as the longer-term picture continues to be extremely bright. Our plans for helping meet the world's growing need for food, shelter and infrastructure are well on track and moving ahead. All-in-all, we remain highly confident about the company's future prospects and our ability to deliver value to customers and investors in the years to come.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. It's Barclays. Nice quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If we could talk about Construction first. Can you talk a little bit more about your comments around emerging caution from the dealers? To me, it sounds a bit counter-intuitive. Housing starts have been going the right way. Is this the rental market slowing down for you? And you didn't mention energy and material handling as a strength, which you have in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we would actually &#x2013; in terms of strength, of where we're seeing strength, we would continue to say the three key areas, rental continues to be stronger, energy-related, as well as material handling, that really hasn't changed. I think where the outlook has changed is we're seeing some caution around some of the uncertainties around fiscal policies, and it's particularly impacting our Construction &amp; Forestry business, and dealers, in particular, I think also are cautious and, as a result, are beginning to pull down their inventory somewhat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll let other people ask you about that. Tony, if I could ask you about your guidance. You maintain your guidance of 74% cost of sales. You did 74% in the quarter. We were modeling something worse. It seemed like you executed quite well in the context of all those extra employees that came in in the beginning of the year or at the end of last year. So why wouldn't margins go up toward the end of the year, that cost of sales number go down? Your production of combines should be going up at least modestly and you had better absorbed those employees, especially considering price cost should be relatively good this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Actually, you touched on one of the reasons with combine shipments. Keep in mind that last year, we actually had the opposite phenomena, in the sense that we were producing and shipping a higher than normal percentage of combines in the back half of the year. And in 2013, we'll be moving to what would be a more typical shipping pattern on those combines. We're seeing a lot more being shipped in this first half. Especially in the first quarter, we saw more combines shipped versus last year. In fact, last year, it was like maybe around 10% of the combines that were &#x2013; of the annual shipments of combines, went out in the first quarter and you're up closer to 15% to 20% in the first quarter of this year. So it's a big shift.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Credit Suisse and, sorry, just a follow-up to Andy's question on the C&amp;F side. I guess two questions. One, I mean, Tony, you guys really &#x2013; when you look at your forecast on housing, it's up a little, non-res is down a little. So your forecast, your economic forecast, really hasn't changed that much. So I guess my question is is this more Deere-specific in that you had too much inventory in the channel and you're making some adjustments that other people made before? And, if so, and just what's the level of dealer inventory out there that I guess needs to get cut? And my second question is I'm pretty sure you said margins are still 8% in C&amp;F on a lower sales forecast and I just wanted you to confirm that. And then, how were you able to achieve the same margins on a lower sales increase? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Tony and I were debating who's going to answer. So, Jamie, we're really tweaking inventories on the Construction side. If you look at the ending guidance, it's down $100 million and some from our previous outlook. So it's really tweaking, but again, in the field, we are seeing a little slower rate in terms of inventory growth and that's just what you're seeing in terms of inventory ordering. So you're seeing that reflected in a little bit of caution in our outlook, especially for the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>But I guess, Marie, do you feel like you guys were a little late on the inventory reduction relative to some other guys or are you just more &#x2013; is it market or is it Deere? I guess I'm still not...?</p>

          <p>Primarily because of the &#x2013; we have a stronger market in Canada for construction. And we sell &#x2013; we have consigned inventory in Canada, okay? That's what went up.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I was hoping &#x2013; hi, guys. I was hoping we could just have a bit of an update on sort of where the order books stand and for any programs you might want to highlight. And then, I'm curious about what you're seeing in the used markets, as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I assume you're referring on the order books in U.S. and Canada on Ag?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, basically they continue to be very, very strong. I'm looking for the exact data here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And while Tony's looking, and that's really reflected in the improved guidance for North American Ag, where you see us taking that up flat to up 5% for the industry, where we have been flat before. And that is driven almost exclusively by large Ag. Tony?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and so specifically on the early order programs &#x2013; and these are for the order programs that were active during the quarter. So, and it never &#x2013; excluding cotton and combines and sprayers ended during our fourth quarter, so outside of that, we're still up double digits year-over-year on the early order program. So, that's things like self-propelled wind rowers, forage harvesters, as well as planting equipment for those. Our combine early order program ended in January, mid-January, and was &#x2013; for the U.S. and then 1st of February in Canada. But very, very strong and we have virtually all of our production covered with the early order program.</p>
          <p>On tractors, again, our order window is open out about seven months. And Track Tractors, in particular, are very strong, both 8 and 9R. Track Tractors are effectively sold out during that order &#x2013; or for that order window. And in both cases, keep in mind that's with additional capacity for U.S. production. On the 8R Wheel Tractors, the effective availability is late June, again, on additional capacity over 2012. And on the 9R Wheels, there's availability in April of this year, which is similar to where we were last year, so across the board, very comparable to where we were last year, but on higher capacity for the U.S. and Canada.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can comment, Stephen, is the combines is one that everybody thinks of typically. I'll tell you the price levels are holding very well. The inventories in turns are in decent shape, as well. Now when it comes to tractors, and grow crops, they're in very good shape in all those three parameters. In four-wheel-drives, given the retail sales we've had, we are very comfortable with the inventory levels and the turns we have in four-wheel-drives. The pricing is holding very well, as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. And just quickly, the increased capacity that you spoke of, Tony, can I think of that as kind of 15%-ish?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's in the 15% to 20% range on tractors.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Can we talk about Ag &amp; Turf for a little bit? I was surprised you kind of glossed over the unfavorable impact on margins this quarter. Can we get a little bit more detail, particularly on the warranty costs? Is that just accruals? Is it actual costs? Where are they coming from and then production costs and R&amp;D also?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with warranty. Ann, as you know, Deere has extremely high product quality and, in fact, over the last decade, we've taken our warranty rate actually down by about a third. So we are doing very good on that. You are well aware, as I'm sure everyone is, that we have had, because of IT4, a record number of product introductions in a compressed time. And as good as our products are, occasionally we have to make a few corrections, and so this really just relates to the fact that you've had this huge number of product introductions. And when you increase &#x2013; when you launch something new, you occasionally have to make a few fixes, so no big story there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So are we done with those warranty costs now or are they a headwind for the remainder of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would expect that you might see a little bit of an increase in the run rate as you move forward, again, just reflecting the launch of products. It probably &#x2013; in any other quarter, it wouldn't have even shown as a factor to explain the quarter's results. It's just that we had relatively low sales volumes in the first quarter, so it's a little more apparent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a fair point. And just a little bit more philosophically, around the warranty costs or around Tier Interim, you're the only company that really calls out the transition to Tier 4 engines quarter after quarter as being a headwind. Is there any case to be made that that's because you're doing EGR first and then going to SCR, whereas most of the rest of the industry, both construction and agricultural, went primarily to SCR? Or how should we, as investors, think about Deere's struggle with this transition relative to its peers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well &#x2013; excuse me. Not a struggle, actually, a very, very good execution. We just want to help you understand that there are costs associated with this product, costs in addition to the R&amp;D and the capital expense associated with it. And that's helpful in understanding our margin. We've done a very good job on cost recovery. And we have added a significant amount of value to our customers, because, as we've discussed in the past, the product introductions are around IT4. So in addition to getting the emissions upgrades, they're getting a tremendous amount of features and values.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me reiterate something here, Ann. In terms of investments for emissions, we are making those, and I think we are talking about those. Our competitors have costs as well, okay? So it's not costs that only we are seeing. Others are seeing it, as well. And, like Marie said, our implementations have gone very well. And we are looking forward to keeping that momentum for Tier 4 transitions, as well, coming up in 2014 and 2015.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would also reiterate, compared to some of our competitors, if you look at our overall margins, I think we're doing fairly well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's a fair point. I'll leave it there and get back in line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wanted to touch on the South American outlook. Clearly, seeing some strength in Brazil, but I'm curious how the competitive dynamic is playing out. Are you seeing room to take up pricing more than you originally planned? And do you expect your share in combines perhaps to recover after it took a dip?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and certainly as we look at our pricing, again, in Brazil, we continue to have positive price realization year-over-year. Again, in the first quarter, we had positive price realization. I think for us, as you're aware, we've introduced a number of new products into that market and they've been very, very successful. We've talked for a number of years about the strength of our distribution. And I think as you see these market share shifts, that that just further demonstrates what we've been saying regarding the strength of that distribution. So again, we're very positive about that. Regarding combine, certainly we would hope to see the recovery and, keep in mind, it's a pretty small drop in the year on combine market share, but we would certainly expect to continue to recover from that and perhaps even extend our share further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair. And if I could just ask a follow-up on CIS, you didn't cite credit being a factor. So is it safe to assume it's not having an impact or is it just that there's been no change there? And in light of the higher import duties, has your longer-term view on that market changed at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Certainly with credit, I would not say &#x2013; I wouldn't imply that by lack of discussing that it isn't an issue, because certainly there is some tightening of credit in CIS countries. We talked about it last quarter. Really, it's just the more significant change would be around the import duties, specifically on combines that were added. Keep in mind that's really &#x2013; it begins in mid-February and runs through June currently.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we just go through a little bit more on construction equipment and a little more color? I think you indicated second quarter productions have probably trailed last year numbers. And I guess Brazil has some tariffs on imports of construction equipment. Is part of the reduction in forecast due to some of the tariffs there in Brazil also or &#x2013; and can you talk about second quarter production versus last year and the residual 3% gain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really, the second &#x2013; I'm sorry, Eli. I didn't &#x2013; cut you off. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the drop in production the first half &#x2013; is all the 3% gain in C&amp;F coming in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the drop in the second quarter is really exclusively related to North American Construction, and then there's also some Forestry activity. In Brazil, indeed, we're actually building our presence, so although there are tariffs, as you know, we are entering that market. We've got a dealer network that we are supporting with equipment sales, imported equipment sales, prior to the launch of production in our factories, which will really be a 2014 and 2015 event. So it's really not &#x2013; it has nothing to do with Brazil, and it's a tweaking in North America, as we talked about earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And sort of as a follow-up, you've mentioned nothing about material costs this year. Is that actually a tailwind versus last year? And we are approaching Final Tier 4 next year in 2014 and 2015. Are we looking at some &#x2013; can you give us some insight on how it's going affect Deere with, I guess, some of the larger equipment and in Ag particularly, we'll probably get &#x2013; have to introduce Final Tier 4 next year. And so how that cost, incremental cost, will be as we get closer to that date?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And I want to make sure that I'm separating the two, because we talk about &#x2013; we've talked about in the past material cost, and then we've talked about Interim Tier 4 material cost. And as we mentioned in the first quarter, material costs, excluding IT4, is not a material impact, either positively or negative, in terms of driving any change in that cost of sales percentage. On Interim Tier 4, certainly that is an impact. Emission costs, as you look at unfavorable factors impacting our cost of sales ratios, Interim Tier 4 product cost would be the largest impact in this year.</p>
          <p>As you mentioned, we'll move into Final Tier 4 beginning in 2014. And so you'll start to see, in addition to &#x2013; you have your Interim Tier 4 costs will pretty much be completed, but you'll start seeing Final Tier 4. And that should be fairly similar to what we saw in terms of the ramp-up, not necessarily the total costs, to what we saw with Interim Tier 4 in that large Ag, over 175 horsepower equipment, is &#x2013; the effective date of that regulation is January 1. So you'll start seeing large Ag go and then below 175 horsepower in 2015.</p>

          <p>So will we see those costs beginning in the second half of this year, this fiscal year, beginning to ramp-up as we get closer to it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You might &#x2013; in the fourth quarter, you might see a little bit of impact, more as you get started, so that you know with some demonstration models and things like that for farm shows. But no, it's really a 2014, fiscal 2014, for us. You're also &#x2013; we talked about the inventories and receivables being a little higher on the Ag side than what our original guidance had been. We'll continue to refine our transition plans as we move through the year, so you could see some activity there.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost up, Eli, the bigger cost up was really to go from Tier 3 to IT4. Going to Final Tier 4, while still a cost up, is not quite as significant. I do not have a precise estimate of the number, but if you said on a 10 point scale, if going from Tier 3 to IT4 was a 10, then maybe you're looking at five, six, seven to go from IT4 to Final Tier 4. But we're still, as you might imagine, working on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So my first question is, did I understand right the &#x2013; on the Russia tariff issue, that's only on the combine side? And did you build into your forecast that on tractors, as well? Is that something you expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. At this point, that import duty is only on combines. And we're not aware of any change, at this point, with tractors. So the outlook really is impacting combine alone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And keep in mind that impact, as Susan pointed out, is not just Russia, but that affects Russia and Kazakhstan, as well as Belarus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then second, just as sort of a big picture question, obviously, the environment is quite strong in Brazil. I'm curious about what kind of customers are buying. The biggest, largest corporate farms there tend to buy stuff and use it, I think, until it runs all the way down. I don't know whether they're accelerating. I don't know whether there's the development of used market in Brazil, as they maybe accelerate or whether it's mid-tier farmers who are buying more or smaller. I'm just wondering if you can give just sort of a bit of color around how Brazil is evolving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And certainly, there continues to be &#x2013; and it kind of depends on what industry you're referring to in terms of typical usage. For example, a sugar industry tends to use both tractors and harvesters very heavily on an annual basis. And to your point, with their holding patterns, they tend to be pretty much ready for scrap by the time they're ready to trade in. Grain industry is a little bit different. And there is &#x2013; probably best characterized maybe a bit of a developing used equipment market there. Typically, they're trading in every five years or so, but they're putting &#x2013; a typical grain farmer is putting fewer hours on than what you would see in the sugar industry.</p>
          <p>So our dealers do take trades there. In some cases, similar to the U.S., they'll have an in-house used equipment department to process those through. Some of them actually outsource it and have others take care of selling that used equipment, but, again, I would characterize it more as a developing issue or market versus what you would have in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you seeing strength amongst the very biggest, the big corporate ones, in large land holders and smaller, as well, or is there anything that you can call out about your customer? Thanks. I'll stop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me &#x2013; this is Raj. Let me broadly say that sometime back, there was this M&#xE1;s Alimentos program in Brazil that provided additional subsidies for smaller farmers. And you've seen that's peaked off and since then, the natural economics has determined essentially that the larger farmers are growing, okay? And if you look at our own past experiences, these are very large farmers in 2011. We had 2011, 2012, approximately 60 of these farmers who contribute almost $0.5 billion worth of our revenues in that market. And we have said that in the past. And if you look at the first quarter, we have a slightly higher proportion of large Ag sales in Brazil than in the first quarter of last year. So it is increasing, especially for us, towards larger Ag and our proportion of large customers is increasing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joel, the Forestry business is a very important portion of our business. If you know our long-term strategy, 2018 aspirations, we have articulated that we have the growth businesses, which are Ag and Construction, and we have complementary businesses, Turf for Ag and Forestry for Construction. So we think of it as an important contributor going forward, in terms of being complementary to the Construction Equipment business. In terms of longer-term growth, we are not expecting as much from Forestry as from Construction, okay? The tailwinds in Construction is very critical for us. Tailwinds in Forestry, we think, are very modest, so we are looking to get good SVA and not great top-line from Forestry going forward.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning. It's Goldman Sachs. Tony, in Eastern Europe with your facilities or manufacturing footprint there, sounds like you're better positioned than most for a potential change in the tariff regime. Can you just talk about what kind of local content requirements would be needed for combines to be considered local? And over what time period would you be able to configure your facilities there to do some assembly work in the region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, certainly not with &#x2013; unfortunately, not with any specifics. We're currently working with the Russian Government specifically in terms of what those definitions are and trying to ensure that we can move that direction if feasible, and qualify as local production, but that's something that we're working through at the moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Tony, can you comment on around what timeframe you'd be able to execute that, if you did reach an agreement, from a manufacturing standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on how quickly you could reach an agreement and what that requirement would be. So that would &#x2013; it'd be very premature to speculate on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And from a pricing standpoint, maybe the answer is mix or rounding, but I'm wondering if you could comment. Your pricing this quarter was 100 basis points lower than your guidance and you're looking for two points of pricing in the fiscal second quarter accelerating, it's back the 3% in the back half of the year and I'm wondering if you could just step us through what's driving the variance versus your expectations in the first quarter and the mix improvement in the back half versus 2Q?</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just maybe at the risk of asking you to re-hash some things you already described, but it seems like guidance is implying something like 11% incremental margins for the Equipment business for the second through fourth quarters year-over-year. And I realize you mentioned that combine production is more evenly balanced this year versus last year, but I was just wondering if there was anything else in there that would sort of point to the deceleration incremental profitability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so now, Ashish, you need to &#x2013; now we provide guidance and a top-line, as you know, in 1% increments. So it could be &#x2013; so there is a range that you need to be careful about in terms of rounding, it's 0.2% to 1.8%, okay? And again, on the other hand, we provide guidance on net income in $100 million increments. So you've got to be thinking about the range there, as well, could be anywhere between $20 million to $180 million. And if you look at our operating margins for Ag and C&amp;F, we have said it's 13%, 8%. Those have not changed.</p>
          <p>And we are also looking at in terms of effective tax rate 34% to 36%. Now, Q1 was 30% because of a discrete item. Overall, we're saying it's going to be 34% to 36%. And then, given the uncertain economic environment around the world, you will expect some caution from us, appropriately so, especially in our second half outlook. So factoring these, I think you should be able to add up the numbers that have been provided.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>No. The biggest change that we are seeing is really coming out of the UK, which relates to the weather that we've talked already about. But it's a large, one of the key markets in that part of the world, and it is very, very weak. We're actually seeing some stabilization in the south, which is gratifying, although stabilizing at very low levels. And we actually have some strength in markets like France and even some growth in Germany. So it's really the UK. It's a unique phenomena related to the weather and to &#x2013; the weather and crop, resulting crop by yield of last year and then concern emerging over what's happened this winter.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just one more from me quickly, your share repurchase activity dropped pretty sharply in the quarter. Is that just because of a more cautious economic outlook that you described or is there anything else there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. I think you may recall that we ended the year with about $6 billion of cash and we said we had pulled forward some funding because we were concerned about the outlook for &#x2013; the risks on fiscal cliff, et cetera, and consistent with that, we moderated our share repurchases. And I do want to emphasize that share repurchase is a residual use of cash that tends to be a high use of cash time for us the first half of the year, as well, so no story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and this is Raj. Let me reiterate that our cash use priorities are the same. They haven't changed, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Operator, I think we have time for one more call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our final question comes from Ross Gilardi. And please state your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Bank of America. Just on that cash flow prioritization, I mean, you, clearly, you've had a big quarter in Ag. What signals are &#x2013; is Deere looking for to raise the dividend more substantially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we do not ever comment on dividend policy actions. You know that we convey that over a long time, we desire to have a &#x2013; be known as a company that consistently and moderately increase dividends and that we have a targeted payout, on average, over a long period of time, of 25% to 35%. If you look at the monies that we have returned to shareholders, really since we began our share repurchase program in 2004, you're looking at about 60% and some of that's been in the form of dividends. Some of it's been in the form of share repurchase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then just on Section 179, do you think that had a big impact on demand in December? And is that borrowing from your first half 2013 outlook at all? And just could you clarify, is this a one-year extension or has it been extended indefinitely?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It extends through 2013. And actually, at the margin, we would view it, very much so, as additive because it is most significant in helping facilitate movement of used goods. And that's obviously important in a mature market. And so, we &#x2013; that was a favorable development for us, not...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, keep &#x2013; I'm sorry. Keep in mind on new equipment, by the time &#x2013; in terms of for a farmer customer, by the time they realize they want to extend some tax shelter or take advantage of that by &#x2013; quite often for us, our order books, especially on large Ag, are extended beyond January 1 or December 31. And so, they wouldn't be able to order and receive that equipment ahead of that December 31 cut-off to take a lot of advantage on new equipment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And remember, the recent Section 179 announcements came first week of January, so the previous November and December, and this was after that November, December, when the announcement came in. So as Marie said, we are expecting an impact on the used equipment movement because of it through this year, okay, not in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, just last &#x2013; could I just ask one last question on the China subsidies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Ross.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll have to cover that in follow-up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And in summary, I just wanted to reiterate, obviously, while our near-term outlook is tempered by uncertainties over fiscal, economic and trade issues, we have entered 2013 on a very strong pace and looking forward to another solid year. With that, we thank you for your participation in the call. And, as always, we'll be available the rest of the day to answer any additional questions you may have. Operator?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect your lines.</p>
