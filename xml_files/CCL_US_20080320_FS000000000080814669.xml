          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Frank, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. With me this morning is Micky Arison, Chairman and CEO of Carnival Corporation; David Bernstein, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, our Vice President of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>We are going to start the program off with David taking you through the first quarter and then I will try to give you some color on what the rest of the year looks like. David?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Howard. I will begin the conference call by reading the forward-looking statements. During this conference call, we will make certain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, or other factors, which may cause the actual results, performances, or achievements of Carnival to be materially different from any future results, performances, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  For further information, please see Carnival's earnings press release, and its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>For the first quarter 2008, our EPS is $0.30 per share, which is above the midpoint of our latest guidance in the 10-K by $0.03 per share. The 10-K guidance was $0.26 to $0.28 diluted EPS. This resulted from lower than expected fuel prices worth about $0.01 per share, the positive impact of currency worth about $0.005 per share, various other cruise costs, which in total were worth almost $0.02 per share, and all of that was partially offset by the fact that we excluded the fuel supplement on existing bookings from first quarter revenue, which cost almost $0.01 per share.</p>
          <p>Let me elaborate a little on the status of the fuel supplement program, which we announced last November. As you know, the Florida Attorney General is conducting a review of our fuel supplement program as well as programs at other cruise lines. We believe that our fuel supplement complies with all applicable laws and we have been fully cooperating with this review.</p>
          <p>Last week, Royal Caribbean announced an agreement with the Florida Attorney General that expressly permits a fuel supplement, but provides onboard credits for the fuel supplement on bookings existing as of the date of their announcement of the fuel supplement program.</p>
          <p>We continue to discuss our fuel supplement program with the Florida Attorney General. We believe that the facts and circumstances surrounding our existing bookings are different than Royal Caribbean because our brochures disclosed to guests the possibility that a fuel supplement could be assessed in addition to the advertised price and that such a supplement would apply to all booked guess.</p>
          <p>However, the accounting treatment for recognizing revenue is such that where a significant uncertainty exists as to the revenue realization, such as the review by the Florida Attorney General, revenue should not be recorded. Therefore, we deferred recognition of the fuel supplement pertaining to existing bookings from our revenue in the first quarter. And in order to be consistent between our current guidance and our first quarter actual results, we took the conservative approach and excluded the approximately $40 million of fuel supplement pertaining to existing bookings for the full year from our net revenue yield and our EPS guidance for 2008. The $40 million equates to 0.3 percentage points on yield or $0.05 per share.</p>
          <p>Before I go on let me set the stage. The remainder of my comments will be versus our December guidance provided during our last conference call. Our EPS came in at the midpoint of the December guidance, which was $0.29 to $0.31 per share as all the pluses and minuses netted out. While we missed slightly on the revenue side, we achieved our cost guidance and had small favorable variances in depreciation, taxes, and various other items.</p>
          <p>Net revenue yields increased 6.2% in the first quarter. This was slightly below the range of our previous guidance of 6.5 to 7.5%, which we gave three months ago. The exclusion from revenue of the fuel supplement on existing bookings, which I previously discussed, accounted for 0.2 percentage points. The remaining difference was primarily driven by the lower than expected onboard and other net revenue yields. In 10-K, which we filed in late January, we indicated that we had seen some softness in onboard revenues at certain of our contemporary brands.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, cruise costs per available berth day were up 12.9% for the first quarter, which was within the range of our previous guidance of 12.5 to 13.5%, which we gave in December.  Higher than expected fuel costs were offset by other expense items.</p>
          <p>Looking more closely at our first quarter operating results, our capacity increased 10.5% for the first quarter with the majority of the increase going to our European brands. Our European brands grew 20.6% including Ibero Cruises, while our North American brands grew 5.7%.</p>
          <p>As I indicated before, net revenue yields in current dollars increased 6.2% versus the prior year.  Now let's take a look at the two components of net revenue yields, cruise passenger ticket yields and onboard and other yields. For net cruise passenger ticket yields, we saw an improvement of 7.7% in current dollars and 4.8% in local currency. Our North American brands were up as strong 7.1%, driven by the recovery in the Caribbean. Excluding Ibero Cruises, which we began consolidating in the fourth quarter of last year, our European brands achieved a 1.3% increase in local currency passenger ticket yields.</p>
          <p>I'm also glad to report that Costa's yields in China improved significantly in the first quarter as they did in the third and fourth quarters of last year, driven both by price and occupancy, which resulted from our decision to shift our sourcing strategy for Costa Asia. Based on the improved performance in December, we had announced that we are adding a second ship to Costa Asia one year from now.</p>
          <p>In onboard and other yields, we saw a reported yield improvement of 1.5% in current dollars, but a yield decline of 0.7% in local currency. However, if you adjust for consistent brands and you exclude Ibero Cruises, Windstar, and Swan Hellenic, the year over year yield change in local currency is up slightly, 0.2%; the declines in our contemporary brands being offset by increases in other brands.</p>
          <p>We have packed our recent experience in onboard revenue into our revenue guidance for the year. However, keep in mind that we do not have the same visibility into future onboard revenue yields as we have into ticket yields where we can analyze advance bookings.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, our cruise cost per available lower berth day for the first quarter, as I said before, were up 12.9% versus the prior year, while in local currency it was up 9.8%. However, the increases were driven by fuel prices and dry-docks. Fuel prices this year were higher than the first quarter of last year, costing an additional $156 million, or $0.19 per share. We had 10 dry-docks in the first quarter of this year versus 4 in the first quarter of last year, which cost an additional $21 million. Therefore, excluding dry-docks and fuel and in local currency, cruise cost per available berth day were flat.  Despite significant inflationary pressures in food, wages, crew travel, and other areas of our controllable expenses, the cost per available berth day remained flat for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to our 2008 outlook, I will skip the net revenue yield outlook as Howard will discuss that in a few moments. And as far as our crews cost per available berth day is concerned, for the full year in current dollars, it's expected to be in the range of 8.5 to 9.5%. However, excluding fuel and in local currency, it is expected to be down slightly.</p>
          <p>For the full year based on the forward curve, fuel prices are projected to be $525 per metric ton for 2008 versus $361 per metric ton in 2007, costing us an additional $532 million or $0.65 per share.  However, keep in mind that fuel prices continue to be very volatile.</p>
          <p>Overall for 2008, we are forecasting controllable expense unit costs excluding fuel and currency slightly down and exceeding our long term target of unit cost growth between flat to one-half the rate of inflation.</p>
          <p>At this point, I will turn the call back over to Howard.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. Let me start by talking about the booking environment since the beginning of the year. As we began 2008, cumulative bookings and revenue yields across all brands, as we indicated in our previous call, were nicely ahead of last year. While bookings during the 2008 wave season have been slightly lower than in 2007, that was to be expected as our cumulative bookings at the beginning of the year were well ahead and there was less cabin inventory left to sell.</p>
          <p>Another contributing factor to the slightly lower volume of bookings during wave season is ticket pricing during wave season bookings was set at higher levels. And of course it's also likely that the slowing economy, particularly in North America but perhaps in Europe as well, was also a factor in the slowdown in booking volumes.  Because bookings were strong coming into wave season and wave seasons bookings are only modestly lower than last year, our booking picture at the present time is still quite strong with bookings and pricing still running nicely ahead year on year.</p>
          <p>What we didn't anticipate in our revenue yield forecast, as David discussed, for 2008 was a slowdown in onboard revenues, which was the principal factor in our reduced first quarter revenue yields and which we have now factored into our yield guidance for the remainder of 2008.  As David mentioned, 2008 revenue yield guidance was also lowered because of the deferral of the fuel supplement revenue related to the bookings we had at the time the supplement was introduced as a result of the Attorney General &#x2013; Florida Attorney General's review of this whole issue.</p>
          <p>We do believe we have experienced a soft economy during this first quarter of 2008 and whether it's a recession or just a flat economy, it's not critical to our analysis.  It seems we are going through almost a perfect storm, an unprecedented decline in house prices not seen in the last 30 years, financial markets in complete turmoil with banking liquidity substantially frozen, fuel prices at their highest historical levels in history; the weakening US dollar, continuing rising unemployment and inflation, and the worst consumer confidence in recent years.</p>
          <p>Taking all these factors into consideration, we have reduced our revenue yield outlook for the reminder of 2008 to recognize reduced revenue yield, primarily resulting from the slowdown in the onboard spending pattern. While it seems clear now that the slowing economy is having some effect on our booking patterns, it is also clear to us that consumers are still planning to take vacations, although some think they will be trading down to less expensive, more value priced vacations, and that's why cruises are so popular. The value proposition of largely all-inclusive cruise vacations versus more expensive land vacations is greater now than ever before.  And it's for this reason that we believe our business will outperform other leisure companies during periods in which there is a soft or recessionary economy.</p>
          <p>And yet with all this, consumers are still booking their vacations, albeit less expensive, value oriented vacations, and that is what we are.  Do we think the recession will affect the business?  The answer of course is yes, but as we have said many times in the past, our business has shown tremendous resilience in a declining economy and we expect it will do so this time as well.</p>
          <p>It is also important to keep in mind that 40% of our revenues and 35% of our capacity comes from other parts of the world with stronger currencies, which will be a further positive factor in our financial performance for 2008.  Europe is our second largest market and while the slowing US economy will affect the European economies, Europe's social systems provide a strong underpinning for European consumers, who place a very high priority in taking their vacations. Our European cruise brands are performing quite well.</p>
          <p>As we indicated in the press release, we have reduced 2008 EPS guidance range to $3.00 to $3.20, which is a 10% reduction from previous guidance &#x2013; a $0.10 reduction from previous guidance. The $0.10 reduction is comprised of a number of factors, including lower expected revenue yields, the deferral of the fuel supplement revenue I had previously discussed, the higher forecasted fuel costs for the reminder of the year, and a 10% benefit from the strengthening of foreign currencies.  Our revenue yield guidance for 2008 has been increased to 5.5 to 6.5% from 4.5 to 5.5%, largely as a result of the stronger euro and Australian currencies; and on a local currency basis, it has decreased to 2 to 3% from 3 to 4% in previous guidance.</p>
          <p>Let me take you through now the individual quarters and give you as we look forward and give you a brief outline on how they are shaping up.  In the second quarter, company-wide capacity is up 8.3% over 2007 and there is only a small amount of inventory left to sell in the second quarter.  Overall occupancy is slightly ahead of last year with pricing nicely up year over year. Our Northern American cruise brand capacity is up 3% in the second quarter. 52% of that capacity is Caribbean, down from 55% in 2007.  Mexican Riviera is 13% versus 11% in 2007, and the remaining capacity is spread amongst various other itineraries.</p>
          <p>North American occupancy is up 1.5 points year over year and pricing is well ahead of last year.  All brands are performing well, with the Caribbean pricing rebounding nicely from 2007.  Mexican Riviera pricing is approximately flat, and pricing of most other itineraries are higher year over year with the exception of the shoulder Alaska season, which is slightly down. We currently forecast second quarter North American yields to be nicely up year over year.</p>
          <p>For our European brands, second quarter capacity is up 23% on a year over year basis. Europe's second quarter occupancy is on an overall basis running slightly behind 2007, with pricing slightly ahead. Europe capacity is 59% in European itineraries, which is up 7 points from 52% in last year; 16% in the Caribbean, approximately the same as last year; 11% in transatlantics, which was also approximately the same as last year. And the rest of the fleet is in various other itineraries.  Europe itinerary pricing is up year over year and pricing in all other itineraries is relatively flat with the prior year. We are currently forecasting European second quarter revenue yield on a local currency basis to be approximately flat year over year.</p>
          <p>As indicated in the press release, on a company-wide basis we are currently forecasting yields in the second quarter to be in the 6.5 to 7.5% range.  On a local currency basis, it would be 2.5 to 3.5. It's driven primarily &#x2013; the stronger yield is driven primarily by stronger Caribbean pricing.  Local currency revenue guidance for the second quarter is slightly lower than previously thought as it incorporates the lower estimated onboard revenues that we talked about as well as the deferral of the revenue related to the fuel supplement that we've also previously discussed.</p>
          <p>Based on the forward price for fuel of about $528 a metric ton, the increase in second quarter fuel cost is approximately $161 million over 2007 second quarter or $0.20 per share. Taking all these variables into consideration, EPS for the second quarter is now expected to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.44 versus $0.48 a year ago second quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let me discuss in the third quarter as it is shaping up today.  On a company-wide basis, capacity for Q3 is up 8.8%.  At this time, overall third quarter occupancy is up slightly year over year and pricing is well ahead.</p>
          <p>North American capacity is up 2% year over year, primarily resulting from the delivery of Carnival Splendor and HAL's Eurodam in early summer. 36% of North American third quarter capacity is in the Caribbean, which is down from 40% last year; 29% in Alaska, which is about the same as last year; and 22% in Europe versus 18% last year; and the remaining itineraries are in various other markets.</p>
          <p>North American occupancies were 1.6 points higher than a year ago and pricing is nicely ahead of last year.  Caribbean occupancy and yields are well ahead year over year.  Alaska and Europe occupancies are slightly down with slightly lower pricing for Alaska and flat pricing for Europe sailing. As a result of the strong occupancy and pricing for our Caribbean itineraries, we are currently estimating North America brand revenue yields to come in nicely higher than the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Europe; on European brands, with the delivery of the AIDAbella for AIDA Cruises and the P&amp;O Ventura ship this spring and the Ocean and the Queen Victoria, which was actually delivered at the beginning of this fiscal year, Europe brand capacity is up 24% in the third quarter. Europe brand capacity is substantially all based in the Mediterranean and Northern Europe during the summer quarter. Given the large capacity increase in Europe at this juncture, occupancies are slightly lower year over year.  With local currency pricing higher, we are forecasting European local currency revenue yields to be approximately flat by the time the third quarter closes.</p>
          <p>Overall for the third quarter, we expect revenue yields &#x2013; when I say combining, I say overall combining North America and Europe, we expect revenue yields on a local currency basis to be higher than 2007's third quarter.  Because of the more difficult comparisons to 2007 third quarter yields last year and factoring in a modest reduction in yields to reflect the impact of the slowing North American economy, we are forecasting an increase in local revenue yields for the quarter, but not as high as the increases in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the fourth quarter, company-wide capacity for the fourth quarter is up 8.7% over 2007.  Booking data for the fourth quarter is still in the early stages, so I caution not to read too much into the information. Overall, fleet-wide occupancies are running about 4 points higher on a year over year basis, with pricing also well ahead year over year.</p>
          <p>In North America, fourth quarter capacity is up 5% with 42% in the Caribbean versus 46% a year ago, down 4 points; 12% in Europe versus 10% in 2007; 12% Mexican Riviera, which is approximately the same as last year; and the balance spread amongst various other itineraries.</p>
          <p>North American occupancies are running approximately 3 points ahead year on year with pricing nicely up as well.  Caribbean occupancy and pricing are ahead of last year. Mexican Riviera occupancy is flat versus last year and pricing is slightly ahead. And Europe, pricing is down year over year on a slight increase in occupancy. So the North American fourth quarter booking picture at this point is quite good.</p>
          <p>Capacity for our European brands is up 18% in the fourth quarter. European fourth quarter capacity is 77% for European itineraries versus 81% a year ago. 10.5% in transatlantic is up from 8.3% a year ago and the balance spread amongst the remaining itineraries.</p>
          <p>Europe brand occupancies are running approximately 3.5 points ahead year on year with pricing also nicely ahead at this juncture. Occupancy and pricing for European and transatlantic cruises are up year over year. Again, I caution not to read too much into this information as the fourth quarter is typically one of the most challenging quarters in the cruise business. And there is still a long way to go before the quarter is complete.</p>
          <p>For the second half of the year as a whole, we are forecasting a year over year increase in revenue yield. But similar to the third quarter, the increase will be lower than the first half of the year, largely because of more difficult comparisons with the stronger yield performance in the second half of 2007.</p>
          <p>And with those comments, that completes my story. Sean, we will turn it back over to you to open it up for questions. I ask that you limit your questions to two per person so we can try to give everybody an opportunity to ask questions. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, I have two questions. The first is just on the comments about onboard spend. It sounds like you're saying it continues to be just the broader market brands and you haven't see it in the other brands yet. I don't know if you can give any more color on is it across all the items of onboard spenders. Is it more one area versus the other?  I'm just trying to get a little more insight into that. And then the second question is just about the proposed regulations for cabitage changes. It sounds like the decision is going to end up being reasonable and favorable, but I'm just wondering what your expectations are there in terms of timing now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robin, Micky here.  As far as onboard revenue, yes, it stayed within the context of the contemporary brands as we disclosed in the K.  We haven't seen it in the premium brands.  It's pretty much across the board. I would say that if you look specifically at certain areas, it would be what you would expect.  If people aren't buying homes or looking for homes and decorating homes, they are likely buy less art than they would if they were buying homes and decorating their homes. So the art revenue may be down more than average.  On the other hand, people are taking vacations and going to places for the first time, and they are continuing to buy shore excursions, so shore excursions would be down less or not down at all. While there are anomalies within, generally it's pretty much across the board in the contemporary brands.</p>
          <p>As far as the CBT decision, we don't know what that's going to be.  We are hopeful that it will not be impactful to our business as you said.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from the line Felicia Hendrix with Lehman Brothers. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning guys. Howard, I just wanted to understand some of your comments relative to the detail you gave last quarter and understand the phenomenon behind the change and interpreting this correctly. In this quarter, you said that North American occupancy in the second quarter and in the third quarter were up about 1.5 points and 1.6 points respectively, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so that compares to what you said last quarter of up 6 and up 7. So I am just trying to understand the change there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Q2, I think it's clear that it's a zero sum gain, so at some point, your occupancy, while you were ahead, way ahead three months ago, your occupancy &#x2013; the amount you are going to be ahead as you close out the quarter is going to substantially reduce.  And I think Q3 is evidence of some slowdown that we've seen in the booking patterns that I discussed.  And as a result of that, I think that is what we are factoring into our yield outlook.  But fortunately for us, Q3 was well booked and the patterns in Q3 continued and pricing continues to be very good. So we feel pretty confident that we will close out the quarter with up yield, as I indicated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you have to remember this.  If you're looking at a graph of where occupancy is and where you are going to end up, it ends up at zero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, that's what I wanted to &#x2013; okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the reality is that graph has to narrow as you get closer.  Also the reality is when you look at second quarter, we are almost at the end of the graph. And for third quarter, we are also very far along the graph. So it has to narrow substantially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that is what I wanted to check. And then just a housekeeping question; your share count this quarter was 814 million lower than I had thought it would have been.  Did you buy back any shares in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the anti-dilution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The convertibles in the first quarter weren't dilutive, which reduced the share count in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you; two also here.  Regarding the fuel, David, just to clarify again, $40 million you pulled out of your assumption for the balance of the year or is that for the full year encompassing the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 40 million is for the full year, encompassing the first quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Q1 was $5 million, then the balance of the year.  Remember Q1 was just the month of February.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the 35 million is the balance of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and you would anticipate that being spread according to revenue, historical revenue spreads in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, it was related to existing bookings on November 7, when we announced the program.  So it may not be spread between the second, third, and fourth quarter in accordance with all revenues because the second quarter would have been more booked than the third and the fourth at that time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and again that was 30 basis points of yield that reduced your yield a nickel for the full year, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, second question is related to I guess funding.  You have some debt coming due.  Obviously, you've got new build of ships and you are always rolling over some of the debt. Historically, you have been able to tap some export-import credit facilities.  Given the state of the global credit markets, can you give us an update or some thoughts as to what you guys are maybe working on from that perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean basically, we have completed in total 10 Italian export credits, five of which are drawn and five are yet to be drawn.  We had done two Germans.  One has been drawn and one is yet to be drawn. In total for 2008, basically we have enough committed credit to make it through the balance of the year for the ship commitments and also the refunding. It doesn't mean we are not potentially going to do some more opportunistic financing, but we don't necessarily need to do anything for the balance of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What was the total of that and any terms on that type of debt, I mean your maturity range, interest rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is clearly where our A-minus rating is of great benefit to us. And we are hearing obviously from banks and others that makes it much, much easier to continue to do deals with us at very, very favorable rates. So these are the times were our stubbornness about maintaining ratings really has helped us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as your maturities and rates, typically the export credits as you can see in the financials have been 12-year amortizing loans. And some of the ones that we have drawn have all generally started with &#x2013; have actually all started with a 4 in terms of the interest rate, something between like 4.50 and 4.75. And the future ones are in this same general region.  Some are a little higher; some are a little lower, but all starting with a 4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and again, what's the total, David, of the five drawn and the five undrawn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't remember the exact figure, but most them are roughly between -around 350 million per loan on average.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. With growing capacity in Europe, it seems that there is some concern from the agents on the availability and pricing of airfares or airlifts from the US to Europe. Do you share that concern and is there anything you can do to offset any negative impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we do share that concern.  On the other hand, we do have committed air on our air seat programs, committed air seats and committed air prices on our air seat program and we are fine in that area.  Where we are a little bit concerned is those people who historically have purchased their own air, and whether they would be able to get them at reasonable price. We are not as concerned about availability as we are the cost. And hopefully, it just doesn't take too many people out of the marketplace.  But as Howard reported, as of right now, our booking situation is pretty good. And so while it's a concern, it hasn't seem to impacted us very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see, and as a follow-on to the pricing trends, it seems that of all the regions, the Caribbean seems to be doing the best.  Obviously, there are some easy comps there, but how has that changed? Does it change the way you think about your seat allocations for the next few years?  Could we see some capacity moving back to the Caribbean or are you better off moving it into Europe or other emerging markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>While the Caribbean has rebounded, I think it's clear that yields are much higher in Europe and Alaska than they are in the Caribbean. And so I doubt that you will see movement any differently than you have seen for the last year or two.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, two questions from me.  Firstly, obviously there is some uncertainty surrounding the fuel surcharges you discussed today, but can you just give us some indication whether you would consider extending the size of the fuel surcharge given where the oil price is? And then secondly, just to be clear in terms of your reduction in net yield guidance by 1 percentage point. How much of that is due to retail onboards and how much is due to not being able to recognize currently the fuel settlement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Because of the sensitivity of our discussions with the Attorney General's office, we'd rather not talk too much about the issue of what we're going to do going forward until we've concluded those discussions. As far as the impact, I'll turn it over to David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we reduced overall guidance by 1%. I had said before 0.3 percentage points was due to the fuel supplement. And the other 0.7 points was due to the changes we made in &#x2013; as Howard indicated, in ticket revenue yields as well as onboard revenue yield.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>It's also important to reiterate that we've increased guidance on an actual basis &#x2013; yield guidance on an actual basis. So when analysts are comparing our constant dollars to someone else's actual, if they increase it, it's probably because the currency as well.</p>

          <p>Briefly, what about retirement of vessels that are within the fleet or moving them to joint ventures or things of that nature?  Is there anything we can talk to, to that point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are no plans at the current time to retire any ships or put them into a joint venture. As you know, David, we acquired 75% of Ibero Cruises last year and we have moved one of the older Carnival ships into that venture, the Celebration, and there will be a second ship to go into that business in 2009.  And some of the older smaller ships, if we can find good buyers for them, because it's really de minimis actually in terms of what we are talking about in terms of our own capacity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That will clearly give more flexibility to the post-Panamax ships, particularly the ones that are on the West Coast.  So, I don't think it will be a major issue for us, but it will give us greater flexibility to move post-Panamax &#x2013; what are presently post-Panamax ships from one coast to the other the way we do Panamax ships now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This is Assia, congratulations on very good results in a tough environment. I only had one question.  Maybe Howard, you can help me.  Can you give us some more color as to the booking trends by European passengers, obviously a big percentage of your source markets?  And it's my understanding that they don't fall as neatly into wave season and the trends that we see in North America. And again, you mentioned that some of the weakness from the US economy is spreading into Europe.  Have you seen any specific evidence or are you just being cautious?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Assia, let me handle the last question. There is some &#x2013; we have seen some evidence, but it is very recent, of a slowdown similar to &#x2013; a little bit similar to what we have seen in North America in Europe. Whether it's economic driven or otherwise, it's not clear. Having said that, to respond to your first question, our bookings in Europe have been very, very strong and are significantly up year on year. We have several new ships entering service as I indicated.  Bookings are strong for those ships. So I think we are in quite good shape in Europe, but in forecasting out yield as I indicated, even though we are ahead in some cases on European yields right now or European pricing, our brands are suggesting given the patterns that we are seeing in Europe that we will come in relatively flat on yields in Europe by the time these quarters close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And my second question very quickly, Alaska doesn't seem to be doing so well this year and if I recall last year, it wasn't that strong; any specific reason or just the cyclicality there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Alaska is not as strong as it could.  Alaska is doing fine, it was doing fine last year. I think part of the issue is that demand &#x2013; summer demand has skewed more towards Europe, and I think that has been an issue.  The $50 head tax I think has been an issue.  Clearly Alaska is not growing the way other markets are growing and I think it has been impacted by the $50 head tax. I suspect that it will continue not to grow at the pace of other premium markets like Europe based on that and other factors.  Obviously you do have to position the ships through the Panama Canal to Alaska, and I think the companies have been conservative in doing that based on what happened with the referendum. But overall it's fine, I mean it just &#x2013; it continues to be a very, very good premium market for us.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, two quick ones. Can you say anything about your bookings visibility?  Are you finding that people are booking later-in now than perhaps in the last couple of months as there is greater uncertainty in their lives?  What does that mean for Q4 and going into 2009? And the second question is on source markets within the US economy.  Are you seeing any regional imbalances?  For instance, is Florida much weaker than California and it sounds like if you read across to your future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, our booking curve has been as far out as it has ever been historically and that has been the case since about middle of last year. And it hasn't come in at all as far we can tell. Anecdotally, we are ahead in the fourth quarter.  Anecdotally, we are ahead in the first quarter of...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of '09, so the booking curve has been as far out as it has ever been.  A lot of what we are saying unfortunately relates to reading the Wall Street Journal and other newspapers. Clearly, we are more concerned about Florida than California because of that.  The housing situation in those markets is far worse than anywhere else in the country I think. So, we are impacted by all of this.  We are impacted by what happens in the market.  We are impacted by Bear Stearns and you call tell it based on what we are talking.  But the reality is the bottom line our booking pattern is as Howard described it and our booking curve is as good as it has ever been. So, we will continue to truck along here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys; I have two questions. First of all, can you talk to the elements of controllable costs that provide the favorable outlook for the balance of the year? It looks like you front loaded your dry-dock costs.  Is that contributing to it?  And the second speaks to Micky's comment about the conservatism.  Is it time given your valuation and dividend yield, which is not too far off from your financing costs, to consider a more aggressive repo? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the costs are concerned; the dry-dock, it's not that we are front loading it.  It has to just do with scheduling of the dry-dock and there generally isn't much scheduling in the third quarter because that is of course the strongest season for us. So, you've got a lot more dry-docks scheduled in the first quarter and it was up 21 million.  That's one of the reasons.  But basically if you actually look over the year, we had indicated that controllable costs in the first quarter were relatively flat; and the second quarter the same thing; and for the full year. So the controllable costs are relatively flat for all four quarters of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, to some degree, we benefit from the fleet expansion as well as the larger ships coming into the fleet, which have better cost metrics than the smaller ones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Particularly in Europe, where the scale effect is bigger because the brands are smaller.  It has a bigger scale effect for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we've got all of the operating units out there looking at cost saving measures in every respect, whether it would be in food or other areas, where they can without any noticeable service change reduce costs on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>As far as the buyback program is concerned, we have said publicly before that we are interested in &#x2013; we are going to be opportunistic in buying back shares, but within our current credit rating.  As you can see in today's credit market with the way the world is going today, having a strong credit rating, as Micky indicated before, is a top priority given our financing needs. We have been able to utilize that strong credit rating to complete all the financing we need for this year. So in today's world, our A-minus is even more important to us than it was ever before. And so while we will continue to look at a buyback program, we're going to focus and make sure we maintain that credit rating and continue to evaluate that over time.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And our next question comes from the line of David Leibowitz with Burnham. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Quickly, the shore excursion part of the cruise &#x2013; not shore excursion, but the short part of the cruise tours, where the passengers are spending a few days pre or pos; are they improving for you as a source of revenue or are you finding that the tightening in the overall economy is affecting that part of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not aware of an issue on cruise tour bookings. It's obviously early to tell because we don't get into that business in any way until end of May.  But advance bookings as far as I know are basically on par with expectations and were good last year.  I really can't comment on that.  We may be in a better position to talk about that at the end of the third quarter, but right now we don't see anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also the premium, the luxury end of the business, is there more you could be doing beyond just having one new ship coming in for Seabourn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's important to understand that the luxury market is a very small market. A lot of times you get analysts compare a luxury cruise product to what is perceived to be a luxury hotel product like Four Seasons or Ritz-Carlton. It's really not.  The luxury cruise market is up there with hotels at the top, the very upper end boutique hotels that cost $1,000 plus per day. Four Seasons or Ritz-Carlton, all those have conventions and meetings that generally don't exist in a luxury cruise product.  And so, it's a very small market, so growing it by one ship per year for Seabourn, for example, is a pretty aggressive growth rate.  And if a lot of the luxury competitors jump into that and grow it, we'll find ourselves struggling.</p>
          <p>The reality is when we made that decision, no one in the luxury market had announced a new build for a very long period of time and in fact ships were withdrawn. Radisson Seven Seas at the time withdrew a ship. Crystal withdrew a ship. So, the reality is it's a market that has in my opinion great potential but for a very, very small segment; and we have to grow it cautiously and the industry has to grow it cautiously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you think about it, David, because the new Seabourn ships are more than twice as large in terms of capacity as the older ships, we are tripling the size of the fleet in three years, which is pretty aggressive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I should say though that early booking indications are really excellent.  We are really very pleased with the early indications for Seabourn Odyssey.  She is booking beautifully.</p>

          <p>And our next question comes from the line of Edward Stanford with Cazenove. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everybody; just a couple questions, please; one just a technical one on the accounting treatment of the $40 million.  If and when the Florida Court makes a decision, do you just write it back in the quarter in which the decision was made?  And secondly, I think you alluded to perhaps just the first signs of weakness in some of your European brands.  Is that more present in volume of bookings or is it in onboard spend; if you could give a little bit more color on that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the 40 million is concerned, first of all there is no court involved.  The discussions have been with the Florida Attorney General and they are ongoing.  If there was a decision that would allow us to continue with the bookings, we would recognize those that we did not recognize in February at the time we reached an agreement with the Florida Attorney General.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What's in question is only those bookings that were on our books prior to November 6. There is now no question about all the bookings after November 7. So, the $40 million refers to the bookings that were on our books prior to November 6; and we will either be able to take that into income or not.  We're taking the conservative approach at this point and not until there is a final determination from our discussions with the AG's office.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the issue with weakness in Europe, or some signs of weakness, it's not &#x2013; it's really very early and it's very inconsistent and it can vary significantly by each of the major markets. Some markets continue to be quite strong.  Others seem to be moderating, and week in and week out because we are so close to it, you do not want to be overly influenced by what you see in terms of the current booking pattern because it could &#x2013; it may not hold up for a while. So you may find that it could strengthen.  And just during this pre-Easter period, it's very difficult to determine whether some of this is a result of the early Easter and people focusing on the holiday, which does happen, as opposed to any real weakness that is going on. So, I think we'll have a better sense of it, but I think our business managers in each of the European businesses basically are forecasting out good yields based on what they think is going to happen.  That is the best information we have right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have to put this context.  Our occupancy right now is about flat.  Our yields are about flat, and we have a huge increase in capacity, 20 plus percent increase, and the industry has a 20 plus increase in capacity here. So, I would venture to say that Europe is performing beautifully.  But again we are really impacted I think by everything we read.  So I'd say that we are a little bit aware of a slight pressure on Costa, which is in effect our contemporary European brand, has had a little bit of weakness in onboards, similar to contemporary North American brands.  But again the booking pattern in Europe has been extremely strong when you consider the amount of capacity that has been added this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, bookings are substantially up year on year, on an absolute basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and they are even on a capacity adjusted.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I might be over-analyzing this, but when you look at the onboard spending and some of the weakness there, is it across the board in terms of all categories, or do you have the data to see that it's more the high end stuff, the spa and that kind of stuff?  Can you just comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you're trying to get me to answer a Steiner question, I won't do it.  But the reality is that it's pretty much across the board as I said before.  We have seen more deterioration in something like art auction, as I said, and less with shore excursion, but we are talking percentage points. It is just 1% &#x2013; very, very small movements in all of these things. I guess we were spoiled by this inflation plus a little bit consistency year over year over year; and now that we're not getting it in some brands, we thought we should alert everybody, but it's pretty much across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But understand it's more focused, it's more of an issue in the contemporary products than the premium.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just wondering from a capital planning perspective, are you assuming that these convertible bonds that are puttable this year are going to be put back to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been prepared to if they are put. We actually have two of them that are puttable to us in April.  The 2% is puttable on April 15. The hypers are puttable on April 29.  And if you looked at our 10-K filing, we signed up a 1.5 billion revolver, so that if they are put, we have the available liquidity to pay the put, and so we are ready.  But the assumption or actually the put right is in the hands of the holders and we will leave it up to them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, a couple items here. Once you pass those two primary put provisions, I think you have another one in October. Once you past those and say there is no put occurring, would you potentially be more aggressive at that point assuming no change and everything else in your stock price and repurchasing stock?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess at that point in time, I would still have to reiterate what I said before relative to the stock buyback program is that our rating is incredibly important to us and allows us the access to the banks and the capital markets. And we will buy back within the context of the rating and we continually look at that and evaluate it over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then two other housekeeping items.  What's your anticipated fuel usage, an update for 2008 as a whole?  And then in the quarter &#x2013; granted it's not that much; but your tax benefit was a little bit larger; anything going on there on a year over year basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the tax is concerned, typically in the first quarter, we do have a benefit from the tour operations because of course those are very seasonal and are pretty much shut down in the wintertime, so you get a benefit from there.  But in addition to that, on top of that, with some of our Italian subsidiaries, we had a merger and we were able to recognize some tax benefits as a result of that, so that's the increase in the quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
