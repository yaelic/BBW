          <p>Thank you, Sol.  Welcome to the fourth quarter and full year conference call for National Oilwell Varco.  I am Pete Miller, CEO, and with me today is Clay Williams, our Chief Financial Officer.  Earlier today, we announced fourth quarter earnings of $377 million or $1.05 per fully diluted share on revenue of 2.66 billion and we announced full year earnings of 1.34 billion or $3.76 per fully diluted share on revenues of $9.79 billion.  These are both record results for us and we're very pleased with them.  In a moment, I'll turn it over to Clay and he'll provide more color on the numbers and our results.</p>
          <p>In addition to our earnings, we announced a quarter-ending backlog of $9 billion.  During the quarter, we took in a record $2.2 billion of new orders.  I'll expand upon this backlog -- or these backlog numbers a little later in this call.</p>
          <p>I am very pleased with both our financial results and our backlog growth.  We appreciate the confidence our customers have shown in us and the tremendous efforts of our 30,000 employees to achieve these results as well as the continued support of our worldwide network of supplier partners.  At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Clay to give you some comments regarding our financials.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Pete.  Before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31st, 2007, please note that we -- that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecasts, projections and estimates including but not limited to comments about our outlook for the company's business.  These are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws based on limited information as of today, which is subject to change.</p>
          <p>They are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially.  No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year.  I refer you to the latest Form 10-K, Form S-4 and Form 10-Q National Oilwell Varco has on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business.  Further information regarding these as well as supplemental financial and operating information may be found within our press release, on our website at www.nov.com or in our filings with the SEC. Later on in this call, Pete and I will answer your questions.  We ask that you limit your questions to two in order to permit more participation.</p>
          <p>National Oilwell Varco generated earnings of $377 million or $1.05 per fully diluted share in its fourth quarter ended December 31st, 2007 on revenues of $2.659 billion.  Earnings per share rose 3% sequentially and rose 54% from the fourth quarter of 2006. NOV's fourth quarter revenues improved 3% sequentially and 28% year over year. Operating profit was $575 million in the fourth quarter or 21.6% of sales, an increase of 5% sequentially and an increase of 51% year over year. Flowthrough or operating leverage was 37% sequentially and 33% year over year.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2007 National Oilwell Varco earned $1.3 billion or $3.76 per fully diluted share on $9.8 billion in revenue. Earnings per share, adjusted for the stock split, improved 95% on 39% higher revenues year over year.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was $2 billion, up 84%. Operating margins for the year expanded 510 basis points to 20.9%, and year-over-year operating leverage or flowthrough was a very strong 34%. All three of our operating segments produced record revenues in 2007.</p>
          <p>National Oilwell Varco and Grant Prideco announced on December 17th, 2007 that the companies had entered into a definitive merger agreement, pursuant to which National Oilwell Varco would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Grant Prideco for a combination of cash and NOV stock. The transaction remains subject to various conditions including approval by regulatory authorities and approval by a majority of Grant Prideco stockholders.</p>
          <p>On January 7th, we filed our application with the US Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and have been in discussions with the DOJ regarding the proposed transaction since the filing.</p>
          <p>At this time a few minor questions still are outstanding. These questions do not merit a second request. However, the DOJ does need more time to answer its questions. Therefore, this morning, in order to give the DOJ more time to evaluate the transaction, we have pulled and are refiling our application under Hart-Scott-Rodino. This will restart the HSR waiting period and facilitate the DOJ's desire to better understand the transaction. We are confident that these issues will be resolved shortly and that the transaction will be approved given that NOV does not compete with Grant Prideco in its businesses.</p>
          <p>On January 28th, National Oilwell Varco filed an S-4 registration statement for the NOV shares to be issued, together with a proxy statement and prospectus for Grant Prideco shareholders. We do not know precisely when the FCC will permit these to become effective, but we nevertheless expect the transaction to close sometime in April 2008 and remain very enthusiastic about the prospects for the combined business as we enter the new year. We urge shareholders to read our public filings for more information about the transaction.</p>
          <p>Turning back to NOV's fourth quarter performance, we continue to execute well, efficiently fabricating highly sophisticated drilling rigs, delivering great service and technology, and pressing forward into new, promising international markets.  We are pleased to once again announce a record level of new rig orders and backlog and we are glad that the drilling contractors we serve continue to trust NOV with their critical rig building projects.  They count on National Oilwell Varco to deliver safer, cleaner, more efficient ways of finding and developing new sources of oil and gas.</p>
          <p>Our secret weapon in this effort, the factor that convinces Pete and me that we will continue to succeed in this endeavor, are the dedicated NOV professionals who keep the oil patch running smoothly around the world. I know that many are listening to this call today and I want all of you to know how grateful we are for the super job that you did in 2007.  We also offer our thanks to our vendors for their excellent performance this past year, and we want our employees, suppliers and customers alike to know just how excited we are about 2008.</p>
          <p>Here's why we are excited.  The world needs to build a lot of rigs and we have just the team to build them and it's a growing team.  We are pleased to announce that we have opened the first of three innovative training programs, the NOV Technical College in Norway to support our Rig Technology group.  We expect to open two more, one in Houston and one in Singapore later this year at a total cost of nearly $30 million.  All three will immerse bright, energetic students in an intensive six to 12- month course in the science of maintaining, repairing, installing and commissioning the sophisticated equipment and technology NOV provides.  Our goal is to expand the number of rig service technicians available to keep the growing numbers of high-tech rigs working efficiently.</p>
          <p>At the time of the merger between National Oilwell and Varco, we had a little over 400 service technicians available to service equipment and in the three years since, this workforce has grown to nearly 1,000.  Over that next year or so, we expect to recruit and train new technicians to bring our workforce up to about 1,400 and NOV Technical College will help us do this, along with institutionalizing a means to steadily improve the skill set of all of our technicians.</p>
          <p>NOV is committed to developing the skills of its valued employees and customers alike.  In 2007, we trained nearly 1,700 drilling contractor personnel, including 150 US land contractor employees who received training in our new state-of-the-art mobile training lab, which brings NOV instructors to the field.</p>
          <p>These initiatives represent a sustained, systematic commitment to grow and enhance our already deep pool of talent.  This effort will also help us manage the rising demand for installation and commissioning work associated with 165 offshore new builds underway.  So far, our track record on getting these rigs out of the shipyards to spud has been very good.  We have completed the installation and commissioning of 22 rigs since the merger, including the first floater, the Stena DrillMAX I which was delivered early.</p>
          <p>We are presently performing INC operations on another 23 rigs in 13 different shipyards with 180 NOV technicians.  Once these new rigs spud they will need ongoing maintenance and refurbishment support.  2007 marked the year that we opened a 400,000 square foot aftermarket service center in Houston to keep these rigs supplied with critical spare parts and efficiently refurbish the high-tech equipment they employ.  This initiative began to pay dividends this quarter as we saw significant growth in aftermarket revenues and rig technology, which contributed significantly to the market expansion and high flowthroughs for the group. Total non-backlog revenue for rig technology grew 11% sequentially, entirely due to higher aftermarket sales.</p>
          <p>Our Houston aftermarket facility also served to concentrate our equipment refurbishment businesses and extract them from operations where we manufacture new equipment.  This has freed up floor space, machine tools, and other resources in our new equipment manufacturing plant, effectively increasing capacity there and making them more efficient by accelerating our cellular manufacturing and quick response manufacturing initiatives, which are underway in about a dozen locations.  The margin expansion you've seen in our rig technology financial statements over the past several quarters demonstrate the success of these manufacturing initiatives.</p>
          <p>We're expanding elsewhere around the globe too.  This quarter we invested in additional manufacturing space in the Middle East, completed a number of expansion projects in domestic manufacturing plants, and opened a new assembly facility in Norway.  Looking forward we expect to open another aftermarket support facility in Singapore later this year.</p>
          <p>NOV also continued to invest in new and better ways of drilling in 2007.  We are launching new rigs for high ambient temperature desert drilling conditions, and a specialized rig designed for Latin America, where our Ideal Rigs and Rapid Rigs continue to gain acceptance.  We are lucky to have some of the best, most experienced drilling technology minds in the business on the NOV team, and our rig technology engineers and scientists applied for or won 49 patents for their innovations last year.</p>
          <p>Rig Technology group won $2.2 billion in new orders during Q4, including major packages for four deepwater floaters.  Orders eclipsed last quarter's record levels by nearly 13%, and lifted backlog to a record $9 billion.  A little over $5 billion is scheduled to flow out as revenue in 2008, and most of the rest in 2009.  The backlog is 88% international and 12% domestic, and 85% offshore and 15% land, reflecting strong interest in building offshore rigs for promising new deep water basins like Brazil Santos Basin where Petrobras has announced two major discoveries in as many months.  We think this news, together with recent advancements in reliably seeing through salt with seismic processes and drilling through salt with rotary steerables and oil-based mud will fuel further industry interest in deepwater new builds. As a result our bid activity remains brisk as it has for 12 straight quarters.</p>
          <p>Last quarter we spoke about declining demand for new land rigs in North America where our land rig backlog has fallen by about half from peak 2006 levels.  This quarter the domestic land backlog stabilized and we are seeing and hearing of a lower level of stealth building wherein land contractors are acknowledging the success of high tech fit-for-purpose rigs in the domestic market.  Old, tired iron must and will be replaced, even at day rates that are considerably less heroic than those seen in 2006.  Contractors are responding to competition from better rigs that consistently post meaningfully higher day rates and utilization, and NOV's here to help.</p>
          <p>Demand for land rigs for international markets is exceptionally strong and we are seeing considerably higher interest in high tech rigs for these markets.  We believe operator experience with higher technology rigs vis-a-vis old mechanical rigs will continue to pull more of these into the marketplace.  Q4 saw 22% growth in our international land rig backlog as several international customers placed firm commitments.</p>
          <p>To recap, we expect to continue to sell into three important trends in the rig fleet worldwide.  The secular build-out of additional deepwater capabilities, the retooling of the jack-up fleet with newer, more capable rigs, and the replacement of tired, old land rigs both here and abroad with smart new technology.  And, as a reminder, 73% of the world's fleet of floating rigs are more than 20 years old and 84% of the world's jack-up fleet is more than 20 years old, and as the great old rocker Neil Young put it, rust never sleeps.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to operating results for Q4.  Rig Technology generated $1.594 million in revenue and $411 million in operating profit in the fourth quarter, yielding an operating margin of 25.8%.  The group generated sequential flowthrough of 51% and year-over-year flowthrough of 40%.  Sales rose 5% sequentially and 40% year over year.  Sales out of backlog increased 3% and non-backlog revenues increased 11% sequentially.  Both were up in margin with revenue from backlog coming through at higher margins due to good cost control on offshore new builds, and non-backlog revenue benefiting from favorable mix of significantly higher sales of spare parts and repair services, offset by lower component sales into the western hemisphere land market.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to the first quarter of 2008, we expect to see Rig Technology revenues grow in the mid single-digit range but at more typical flowthroughs in the mid to high 20% range, resulting in margins comparable to Q4.  We also expect another good quarter for bookings particularly for offshore rigs but are unlikely to surpass the $2.2 billion in orders won in Q4.</p>
          <p>The Petroleum Services and Supply segment generated $818 million in revenues in the fourth quarter, an increase of 2% from the third quarter and a 22% increase from the fourth quarter of 2006.  Operating profit was $189 million, down $4.4 million from the third quarter, and operating margins were 23.1%, down 90 basis points from the third quarter.  Year-over-year flowthroughs were 17% below the group's average of the past few years.</p>
          <p>Several factors contributed to the lower margins, including a softer North American service market where drilling contractors are reducing purchases and applying more pressure on pricing, which led to lower purchases of expendables and services across a number of product lines. We also see US drilling contractors pulling expendables and spares off older stacked rigs and reducing their major rig refurbishment projects, resulting in a decline in overall US sales for the group in Q4.</p>
          <p>Canada benefited from modest seasonal improvement but pricing remains under pressure which limited flowthroughs for the group there.  International sales growth was strong but at lower margins due to costs associated with several international expansion initiatives.  These include the costs associated with two new Tuboscope plants opened in China, and the opening of a 200,000 square foot manufacturing facility for downhole tools in the Middle East, and new motor service in relined facilities in the Fast East.</p>
          <p>Additionally, flooding in Mexico, higher costs in our European inspection operations and unfavorable mix of fiberglass pipe and mill equipment sales, and modestly lower coil tubing sales were only partly offset by higher sales of downhole tools and instrumentation equipment, comparing Q4 to Q3.</p>
          <p>Moving into the first quarter, we expect continued broad international growth to offset a modestly weakening North America picture.  Specifically, we foresee higher sales of power sections and rotors and stators for downhole drilling motors to be offset by inspection and coating declines due the rolling off some large riser, line pipe and mill equipment projects.  Also, fiberglass pipe and fishing tool sales are forecast to be down, resulting in an overall Petroleum Services and Supply's revenue and margins that we expect to be roughly flat with the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our Distribution Services segment also faced margin challenges in the North American market in Q4.  Group revenues were $366 million, up about 1% from the third quarter due to international growth and some seasonal improvement in Canada, which were partly offset by lower US sales.  Year-over-year sales were down modestly as international growth failed to fully offset declines in North America.  Operating profit was $20.9 million and operating margins declined to 5.7%, down 120 basis points from the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter saw higher severance and restructuring costs in Canada and the US business saw lower margins on a combination of mix and price and volume.  Domestic drilling contractors are bidding out more of their MRO contracts broadly and pricing appears to be weighing more heavily on their purchasing decisions.</p>
          <p>International growth was solid from Q3 to Q4 but flowthroughs were low as NOV expanded its Middle East operation and invested in new expansion locations in Thailand, Egypt, India and Angola. Overall, for the full year 2007, Distribution Services group grew international business 22% but Canadian declines completely offset this.  Nevertheless, the group did a great job building out the foundation for future international growth.</p>
          <p>Looking into the first quarter, we expect the distribution group to post modest margin improvements on roughly flat revenue, as international growth and seasonal and cost improvement in Canada are expected to offset continuing pressure in the US.</p>
          <p>Turning back to National Oilwell Varco's consolidated fourth quarter income statement, SG&amp;A increased $21.5 million from the third quarter and rose as a percentage of revenue from 7.6% to 8.1%, due to higher incentive compensation accruals and IT expenses and the reclassification of certain expenses from cost of goods sold.</p>
          <p>Higher interest expense was more than offset by higher interest income driven by higher cash balances.  Other income declined $17.7 million sequentially, due primarily to FX losses on the revaluation of unhedged accrued liability balances on projects in Norway.  For the full year National Oilwell Varco had FX losses of $7 million, down from $21 million in 2006 despite dramatically higher volumes as we improved our systematic hedging of FX exposures. Other income was also affected by higher banking fees associated with letters of credit on customer deposits.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter tax rate rose slightly from the third quarter to 32.7% and we ended the year at 33.3%, slightly below our expected rate of 34% due mostly to favorable manufacturing tax credits in the US.  We expect our rate to run in the range of about 33% in 2008 as benefits of lower statutory rates in a handful of countries will be partly offset by higher income tax rates from our Chinese operations.</p>
          <p>Unallocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental schedule were $45.9 million, down modestly from the third quarter.  Depreciation and amortization was $58.5 million in Q4, up $2.1 million sequentially due to higher CapEx and full quarter impact of Q3 acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Our December 31st balance sheet employed working capital, excluding cash and debt, of $1.878 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up $68 million or 4% from the third quarter and about 17.7% of annualized fourth quarter sales.  Inventory rose $323 million and cost in excess of billings rose $150 million, but these were partly offset by higher crude liabilities and billings in excess of cost.  Customer financing of our rig projects in the form of prepayments and billings in excess of cost totaled $1.9 billion at December 31st, up over $800 million from the prior year.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations was $437 million in the fourth quarter and $1.165 billion for the full year.  CapEx was $74 million in Q4, bringing our full-year CapEx to $252 million for 2007.  CapEx increased sequentially due largely to the Middle East and China expansion initiatives discussed earlier.  We expect 2008 CapEx to run in the range of $320 million.</p>
          <p>NOV spent $324 million in cash for acquisitions during the year, closing eight acquisitions.  Our cash balance was $1.842 billion at December 31st, up $356 million from the third quarter, and our debt totaled $891 million, $45 million due to debt incurred by an international joint venture in which we own a majority interest used to finance international acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn it over to Pete for his comments.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Clay.  What I'd like to do at this point is just kind of give you a little bit of an overview of what we're seeing operationally, and kind of take you to some of the spots around the world where we think that the business is going to be very nice over the next year.  When you really talk about 2008 for us operationally, it's going to be a story of about five things and the first one is a lot of continuing repositioning of assets.  As Clay pointed out earlier, we've moved a lot of international distribution systems out, we've done some things with downhole tools to reposition tools, and that's going to continue because these are going to be secular growth areas that we don't see declining anytime soon.</p>
          <p>Continuing on, we'll be continuing to prep for our deep-water operations.  You know, we're building most of the deep-water rigs in the world today, and the neat thing is that we're going to be supporting those rigs for the next 20 years.  And as we look to the future, we're making sure that we have the assets in place that can take advantage of doing that.</p>
          <p>We're going to continue new product offerings.  We have many new products in our -- many new arrows in our quiver and we think that this is going to help us expand operationally as we go throughout the year.</p>
          <p>We're going to continue making our operations more efficient.  In our QRM process, the things that we've done, a lot of the improvement that you see, especially in the drilling area, while some of it is pricing, an awful lot of that is the efficiency that we've created.  And as we've said before, we like to have that efficiency because that's the gift that keeps on giving.</p>
          <p>And then finally, we're going to continue to deliver the rigs on time that we've committed to our customers.  So that, really, those are the five things that we're emphasizing operationally this year.</p>
          <p>In our distribution area, Clay kind of pointed out that we're following our customers, we're going international. I think while in the short-term that incurs some expenses that you see, in the long-term it really positions ourselves to be able to take care of our customers in a much better way.  In distribution, we're also leveraging off our new build; much of the backlog that we have, those rigs are going to need support and we're able to do things with these customers and really create a new business model.  You've heard us in the past talk about what we've done with Scorpion and we see the opportunity to do that with many of the drilling contractors that are coming out of the shipyards today.  So we believe that really is going to be a positive area for us and again we're going to be emphasizing the deepwater areas.  Clay mentioned Angola and other areas where we're opening up distribution facilities to be able to take care of the rigs that we're building for those areas.</p>
          <p>In our petroleum services supplies area, it's going to be a lot about new products.  Things like our MD Totco Rig Sense 2.2 that helps our customers be able to really develop and get information on a much more timely basis and to be able to have much more efficient operations.  In our Brandt operations, we'll continue to emphasize our support of deepwater: as we look at the deepwater rigs coming into the Gulf of Mexico, we expect to be able to put many of our Brandt equipment and services on those rigs to be able to take care of them in the future.</p>
          <p>In our Mission operation, a lot of it's going to be efficiency, continuing to push out our QRM and continuing to drive down our costs and in addition to that, many of our new mud pumps are going out, our hex pumps on these offshore rigs and as that happens, we'll have the products out of Mission to be able to support those.</p>
          <p>In our Tuboscope operations, we'll continue to expand internationally, Clay mentioned our facilities in China and also what we do with riser, as you look at the riser that will be coming out in '08, '09 and 10 that'll be associated with much of the deepwater that we're seeing. So, again, a lot of operational efficiencies but a lot of positive things that we see out there for both distribution and petroleum services and supplies.</p>
          <p>In our drilling operation, as we mentioned earlier, we took in over $2.2 billion worth of new orders.  We think that reflects the confidence that our customers have in us as well as the continued secular increase in especially the deepwater rigs.  In particular, as I go around the world, one of the things I'd like to talk about is Russia.  Those of you that have been on these conference calls before have heard me talk a lot about Russia, my excitement about Russia and in particular, the Stockman Field.  Well, I'm happy to say we took our first orders for two semi-submersible rigs that are going to go into the Stockman Field.  They're in the fourth quarter backlog.  It'll be north of $400 million and I think there are going to be many more of these and we are positioned, with our very good partner Samsung, to be able to expand the operations that we're doing there.  One of the neat things about that, if I go back to distribution for a moment, as we put these rigs into places like the Stockman Field, we're going to open up some facilities to be able to support those rigs both on maintenance basis and on an MRO supply basis.  So we're excited about it.</p>
          <p>After this call, in a couple of days, I'm leaving for Russia so I can thank our Russian partners and customers over there for the opportunity to do this, but I think this is the, this is kind of the opening of the floodgates of the things that we think are going to happen in Russia.  We're excited about it.  I think a lot of the land contractors are starting to expand in Russia.  I know Weatherford's going over there.  Nabors has rigs going in and we're going to be there to support them.  We're also going to be selling new rigs into Russia, so when people talk to me and they say what's the area you're most excited about, I always said prospectively Russia and now I'm going to say it's there. We are starting to see it and you're going to see the -- our revenues increase in that arena.</p>
          <p>The Middle East and North Africa continue to be very, very good places for us.  Clay mentioned the increase in the international land rig business that we have and a lot of that is going into both the Middle East and North Africa.  We're opening up facilities in those areas to support these rigs both in our distribution &#x2013; well, really, in many more ways, our downhole tools, our Tuboscope, our Brandt, everybody really is moving into these areas quite aggressively so that we can take advantage of the things.  We've been there for a long time.  What we're doing now is expanding our opportunities in these areas.  I think the Middle East will continue to be a solid arena for us well into the future and I'm talking well into the next decade.</p>
          <p>One of the more interesting areas for us right now is South America.  You know the seismic rig count in South America went up about 43% last year and I think where seismic goes, drilling's going to follow.  We've been very successful in getting some new land rigs into Mexico, into Argentina and into other areas in South America.  I think it's going to be a pretty neat place for us and, of course, I don't need to tell anybody on this call about Brazil, because I think with the things going on in the Santos Basin Brazil will continue to be quite an exciting area for us as we go into the future.</p>
          <p>India and China both continue to be very good.  In India, we've taken some jack-up orders in the past quarter and in China we continue to utilize that as a base not only of manufacturing but also many of the products going in there.  It continues to be a wonderful arena for many of the shipyards and the new rigs being there, as well as our high tech equipment such as top drives.  So I think those will continue to be great areas.</p>
          <p>And then, finally, I want to talk for just a moment about North America.  Clearly, there's some challenges there but I will say this: North America has always, in the long term, provided good things for us.  I think you'll continue to see a lot of technological advances made when you're looking at things like the Barnett, Fayetteville Shale, they'll continue to do things for us that will enable us, to number one, learn a lot here, have good business here, but then take those learnings into the international arena.  We continue to be very bullish, I think, in the long term in North America.</p>
          <p>Are there some headwinds short term?  Sure, but we'll get through those.  I think those of us that have been in this industry for long time, unfortunately know how to handle these headwinds and we'll do that well, but I think in the long term North America will turn up and be a very positive arena for both the development of new products and for our businesses that we can expand and make them scalable worldwide.</p>
          <p>So that's kind of a quick tour, Clay did a very good job of kind of telling you some of the other things that we're seeing around the world, and at this point what I'd like to do is open it up for questions that some of the callers might have.</p>

          <p>Quick question on supporting the new builds, Pete.  Is there any way that you can quantify what you think the aftermarket opportunity is for each of these new builds from a support mode?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, that's a great question and it's one that we've had a lot recently, and my commitment is I'm going to try to do that over about the next six months, and let me tell you why I'm saying that.  In the past we've built some of these rigs but we don't quite have the same data because things were done a little differently and the equipment in many cases wasn't as advanced as what we're putting out there today.  As Clay pointed out earlier, we delivered the first big new floater, which was the Stena DrillMAX and that was delivered a little early, as a matter of fact, in December. A great looking rig, and we're going to try to use that a little bit as a proxy so we can give a little bit more detailed data on what that support is.  I will tell you this, it's going to be good...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, I might add too that, you know there were a bunch of offshore rigs that were built in the very late 1990's and in 2000 that went out into the field, and what we're seeing on some of the generations of technology introduced with those new rigs is that they're now starting to come back for refurbishment.  You know they've been out working 6, 7, 8 years and so we have some major rebuilds that we're seeing rising now for things like pipe racking systems and other components that went out with that wave, so that's another good indicator that there are good things ahead with these new rigs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are those full-blown replacement components or is it just &#x2013; is it refurbed on spare parts and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's refurbed, so there's a lot of spare parts and repair services that go into &#x2013; these are multi-million dollar refurbishment tickets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then I'm impressed, Pete, that four deepwater floaters going in, inbounds fourth quarter versus five in Q3, and orders are up.  Obviously that's the, I assume the desert rigs for the international market is a big component of that.  What's the value now of a desert rig?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, those things kind of &#x2013; they'll bounce around a little bit, Michael, but in some cases it's going to be well north of $30 million.  It just kind of depends &#x2013; each one of the desert rigs is kind of a rig on its own self, and so depending on what the customer wants, we have like a higher floor in some cases, it might be, go from a 30-foot floor to a 40-foot floor, which adds to the cost, and they do that because of the different pressure control issues and in some cases the mast is longer, it goes from 152 to 156 feet, but I would say 30, $35 million in there for a typical desert rig is a pretty good number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good number, okay, and last one from me.  Steel prices appear to be back on the rise a little bit.  Do you have any cost inflator protections in the contracts that are in backlog?  Any thoughts on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The primary, we do in some of our contracts, but the primary way we manage that, Michael, is to place orders for the steel very early after we get the customer signed up on our contract, so we sort of try to do back-to-back contracts as quickly as we can.  But yes, we are hearing talk about higher steel prices in 2008, I know there have been some flooding in Australia that impacted supplies of coking coal, there's some concerns about supplies of iron ore and cost of iron ore, you've got a weak US dollar, all those things that I'm pretty sure are going to conspire to raise steel prices in the coming year.  What we're hearing is anywhere from 5% on up to 15%, depending upon the grade.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Robin Shoemaker with Bear Stearns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Pete and Clay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Robin, how are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good.  You've been &#x2013; you've done a good job in recent times of keeping us abreast of your quoting activity.  And it's -- you've continued to say it's quite brisk and I just wondered if you could update us on the deepwater, the jack-up and the land rig arenas with regard to your quoting activity and what you're seeing in early '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's quite brisk.  Actually what we're seeing, Robin, is really still a very active quoting arena.  It's kind of been interesting because if you look at land we could have gone back a couple of years ago and there was probably much more quoting going on in North America than versus international, and today that's kind of flipped.  However, having said that, there's still quoting going on in North America.  We continue to sell more component-oriented type things in the lower 48 as an example.</p>
          <p>The deepwater business continues to be very good.  We continue to have quoting activity that probably is not dissimilar to what we've had in the last six months.  And I've continued to say that on the jack-up market, I've said all along that when the jack-ups get delivered there'll be more jack-ups ordered, almost on a one-to-one basis.  And I think if you look over the past quarter it's been like that.  We took some jack-up orders in this quarter and we continue to have very good inquiries into the jack-up arena.  So I feel very comfortable that the quoting activity is positive.</p>
          <p>The issue you always have is quoting and determining what might be a science project and what's real.  But for the most part I think we're pretty good at figuring that out.  And then the other thing on quoting is, ultimately, especially in the international arena, it takes a little longer.  And so, what quarter does some of the orders fall in might make a difference, and I think if you look in the third quarter we did 1.9, in the fourth quarter we did 2.2.  If you look in the second quarter we did less than that.  But that -- really we were quoting stuff in that second quarter that really fell into this.  So, long-winded answer to tell you we still feel very good about the quoting activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. So I assume that these quotes are for jack-ups and deepwater are for the 2011 rig delivery timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually the jack-ups would be earlier than that, Robin.  For the most part, I think the jack-ups are really in around a two-year timeframe and maybe in some cases less, depending on the shipyard.  But for the floaters for sure, you're looking out into 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay.  And just currently your back -- your composition of backlog as between international, domestic and onshore and offshore.  I think you've given us that figure previously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's 88% international, 12% domestic, Robin.  And it's 85% offshore and 15% land, unchanged from the last quarter because of the surge in international land buying that we saw in the quarter.</p>

          <p>And our next question comes from the line of Marshall Adkins with Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, guys.  Let me drill down a little bit more on the floater market.  Last quarter we had &#x2013; you discussed some of the announced new bills and kind of the ones that hadn't been booked. Can you give us an update, Pete, on what we are looking at there in terms of what's been announced relative to what's been booked?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, at this time, Marshall, I would probably assume that about -- I don't have the exact number but I would say the majority of the announced have been booked. There's still some of the announced that have not been booked yet and I think again that kind of comes down to a timing issue. You know, clearly if you heard something announced in the first quarter it wouldn't have fallen into our 2.2 billion that really was cut off on the 31st of December.  So I would say the majority have been booked but there is still a lot out there and there is also some out there that have not been announced and those are ones that we work on every day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  So of the announced ones, you know I am just kind of throwing out a ballpark, maybe four or five that have not been booked, is that just a fair ballpark number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's fair, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Clay, give me -- you talked about backlog next quarter, at least bookings being down modestly, you also talked about spare parts business really improving.  Can you give me a little more color on the spare parts business, talk about the trends there going forward? Should we expect the spare parts business to continue becoming a bigger part of the overall business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely, that's our plan and that's why we invested in this big facility in Houston and then have follow-on investments overseas as well in that. And you know we pulled in spare parts from around the Houston area from probably half a dozen locations into that facility, and that's been underway since last summer and I think what we saw in Q4 was the impact of kind of getting that squared away and then increasing our shipments out of that facility to better service our customers. We also saw a higher spare parts shipments out of our Norwegian operations, a lot of those had to do with initial stocking of some the new rigs going to work and as you are aware there is going to be more and more new rigs delivered in '08 and '09. And so we will continue to see that favorably impact our spare part shipments.</p>
          <p>But I think the longer term kind of secular trend here is that the nature of the equipment going to work on these new rigs is different, and requires a little more OEM care and feeding and participation, and that the offshore drillers and that the owners and operators of these more sophisticated bigger land rigs are more likely to come back to the OEM for help on this, and that's in contrast to many of the 25 and 30-year-old rigs across North America and elsewhere in the US where they're not necessarily going to come back to the OEM but go to machine shops somewhere.</p>
          <p>This new stuff you just can't do that.  There's embedded chips and PLC chips and networks and technology there.  It's also much more highly engineered and the nature of the new wells that these rigs are drilling are way more complex and they seem to get more complex every day and so this equipment's being pushed harder, so all of those things we think are pointing to a spare parts business that should continue to move up and to the right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess kind of along the same lines, Clay, when you were talking about these non-capital equipment sales out of the Rig Technology segment of 11% sequentially, how much of that is kind of considered secular or organic growth and how much of that do you think is &#x2013; was just due to seasonality in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it was more -- I don't think it was seasonal in as much as -- we did have some help from stocking out new rigs going to work that were coming out of a shipyards and going to work and a big offshore rig will soak up 3, $4 million of spare parts, so we had some of those coming in, and certainly the outlook for more rigs coming out of shipyards is good so we think that will continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then my last question that &#x2013; again, when you look at the order flow for 2007, over $7 billion, of that, how much of that was attributable to deepwater rigs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that I've got that number off the top of my head, Scott. We've basically -- I would say the majority of it is. You know, if you take a look, when we talk to folks about our potential, if you look at a land rig, of course, you know, depending on the type of land rig it could be as much as 30, 35 million.  If you look at the jack-ups we could put &#x2013; a 190 million jack-up, we could put about 50 million on it. And of course when you look at the deepwater rigs today, if we go all in on one it could be almost 300 million.  So, you kind of -- the majority of that number is in deepwater simply because of the size of the order that we are getting on those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what I heard you say earlier, your quote level is unchanged for deepwater and I guess what I'm kind of wondering here as we've seen each quarter, you kind of say, well, I don't expect to repeat that order size. We saw Q4 at 2.2 billion, Q1 at 1.9 billion.  What changed between Q3 and Q4 did that cause an extra 300 million of orders to flow through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, it might have just been my natural conservatism, I'm not sure.  You know again, Scott, I think what happens here, and we've tried to explain this a little bit, a lot of what you're seeing out there is just order timing and, quite frankly, I was very pleased with the fourth quarter.  I mean, I'm sure as heck ought to be, but when you think about the fourth quarter on a normalized basis, it's only about a nine or 10-week quarter because you really have a lot of time off for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and a lot of these orders, these are fairly complex deals and we won't &#x2013; we don't put them in our backlog until the contract is signed.  And so, in some cases, we don't know if it's going to be in the first quarter or the second quarter, we're looking at some things today that I would hope would come in the first quarter but I'm not sure they will.</p>
          <p>The contracts could extend out and might not get signed until the first week of April which means then that it won't fall into Q1, it'll fall into Q2, so we're reluctant to try to pin that number down simply because of the movement of that and of course, we've cut our backlog off and are very date- specific.  The last day of the quarter, if the order is not in, it doesn't come in.  That's one of the reasons that we kind of equivocate a little a bit there and say here in one hand it's this and the other hand is this.  That's why we like to just talk in context of the order, the flow of tenders and bidding is still pretty solid.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys.  The question I've got for you guys is you've been pretty consistent obviously with your comments on the jack-up market.  We've seen a big surge in orders here obviously over the last few years for offshore rigs in general.  In your estimation, do you think that we're going to see whatever it was, 180, 200 offshore rigs over the next three years?  Is that pace going to continue, is it going to trail off and do you think in that context, is the dollar value per rig going to continue to increase so even if the volumes come off a little bit, you're still going to be able to book some pretty decent backlog and order value numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Kurt, it would be very difficult to say that the next three years would equal the past three years on that number of rigs.  I think the real issue out there today is going to be what's really needed in the deepwater arena, and I think as you take a look around and you see some of these bigger discoveries like Tupi and the things that are going down in the Santos basin and then what you see off of West Africa, continued discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico, I think the real question becomes: how many deepwater rigs do you really need?  My guess is it's a lot more than we think.</p>
          <p>I think the other side of the coin is, on the jack-ups especially, is the retooling of the industry and then the repositioning of jack-ups into places like the Persian Gulf, which I think is going to need a lot more jack-ups as the drilling contractors I'm sure have probably told you.  So I would be hesitant to go on the record with an absolute number.  What I will say is we continue to expect that you will see a very, very brisk activity in the offshore arena.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Since you did reference it in terms of maybe deepwater will be more than what we think, so what are we thinking on the number of deepwater rigs that are going to be needed?  What's the number that's out there that you've seen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, there's a lot of varying numbers and I would never -- we kind of internally have our own proprietary expectations on that and I think there's been, there have been a lot of people that have been all over the map on it. But I would say if you take a look at something like Tupi, I know that the, I think that Petrobras has given out a pretty significant number on the number of rigs that they need just to develop that particular field.</p>
          <p>And the thing about a lot of these deepwater wells is that they aren't the type of wells that you're just going to knock down the way you can knock down a Barnett or a Fayetteville Shale well.  They're going to take a lot of time because it's not even the drilling as much as the flaps and the case in running and logging and everything else that take up so much of the time, landing of BOPs.  So we think it's -- we think the world's still going to need a significant number of deepwater rigs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you referenced Russia as kind of being here and now.  What kind of market size, what kind of market opportunity, either in terms of number of rigs or dollar value of rig opportunity do you see in Russia, and how does that compare to maybe what happened here in the North American land rig market between '05 and the peak in the latter part of '06?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the Russian market is going to be really positive.  You know I mentioned that the two semi-submersibles, and the fact is that the two semi-submersibles going into the Bering Seas aren't really deepwater rigs because that's not a deepwater basin as much as it's a harsh environment basis.  There really are going to be some challenging drilling up there but I think that, I think there will be a continued demand for rigs like that.  And, again, that's more into our fairway because you're talking, you could be talking 150, $250 million depending on the kit that would go on a rig like that from us.</p>
          <p>So I think the offshore side of Russia will continue to look very good and then on the land business today, you're seeing some of the western contractors move rigs in.  As those go in and some of them are new, some of them have to be heavily refurbished.  I know both Nabors and Weatherford are moving rigs in there and I think that potentially, you know, you could clearly see that equaling what we've seen in the lower 48. I mean, just look at the base numbers, the United States is four time zones wide, Russia is 11 time zones wide.  And you look at just the land that has to ultimately be explored, and I think that can potentially be an exciting market for land rigs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that dollar value per Russian land rig in a 30 to 35 million range?  More?  You know, is it more, is it less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it would be a lot less.  It's probably much more of a -- if you look at a Rocky Mountain-type rig, you know, just winterization, the actual, the actual type of rig itself, it wouldn't be dissimilar to a typical US rig with the exception being the winterization.  So, you know, that's more in the 10 to 12 to $14 million range.</p>

          <p>And our next question comes from the line of Dan Pickering with Tudor, Pickering &amp; Holt.  Please go ahead with your question, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Dan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Pete, during 2007, in the Rig Technology business, you showed a consistent, you know, ramp in terms of your ability to deliver products.  The revenues grew each quarter through the year. You're consolidating facilities, you're doing a lot of things on the manufacturing side.  Should we expect that we just continue to see a steady quarterly progression on the top-line for you guys in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I think you'll certainly see a progression, Dan, but you know it can't be, you know, you kind of get to the law of big numbers here. I mean, we've done a lot of awfully good work.  You initially you have some low-hanging fruit, and then now you just kind of, the iterations get smaller and smaller.  I think our people continue to do a fantastic job and I think you'll continue to see growth. However, I think to think that the growth would be, would be similar to what it's been in the past would be tough to do, because, you know, when you double up on something it's tough to double it up again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  And if we thought about, I tend to think about, moving already to think about '09 for you guys, you know you, you had orders in the quarter of about a -- for the year, averaging about 1.7 billion per quarter on average in '07. Do we, I mean can we manufacture and deliver at that rate by the end of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  I'm not going to commit that we'll be there by the end of this year, but that's certainly in the right, we're, we're getting pretty close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's the right ballpark generally, in terms of exit right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  And then, Clay, question for you on margins, I want to make sure I understood your comment, as it regards non-backlog revenue, which we're kind of calling aftermarket, I realize it's not all aftermarket but, I understand the trend, which is more, that was about 29% of the total segment this year.  I guess what you're saying is that's probably at least the same amount in '08 and that has a positive margin impact as we move forward.  Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the aftermarket business generally is a little bit accretive to our margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So in other words, Q4 margins weren't a fluke.  They're sustainable in Q1, I heard you say that.  But it sounds like they're sustainable as we step through '08.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but bear in mind, Dan, we have been guiding towards incremental flowthroughs in the high 20% range and given an average mix of things that we sell.  And we're not backing off that guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, guys.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>And our final question comes from the line of <mark type="inaudible" /> with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chuck.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just another question on margins, this one more on the PSS segment.  You talked a little bit about international expansion starts that's kind of holding back the margins there in the quarter.  Is that something that will continue to carry forward here?  You talked a little bit about 1Q '08, but I guess longer than that.  I mean, is that something that really makes it difficult to grow margins going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the specific projects that we talked about, yes, some of those will -- those items will drift a little bit into Q1. But remember, Chuck, we're committed to the international business and growing that business over the long haul so we expect even more initiatives to get launched as we move further into 2008.  And as is typical when you start up an operation in a foreign market, you typically experience a little headwind as you get that going. So yes, I think we'll kind of continue to have some of that out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That -- and then one -- is it something that you expect is really -- in '08 -- I mean, do you expect more expansion in '09 to better prepare yourself for the growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We hope so, because that means we've got -- we continue to be enthusiastic about the opportunities.  Obviously we're going through our '08 capital budgeting and planning exercises and so we've paid a lot of close attention to our '08 opportunities.  But if we continue to do the same in '09, that means we're &#x2013; they're working well and we're still very, very optimistic.  And frankly, where we sit here in early '08 that would be our view on '09 as well.</p>
