        <plist>
          <p>Is everyone in? Okay, thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending our Fourth Quarter Results Briefing.</p>
          <p>I'm joined today by our Group Chairman, Koh Boon Hwee; our CEO and Chairman of DBS Hong Kong, Frank Wong; Amy Yip, our CFO of Hong Kong Office and members of our key business groups. I'll start the briefing with our financial performance, and thereafter we'll open up for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter results shows a continuation of the underlying business trends seen in recent quarters. Operating profits before provisions were similar to the third quarter, except that in the fourth quarter, we increased provisions to cover our CDO investments. This resulted in a 14% decline in net income before one-time items.</p>
          <p>Before I move to our business results proper, let me just update you with what we've done with some of our CDO positions in our investments books, as well as in Rosa, our conduit. We have SGD1.21 billion of CDOs in the bank investment books at end 2007. This comprised 267 million of ABS CDOs. So these are asset-backed CDOs with some exposures to US subprime mortgages, and we also have 944 million of CDOs, which have no exposures to US subprime mortgages and most of them are all exposures to corporate bonds and loans.</p>
          <p>This amount is largely unchanged from end of September 2007, when we reported a 1.24 billion in exposures. Any change is the result of exchange rate movements.</p>
          <p>For the ABS CDOs, we took an additional provision charge of $170 million in the fourth quarter. This is in addition to the 70 million of provisions we took in the third quarter, which brings cumulative provisions for the ABS CDOs with US subprime exposures to $240 million.</p>
          <p>This translates to a 90% provision coverage of the notional amount of $267 million. We considered this to be more than adequate as this ABS CDO portfolio does not consist only of US subprime mortgages. It also has exposures to high grade mortgages as well as other forms of asset-backed securities. The value of this portfolio is unlikely to be zero even with widespread defaults, so 90% provision is more than adequate.</p>
          <p>Currently, we have no defaults and we're still receiving interest payments on all these CDOs. For the remaining 944 million of non-ABS CDOs, we have decided to take an additional 30 million in general provisions, representing 3% of this portfolio, as an additional prudential measure, given market movements in all CDOs irrespective of type.</p>
          <p>This 3% general provision is in addition to the 1% GP we already take for all debt securities. Again, there have been no defaults in this portfolio and we continue to receive interest payments on this portfolio. As in January 2008, we had a repayment of one CDO from this portfolio of US$40 million, reducing our overall exposure in this portfolio down to SGD885 million.</p>
          <p>Let me also explain what we have done with regards to Rosa, our conduit, which also has CDOs in its asset portfolio. This event is subsequent to our year-end closing. We decided to liquidate Rosa to give ourselves greater flexibility in managing the risk of the assets in Rosa. As a first step to the liquidation process, Rosa sold its assets to DBS Bank on 30th of January 2008. The transaction was carried out at fair value, realizing a loss of $232 million.</p>
          <p>Since Rosa is already consolidated, this loss is part of DBS Group. 136 million of the loss has already been reflected in our 2007 P&amp;L statement under trading income, of which 91 million was incurred in the fourth quarter. Another 10 million had been incurred prior to 2007. The remaining $86 million loss will -- was reflected in our January 2008 trading income and remember this, depending on how our trading desk managed this risk and other activities during the first quarter, total trading income may or may not result in a loss at the end of the first quarter despite this loss hitting our January's trading income.</p>
          <p>Most of the CDOs in Rosa were dismantled into their standardized credit trading components and most of these risks are hedged with standardized credit tranche indices. From the $1.12 billion of Rosa's CDOs, which we reported at end September 2007, 347 million of the CDOs remain, although these are also transferred to DBS Bank for ongoing risk management. These CDOs were bought from external parties. We can sell them back to third parties, but we decided to hold them given the short tenure of the CDOs expiring in 2009 and 2010. The net impact is that Rosa, as a conduit, will no longer exist. Although, we will still hold the 347 million of CDOs transferred from Rosa in the bank.</p>
          <p>This chart now summarizes our current CDO exposures. Our CDO exposure will now fall from $2.36 billion in September 2007, to the current level of $1.5 billion. This includes the 267 million of ABS CDOs with 90% provision coverage. The remaining $1.23 billion of CDOs are non-ABS, so non-asset backed and have no US subprime exposures. The collaterals for this portfolio are loans and bonds across many markets including Asian loans.</p>
          <p>Of this amount, 907 million are held at amortized cost in our investment book, so changes to mark-to-market valuation will not impact P&amp;L. The remaining 325 million which were from Rosa sale are in our trading portfolio. Changes to mark-to-market valuation of these remaining CDOs will be taken to the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Now, let me highlight something else in our fourth quarter results before moving to our business performance. A further impairment charge of $67 million was made for our investment in TMB Bank. This charge largely reflects the decline in the market value of TMB shares during the quarter. You may be aware that we did not subscribe to TMB's rights issue in December. Our stake has therefore been reduced from 16.1% to 6.8%. With this impairment charge, the cost of our investment has been marked down to $209 million. We will continue to hold TMB Bank shares as an investment. We do not have any lock-up period for our holdings.</p>
          <p>The following presentation will now focus on the underlying operating performance. Business trends continues to be strong. Strong loan growth continues to contribute to net interest income improvement. Compared to a year ago, fourth quarter net interest income grew 14% to $1.06 billion. Fees also rose 25% to 379 million with capital markets related activities such as stockbroking leading the way.</p>
          <p>Trading activities recorded a loss of 25 million, largely the result of Rosa's 91 million mark-to-market losses and also losses from our structured credit trading activities. But this is more than offset by strong credit gain -- strong trading gains in our FX, interest rates and equity trading.</p>
          <p>Total income was 10% higher than a year ago. Total expenses grew 3% from a year ago. We managed to keep our expense growth below income growth. Profit before provisions was therefore 14% higher than a year ago. Excluding charges for the CDOs, loan provisions remained healthy as our loan books -- the quality of our loan books continued to remain good.</p>
          <p>Compared to the third quarter, this quarter's total income and profit before provisions were largely unchanged. The CDO provisions pulled our fourth quarter's net profit down to end 14% lower than the third quarter's net profit.</p>
          <p>Compared to a year ago, most of our key operating ratios improved except for net interest margin, which I'll cover later and our ROE, which fell from 12.2% to 10.9% due to provisions for CDOs. Otherwise fee income contribution, cost income ratio and NPL ratio all improved.</p>
          <p>Compared to the previous quarter, our operating ratios are little mixed. Net interest margins and fee income contribution declined, and together with higher provisions for CDOs, ROE fell to 10.9% from 13% in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Net interest income rose 1% from the previous quarter to $1.06 billion. Increased asset and deposit volumes more than offset a three basis point decline in interest margins to 2.11%.</p>
          <p>The margin decline was largely due to Hong Kong's margins, where prime lending rates fell faster than HIBOR. In Singapore, Interbank rates also declined, although yields on Sing dollar Interbank assets were lower, they were offset by an overall decline in deposit cost. Therefore, this had minimal impact on group NIM in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Compare to a year ago, net interest income grew 14%, because of higher loan and deposit volumes, despite a 7 basis point decline in interest margins. We've recognized that lower interest rates will impact our overall margins, but we are confident that we can counter some of this with discipline loan and deposit yields, as we grow our customer franchise.</p>
          <p>Loans rose 4% for the quarter and 25% for the year. This compares with industry growth were Singapore was up 7% for the quarter, and up 20% for the year, while Hong Kong was down 3% for the quarter and up 20% for the year.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, loan growth was led by corporate borrowings in Singapore and China. This quarter's loan growth -- loan figure for Hong Kong is lower because in the third quarter its loan included 1 to 2 billion of IPO loans, which have since been repaid.</p>
          <p>Growth rates for the various segments are as follows. Singapore housing loans, it's up 1% for the quarter and up 10% for the year. Singapore SME loans flat for the quarter and up 8% for the year. Hong Kong housing loans in local currency terms down 2% for the quarter and up 2% for the year. Hong Kong SME loans in local currency terms flat for the quarter and up 3% for the year. Corporate loans as a whole, up 7% for the quarter and up 45% for the year.</p>
          <p>Fee income in the fourth quarter was at $379 million, this is up 25% from a year ago. The growth was broad-based led by wealth management, stock-broking and loans indications activities. Compared to the third quarter, which was a record, fees fell 6%. Stock broking, investment banking, and loan syndication activities slowed due to uncertainty in the financial markets in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Other non-interest income was similar to the previous quarter. Trading losses from credit trading and mark-to-market losses in Rosa were offset by better trading gains in foreign exchange, interest rates and equities.</p>
          <p>Wealth management fees rose to $70 million, the highest in several quarters, as demand for unit trust remains strong in both Singapore and Hong Kong. Unit trust sales totaled $1.35 billion during the quarter, which is up 45% from a year ago. For the full year, unit trust sales rose 51% from 2006 to $5.74 billion, a reflection of our growing wealth management franchise.</p>
          <p>Total sales of wealth management products for 2007 rose 12% from 2006 to $7.77 billion. We continue to keep cost under control. Expenses fell 1% from the previous quarter. We had lower staff and computerization cost and these were partially offset by higher year-end marketing cost.</p>
          <p>These quarters, cost income ratio of 42% was unchanged from the previous quarter and it was an improvement from the 45% level a year ago. Wealth staff cost and other operating costs were higher. The increase was partially offset by decline in computerization cost, if you compare it to a year ago.</p>
          <p>We continue to remain discipline and expect to retained our 45% cost income ratio target in 2008. We recognize that we need to grow our regional platform, which will increase investments in people and infrastructure, but we will remain focus on growing our revenues in our core markets and our key emerging markets to fund this investment.</p>
          <p>For the full year net profit improved by 14% to $2.49 billion. There was board based growth across businesses, geography and products, resulting in net interest and fee incomes reaching new highs. Net interest income rose 14% to $4.11 billion. Fee income rose 27% to $1.46 billion, as our customer franchise contributed to capital markets, corporate and consumer fee activities.</p>
          <p>Our trading income fell 66%, a result of the decline in credit markets, but overall it still recorded a profit, despite taking mark-to-market valuation losses on Rosa CDOs and credit losses in our trading book. So, total income rose 15%, faster than the 11% increased in expenses. The positive draw between income and expenses resulted in a 19% increase in profit before allowances.</p>
          <p>Total provisions rose to 431 million, compared to our 135 million in 2006. The increase was due to provisions taken to cover our ABS, CDO exposures. Specific provisions for loans fell 42% to $92 million. Considering the dislocations in the financial markets for 2007, retuned in the 14% improvement in net earnings. I would say it's not too better performance.</p>
          <p>Most operating ratios for the full year were better than 2006. We improved in fee contribution, cost/income ratio, and loan/deposit ratio, which combined raised ROE from 12.3% to 12.7%. Our ratio -- one ratio that did not improve was our net interest margins, which fell from 2.20% to 2.17%.</p>
          <p>Interest rate trends in Singapore and Hong Kong were unfavorable for us. SIBOR picked in the first quarter of 2007 and Prime-HIBOR spreads narrowed for most of 2007. Despite this, we managed to keep the decline in margins to three basis points by carefully managing our asset and liability mix and remaining disciplined in our pricing.</p>
          <p>Let me just move on to Hong Kong. The figures on this slide, incorporates a 4% appreciation of the Singapore dollars against Hong Kong dollars over the previous quarter and a 7% appreciation from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Net interest income declined 5% from the previous quarter, as exchange rate effects and lower Prime-HIBOR spreads were partially offset by higher deposit volumes. Compared to a year ago, net interest income fell 13%, as there was a larger full year impact from unfavorable currency movements and interest rate margins, which more than offset the benefit of loan growth.</p>
          <p>As these recent quarters non-interest income, contributed to drive Hong Kong's performance, rising 15% from the previous quarter and 49% from a year ago in Sing dollar terms. Fourth quarters improvement was led by stockbroking commission, sale of wealth management products reflecting our growing wealth management franchise in Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>Expense growth was higher due to higher staff and operating cost, such as computerization and occupancy expenses. Net profit fell 3% from the previous quarter and 2% from a year ago. But in local currency terms, net profit was up 2% from the previous quarter and 6% from a year ago.</p>
          <p>This slide incorporates a 5% full year appreciations of the Singapore dollars against the Hong Kong currency. For 2007, net interest income was almost flat in local currency terms, as the impact of higher loan and deposit volumes was offset by a narrowing of Prime-HIBOR spreads. Loan growth for the year continued to be led by the SME and corporate borrowings.</p>
          <p>We saw strong non-interest income growth led by stockbroking commissions and wealth management sales. In Singapore currency terms, non-interest income grew 47%. Total income rose 6%, this was faster than the 4% rise in expenses as staff and other operating expenses continue to be managed. Profit before provision increased 8% with total provisions falling 4%. Net profit for the full year was up 10% in Singapore dollar terms. In local currency terms net profit rose 16%.</p>
          <p>A brief review of our asset quality, which remained strong. Credit quality continues to remain strong. Non-performing loans fell to $1.17 billion with NPL rate falling to 1.1%, but if you look at our total non-performing assets that rose 1% from the pervious quarter to $1.44 billion because of the ABS CDOs, which we provided specific provisions for. Provision coverage continues to rise, reaching 135% of non-performing assets from 130% in the previous quarter and 115% a year ago.</p>
          <p>You can see from the next chart that new non-performing assets rose this quarter due to the addition of the ABS CDOs.</p>
          <p>On the next chart the fourth quarter specific charges for loans was $16 million. This was lower than the previous quarter, as well as lower than a year ago. This reflects the still favorable credit environment. The 16 million SP charge amounted to 6 basis points of total loans outstanding, which is much lower than recent quarters.</p>
          <p>The specific provision charge for loans for the full year was 9 basis points, compared to 19 basis points in 2006. We remain vigilant to the current credit environment and do not expect the current benign environment to continue indefinitely. With our risk weighted assets continuing to grow from increased credit and market risk, our CAR fell to 13.4% from 14% in the previous quarter, and our Tier-1 ratio at 8.9%.</p>
          <p>Both ratios are still above regulatory requirements, while the Tier-1 ratio is within the range of 8 to 9% that we're comfortable with. Beginning 2008, Basel II will be coming on stream. Approval has been obtained from the MAS for DBS bank to adopt the foundation internal ratings based approach for most of our corporate credit portfolios and the advanced internal ratings based approach for our retail credit portfolios.</p>
          <p>Subject to regulatory approval, we will be extending the adoption of our IRBA to our subsidiaries including DBS Hong Kong Limited after this year. We are recommending dividends of $0.20 per share this quarter, and like previous quarters, this amount will be paid on a one-tier tax-exempt basis. This means the investors will receive from DBS full cash dividend of $0.20 per share, as suppose to $16.4 per share under the previous tax regime. This effectively translates to a 22% increase in cash dividends, based on yesterday's closing share points DBS shares gave investors a dividend yield of 4.6%, which is must better than our fixed deposit rates.</p>
          <p>Let me finish with the brief explanation of our acquisition of Bowa Commercial Bank in Taiwan, which we announced earlier this month. Under the terms of the transaction, we are acquiring good loans of around $2.9 billion; this is Singapore dollars, deposits of $4.1 billion and up to 42 branches with the payment from the Taiwan Government Central Deposit Insurance Corporation of around $2 billion to DBS. The acquisition fits well into our Greater China strategy as Bowa gives us a suitable platform to expand in to Taiwan. The fourth largest economy and banking sector in Asia, x-Japan and this completes our presence in greater China.</p>
          <p>We are now in the stronger position to develop a greater China franchise and capture the growing trade and investment flows between Mainland, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We have full control of all our operating entities in these countries. Similar to what we are doing in Hong Kong and China, we will be focusing on the SME and wealth management segments in Taiwan.</p>
          <p>We already count Taiwanese SMEs among our customers, with our expended local presence in Taiwan. This will enable us to serve them better and penetrate the segment more effectively. The deal is expected to close end of May, but the transition committee has already been put in place to look at all aspects of integration. We will need to put in the right resources and infrastructure to grow this franchise. We expect to take a couple of years to gain adequate scale for us to REIT the full benefits of this investment.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Let me now open the floor to Q&amp;A, which will be taken by our Chairman.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> liquidity of Rosa portfolio. Now if I recall the Rosa portfolio was around 1.1 billion, after liquidation around 300 odd million of external CDOs still sit with DBS. My question is were the remaining part of the portfolio purely internal CDOs? And they have been dismantled since then I take it? And the question is after the dismantling, is there any risk -- is there still any risk associated with the CDO world? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try to explain slowly and perhaps, as much as I can. And for those people really have questions in their mind, please do raise questions because CDO and that's how we say is a name that complicates matters. People do not understand the makeup of it.</p>
          <p>Well, let's go back to your question. The amount that we have, 325 million left on the book. These are CDOs; these are loans, collateralized loans applications, mostly loans and bonds that we bought from other banks, global banks. The rated, the funds are rated AA and AAA and they are of short maturity. And they are -- they will mature in a year or two. And we look at it in fact, we do have a price all the time provided by the seller. So, we don't like that tranche, we can just sell it. Because it's short maturity and we feel pretty safe in terms of the credit quality within that.</p>
          <p>Now the -- in terms of Rosa, your question, what is the CDO risk left on the bank? That we were like you, we have always managed that credit derivatives risks associated with CDOs i.e. CDO square. These are credit derivatives. CDOs squares, some of these -- that complicates matters that leverage. What we did was, we actually -- we reduced the risks in January, by selling it through the market players and we reduced the risk by 50%. Second, what is left, we have converted that derivative risk taking out the complex component and reduce it to index risk.</p>
          <p>Index risk, these are indexed against 125 investment-grade names in the US that is traded in the US. The credit spread of 125 names, investment-grade, they are traded. The notion among trader on the index is above US$22 billion a day, average volume. So, we can literally can get rid of the risk if we like. Now we believe that the market has -- is a fair value and debt exposure is captured into the bank's earnings and risk, which we are being managed by our global financial markets. That is the reason I slapped on our booked internal CDOs. And the other short maturity I mentioned two types.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just -- can I just add -- I mean Frank, you've mentioned that is that most of the risk has already been hedged out and a very little risk left. And most of that risk is actually indices and that can be easily traded and hedged out, as well.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> from Reuters. I just want to know what's the risk of low write-downs on the existing CDO exposure that you have mostly corporate CDOs and the CLOs, what -- which is like roughly $1.2 billion? And my second question is on TMB, you've said that you plan to hold the shares as an investment. What was your original value of that investment and how much has it come down since you took a stake in TMB? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let answer that. On the balance of the corporate CDOs a large part of it are basically consist of corporate bond, corporate loans, so -- and some of these corporate loans and bonds are basically exposures in Asia. I'll give you an example of what some of them could be. They could be portfolios of loans of Asian banks and they have been taken out and securitized. We have bought portions of these.</p>
          <p>Some of these are also mortgages, that means they are not mortgaged-backed, but they are just mortgages and we have exposures on them too. I would say that generally we don't expect these portfolios to actually lose their value. They have been impacted by mark-to-market valuations, but on a whole these are not as toxic as what you would see in the US sub-prime markets. So they are actually good quality collateral and we expect to hold them as investments until maturity. And on TMB...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe Jeanette, I just want to give more color. We just want to really close this chapter, because we do believe we have done the best we can and progressed -- open as we can. Let me explain to you the risk that Jeanette just clearly just articulated is quite clear.</p>
          <p>Now, the mortgage-backs are commercial buildings. These are the <mark type="inaudible" /> square. These are the major buildings, commercial buildings in Honk Kong, these are not residential. The second, the makeup of the basket, these are all loans, equivalents and the way the Collateralized Loan Obligation was structured. These are about 100 names in each portfolio, 100 names. The maximum exposure per name is only 1%, that's halting business. So base of this -- the risk is spread out over 100 names, each the maximum loss is blocking about SGD10 million, even it deteriorates. But the credit rating is AA, AAA and A, so our credit group reduced that on a daily basis and provides for SP should they deteriorate. But, we feel very comfortable with the risk on the book. Sorry, Jeanette, TMB...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the TMB portfolio, I mean you've seen us mark down this year by about $200 million -- $209 million, so if you would add that to when we first started in the beginning of the year that would be above $418 million. That was the book value of TMB. It's difficult to go back many, many years, because of all the deconsolidation of our positions. So when we first deconsolidated at that point in time, it was about -- no, when we first deconsolidated and the book value at that point was about $400 and -- I will get you the number, but I think its about $460 million or so at that point in the year 2004 -- book value...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good day. Matthew Wilson, Morgan Stanley. Three questions if I may. The first one, can you talk about any exposure that you may have to bond insurers, maybe directly in the bank over some of your asset management vehicles. The second question is, just for completeness, you've detailed the CDO exposure of the bank. Can you just update us what the CDO exposure is in the asset management companies that you manage?</p>
          <p>And then the final question is, obviously you got a new CEO coming on Board in May. Typically, new CEOs have a habit of finding new provisions and areas to sort of buttress the earnings in the first year that they come on board. Where do you see the opportunities are for Richard there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer the third question first. I think having a new CEO on Board does not mean that we'll jettison long held policies of how we recognized the value of our assets held in the bank. We believe that we have -- as Frank has explained and as Jeanette has explained, we believe that we have been extremely conservative already and therefore, there will not be a change in this. Monolines...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have some exposures to monolines, but a lot of the monoline exposures we have are basically wrapped around underlying bonds where we have a view that these underlying bonds are actually strong enough. So, I'll give you an example of a monoline wrapped around a underlying bond. Matthew, you could identify with this.</p>
          <p>We have a monoline exposure of an insurer wrapped around the Sydney Airport bond. We believe Sydney Airport is doing very well. We believe that the bond itself is not going to default. So we are not exceptionally concerned about potential exposures to these monolines. So that's most of our exposure is, it's really not a lot and we are quite happy, because we look at the underlying bond exposure more than anything. On asset management and the CDOs, we manage, Amy, do you have that information?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is <mark type="inaudible" />. So, I have got some questions about the sub-prime problem to ask. First of all, I would like to ask if -- because many US and also Hong Kong officers said that the sub-prime problem is very severe in the situation and suggest that banks to make more provision to prevent the problem to grow. And so would DBS take more provision into the near future for your CDOs?</p>
          <p>And also for a second question, because many forecasted the global economy would be slowed down for 2008. So what is the impact for the DBS's financial situation? Could you do some forecast for the actual '08? And also another question is for DBS Hong Kong. Because we're a Chinese channel, so may I ask in Cantonese for Ms. Yip? [Foreign Language]</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Should I take the third in Cantonese on Prime-HIBOR spread and I'll pass the ones on further provisions and outlook for 2008 back to Singapore? Okay.  [Foreign Language]</p>

          <p>For the benefit of the audience, Amy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the question pertained to Prime-HIBOR spread in Hong Kong and the outlook for Prime-HIBOR spread and the impact on the mortgages -- the NIM on mortgages in Hong Kong. I think the Prime-HIBOR spread is very volatile. As you can tell in 19 -- in 2007, it actually went down by 37 basis points year-on-year. In between January and end of -- between -- end of January and end of December Prime-HIBOR spread actually rose by 45 basis points. So this the extent of the volatility. So while interest rates are projected to continue to be -- to go lower, there is a lag effect between the lowering of the prime with, against interbank market. So, while we think that the outlook for the Prime-HIBOR spread remains challenging for the bank, it will also be volatile. And we will manage our cost of funds as much as we can to preserve the NIM.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's come back to Singapore, and before, I get Jeanette to answer the question on additional exposure. I mean there is no question in our mind that we have been in a very benign credit cycle for the last five years. It is our impression that this is not going to be sustainable going forward. So for 2008, our stance, is to be cautiously optimistic. We believe that there is still room for growth in Asia, but we do not believe that we will be completely immune to what is happening in the United States, so our stances one-off cautious optimism.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the first question was whether  we are going to take more write-downs in the sub-prime markets and whether we have any other exposures to sub-prime market, especially, if we cast to US mortgages. I would say we have no further exposures to the US sub-prime market other than those that has already been disclosed to you. And 90% provision in our mind is more than adequate because it basically covers all the CDOs that's in that portfolio that has exposures to the US sub-prime market. In fact, in that portfolio, it is not just US sub-prime markets that are securitized. There are other forms of securitization including student loans, credit cards, auto loans and even high grade mortgages.</p>

          <p>Hi, Harsh Modi from JPMorgan. I have couple of questions. First, on securities portfolio coming back to monoline, is -- do we have a number of or the total amount of bonds, which are at a risk of downgrade due to monolines coming under trouble, that's one. And second on Hong Kong loan growth. I understand industry loan growth in HK was about 20%, whereas DBS clouding about 4.3% year-on-year, any particular reason for that? And second outlook going forward for both Hong Kong and Singapore for loan growth, where do you see that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question, which is how many of our bonds will be impacted if there is a downgrade in monolines. I don't have the exact number with me, but I would say it is really less than 200 to 300 million US. I mean, when we looked at it, which was about week ago or so, I mean, we had some and we were reducing some of our positions. So, I would say that -- that's basically what it is. It's not a lot, we are comfortable with that risk and we really don't think that we'll basically phased our potential write-downs in any of those bonds. The other thing you have to bear in mind is as an institution, we are now limited to just holding AAA bonds. So, any downgrade in these bonds will not force us to sell off our bond portfolio. So, you have to remember that.</p>

          <p>Can you -- yeah. Let me give a little bit more color the monoline, these are not monoline that's been used to credit wrap the bonds that we purchase. These are the topline for monoline that is ready to exposure to the sub-prime. Not the tool we see trouble. I don't know which you don't -- not the tool that is in trouble, we cut it all out in the last three to four weeks is the top, top one. The one I'm mentioning -- that's the one we have.</p>

          <p>The loan growth of Hong Kong, in Hong Kong dollar terms was actually 13% year-on-year. But that is below the industry loan growth of 20% that you had mentioned earlier. We did register very strong growth in our loans to property development and investments, manufacturing to our SME customers and also trade finance to our SME customers.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I'm <mark type="inaudible" />, Hong Kong. Actually, I have two questions, but Hwee, Mr. Chairman can give us answer in English and Frank, give us an answer in Cantonese. My questions are as follows. Firstly, the CDOs, the companies that DBS have already due enough allowance to the sub-prime related CDO. But the problem is the market, I was wondering whether the credit crunch will go to the -- your market. So, I'd like to know whether the DBS have some CDO export in Europe and was the portion of the CDO export in Asian. That's my first question. And I would like to have Frank give us some comment on how the economic growth down &#x2013; goes down to the global economic goes down, if as today Asian banking sector and the DBS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Frank, the question that was -- Frank, I think the question has been directed to you pretends to your view on the slowdown in the global economy and the impact on Asian bank -- Asian economies and on Asian bank and particularly for DBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have done a lot of analysis in the last -- since actually October last year. And we've been expecting the worst to happen. Touchwood, it hasn't really happened although our loan growth is healthy. Credit standings are good. We are more aware of the sector i.e. the manufacture -- manufacturing sector, the property sector that is highly leveraged only that is if there &#x2013; if that is highly leveraged. Most also some of those exposure they are linked to Mainland China because of the austerity program that is being put in place by the Mainland Chinese authorities.</p>
          <p>We, despite all of that we're assuming -- seeing good growth in the business. But we are cautiously optimistic because the US, we believe will slowdown quite a bit, so with Europe and that would affect mostly the exporters to these places. As we affected perhaps in the equity indices in both Hong Kong and Singapore that shows up some of the concern that people expressed. So, to the banking sector, I think that the banking sector has been pretty healthy. I can only comment about DBS, we see the numbers our capital ratio is high. We've gotten rid of all bodes of exposure 90, 95% of the exposure to the sub-prime market is behind us. So, we are on top of the credit conditions. We are reviewing our book. We've been done so since three-four months ago. So, I think we are just as good as the economy wish of, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the question about whether the sub-prime would affect Europe and Asia. I think the sub-prime phenomenon originated primarily from the United States and the impact in Europe and Asia will be on investors who actually hold those instruments and securities. To the extent that, I think, our view is that the Asian banks are probably less affected by their holdings in this. And as far as we are concerned and as far as DBS is concerned, we believe that we've already met most of the provisions that are affected by the sub-prime issues and that there we would have no further problems going forward. It's already 90% provided for.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sanjay Jain from Credit Suisse. Let me find the questions. Okay, first question is for Jeanette. Is -- I mean I understand that the balance sheet structure is dynamic, assets liabilities both sides, but based on the 2007 numbers, what is your estimate for impact on margins from a 100 basis point fall in SIBOR?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that a question, Sanjay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Or you're just asking me for any impact on -- what happens if SIBOR moves down 100 basis points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, I mean it is already moved down almost 100.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually what you could really do, I mean, I think the equity analyst can do, is if you go map where SIBOR has been trading on a last few -- for the last few years and where our net interest margins are, giving that same period you have more or less have a good sense of that impact. But, I would say, that we are actively managing our asset and liability mix. We are also actively looking at how we can improve the yields on our loans, including the yields on our deposits. So it's really very hard to project that, because -- yes, the balance sheet is dynamic and that's our job basically as management has to manage our asset and liability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact in -- I mean in that context in the fourth quarter you've raised a lot of fixed deposits in Singapore. I am not sure why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's really part of, some of our year end activities unfortunately. I mean there are some deposits from very, very good customers and we need to retain and we need to keep if -- especially if they would come to us. We do not want to throw away all our customer franchise. So that's part of the process of year end liquidity and things like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question is on CDS. Last year's annual repots said your gross exposure adding both sides was 60 billion. What is the exposure now, and how much is net? And are you taking any charges on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not at all. I mean how we look at our CDS exposure, is really based on net exposures, gross exposures alone does not tell you what kind of risk we carry. At a same time, we also monitor things like counterparty risk of our CDS. And as far as possible, what we also try to do is make sure we net off, so that counterparty risk do not buildup on both sides, positive and negative. So we do a lot of there is in managing our overall exposures to the CDS. But how we look at CDS exposure is really its net exposure to credit risk, so credit spreads.</p>
          <p>And that's how we monitor it. I don't have the year end CDS exposure unless finance has it. But actually, from a gross perspective it is actually irrelevant. What is more important is the net exposure and again it also depends on what underlying bonds the CDS has been used to hedge. So the overall VaR position is much more important from a trading perspective or from the total credit book perspective, then the CDS is an instrument.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you be able to give us the net number?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will try. And after this I'll get finance to basically look at it and see whether we could give that to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Fine. The 1.5 billion, 1.2 billion are corporate CDOs, 907 are in your investment books, 385 for the group -- CDOs from Rosa.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then there is 267 as ABS CDOs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Most of -- okay. The breakdown into lower parts so as, for example, CLOs that we have -- for the all corporates -- right, all loans actually, right. And these loans are going to be largely the US and European loans. Okay. And these are senior secured loans in SS collaterals so, in terms of geography, there about 50-50 Europe and US. For the corporate bonds -- corporate CDOs that we have well, then those are -- we've two main ones, both are between 55 to 75% of the exposures are actually high grade agent names. So, agent names will include agent corporates and -- some in agent financial names as well.</p>
          <p>But 50 -- 152% that are 74%, that are actually agent centric. All right? The rest of the other Rosa type of bond of CDOs, your questions are again they are the corporates in the -- global corporates, meaning they are -- largely about 40% US and then above 40% Europe and there are 20% Asia. So, that's some different make-up -- breakdown for a different sets of CDOs that we've left. Does it make sense here?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks. And lastly goes back to Harsh's questions on your outlook for loan growth in Singapore and overall. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe I'll take that. I mean our loan pipeline continues to remain healthy. We are very aware of what kind of credit environment we are operating in. So, basically as we grow our loans, we are also looking to make sure that we adequately compensated for this. The loan pipeline for the consumer books are also healthy. In fact, from a mortgage perspective, our consumer guys are basically bullish on a fact that some of these deferred payment transactions; will be coming out for mortgage financing. But overall it's within our control to how much we want to grow our loan books taking into consideration the risks that we see in the overall market. But I would say the pipeline continues to remain healthy.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Let me find and do this so that we have some clarity. I think when Wong was trying to do that, he was breaking down into specific positions for you, meaning he thinks of CLOs as well as CDOs. CLOs are collateralized by loans. CDOs are collateralized by bonds. What we have done basically is compressed the two and we just call them CDOs. So, when you say talking about the loan portfolio he is referring to the CLOs. We did not break those things down in the public information. So, when you look at it overall, we do have Asian exposure, we have European exposure as well as we have US exposures. Those they are backed by loans, he is basically saying that they have primarily US and European driven. But there are also CDOs which are backed by bonds as well and those also have Asian exposures. We just use the two words generically to mean the same thing but they are basically backed by either loans or bonds.</p>

          <p>I don't have the exact numbers with you -- for you at this point, but basically what we are trying to say is they have global exposures US, European and Asia, on -- and we are very comfortable because none of them are actually backed by securitized assets, rated BBB. They are all backed by loan exposures as well as corporate bond exposures. That's why they do this. If we believe that corporate bonds and corporate loan exposures are basically going down then you got a look at every commercial bank's loan books at the same time.</p>
