          <p>Hi, it's not Phuthuma its Ms. Debbie Miller, Head of Investor Relations for MTN Group. Thank you for joining us here today, to discuss MTN's results for the year ended 31 December, 2008. With me here are Phuthuma Nhleko, our Group President and CEO; Rob Nisbet, Group CFO; Sifiso Dabengwa, Group COO, and Tim Lowry, VP for the SEA region; Christian de Faria, VP for the WECA region; and Jamal Ramadan, VP for the MENA region are also dialed in via teleconference onto this call.</p>
          <p>In terms of the process, Tim and Rob will give a brief overview of the Group results highlighting the key operational and financial information and a bit of an outlook, and thereafter we'll move onto a Q&amp;A session, which I understand the conference call operator will facilitate.</p>
          <p>I will hand over now to you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Debbie, and afternoon everybody. I believe our presentation obviously is out there now, and I know some of the people on the call attended this presentation this morning. So I will really tend to run through some of the key highlights, and then we can take some highlights on the financial section as well from Rob, and then we can take some questions.</p>
          <p>And I think it's actually, as I indicated this morning, we do have a set of results that were achieved under some fairly difficult conditions. By and large, the global backdrop in the recession, which obviously kicked-in in earnest last year, followed by the banking crisis or the other way around actually, and of course I think, the knock-on effect on that is access to funding in some areas could be challenged and people are more risk adverse than what they may have been 12 months ago.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I think MTN does have a very strong balance sheet, relatively speaking, and we have also undertaken a very big infrastructure rollout in 2008, which has enabled us to report some of the numbers we're going to report now. And subs were up of course 48% to just over 90 million subscribers, and revenue up 40% to 102 billion rand, and EBITDA up 36% to 43.2 billion rand. And notwithstanding the high effective tax rates as a result of the Nigerian &#x2013; at the end of the Nigerian pioneer tax holiday, we still achieved a PAT of 17 billion rand, which is 44% up from the previous year.</p>
          <p>The adjusted headline earnings per share is 904 cents, which is 33% up on last year, and I think Rob in the financial section will take you through what the adjustments are to arrive at that adjusted headline earnings per share. And of course, I think the big number on CapEx is the 28 billion rand, which is 84 up &#x2013; 84% up on 2007.</p>
          <p>It is important to point out that we did have a tailwind in 2008 through the currency; the rand has weakened against quite a number of currencies, including the dollar of course, but the currencies of the countries in which we operate have by and large strengthened against the rand.</p>
          <p>The gearing is low, we have achieved the guidance that we gave you all I think. When we did the investment deal, we said that by December '08, we'd hope to be at 0.4 as net debt to EBITDA and I think we're at 0.3 &#x2013; and in fact we got there much earlier. And that has allowed us to maintain the dividend policy of a cover of five, and therefore we declared a dividend of 181 cents per share.</p>
          <p>Key developments, I don't want to go into a lot of detail again, suffice to say that on the economic front, we've had quite a varied picture or a mixed picture in the sense that Nigeria, Ghana as an example have held up very, very well in terms of consumer spend.</p>
          <p>As you shall see later on, we will be giving you the subs tick-up, up until the end of February 2009. Roll out very big, we got very close to the number that we said we'd put into the ground. And of course we've done a number of other things operationally that have enabled us to continue to evolve the business and position it competitively very well. Examples of that are, of course, the internet service providers that we have purchased; Verizon in South Africa, Afrinet in Cameroon VGC which, of course, we did much earlier which is almost a PTO as well, in Nigeria.</p>
          <p>And we've also invested heavily in 3G. I must say sooner than we may have wished in certain countries but I think the climate we have with 3G speed and remain competitive was fairly important. And we've also invested considerably in the submarine network cables, the key one being the easy cable which is on the East Coast of Africa and then, of course, the West African Cable as well. And that does enable us to obviously service our own traffic and become more competitive.</p>
          <p>And BEE and just to say that, of course, the Newshelf structure got unwound in December and a large number of staff participated in that, and the company now wants to put a new scheme, of course, Newshelf had nothing to do with the company. It was a completely independent Angeline scheme put in by management. So, the sharholders did not subsidize that in any form but the second BEE scheme will, of course, be by the company and when the market conditions are far more conducive and there's less volatility, we believe that'll be the right time to actually put that scheme in place and move on.</p>
          <p>Subscriber growth again, hopefully, everybody's got a presentation, it's very strong at 90 million subs. Suffice to say that we have now got a much widest spread. Initially, it was all South Africa and then Nigeria and but if you look at the three regions now, we're having significant growth in the Middle East which is driven primarily by Iran. The earnings are not as diversified unfortunately but definitely we're hoping that in the medium term we will be able to achieve that as well.</p>
          <p>The ARPU is very resilient in most of the countries with the exception of Sudan which, as I mentioned this morning, does have its own set of challenges but we have seen fairly strong ARPU. Nigeria, as an example, is still at $16, and I think what that indicates is that the spending power is there. But it also indicates that there was quite a lot of pent-up demand that we were able to address once we had significantly increased capacity and spent &#x2013; and spent more money on infrastructure.</p>
          <p>And the other countries are also fairly strong. And in local currency, I mean some of them maybe a bit weaker, because of their own currencies work &#x2013; movement against the dollar, but by and large, I &#x2013; I believe that we've had a very pleasing and sustainable ARPU in &#x2013; in most countries. And I think that does talk to the potential depth of some of &#x2013; of these countries.</p>
          <p>On the EBITDA basis, I think I spoke about contribution, where the WECA region is obviously the largest contributor now, followed by the Southern African region and then Middle East has picked up to 11% of EBITDA now. And we'd like to see more, I mean, we'd like to see it being in the 20's and so on, but of course notwithstanding the high increase in subs in Iran, the tariffs are relatively low.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA margin of the Group by and large had held out but it has come down, 1 point, 1.5 points, and that &#x2013; the key reason for that is quite varied and multifold. And, clearly you do have high revenue share in Syria, and Iran, and that does have an impact on the EBITDA margin. We've also seen some expenses in fuel, site maintenance leases in some of these countries. We've seen some escalation in that and that has made it &#x2013; added to that pressure on margin. And then of course in South Africa, we also took quite a number of initiatives on distribution, buying our own distribution network, that have had somewhat of s depleting impact on margins.</p>
          <p>But nevertheless, Iran margin is pleasing at 30%. I think we have given you guidance of late 20's, but at 30% at this stage is quite good and &#x2013; and given the new entrance, we still think the margin of 42.1 overall as a Group is still acceptable given all the things that we had to deal with last year. And I won't go into the detail of the SEA countries, suffice to say that most probably, Uganda faces the largest competition with five operators in there.</p>
          <p>It has managed to increase its market share back to 52%, and I think the MTN Zone has not got enough. And South Africa again on the prepaid side has done exceptionally well. MTN Zone and the low denomination vouchers have helped a lot. Postpaid has been acceptable, and we want to see an even bigger performance on postpaid, but we did launch a new tariff and plan, MTN Anytime, which will &#x2013; conceptual it gives people far more flexibility, and we've seen almost 250,000 subscribers on that.</p>
          <p>The regulatory issues in South Africa have by and large been sorted out. The biggest one has been obviously the new licenses, which were issued on 15th January. There are still some issues to be resolved there that we are engaged with, but we have moved on in terms of the licenses we issued and so on. Things like WECA are still outstanding, and we think that the amendment to that &#x2013; the amendment to WECA ought to be published very soon. So sorry it was published sorry on the 9th of January.</p>
          <p>So, I think that South Africa, MTN Zone the big issue there, the minutes of usage have gone up. We've also acquired the Verizon Business in South Africa, what that does is of course give us a much larger market share in the data space in South Africa, somewhere in the order of 23%, if you combine that with the other smaller operation, which we had, which was MTN Network Solutions.</p>
          <p>Infrastructure and rollouts, EDA, South Africa, last year spent almost 4 billion rand, of course they took up our CapEx to sell to a much higher number, I think it was 15% at the end of December from let's say around 8 to 10% that we had previously, but we just felt that it was time now to reinvest in the South African network, and I think we've done that. And even though we went through a bad patch we believe the quality has improved significantly. And 3G network full year, 400 new sites for 2008 and so that has worked.</p>
          <p>And data, we're still on the increase it's now 12% of revenue excluding handsets. It is progress, but we again, we would like to reach the 15% mark as guidance that we've given previously. And West Africa by and large Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire have all shown very good performance, they have both increased their market share, and of course in the case of Cameroon we also &#x2013; sorry in the case of Cote d'Ivoire, we also increased our holding to 65%.</p>
          <p>Nigeria, I think had a very good year. The call to put huge CapEx into Nigeria 2008, I think was a very good call on our part. We've increased market share, we think we've gained significant momentum, and &#x2013; and we have increased our edge as the leading player there in the sense that we do now have the capacity to take on far more subscribers than our competitor, and I think more importantly, the quality is there. And as I mentioned earlier the &#x2013; the ARPU has remained fairly resilient.</p>
          <p>Of course, the big issue in Nigeria is naira devaluation, and it is in many respects very much linked to the price of oil, if the price of oil remains at $42 or around these levels, we will expect that there could be further devaluation, but nothing more significant and if of course the price of oil were to start going up there could be an upward tick, but as I said this morning, we &#x2013; it's treacherous for us to try and predict where the currency is going to go, suffice it to say that I think in the case of Nigeria, it is very much linked to the price of oil.</p>
          <p>And but these countries do have very large informal economies, and I think Nigeria is one of those, and therefore even though we're expecting a slowdown, we are still seeing very strong growth as indicated by the subscribers that we put up this morning for January and February. And again in Nigeria huge investment in &#x2013; in transmission of a 1000 kilometers in the metro areas, and of course having acquired VGC, we've now integrated that into MTN Nigeria, and I think working with the BT people on VGC we think it will position ourselves &#x2013; position us to be a major ICT player, and more importantly be able to service the &#x2013; the SMEs and the corporate segment in Nigeria far more effectively.</p>
          <p>Ghana, I think no different from Nigeria in terms of huge rollout there as &#x2013; as well. And we've put on an extra 2,400 sites in Ghana for 2008, and it has enabled us to increase our market share to 55%. A slight drop in output from $14 to $12, but again I think Ghana has weakened, the Ghana cedi has weakened against the dollar. I think, it's fairly stable on a &#x2013; on a local currency basis.</p>
          <p>And if we look at the MENA region, the medium-sized countries there Yemen, Afghanistan have done fairly well, Afghanistan in particular given the security challenges there, that put in fairly significant growth. But the driving engine there has been Iran, which is now at 16 million subscribers, and essentially the same size as South Africa. Of course, I think one key feature of the Iranian market is that the tariff is very, very low, and that is reflected in the ARPU at $9. Nevertheless, it's really relatively flat; it went from $9 to $10 to $9.</p>
          <p>And Iran, as you all know, does have a very strong and good quality fixed-line network. So I guess that has an impact as well. Market chain, Iran has increased to 37% from 23%. So, I think in the two years starting from zero, we do believe that it's been a fairly satisfactory performance. There is a third mobile operator that has been named as a preferred bidder in Iran, and we are not too sure when they will launch, but suffice to say that, we do believe that there will be a bit of time before that happens.</p>
          <p>And coverage, very big in Iran now over 455 cities, and over 3,000 kilometers of road coverage has happened. And there we are starting to see a rapid growth of data, we're at almost 14% of revenue data in Iran and of course 92% of that is SMS. So I think it does reflect how much potential is there on the data side, as time goes on.</p>
          <p>The disappointment for the year has been Sudan. Sudan has been a very big challenge for us. And it's a number of factors that have caused that problem. I think firstly, government has put out or supported the CDMA player, ARPU that is highly subsidized and that CDMA players had very low tariffs, very low, and &#x2013; and high subsidies on handsets, but to exacerbate the challenge, the regulator put us in a situation where we have to disconnect 1.1 million subscribers that were not fully registered.</p>
          <p>As I said this morning, I think we're fully complied; I can't talk for the other operators. Suffice to say that it did have an impact on our market share in Sudan, which dropped but I'm sad to say it's not that big a difference. We are working very actively to try and see what we can do in Iran, sorry in Sudan in resolving issues.</p>
          <p>And we have also launched now in the South of Sudan, and our market share there I think will most probably equal to the number one player there, and the intention is to obviously ensure that we sustain that by rolling out rapidly and so on.</p>
          <p>I think Syria essentially is very much a managed market in the sense that by law, we cannot do promotions and move far more rapidly than our competitor, and that does hold us back in Syria. I think, the second thing that holds us back in Syria is the fact that is a BOT, therefore we have to &#x2013; be extremely perceptive not that we're not elsewhere, but in Syria 10 times more than we are anywhere else of the marginal CapEx that we're putting on the ground, because it is a BOT.</p>
          <p>We're fairly hopeful that, we will get into more engagement with the regulator. In fact those discussions have started to try and see if the BOT, can be converted into a normal license. If you were to succeed in that, then on reasonable terms, I don't think if, then clearly Syria would become a far more valuable market, and I think the penetration would increase fairly substantially, fairly quickly.</p>
          <p>And so, I think that is really, I think the &#x2013; the brief overview on the strategic and operational issues that we've dealt with &#x2013; and as I mentioned this morning, there are some sort of tailwinds we've got from the currency, but by and large the performance is &#x2013; the fundamental performance is very, very strong. And we've seen strong performance will take up or start in the last two months. We're not by any indication saying that run rate will therefore continue for the rest of the year and so on, but we are saying that everything indicates to still meaningful potential for us to still invest in CapEx in a meaningful way.</p>
          <p>I will ask Rob now to just give the highlights of the financial overview, I will then close very quickly with just one or two things on the way forward, then we can take questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Phuthuma. I'll be pretty brief, and I'll just call out the page numbers as I go, because I'm sure you've all gone through the numbers already. On the key accounting considerations, and effectively the disposables that took place during the year, and just to note that as well as the acquisition, FX from a foreign exchange perspective, if you look at the net gain that came through, overall in the interest line it was about a 1 billion rand, depending how you wish to unpack that. The put option obviously is still with us, and will be with us for a while on the SB show exercises earlier. Anticipate that that is in place until 2013.</p>
          <p>From the Group tax rate perspective and I'll go through that a bit later as well. It is higher than what we anticipated up in the very high 30s, and I'll try and give some, enlighten to that. The EPS slide is 53 I don't think it needs any talking through other than obviously finally the impact of the &#x2013; pioneer status. And the increase related to that on the adjusted headline earnings, won't become through in the future years, because this is the last year that will be reflected other than as a comparative analysis.</p>
          <p>On the exchange rates, and as Phuthuma mentioned, I mean we did get that tailwind of some 15%, on both revenue and EBITDA lines and likewise obviously expenses engulfed by a similar sort of amount, and then from a closing rate perspective, obviously the balance sheet assets and liabilities also go up. And so just to bear that in mind, I think one item just on the exchange rate side, and just to bear in mind that obviously from a rand perspective, the naira has devalued and so has the rand relative to the dollar, so if you look at the average for last year with the rand, naira was at about 1454, if you look at the current exchange rate with the naira is about 145 to the dollar and the current rand exchange rate of about 10.</p>
          <p>Once again that's pretty similar to where it was last year. So, although obviously both have weakened from a rand perspective just to say it's still pretty even.</p>
          <p>On the income statement side, slide 55. The revenue numbers and the procurements gone &#x2013; gone through on the EBITDA margin obviously that slight slippage of 1.4% amounts to about 1.4 billion rand. And I will go through that a bit later. Obviously, our depreciation, amortization, it comes through both, impacted by the Forex issues, and amortization specifically about 600 of that movement was Forex related.</p>
          <p>I'll just go straight onto the slide 57, which is the revenue analysis slide. And just to state there that obviously net interconnect from a Group perspective, as a percentage of revenue has gone from about 4.8 up to 5%, RSA dropped off slightly, whereas &#x2013; Iran with the increased turmoil and they have a fairly high percentage in any case that contributed to a positive movement on net side.</p>
          <p>With regard to slide 59, I think &#x2013; I will just spend one second on 58. Obviously if you look at Syria and Phuthuma mentioned it, but if you look at Syria's performance on slide 58 from an EBITDA perspective and in slide 59, and if you look at the EBITDA margin decline from '07. Obviously the step up in revenue share from 40 to 50% took place from effectively 1 July. So you would have expected the decrease to come through year-on-year of about 5%. The reason for &#x2013; let's call it the low decline, was really due to correct expenditure control in the second half specifically in sales marketing and distribution and so next year we would expect that margin to come down.</p>
          <p>But within that Sudan, Phuthuma has gone through, obviously the extremely low margin that came through there. Christian's realized this morning whether the drop off in the second half of the year was due to one of the expenses, and I think the way you should look at Sudan for last year is effectively the EBITDA margin in total for the year, is what you should look at. So, there were some expenses that came through in the second half of the year that should have been processed during the first half of the year. So, rather just view it as an average for the year from that perspective.</p>
          <p>If you look at the operating expense analysis, and just to try and give some color to the decline in the EBIDTA percentage, and the direct network operating costs that increase of 64% or 5 billion rand effectively that's really made up of three items, the rents and utilities, those went up by about 86%, the &#x2013; and which equates to about 1.4 billion. The major item that came through there was Nigeria, which was at 1 billion. And the reason for that is, if you look at the slight increase in Nigeria for the year, it was at about 54%. So obviously, that's one of the major contributing factors. And on top of that, a lot of the leases within Nigeria had come to an end and those were renewed and the let's call it the renewal cost per site leased has escalated quite substantially in that environment.</p>
          <p>The other item and Phuthuma had mentioned it is the revenue share payments or regulatory payments. Those were really as said about 73% year-on-year, a major one being Syria at 1 billion, and Iran with the high revenue share and the higher revenue coming through that was an increase of 750 million. So those were the two items, and the final one was maintenance and that went up at about 62%, which was a 1 billion increase year-on-year, and that was largely across all operations, so I won't pull out any one specifically.</p>
          <p>On the other slide 61, just on the selling, distribution and marketing expenses, the increase of 45% and 4 billion rand, and two major contributors there in Nigeria, those expenses went up 70% relative to the revenue increase of about 55, and that accounted for 1.2 billion of that and that really was a, let's call it re-vamped proposition into the channels, when compared so they did up the commission, and that did have the impact the increase coming through, and then the other was South Africa with the increases on those lines contributed about 20% relative to the revenue increase of 16, and 16% is 1% higher than what's on the slide it's just excluding the handset revenues. And that again was mentioned in June as well as the March results last year, South Africa focusing on the distribution side.</p>
          <p>On the other and that really is made up of many items such as security, insurance, professional fees and various other items. On finance cost only quick item I'll mention on that slide is if you look at the forex losses, it does appear fairly large at 2.8 that really is the let's call it loan, dollar loan that we had at, at Group level that was fully hedged out as you are aware the effective hedge cost comes through the in forex losses opposed to coming through in the interest line that was 1.5 billion, immersed was at .3, 300 million rand and in Nigeria 20% of the $2 billion facility is dollar-based and that created a loss of some 400,000.</p>
          <p>On the tax considerations, I think just to 50 to come up to the 39.9% and Nigeria commencement provisions 4.3, obviously from mixture that pulls away, the STC and withholding taxes of 1.9 and plus the withholding taxes on near profit dividends from MTN Nigeria plus net debt withholding taxes of 1.5. So the STC although in South Africa that is going to fall away, I mean to the future it wouldn't come through as a charge, the withholding taxes that's coming from the debt always charge on the dividends coming up from the operating subsidiaries that would continue into the future and that would obviously bump up the tax rate a bit.</p>
          <p>Nigerian put option, the impact of that on the tax rate going forward is obviously questionable, because it does depend on the exchange rates in that, so we'll have to see where that ends up. And then other words various others items that came through that effectively increases the tax charge would decrease down <mark type="inaudible" />. If you look forward, we would expect going forward the tax rate to be in quarter in high to mid 50's next year compared to the 39% this year.</p>
          <p>Nigeria I won't go through those slides I think everyone is aware of it. On the balance sheet once again just to mention the exchange rate items that came through so I won't go through that, anticipating liabilities on page 67, other than to say, I mean you can see that we have local currency and borrowings in the countries that we're in and obviously it's always been our intention is to maximize that and that's &#x2013; let's just say paid well &#x2013; paid us well, we're the &#x2013; those currencies have devalued against the dollar, as such, which has been good for us.</p>
          <p>The other items just to mention is your own product interest you can see that's been reduced to 2.5 billion, if you remember when we start to go through while ago in June 2006 with the Investcom acquisition that was closer to 50 billion. So I mean that has reduced dramatically, which has been very good for us and net debt EBITDA 0.3 obviously very, very strong from a balance sheet perspective for going forward.</p>
          <p>Cash flow statement on page 68, net cash generation for the year plus CapEx at about 7 billion rands and notwithstanding the 28 billion of CapEx, still a very good cash generation.</p>
          <p>Slide 69, just on the CapEx slide, I think if you look at the 28.2 billion, if you remember in June, we said that we'd expect that number to be around about 25. We actually pleased that we managed to get more in the ground, but some of that is forex related, and so you must certainly find relative to the 25, we got about 26 in the ground. So we &#x2013; I think that was good performance.</p>
          <p>If you recall in the June numbers, we did effectively &#x2013; we had approved additional CapEx for the year on the initial amount of growth for 2008 was 50 billion, and we did approve additional CapEx that hasn't obviously been spent through the 2008 year has been carried over to 2009 year and of that 37 or 37.5 billion for 2009 again you wouldn't expect the full amount to be spent during the 2009 year and you'd most probably expect to carryover some in the region of 4 billion rand for the year. Tim, I think that's it from my side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks Rob. I think in closing, we have given some indication of what has happened in the last two months in South Africa, Nigeria, Iran, Ghana, Cameroon, and Cote d' lvoire, suffice to say that I think it's still a meaningful uptake of self. As I mentioned this morning, we all accept that the big question that people are asking is really on the CapEx, and we are saying that looking at traffic look &#x2013; looking at this uptake up and looking at the advantage, the capacity we put in last year has given us, we feel comfortable to look at the kind of CapEx numbers we are looking at this year.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I mean, one does have to mitigate it by saying that and comparing those numbers '08 to '09 on CapEx, one has to realize that these numbers are in Rand and obviously there has been a significant weakening of the Rand. So, you just start off with quite a big number relative to last year just going on currency.</p>
          <p>The second issue is traffic. We will say that there is strong billable traffic growth but it's something that we're obviously are monitoring very, very closely to ensure that I think the take up and the quality of subs in the spin is consistent with the CapEx that we are operating down. Side sharing and infrastructure sharing, obviously, will be a big feature of our strategy going forward to again make sure that we optimize on CapEx. And really, I think the issue of cash and gearing and so on, I think Rob has already touched on that and I won't go into that and the issues of Forex risk and again it's nothing new, we've said consistently that we try and maximize borrowings in local currency as well just to make sure that we've got, if you like, an inherent currency hedge where we've taken out loans.</p>
          <p>And expansion opportunities, as indicated this morning, it's the same thing every year. We just haven't found something that makes sense. We do engage, we do look and, of course, with the current prevailing market condition, and we think that we are even better positioned relative to others maybe, given the low gearing and the high cash generations, but ultimately, it has to be the right opportunity to come along for us to continue our expansion.</p>
          <p>And maybe, I think the last point really is just on the subs. We have indicated that we would expect to add on another 22.6 million subs or thereabouts by the end of December this year. And the split is in the pack, but just to read them out, we expecting 2 million from South Africa, 6 million from Nigeria, 1 million from Ghana or 1.1, 6 million from Iran, 400,000 from Syria, 1.1 from Sudan, and then the rest of the smaller countries another 6 million. So, that gives us vindication of where we expect to be.</p>
          <p>So, thank you very much. I think we can take questions.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. My first questions is regarding CapEx. Can you tell us what's the FX assumption you have taken for the guidance you gave for 2009 in term of Rand versus U.S. dollar, and if you can tell us roughly also the Group CapEx, how much percentage is in U.S. dollar?</p>
          <p>Second question is in term of bad debt. Can you give us any ceiling where currently bad debt as a percentage of revenue stand and if you see any deteriorations in sort of last two or three months and if it is the case, which country may be affected by that.</p>
          <p>And finally, for technical reason, I think I could not connect you for the beginning of the &#x2013; of the conference call, just once, if you can repeat what guidance you have given especially for South Africa and Nigeria for the first two months in term of subscribers on trend. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. I think let me give you the numbers for South Africa and I think Nigeria, and then I'll also give you the number of guidance in &#x2013; on where we expect to end up at the end of the year, and then I will ask Rob to respond on the CapEx, and I think you're asking how much of the CapEx is U.S. dollars. All right. On the two months, January and February, in the case of Nigeria, we've had 2.2 million subscribers and then in South Africa, it's 80,000. And then in terms of where we need to end up at the end of the year, we're saying that South Africa should be at 2 million that is net additions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, South Africa 2 million, Nigeria 60 million, Ghana 1.1, Iran 60 million, Syria 400,000, Sudan 1.1, and then the rest of the other countries 6 million. So, that should add up 22.6 million net additions up to December '09.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Drouet with regard to your issue on exchange rate, if you look at the average rand for the year, we are sitting at 909, was the number we used in the press release. If you look at the naira to the dollar, the average rate that we purchased at that was 122 on that side. So, that's with the two &#x2013; I think key exchange rates to be interested in. If you look at the market to CapEx that's dollar-related somewhere in the region of 40 to 50%, it's dollar-related on net side. If you then &#x2013; the bad debt side, I mean, the real where we have bad debts is South Africa because of the retail book that we run &#x2013; related to it's obviously the other markets where, to say, a 100%, I mean it's 99% prepaid. If you look in the South African environment, it did pick up last year, and the overall bad debt ratio for last year in South Africa was up at about 1.4% on that side. If you look at what it was the year before, it was just under one. So there was a uptick on the bad debt side, if you look at where we're at the moment in South Africa and &#x2013; doesn't mean that they're going to go bad, we have upped our provisions slightly. So at the moment we're providing at just over 2% on postpaid debtor's book.</p>

          <p>Hi, just a quick question. The &#x2013; can you give us an indication of what the fuel bill was in Nigeria last year? And the second question would just be on the Verizon business will that now be included in the &#x2013; in the South African business going forward and are you able to give us some indication of what sort of margins that business is at?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nik, are you trying to catch us out as usual? The fuel bill in Nigeria last year, I think was about $130 million. If you look at where we had end up this year obviously on a hell of lot more sites, and we budgeted on a fuel rate of about $75 per barrel and obviously Verizon had to pay a lot of landing costs to move the rest to within Nigeria and effectively if it ends up at that rate, we'd end up spending basically about the seven months in 2009 compared to 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Okay, and then just on the Verizon business?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Verizon and MTN's will be a separate division of MTN South Africa. So, I'm &#x2013; I presumably will put those figures out separate to the mobile business, and for competition reasons. The EBITDA margin at the moment on those businesses is in the mid-20s.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Could you just please discuss the ARPU and margin dynamics in Nigeria? You &#x2013; I think you exceeded maybe even your expectations with margins there. ARPU's held up stable and you spent considerably in the market, you look to be spending a similar amount for '09, and so maybe if you could just talk to &#x2013; those profitability and revenue dynamics there, and just secondly again in Nigeria is, if you can tell us about in your CapEx numbers, what was &#x2013; for expansion in '08, what was the capacity in '08? What's going to be expansion for '09? What percent will be capacity for '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I will ask Reese O'Toole to comment in general.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Let me start with the last question. Probably between expansion and coverage it was about 55% on capacity expansion and about 45% coverage.</p>
          <p>In terms of the ARPU dynamics, the &#x2013; the ARPU levels have held up very well. I guess the expansion on the network and the increase in capacity, has enabled people to be able to make calls. And the call failure rate has obviously decreased quite a lot and the fact that the network or the MTN network has generally improved quite significantly relative to the other operators has also meant that our subscriber numbers has also increased relative to the other operators. There is no indication that there should be any significant decline in ARPU, other than the normal decline that we've been seeing in relation to the increase in penetration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And obviously, the weakening of the naira on the exchange rate will have a hefty increasing impact on ARPU as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>or tariffs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So your comments on the ARPUs are &#x2013; and at what level and do you feel those levels are stable, what level are incremental ARPUs in Nigeria?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the region of about $9.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And have they &#x2013; those changed during the year. Did those change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean it's gone from about $10 to about $9.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you just comment on the margin, you have a very high margin and you kept it up, what's your thinking for '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, that is always a tough one, the point is we've given guidance on margin a few times and I think people are starting to not believe us. But the point is we can't always predict precisely what would happen there. We've said that the sustainable margin in Nigeria is in the low 50s, okay. And we're not therefore suggesting we are going to lose all of it in a year. But what we are saying is, there is yet another new entrant in Nigeria, it's still early days, if they start reducing tariffs or doing all sorts of things, it may come under pressure. If we start seeing more levies being applied, it may come under pressure. So what we're saying is the sustainable margin in our view is in the lower 50s, but obviously we do everything possible to try and maintain that margin. But, if there is new promotions that somebody undertakes, and we have to follow or we have to do it ourselves, then we may see a pressure on those tariffs.</p>

          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. I was just wondering if you could comment on your margins in Ghana. I think it's the H1 results, you mentioned that the margins were low but they were supposed to be recovering a little bit in H2, and we didn't really see that. I was just wondering if you can give some sort of outlook for the margins going into 2009. And then I was just wondering if you can also comment, I might have missed it in the call, but just on patriation of cash from a lot of your businesses, in particular Nigeria, I guess given the currency devaluation, if you are having any difficulties with that and if you see if that as a problem going forward?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The repatriation of funds &#x2013; to-date and touch wood we haven't had any issues with regards to repatriations whatsoever, other than in those two countries where, as you are well aware, our &#x2013; you not deterring dividends out right now, which is Ghana and Syria. And we do believe that in those two certainly within the next year that that should definitely be resolved, whereas the full embrace we hope soon. Whereas I think we're a bit more positive on those issues right now. So, we are saying by the end of the year that should be resolved. But other than that, no issues.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just very quickly in Nigeria, do you actually need to get approval from the Central Bank to take cash out?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is you always do. The process that you do, and before it was the commercial banks, effectively whether you spending CapEx or whatever, you effectively buy dollars, buy the Central Bank, by their auction methodology and effected in that manner. If you go back to when you first went into Nigeria, the system that's in operation now was in operation then. So, it then sort of &#x2013; we started going by the commercial banks and it's distributed to where it was before.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the margins in Ghana?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The main issues in Ghana were that there was the introduction of the tax, which we are not able to pass on completely to subscribers. And then also, in terms of our distribution, there was quite a significant increase in our distribution front. And then there was a review on how we recognized our cost of sales in such a manner that what had previously was recorded in the revenue line. That has changed through the cost code to be included in the cost line and that had an impact on our margin. But going forward, we believe that we will be able to sustain or slightly increase as we improve on the other cost structures.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes. My question relates to the 3G strategy, and if you could talk to whether that would really give you capacity in your voice traffic, which some cellular carriers have suggested has increased capacity substantiate very low CapEx, whether that's really going to be an effect going ahead, or whether it's really just premium services like mobile broadband, and whether &#x2013; how you see this really having an impact on the Group as you go ahead in 3G?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the reality is a combination of both. We do hope that it does give us additional capacity, and obviously we would like to see let's say the higher end customers migrating up onto the 3G network, both for voice and for the data. So, it is really a combination of the two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you &#x2013; will it effect your CapEx going ahead, I mean if you can materially bring down or increase capacity on voice, would you expect CapEx to show meaningful decline say in 2010 or is that too premature to assume that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No &#x2013; is this &#x2013; I mean at this stage, we're not really focusing on the 3G network from a point of view of taking up more capacity. I think we are really still at a stage where we're just rolling out specifically to be able to provide additional services, but over time we should benefit from the existence of the 3G capacity.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have four questions if I may. Firstly, if you look at a country like Nigeria, how much of a perfect match is there between revenues in naira and costs in naira, or is there a percentage of your cost base that is effectively driven by the U.S. dollar, which would create a mismatch, that's the first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in your presentation you talk in &#x2013; the Nigeria ARPU being off 6% year-on-year in naira. If I calculated using your average rates and the dollar ARPU that you given I get a 12% year-on-year year decline, if you could just comment on that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, if you &#x2013; sorry thirdly, if you look at contract ARPUs in South Africa they've picked up, which I think is quite surprising given the economic situation in South Africa. Could you just comment on the drive of that and where you see that going forward into the new financial year?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, the Iran EBITDA margin of 30%, in the light of the revenue share, do you think that that's pretty much where you would expect it to stay or do you think there is scope for an improvement? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right I'm &#x2013; I think on Iran EBITDA margin I will ask Sifiso to talk about that and Tim, you want to comment about the tick up in ARPU in South Africa after Sifiso and then Rob will deal with the matching of the costs and revenues in Nigeria.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look the guidance that you we have always given in terms of the Iran EBITDA margin has been in the upper 20 I mean there has been really good let's say it's cost savings and management focus on cost in Iran in order to get us to that the 30% level I mean what the revenue share is that we have, we don't expect that it will be any higher than where it is now and we think that does the kind of level that has the upper-end of our expectations on EBITDA in Iran</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next Tim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the &#x2013; on the ARPU in South Africa on postpaid its really three effects and the percentage of top-up customers, hybrid customers in the postpaid base has fallen from about a third to about a fifth. So you get a base of effect on that. Secondly on our long-term customers, we have been upselling them when their contracts come to an end. So, they are on the whole moving to higher value contract. And then on the MTN anytime product people I think as a part of the economic impact are opting into lower value packages, but then spending more outside the bundle, which is giving us a positive effect. I think going forward we are going to be more competitive in the low-end product area, so I still expect us to hold ARPU. But I think I don't see it kind of picking up. Yeah &#x2013; well that's the ongoing one is the hybrid product, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right Tim with regards to those other easy questions I mean I think from a this cost base perspective I mean there are definitely certain costs that are linked to the dollar I mean if you look at the fuel number one. So that would be effectively linked to the dollar if you look at some of the  SLAs with let's say the suppliers like Ericsson in it and some license fee payment those would be linked to the dollar. And some license obviously which would be linked to the dollar and interconnect okay with international partners would be linked to the dollar. And apart from that okay, can't think of anything right now. Okay but why don't you check on it first. Now I do know previously, I am just thinking back in time back in South Africa and obviously it was far greatly impacted due to the handset side okay that came through as on the cost of sales. So I would have thought that those items that I'm talking about linked to dollar in Nigeria almost would definitely be less than 5% of your cost base with regards to the ARPU issue that you are talking about the 12% relative to the 6% I must be quite honest, I'd have to redo the calculations I mean those calculations have been done it's on a weighted average basis again so there is none, so I can come back to you on that.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thanks &#x2013; all I did was use the average exchange rate that you gave and then the dollar ARPUs that you gave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will tell you the &#x2013; the average exchange rate should apply okay because obviously that comes on the revenue line I mean that's done on the weighted average basis for the full year and this is the way we do it okay, which is the way you have to do. So I mean that should work as such. But the problem is you don't have the revenue weighting so what I'm saying is the exchange rates go up if you run at the revenue weighting, but I'll come back to you on that.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just one question on &#x2013; head office EBITDA has come down specifically from 1,385 million last year to 316 million this year, in fact in first half it was 407 million rands. Can you please explain what is the cause for this decline in head office EBITDA and what are the components going into it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, which line are you talking about we didn't hear the beginning.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It has gone down from 1,385 million last year to 316 million, this year in fact in first half it was 470 million rands?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh that's fine. I've got the question sorry, I just catch you very badly. There is basically just a few cost and provision issues that we put through at an immediate school at various head office levels and that's what impacted us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if we remove those one-off items, so what would have been the amount, and what is the provision amount?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said I am afraid I am not prepared to give that out, what I am saying is we applied certain provision on various lines and that came through</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay...</p>

          <p>Can I suggest, we take two more questions, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course sir, just one moment. Our next question comes from William Kirby of Nevsky Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have two questions. My first question is on how you're thinking about CapEx in 2010, I mean could this decline at double-digit rates from '09 levels or are we likely to see the level you've guided for '09 in future years. And then secondly, following the last question, should we be expecting head office EBITDA in future years to be more like what it was in 2007, or were these provisions you mentioned in '08 exceptional? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if I can just start with CapEx in 2010 and then Rob will talk about the head office number. Look, I think as I mentioned, somebody asked exactly the same question this morning in the presentation, and the history has been a bit difficult, now. I mean, we have been very, very, very cautious initially in putting limited CapEx in the ground, we suffered high congestion the quality of service became problematic, we've got problems with the regulator. And of course, I think, the investors were all saying, well why don't you guys put more CapEx and get ahead of the curve. Well, that's what we thought of doing in 2008 and in some respect, everybody is saying well now why you are putting all this CapEx, and say et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>And the reason is because it's been very &#x2013; very difficult for a number of reasons, but one of them being the absence of very good quality staff in Nigeria, to always plan as perfectly as we would want. So, the best I can say to you is, and we still think that there's still very significant growth, hence the number you're seeing for 2009, we are going to monitor it very, very, very closely, and we are all very sensitive to putting more CapEx than we really need to on the ground. So it has to be justified by the traffic, and all the other three, four things that I mentioned as various reality &#x2013; reality check point for us. And I would expect it in 2010 to be a significantly less, I mean that's what I would expect, I mean even Nigeria has got a limit as to what we can afford and what the demand is, and, but I would be extremely hesitant to say it's just going to fall off the cliff, because it really depends, what's going to happen. We will have to look by June, take a view, and so on. I know that might not be as helpful an answer as you wish to hear but that's really the situation, it's monitoring very closely. Bottom line is, the demand is still very strong, the ARPU is still relatively high, and the penetration is still only 36%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I've just got three quick ones, just the CapEx guidance for '09, I just want to make sure that it includes, the fiber out spoke, into sea as well as land. My second question just around the churn rate in Nigeria, maybe an exit number for '08 and whether it's gone up or down compared to '07, and then my last one just the head count of the total business. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I think the head count for the total business is &#x2013; some times there are some people that are partly, temporary workers and paying some labor loans, but I think a good figure is around 18,000, that's for the 21 countries around 18,000 people. And then the CapEx including the submarine number.</p>
