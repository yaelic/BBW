          <p>Thank you.</p>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to E.ON's First Half 2012 Investor and Analyst Conference. My name is Marc Spieker. I'm the new Head of Investor Relations team at E.ON. So from my side for the first time, a particular welcome to all of you. Having worked within the E.ON Group for 10 years in various functions and units, I'm proud to now represent our company to our current and hopefully potential owners, as well as those who try to guide with good analysis and advice.</p>
          <p>We will have plenty of opportunities to talk and meet in person going forward. I'm looking forward to this. Now I know you're keen on listening to Johannes and Marcus, who will bring more valuable insights into the operational and financial highlights of E.ON.</p>
          <p>I hand over to Johannes.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. So welcome to our team, Marc.</p>
          <p>At the 2011 full year results, we told you that last year would be the trough of the current cycle of E.ON. E.ON's first half results of this year indicate our view, we have seen the worst. EBITDA came out at &#x20AC;6.7 billion, a 55% increase, EBIT is up 105% to &#x20AC;4.9 billion, and underlying net income has more than tripled to end up at &#x20AC;3.3 billion.</p>
          <p>At the start of July, we upgraded our outlook for 2012. We now expect EBITDA to come in at between &#x20AC;10.4 billion and &#x20AC;11 billion. Underlying net income is expected to end up between $4.1 billion and &#x20AC;4.5 billion. We are today confirming all these figures and continue to target a dividend of &#x20AC;1.10 per share for 2012. Marcus will later provide you more detail on our financial performance and our current outlook.</p>
          <p>With high double-digit earnings growth, things seem to be &#x2013; to go right. And yes, in all likelihood, E.ON has passed the trough of the earnings cycle. But we cannot relax. The overall economic environment remains extremely challenging. Power and gas demands in Europe are at best stagnating. Power prices and spreads are already low and remain under pressure.</p>
          <p>When we decided on our new Cleaner and Better Energy strategy that we communicated to you in November 2010 and then updated in August 2011, following Germany's decision to exit nuclear energy, we have not put on rose-tinted glasses. We anticipated a difficult environment in many of our businesses and did set our strategic priorities accordingly.</p>
          <p>We have decided as a company and as a management team to embark on a quite fundamental transformation. Since then, we are keeping our focus on delivering on our next promises: first, streamline the European portfolio; secondly, strengthen our balance sheet; thirdly, increase efficiency and enhance decision-making; fourth, improve capital management; and lastly, redeploy capital towards growth areas.</p>
          <p>The current economic environment might be difficult, but it is not an excuse not to do our homework. With other words, we are not waiting for the good times to return, but we strive to perform anyhow.</p>
          <p>In today's presentation, I will discuss three areas where we are clearly doing our homework and quite successfully: first, the renegotiation agreement with Gazprom and the turnaround of our gas wholesale business; second, the execution of our &#x20AC;15 billion disposal program; third, our initiatives to increase efficiency and enhance E.ON's organizational capabilities. And then, finally, I will give you a brief update on the progress in one of our targeted growth areas, mainly Brazil.</p>
          <p>I turn to chart two, the agreement with Gazprom. Let me start here. It's one of the most important business developments of the last few weeks that we had not foreseen as safe given when we met you last for the first quarter results.</p>
          <p>On July 3, we reached finally a commercial agreement with the Russian Gazprom on the renegotiation of the pricing conditions on our long-term gas contracts. Logically, the arbitration proceedings have also been ended. The new pricing conditions primarily reduced the price level on our long-term contracts with Gazprom. In addition, we have agreed on elements of the new price formula which further and substantially reduce the exposure to the gas-oil spreads. I know that many of you would like to learn a lot more about it, but please understand that it's in the commercial interest of E.ON and Gazprom to maintain a quite high level of confidentiality on the details of what we have agreed on.</p>
          <p>Anyway, from what I've just said, it's clear that our agreement with Gazprom is much more than so-called quick fix, but falling short of the fundamental structure solution for growth. The new improved price conditions will be applied retroactively back to the formal start of renegotiations, namely October 1, 2010, as said in the long-term contracts. As a result, we recall that the retroactive benefit of roughly &#x20AC;1 billion in our first half year 2012 EBITDA. And this amount offsets the losses that we had accumulated on the Gazprom volumes between the fourth quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2012. Furthermore, the adjusted price will allow us to sell the gas taken from Gazprom probably &#x2013; profitably in the upcoming gas year.</p>
          <p>All in all, I regard this agreement with E.ON's largest gas supplier as a major success. Despite straining market circumstances, our rights under the contracts have been held through. And what I conceive is even more important, the spirit of the long-term contracts have been respected. Even if the final step to fully and for good derisk our contracts discussed while might still need to be taken. We have now achieved a decisive step in this direction.</p>
          <p>This mutual beneficiary agreement confirms our long running partnership with Gazprom. If I turn to chart three, the overall gas supply portfolio of E.ON now that we have reached the agreement with Gazprom, we have managed to renegotiate all our long-term supply contracts once or early even twice. I want to take a step back and recap from where our gas wholesale business is coming from and where it is heading to. Since late 2009, the European gas markets, especially the German gas market, which is at the crossroad of the European transport systems, have been through breathtaking changes, not only have the changes been of massive proportion, but they also have taken place very rapidly.</p>
          <p>After 40 years of purely oil-based pricing, one cannot overstate the impact of the changes, which most probably can be addressed as a once-in-a-lifetime experience. What EBITDA would our portfolio of long term gas contracts generate in 2013 if there had been no renegotiations since late 2009? Well, basically about 560 terawatt hours of our gas supplies would still be fully oil backed on traditional formula. The breakeven point of that business would have been close to I guess to oil spread of zero. As a consequence, given the current gas-oil spreads, we would probably be making something like a &#x20AC;3 billion of losses, yes, &#x20AC;3 billion. And we would still have an unchanged massive oil exposure to further changes of that gas-oil spread. I know that most investors and analysts did not even believe in our capacity to solve this problem through renegotiation.</p>
          <p>Now two years later, what have we actually achieved? First and foremost, the price level on the long-term contracts has been significantly reduced. Thus the changes of the pricing formula have substantially lowered the breakeven point with respect to the gas-oil spread. And second, we have drastically reduced our overall exposure to any gas-oil spreads. This is mainly the result of the strong increase in the <mark type="ph" /> share of hop pricing (08:57) our portfolio, which is now approaching 50%. Additional adjustments to the formula have further reduced the exposure.</p>
          <p>As a result, our portfolio of long-term gas contracts should deliver a slightly positive EBITDA in 2013. As we have already contracted forward most of our 2013 supply volumes, we have already secured most of the margin and almost eliminated the gas-oil spread risk. When we look beyond 2013, our exposure to the gas-oil spread is much diminished compared to the starting point in 2009.</p>
          <p>The long-term contracts helped us improve the robustness, the main principle that the buyer takes the volume risk and the marketing risk, and the producer, the price and the market risks have largely been respected. To conclude, with the renegotiation of our portfolio of long-term contracts, we have successfully tackled the strategic challenge that our gas wholesale business was posing to E.ON as a whole. Yes, we still have to work on a number of issues. One of our objectives, for example, is to convert most of the remaining quick fixes, infrastructure solutions. But from a group perspective, these challenges don't have a strategic character anymore. In the light of what we have achieved so far, I'm highly confident that we will be able to resolve the remaining issues. Therefore, still I can say that we have delivered on our key objective of our 2010 strategic trend, sorting out the problems in supply and sales of gas.</p>
          <p>Turning to chart four, moving to my next topic, I would like to discuss our &#x20AC;15 billion disposal target. Only a few days after the announcement of our first quarter results, we took another successful step. We agreed to sell Open Grid Europe, our German gas transmission network, to a consortium consisting of Macquarie, Infinity Investments, British Columbia Investment Management Corporation and MEAG. The purchase price amounted to &#x20AC;3.2 billion, and the corresponding enterprise value is &#x20AC;2.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Once again, we succeeded to achieve attractive valuation multiples. The enterprise value was roughly 10 times EBDITA. The transaction already closed now on July 23, so just a few days in the third quarter. In total, we have thus already divested successfully &#x20AC;12.5 billion of noncore assets. We had hoped to clinch another transaction before today's presentation, the disposal of E.ON Energy from Waste. Four bidders made offers at the end of June. However, from our perspective, they all proved unattractive. We are confident if Energy from Waste will continue to perform well in the coming years and that this business is worth substantially more than what was on the table.</p>
          <p>We applied a same disciplined approach when assessing divestment option as to our investment decisions. We are not under any timing or financial pressure. We have therefore simply decided to shelve this transaction for the time being. What are we still working on now? From the outset, we told you that our &#x20AC;15 billion disposal program was not only about improving our financial position or redeploying capital to our growth areas. It's also about focusing all resources and financial means in our European portfolio and assets.</p>
          <p>In this respect, we have decided to focus our German regional businesses on regional distribution to our four largest regional distributors: E.ON Bavaria, E.ON Avacon in Lower Saxony, E.ON Edis in the Eastern States of Germany, and E.ON Hans in the Northern States. These four regional distributors account for about 75% of all present regional supply business in this nation. Together, they form a particularly efficient combination, which we play an attractive part in the energy turnaround in the German regions, especially with respect to the accelerated expansion of the networks and to distributed power generation.</p>
          <p>With regard to our small &#x2013; three smaller regional supply businesses, E.ON Westfalen Weser, E.ON Mitte and E.ON <mark type="ph" /> Drilling and (13:17) Energy, we are open for more active involvement of the municipal core shareholders. The process is proceeding, but not yet in any way to conclude. All in all, we already achieved quite a lot. There are now &#x20AC;2.5 billion of divestments remaining before the end of 2013 to achieve the &#x20AC;15 billion. And we feel extremely comfortable to close this yet on time.</p>
          <p>Turning to chart five, in the cornerstone of our strategy is to increase efficiency and improve E.ON as an organization. The E.ON 2.0 program takes center stage in this respect. Over the last few months, implementation has been gathering speed. E.ON 2.0 is a program that we as a management team are putting a lot of time in. I would like to highlight a few tangible examples of what we have achieved so far in the late months.</p>
          <p>Let me start with structures and overheads. First, at the group management headquarters in D&#xFC;sseldorf, we are reducing the head count by several hundreds to about 400, a reduction of roughly a third. And actually, we are almost done here.</p>
          <p>Second, we have closed for good the headquarters of E.ON Energy, the old traditional German business, in Munich, where about 400 people worked. Some steering functions will be taken over by the newly founded E.ON Germany in Essen where about 100 people will be located <mark type="ph" /> and that recorded (14:45) another anecdotal result &#x2013; remark. Last week, we sold the Munich headquarter &#x2013; since there is no house left, there will be no people there.</p>
          <p>Third, we are carrying out a major reorganization of global gas and trading. Here, exploration and production will become a separate unit reporting directly to the headquarter. We are merging the activities related to supply optimization and trading into the new unit, optimization and trading. Obviously, the major change in this respect relates to gas.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have transferred the responsibility of all sales activities to our regional units. This means in particular that the gas sales activities of the old Ruhrgas have now been transferred to the regional unit in Germany. The objective is to simplify structures, clarify responsibilities, reduce overheads and strengthen optimization and commodity markets, especially gas.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are drastically reducing the overheads in power generation resulting from traditional, complex legal structures.</p>
          <p>Turning to chart six, besides structures and overheads, the second example is what we are doing in the support functions for human resources and finance. This graph on chart six shows what percentage of these activities are centralized into business service centers and benchmarks the current situation of E.ON against the sample of top-quartile companies. It appears clearly that E.ON has, so far, a much more decentralized approach.</p>
          <p>We have thoroughly reviewed the situation and indeed concluded that there is quite a substantial potential of cost saving in these areas. We have therefore decided to completely reorganize human resource and finance functions within the whole group.</p>
          <p>The cornerstone of the organization is the creation of two business service centers, one in the Romanian City of Cluj and one in the German capital, Berlin. The business service centers in Berlin will employ roughly 500 FTEs and focus on human resources. The one in Cluj will employ roughly 600 FTEs and concentrate on accounting and finance. By 2015, around 1,400 FTEs will remain active in HR and finance within all units. All together, thus, the both functions, human resource and finance, will employ 2,500 FTEs across the whole group. Compared to today's current count, this is a reduction of more than 20% of the head count.</p>
          <p>On chart seven, I turn to procurement. This is another major focus of E. ON 2.0, as it should deliver about 30% of all cost savings. Year two, we are considerably changing our procurement organization to get more bank for the buck.</p>
          <p>Following this reorganization, we have launched a renewed effort to reduce procurement spend across the group. In practice, we want to submit our procurement spend to a thorough squeeze in eight successive waves. About 40% of the spend that will be addressed is OpEx and will thus contribute to our target of reducing controllable cost. The rest is CapEx. That will not impact on controllable cost, but of course, reducing CapEx cost also creates value.</p>
          <p>Our current plan is to complete these eight waves by 2014. We have now completed the first wave. Each wave is concentrating on a number of spend categories. The first wave includes eight spend categories, cuts of CCGT maintenance, call centers, and transformers. The second wave is ongoing and involves seven spend categories &#x2013; in example, IT consulting, travel and offshore foundations, among others. The third wave is about to start.</p>
          <p>In the first two waves, we can confirm that we have identified saving potentially of more than 20% on average. We succeeded, for example, to significantly reduce the cost for CCGT maintenance.</p>
          <p>To conclude, I would like to remind to you that we are pursuing three distinctive goals with E.ON 2.0. The first is to reduce controllable cost to $9.5 billion by 2015 on the like-for-like basis. This implies that the cost savings must amount to more than $2 billion to more than offset normal cost inflation. Put beyond cost cutting, we want to further improve the performance mindset of our companies and reach top quartile positions in all operational businesses and support functions. Finally, we want to reduce complexity and make E.ON a much faster and flat organization.</p>
          <p>I believe that the examples that I shared with you demonstrate that there's a strong drive within E.ON to achieve these goals. All these examples show you that we are committed to doing our homework. Our strategy is, however, not all about shrinking, cost-cutting, retrenching. We see attractive growth opportunities that we can leverage our competencies and capabilities. We are therefore redirecting capital towards these growth areas. For examples, renewables or businesses beyond Europe.</p>
          <p>This is why, at the end of my speech, I would like to spend a few words on our partnership with the Brazilian MPX. In May, all the main steps to seal our partnership have been completed. The joint venture has been founded and the development pipeline has been transferred to the joint venture. MPX has spun off its Colombian coal activities and converted some debentures into equity. And E.ON has participated in the capital increase and now holds 11.7% of the capital of MPX. Later on, this will be adjusted back to 10%.</p>
          <p>In addition, two weeks ago, the joint venture acquired three on-shore wind projects in Brazil with a potential capacity of more than 600 megawatt and with another 600 megawatt of possible extensions. These projects are at an early development stage and do not have PPAs yet. However, the joint venture plans to participate in the next PPA auction, which should take place in October and allocate 160 MV megawatt of wind capacity.</p>
          <p>This acquisition reflects the clear will of both MPX and E.ON to expand the activities of the joint venture to renewables while delivering in parallel on the very large pipeline on conventional generation projects.</p>
          <p>The upfront investment was minimal and hence fully in line with our prudent investment approach. Our partnership with MPX is thus up and running now. The focus of both partners is to create value by tapping the growing demand of conventional renewable power in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America.</p>
          <p>This concludes my remarks. Thank you for your attention. Marcus, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you.</p>
          <p>Dear analysts and investors, as Johannes has already taken you through the major movements at the overall group level, I will run you through the details of H1 reporting, starting with the major effects influencing group EBITDA. But let me make short comments first on the fact that we have preannounced the headline numbers of this quarterly release in the form of an ad hoc statement. And as you will recall, this has now happened for the second time in a row.</p>
          <p>Just to make it very clear, we would also rather avoid this, as it clearly does not facilitate the communication process, but the legal criterion set by the German financial markets regulator which we have to recognize here is the deviation of major earnings figures in a significant manner from prior year numbers. And with a 255% increase of the underlying net income in our half year results compared to prior year, this threshold is clearly surpassed. It is actually then irrelevant if the reasons leading to this deviation were actually known, and consequently, analyst capital market expectations are in line with the numbers. Hence, quite frankly, it is quite probable that this kind of communication will reoccur in the future. We haven't made those rules, but we have to follow them.</p>
          <p>Now to the major movers of group EBITDA in the first half compared to the first half of 2011. There are two very substantial positive factors. The first, the nuclear effect, is the absence of the prior year one-off charge. As you will remember, at this time last year, we quantified the overall impact of the accelerated nuclear phase-outs. The German government's decision to take the eight oldest nuclear power plants out of the system had a huge impact on provisions, triggered a value loss of inventory and other items.</p>
          <p>All in all we booked &#x20AC;1.5 billion one-off charge through group EBITDA. As this was obviously not repeated this year, it creates the &#x20AC;1.5 billion positive delta. The second effect is to a certain extent also one-off in nature. The &#x20AC;1.2 billion improvement in our gas wholesale business mainly results from the settlement with our largest gas supplier, Gazprom. The &#x20AC;1 billion books in H1, which we communicated together with our ad hoc statements earlier in July, also contain a substantial proportion of compensation for prior years, mainly 2011 losses. Johannes has already commented in detail on this important issue, so I'll leave it with that. Also in the gas business, now reported in our segment optimization and trading, we recorded a gain from the revaluation of participations for the context of separating Open Grid Europe.</p>
          <p>The good earnings development in Q2 in Russia again confirms the quality of our investment. We profited mainly from the first time contribution of new power plants as these plants were all operational during last parts of the second half of last year. This effect will not gain further in size in the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Finally, next to some $200 million of diverse positive other effects, I would like to mention our UK business, which has been performing nicely in the first half, contributing an EBTIDA growth of roughly &#x20AC;100 million. This was mainly driven by a good Q1, which was supported by a strong margin in Q1 2012 with just the opposite being the case in Q1 of 2011. The earnings of the region UK as a whole do not reflect this strong earnings growth. But remember, we saw UK central networks, which had still contributed to full first quarter of earnings, slightly shy of &#x20AC;200 million last year.</p>
          <p>Now to the negatives, the largest negative impact was in our nuclear and power portfolio. Here we saw the continuation of two effects which we had already described at the Q1 stage. Firstly, a substantial part of this effect is linked to the missing volumes form our decommissioned nuclear power plants <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:48). We lost around four terawatt-hours year-on-year due to the fact that these two stations have still been producing in Q1 2011. Secondly, we continue to see the impact of falling average achieved power prices for the Central European power track portfolio as well as lower earnings from our spread business.</p>
          <p>The second effect is linked to the nuclear fuel tax and is similar in size. Here we faced a substantially higher bill than last year due to two reasons. First is linked to the plant Brokdorf. Last year, we have this plant fuel rod maintenance in the second half of the year. This year, we decided to extend an unscheduled maintenance during Q2 and move the fuel rod switch into the second quarter. Secondly, in expectation of potential changes to the nuclear tax legislation, we had optimized the refueling last year to pretty much minimum levels. This year, we have returned to more normal levels.</p>
          <p>Finally, two divisions contribute negatively with &#x20AC;0.1 million each. Our E&amp;P operation is suffering from production problems in several fields, as reported. Here mainly the <mark type="ph" /> bad (27:04) availability of the Njord and Rita fields and the leak with the following full production stop at the Elgin-Franklin field are taking their toll. I will talk about the outlook for these two fields at the end of my presentation.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we're seeing downward pressure in our renewable segment. Next to the volume and price effects, which are summarized in the earlier mentioned group, power effect, we have to build a provision for our hub work, pump storage plants. In these plants, we're having problems with the major leakage.</p>
          <p>Our EC&amp;R operation has shown good organic growth, adjusted for some one-off effects positively influencing the first half of last year. The EBITDA of solar winds and others would have grown by 15%. This is mainly driven by new capacity added in the second half of last year. Since end of June 2011, we have added 540 megawatt of new capacity of which only 40 were commissioned in 2012.</p>
          <p>On the following two slides, we've reconciled reported net income starting from EBITDA. The first thing you will notice is the lower depreciation. The two main drivers here are the lower production volumes in our E&amp;P business and the asset impairments for last year. Our economic net interest expense has also improved by &#x20AC;120 million. This is the net positive effect of two larger moves. Negative is the higher net interest expense from financial liabilities, resulting from a one-off positive effect in the first half last year. As you may remember, our net interest position in H1 last year was supported by the reversal of the provision related to the prepayments into the renewable energy fund.</p>
          <p>The compensating positive effect is mainly related to a necessary release of provisions. This is an effect that will build up in the further course of the year. It is of one-off nature, it is non-cash and at the end of the year, the positive impact will be substantial. As usual, you will find actually the details on the economic net interest results in the backup to the presentation. Net book gains came down strongly compared to last year in 2011, this position mainly benefited from the disposal of the remaining Gazprom shares and obviously also central networks.</p>
          <p>Restructuring cost improved compared to prior year. As a short reminder here, we booked large restructuring provisions, about &#x20AC;800 million, in the fourth quarter last year and hence the majority of our restructuring expenses from E.ON 2.0 are currently running against these provisions. Our reported tax rate slightly increased from very low levels. Remember, last year, we were benefiting from a mix of effects. Due to the nuclear one-off, we lost a considerable portion of taxable income. At the same time, the book gain from the Gazprom disposal was tax-free.</p>
          <p>This year, on the operational side, the weakness of E&amp;P is reducing the tax expense. Adding to this, we have recorded a release of provisions related to certain effects from prior years.</p>
          <p>On chart 12, you can observe that the strong jump in EBITDA feeds through almost fully to the underlying net income. The increase in income tax only slightly overshoots the positive effect from lower depreciation and economic net interest.</p>
          <p>Let me now run you through the reconciliation of operating cash flow on chart 13. Starting from the &#x20AC;2.4 billion in H1 2011, the first effect is the additional EBITDA in H1 2012, i.e., up &#x20AC;2.4 billion. This is followed by a number of non-cash EBITDA effects of which two are very prominent. Firstly, of course, the nuclear carve-out effect and secondly the &#x20AC;1 billion effect from the Gazprom agreement. We have not yet received the cash for the settlement. And finally, less prominent is the revaluation of infrastructure assets in our gas business, also as I mentioned, before non-cash effect.</p>
          <p>On the positives, the most prominent one comes from our gas storage business where we have a higher net extraction in 2012. In the UK, we managed to reduce coal inventories. And in Russia and Czech, we had negative working capital effects last year caused by regulatory changes which, of course, have not repeated themselves.</p>
          <p>The UK pension funding effect also relates to last year when we had to put additional cash into the fund. The lower interest payments relate mostly to the early redemption fees which we paid for the buyback of E.ON bonds last year. The &#x20AC;0.8 billion other provision is mainly influenced by several positive working capital movements.</p>
          <p>Finally, as you may remember in Q1, we reported a &#x20AC;1.6 billion withholding tax payment. Just to recap again the background for this, the context of our 2011 full year accounts of E.ON AG, we distributed dividends from certain subsidiaries to the AG. This cost a prepayment on E.ON's overall tax declaration for 2011. We expect to fully recoup this payment in the second half of 2012.</p>
          <p>So summing up, I would like to highlight that there were two big effects weighing on the cash flow in H1, but we expect to receive a cash flow in the course of the second half, the just mentioned tax payments and the Gazprom settlement.</p>
          <p>Our net debt position is described on the next chart, 14. As you will notice, economic net debt further increased since the Q1 reporting to &#x20AC;41 billion as of H1. I would like to make clear that this net debt figure is distorted by several factors. Firstly, it does not yet include the proceeds from the disposal of Open Grid Europe, roughly &#x20AC;3 billion. We closed that transaction late July. Secondly, it does not include the cash we will receive in our supply and sales business mainly related to the Gazprom settlement, but we have booked a receivable through earnings. We're still expecting the cash inflow as mentioned before.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, it does not include the compensatory tax repayments related to our reporting tax payment in January. And if you actually add up all these three effects, you get through a number around &#x20AC;5.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, just to remember at this time of the year, we tend to have an interim jump of financial debt simply because of the dividend payment in May. In detail, the key effects were as follows. In the course of the first half, we invested &#x20AC;2.7 billion which corresponds to roughly 40% of the budgeted full year CapEx. This is a &#x20AC;250 million increase compared to last year's first six months. The biggest single share of total CapEx and also largest contribution to year-on-year CapEx growth came from our renewables business. There we invested &#x20AC;730 million, around 27% of the overall CapEx. The only other segment where we saw an increase was our Russian operation. With our annual dividend payment for the group in May, our overall dividend payments amount to &#x20AC;2.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow contributed a positive &#x20AC;2.5 billion, and as I mentioned before, I think the weak performance has been discussed. Divestments contributed around &#x20AC;0.7 billion to the net debt reduction. This figure does not include the cash in from our disposal of Open Grid Europe. Pension provisions increased by &#x20AC;1.4 billion with the main driver here being the reduction of the benchmark bond yields leading to quite a substantially lower discount rate. In the other position, the single biggest driver is the increase of margining requirements at our trading business of in total around &#x20AC;900 million.</p>
          <p>Let me now finish with some comments on the outlook. Together with our release regarding the settlement with Gazprom, we had also announced an increase of our 2012 outlook both for EBITDA and underlying net income. As we did not conduct a conference call after the news of the settlements, I would like to make use of our call today to run you through the changes to the outlook in some detail.</p>
          <p>I'm sure many of you will have conducted this exercise with our Investor Relations team, but for those who haven't, maybe this will be of some help. First on the EBITDA outlook, starting from the previous range for 2012 EBITDA of &#x20AC;9.6 billion to &#x20AC;10.2 billion, we have included the following changes in our new range of &#x20AC;10.4 billion to &#x20AC;11 billion.</p>
          <p>First, to the positive side. Around &#x20AC;1 billion was booked in H1 in relation to the Gazprom agreement driven by compensation for the period between October 2010 and end 2011, and the figure also included compensation for losses incurred in the first half of this year. Secondly, we have adopted the conditions for the Gazprom contract in such form that we do not expect to make a loss on them in the course of the second half. Remember at the beginning of the year, we have been expecting to record a loss of maximum &#x20AC;700 million in the gas LTC business was the only material open counterparty for renegotiation at that time being Gazprom.</p>
          <p>Now to the negatives, we have now assumed a conservative scenario for our E&amp;P business within total around 7 million BOE of production coming from our North Sea fields in 2012. This assumes continued low production of Njord, no volumes from Elgin in H2 and the start-up of Skarv in December.</p>
          <p>A short status update on these fields. Skarv, after an in-depth review, operator British Petroleum reset start-up to the fourth quarter of this year. Since Easter, the weather has improved and there has been significant offshore progress. The installation of all 13 rises has been completed despite a strike in July, decommissioning is progressing well and remains on schedule.</p>
          <p>On Elgin, in March, the Elgin-Franklin complex had to be shut down because of a gas and concentrated leak on an already shut-in well. At the end of May, operator Total succeeded to close the well and stop the leak. As the top gear has been successful operations on two relief wells has been stopped. For the current year, we do not expect to have further production from the fields. Total first wants to permanently kill all three wells that had already shut in. To help you understand the developments of E&amp;P at E.ON a bit better, we have included new charts in the backup showing the volumes produced per field.</p>
          <p>We have furthermore reflected the disposal of Open Grid Europe now in our 2012 outlook.</p>
          <p>Finally there's a group of other effects amounting to around &#x20AC;150 million. Mainly these are related to the generation business. On the one hand, there's the provision we booked in our Happurg pumped-storage hydro plant. And then, we have to notice the further weakening of the conditions in our Southern European power markets.</p>
          <p>Now let me move on to the changes impacting the underlying that income where we have lifted the guidance range to &#x20AC;4.1 billion to &#x20AC;4.5 billion from the previous range of &#x20AC;2.3 billion to &#x20AC;2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Firstly, of course the increased EBITDA is a major reason for this increase. However, the size of the adjustment shows that there was more below the EBITDA line. Firstly, we have adjusted our full year depreciation for group depreciation due to the adapted volume scenario for E&amp;P, but also as a result of the Open Grid Europe disposal.</p>
          <p>Then, there is a one-off effect impacting our economic net interest position. Here we expect to release provisions, as I already commented earlier on, you've seen part of this effect in H1. Our assumption for the financial year economic net interest position has changed now to around minus &#x20AC;1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Finally, we expect to reduce tax rates mainly due to lower E&amp;P earnings and provision releases as mentioned before. This concludes my remarks at this stage and let me now hand over back to Marc.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Vincent Gilles from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I've got two very simple questions.</p>
          <p>The first one is you've developed a lot on the cost cutting and restructuring, but you didn't give us &#x2013; unless I missed it, the actual number you believe is reflected at the EBITDA level or EBIT level of the cost-cutting program. Even if it's the start. It would be interesting to see for us if it's a negative or a positive.</p>
          <p>The second thing is, if we turn to slide 21, EBITDA by units, optimization and trading, I have a swing here between 2011 and 2012 of &#x20AC;1.8 billion, of which &#x20AC;1.2 billion is gas, &#x20AC;0.4 billion is improved margin in the outright portfolio, and &#x20AC;0.2 billion is other. How can I work out or how can we work out the impact of the Statoil agreement then? Because it looks like there is no impact?</p>
          <p>I do understand you've been saying you're still probably at a loss in the gas supply business, but if you could you help us quantify. Because it looks to me that there is no improvement in the underlying business since Q1. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Welcome, Marcus. On cost cutting, the impact for the first half of this year is de minimis because &#x2013; Johannes mentioned some of the items. In particular, on the procurement side, this is still future. i.e. stuff yet to be done.</p>
          <p>And the other example that you mentioned, on shared services, we are &#x2013; as we speak, have opened the facilities in Cluj. And the first &#x2013; the transfer of the first activities actually from Sweden is scheduled for Q4 of this year.</p>
          <p>So what we really have achieved so far in terms of savings is essentially some head count reduction here at group management in D&#xFC;sseldorf, head count reduction in Munich, which actually only became effective at the end of the first half of this year. So that's why you don't see any substantial effect in the first half of this year, which is in line with what we had expected for the full year.</p>
          <p>On your second question, basically my understanding is your question is why is the &#x20AC;1.2 billion only &#x20AC;1.2 billion and not more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In substance, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x20AC;1.2 billion reflects the impact of Gazprom, which we highlighted is around &#x20AC;1 billion. And of course, there are hence also other positive effects from some of the other contract renegotiations. In particular, Statoil.</p>
          <p>And then please also don't forget that, as we reported in September of last year, we had a positive effect from some time swaps that we made, which led to some positive contribution last year. And that has caused some decline in the first half of this year, which &#x2013; hence also you have to bear in mind when you think about the profitability of this segment.</p>
          <p>So in total, we've clearly seen a substantial improvement here &#x2013; in particular, of course, from the two big items, Gazprom and Statoil.</p>
          <p>I think on the others, I think &#x2013; yeah, I think that was probably clear. The &#x20AC;0.2 billion, I mentioned that's mainly the revaluation of participations.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions please. The first one on capacity of payments or insurance in Germany. Can you please update us on the status of your discussions right now with the German authorities? What is the timing of the potential implementation of the capacity insurance in Germany on your thermal plants? And what could it look like?</p>
          <p>And the second question on chart three, please, on the left-hand side. In order to have a view on how structural your gas contract adjustments are, can you please tell us how the 2014 curve would look like under today's perspective? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the capacity regime, there is no solid discussion yet on how our capacity market environment might function. I think the majority of commentators believe that that will be done quite a few years later. And we also argued that the premature starting of a capacity market would not be helpful for anybody and cost customers a lot without helping.</p>
          <p>We are discussing with regulators and some transmission grids operators whether they're willing to put low number of station into a strategic reserve. That would mean, however, that these stations that we otherwise would close would be for a low &#x2013; for a few winters &#x2013; purely under the regime of the transmission grid, which they could not be dispersed into the market. They would only work under direction from TSOs, and we would be compensated for any cost. And that's not just variable cost, but all costs associated to this.</p>
          <p>But this is just a low number of stations. The negotiation on that is progressing, and I could well foresee that we agree with TSO and regulator on such compensation mechanism. But they would not influence markets. The capacity would be gone for the market &#x2013; would be dead for the market. And we would receive money for keeping them in such a strategic reserve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your second question, I guess you're referring to the lower left-hand graph on page three. That curve would have been marginally steeper than the one described here. And basically &#x2013; yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But far from the angle that we used to see, as Marcus said, marginally. And then we need to wait and see what markets will do. But &#x2013; so it's far from clear yet when and which side will ask for another round of renegotiations. Depending on market developments, it could be one or the other side. And the curve is not very steep.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Patrick Hummel from UBS. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is coming back on the cost savings, and thanks for the insights you shared with the presentation. I wonder, now that we are in the third quarter of 2012 &#x2013; and remembering that when you introduced the cost cut-cutting program, you said that up to &#x20AC;750 million of savings can already be achieved in 2013. Are you in a position today to give us at least the order of magnitude, where we should end up for next year?</p>
          <p>And then &#x2013; sorry, coming back on the gas contracts renegotiations from page three, can you be a bit more granular, rather than saying that the curve will be a bit steeper than &#x2013; for 2013 and the year after next &#x2013; in terms of when the next deadlines are for the contract renegotiations?</p>
          <p>I mean Gazprom is very clear. But I think the interesting part is that the smaller ones, where you said a while ago that you have the mixture of structural fixes and price reductions &#x2013; just to get a better feel when the next renegotiation dates are. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well some of these smaller contracts are already on the new settlements. And there, we look now for structural solutions. And we're progressing, so this happens while we speak. But this will be add-on into the curves that you can see.</p>
          <p>We cannot give you more insight into how steep &#x2013; how marginally more steep that will look. We will not speculate on percentage breaks here or steep numbers.</p>
          <p>And as for the cost cutting program, that &#x2013; the results in the first half are not yet so materially does not mean that we lost a lot of time. I think compared to most competitors, we are progressing, I would believe, in a very good speed.</p>
          <p>As we indicated also on the union side, we have settled most of the necessary deals and noise level has declined. Therefore, we have no new insight yet into their delivery in 2013. We will obviously look now during the <mark type="ph" /> MTP (51:07) where we precisely will come out. In some areas, we have been faster than we thought. On others, we lost a few months. But how that translates into a concrete number for 2013 will be understood in the course of midterm planning for next year budget setting. And we may be in a position to share that with you with next-quarter results, but not today yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But if I &#x2013; sorry to follow up, but if you get your right, basically there is no reason to turn structurally more positive or negative compared to the expectation you've emphasized?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon to everybody. I've just got two questions relating to some of the comments that were made by Marcus. The first is on this issue of the provision release into the interest line. I'd be very grateful if you could be a little more specific about the level of that number based on the first half and the full year.</p>
          <p>And then secondly turning to the tax issues, please could you be a little more specific around the level of provision releases into the tax line? Or if that itself is not a possibility, maybe an indication of where you expect the effective tax rate to come out at the year-end. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As you can imagine, these are always sensitive items. But to help you a bit, first, on the provision release in the interest results, we're talking about a number which is sort of around &#x20AC;200 million, &#x20AC;250 million. And you can expect the same amount because it's equally distributed throughout the year for the second half.</p>
          <p>As far as the release in provisions on the tech side is concerned, for the full year, we do expect a number which is between &#x20AC;300 million and &#x20AC;400 million in total. And it's related to the revaluation of issues basically from the past, which now have become transparent.</p>
          <p>And as far as tax rate is concerned, here clearly also our revised assumptions on the E&amp;P matter to some extent. So by now, we clearly think that overall tax rate should come out below 20%. Actually, it can be quite a bit below 20%. But tax is always the line item which is most difficult to predict, but that is as we currently see it.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And of that, I mean, what I probably &#x2013; of the overall provision release in the tax line, this typically gets distributed throughout the year according to the relative share of profits &#x2013; i.e., if the first-half of the year has 70% of the overall profit, then you would also see 70% of the provisional release in the first half of the year.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Bobby Chada from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. My first question is around the E&amp;P business. You gave some helpful details about the progress of Skarv and Elgin. Is it right therefore to assume that your prior kind of guidance or communication around expected production in 2013 is unchanged? And I wondered if you also could give us some indication of the capital employed in the E&amp;P business?</p>
          <p>And then, my second question is on Diethelm. I wondered if you could give us an update on the progress there and when you might expect commissioning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the capital employed, we check that at the minute, but then the production numbers in the E&amp;P should be a little bit down. Because if Skarv goes into operation in December, until it reaches its plateau, we'll obviously be a few months later. And in our earlier prognosis, we had hoped that the plateau would be reached as of the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>So we would lose a bit of the production in 2013 and will be delayed to later years. 2 million to 3 million BOE, Marcus just throws in as the number of delay.</p>
          <p>And as far as Diethelm is concerned, we are still &#x2013; I would say still optimistic that things in the end will work out. But we see further delays. We had hoped that the station really start to go into the production mode &#x2013; not just being productive yet, but starts to go into the process very late 2013. We will see some year delays here. And that is due to the fact that <mark type="ph" /> the cost to cost (56:47) by now have forced us to reinitiate all licenses in &#x2013; for all parts of the process. And the political election campaign last &#x2013; I see another almost year.</p>
          <p>So there will be further delays there. And we are currently doing the final assessment of what precisely it will be. But it could easily be one to two years later than we saw. But we check the economic impacts on that. But that's how it looks today.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon. Two questions, first again on the success of the gas contract renegotiations.</p>
          <p>The question is can you confirm the initial &#x20AC;200 million to &#x20AC;400 million EBITDA target for the gas supply margin? Because if I look on page three of your presentation, the chart suggests to me that it would be zero if the spreads did not improve from the current levels. And there was only a small positive margin if the gas-to-oil spread walks up to a level of roughly zero.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on the remainder of the asset disposal program, after you have walked away from this sale of E.ON Energy from Waste, how much of the remaining &#x20AC;2.5 billion target have you identified already? Or in other words, how much do the aggregated &#x2013; how much value do the regional distribution supply companies represent from your point of view? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Hello. We still have more work in progress on the disposal side than the &#x20AC;2.5 billion. So it's not that these are just covered by these regional distributors. There's more things that we are currently working on. As we always say, a little careful of sharing that, because usually doesn't help the prices. But there is significant things ongoing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know that we are working on the potential sail of three participate &#x2013; or actually three of our participations in German regional distribution companies. That will take us a long way. So the &#x20AC;15 billion is &#x2013; it will not be difficult to achieve this target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we shared that there could be more, but you need to wait for that. The profitability, obviously &#x2013; competitiveness of gas business has been &#x2013; get even harder while we renegotiate it. So the margins that you can make on top of profitable procurement has become tougher. And as obviously, we never said that the producers need to guarantee us a specific level of profitability, so we are a little more careful today as to the margin we can realize on top of breakeven. So yeah, that might be somewhat lower, but we cannot share a number yet. And the profitability needs to be created through our sales process, through retail margins and wholesale margins and obviously monetizing the embedded flexibilities in the procurement contracts. Now all of that is under some pressure. So yes, it's probably fair to say that it might be lower than the expected number, but we still work hard that is not just marginal, and &#x2013; but more we need to see while time is progressing.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Two questions, the first one on CapEx. So as of the first half, you spent &#x20AC;2.4 billion, but the full year outlook is for a &#x20AC;7 billion CapEx budget. Is it still a realistic expectation? If so, what is the bulk of that &#x20AC;5 billion targeted for? And then the second question, following up on the idea of a few stations being put aside for strategic reserve, could you confirm whether or not you're looking at closures of other stations beyond those considered for that reserve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you are absolutely right with the latter question, there might be a low number of stations that go into strategic reserve and there might be other stations that we just close for good. And there have also might be a number of stations that due to their location still can have some profitability at least for a very limited amount of time and we just go through the portfolio and all of the results will occur. We close stations for good. We put a few number into strategic reserve and some to continue for a little while before we close them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your CapEx question, yeah, I think it's &#x2013; we've seen in the prior years that we always step into a year and then try to push the units to see that we can somehow manage total CapEx to a number which is lower than what the original budget was. I think today I would say, I wouldn't rule out that we might see, to some extent, a similar development as well. But it's not going to be terribly material. But I would dare to say we should definitely not exceed the &#x20AC;7 billion mark. The bulk of the investments planned for the second half of the year continued to be on the EC&amp;R side, our wind business in particular, that's the lion's share.</p>
          <p>We also continue to have CapEx on some of the generation plants. In particular, as you know, we are working in Russia on the &#x2013; on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:03:13), but also <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:03:14) in Holland. Those are two big projects we're working on. You have the ongoing investment in all the regional distribution businesses on the grid side, which tends to be more back-ended, i.e., second half tends to always exceed first half. Don't ask me why that is always the case, but this is something that you can observe when you analyze all the prior years. And then also, we have &#x2013; we continue to see some increase in terms of CapEx on the E&amp;P side related to these Skarv projects.</p>
          <p>Those are the main items; I hope that answers your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. The first is on the outlook. You haven't mentioned 2013 and 2015 guidance. Do you reach your targets of &#x20AC;1.7 to &#x20AC;2 EPS in 2013 and &#x20AC;2 to &#x20AC;2.3 EPS in 2015. Is that your best guess from today's perspective? And the second one was on the balance sheet following S&amp;P's downgrade, just wondering whether you are happy with a minus and whether this might have any consequences on your own disposal plan, on your CapEx plan over the next few years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your first question, there are no news on 13 and 15. The numbers are still the numbers. We are now entering into our usual planning process, updating assumptions, and then we'll have to see. And you know what the basis for the outlook was that we put forward in August of last year, we disclosed the assumptions in particular as it relates to the commodity and power price environments. And of course now, things need to be updated. As far as the balance sheet is concerned, I mean, look the AMIs didn't come as a big surprise to us.</p>
          <p>As you know, we had a split rating with Moody's already being at a three. I would say short, medium-term, there are no consequences related from these downgrades because in terms of our financial profile &#x2013; or our financing profile, definitely not before the second-half of 2013 would we have any material refinancing and even then it will depend on the progress we are going to make on the disposals side and Johannes mentioned what we are working on. We also still carry a huge sketch position on our balance sheet and at this stage, we have no &#x2013; <mark type="indiscernible" /> no commercial paper drawn. So, there remains huge flexibility. CVS levels have not at all reacted to the downgrade and the bizarre rate actually came down on the day of the downgrades, but I wouldn't interpret too much into that. So, on the financing side, it means, do we like the downgrade? No, we don't. Are we surprised? No, we aren't. We continue to basically target our balance sheet ratios, our debt factor as communicated before and I think that's all that can be said to that.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. Bit of a follow-up actually on those recent questions. Firstly on the &#x20AC;2.5 billion of disposals still to come, can you give us at least some guidance, even if you don't know the exact asset as to what the financial impact would be on EBITDA from your best guess on what might be disposed of that? And then secondly on the balance sheet, with the reversals of the &#x20AC;5 billion, &#x20AC;5.5 billion of cash flows that need to come through in the second half, what is your best guess on the economic net debt at year-end. Do you expect that to improve slightly on the full year position of 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On your first question, I mean clearly, here I can only comment on the projects that we &#x2013; that are known that we are working on which is the three regional distribution companies in Germany. The total EBITDA contribution from those depending in what year you look into, ranges between &#x20AC;350 million and &#x20AC;400 million, so that would be the impact on those. As far as your second question is concerned, development of economic net debt, clearly the mid-year figures, will be lower than the mid-year figure. We will likely be slightly north of where we were end of last year, but not in a material way.</p>
          <p>The uncertainty we have here is it's quasi- impossible, for example, to predict the margining &#x2013; or the margins posted, which came out at a very high level of $900 million by midyear. We have not seen any number as high as that in any year before. That number might drop also quite quickly. So that's roughly how I would frame it. So definitely a lot lower than the $41 billion, possibly slightly higher than the $36. something that we had at the beginning of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I give it another shot. Just one question left, pension accounting or basically all for net debt and what you just guided for year and we're seeing the impact on that net debt and H1, could you give a bit more granulator or what discount rate are you to using and from that basically how high you consider the risk of obvious had the <mark type="indiscernible" /> markets, but whether there is more risk for additional pension reevaluations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you can actually find that in our interim reports, I'm trying to &#x2013; you could find it on page 39 you have the assumptions for Germany where we have lowered from a beginning or end of last year at 4.75% by 100 basis points to 3.75% and in the UK we've lowered from 4.6% to now 4.2% i.e., 40 basis points.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. good afternoon just two quick questions. Firstly, now that you have renegotiated your gas midstream volumes, I wonder and you've made some comments today about your expected earnings from this business on an ongoing basis, can you comment about the strategic importance of that business and whether this could, whether near, medium or long-term become a disposal candidate? And secondly &#x2013; why it wouldn't be? And secondly I wonder looking at the progress you are making in Brazil and so far no announcements yet on your other international expansions, whether you are still confident you can reach your 25% share of EBITDA from outside of Europe by 2015? Is it fair to say that it's going to be a stretch, and so you actually care? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually we do care, if we don't, we wouldn't reach those strategic ambitions, but I think we have already informed the market that the &#x2013; reach by 2015 will be least tangible of all our promises. That will definitely come somewhat later. And secondly since we pursue a lot of our strategies in partnerships, you will see a lot of impact more on the EPS line than fully on the EBITDA line. So we need to see if at some point we need to adapt our communication a bit too, let's say, the realities guided and the progress there is not bad as we see it. As we always do it, we will not indicate on next market entry before it's clear, but we are working hard on things and therefore there is no reason to water things down.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The strategic importance of the trading business, gas we still see as a global commodity were due to importance also on the Ukraine market and a house like ours that is one of the market leaders in trading definitely should employ and should run a quite sizeable trading business also on the gas commodity side, if it wants to be the magnitude that we used to do itself obviously quite some reasons to think about that, but that we could dispose it and not be active in the gas trading and gas wholesale business I do not see that and we have never considered disposing that business, we just married it to the overall trading activities. If we were to dispose it, wouldn't get some sense to marry it. so I would not go on with that speculation there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks for taking my follow-up questions. Basically, very briefly on the closures, I'm wondering based on today's operating environment and commodity prices and looking into 2013 E.ON free carbon anymore, are you able to give us a number how many giga watts of your generation capacity would actually be close to zero EBITDA or even EBITDA negative? Are we mostly talking about always hard coal stations are also some more than CCGT suspected? And the second question regarding the announced closures in France that you did a couple of months ago, according to media, there was a local bidder but French press states that basically this transaction won't happen. So I just wonder if you can give us an update there on the situation. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, no, we're not prepared to share on a plant-by-plant basis its profitability, so we will not speculate on which of our plants are breakeven or better or worse. We always &#x2013; only if it is closed overall numbers. Secondly, on the France situation, we're pursuing our operational strategy to close stations that are lacking profitability there. The speculation upon a viable bidder, I think we need to wait and see. Obviously, we are listening to all good proposals, but they ought to be good. And I have not yet seen any of that quality yet.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, final question, are you able to comment what the implications could be from that potential practice from the door, nuclear plant in Belgium? Are there potential risks here? <mark type="ph" /> Definitely (01:15:03) if it's not operational in terms of cost or what the other issues you might identify from that issue?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>To the best of our knowledge today, there is &#x2013; none of us stationed at operational &#x2013; is impacted in Germany. So there, we &#x2013; so we don't see any result from this and the Swedish stations are being checked but none of the ones that we are operating is impacted also in Sweden. So for stations we do not operate, we don't have final insiders today and you know that we are co-owners in Sweden, some, and some co-owners in Germany. But in Germany, I think I would know. I don't think there is any impact and in Sweden at least I have not yet been informed of any impact, so I'm not speculating on that and I think it's a problem elsewhere at this point.</p>
