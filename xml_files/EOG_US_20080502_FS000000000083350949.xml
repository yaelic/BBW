          <p>Good day everyone and welcome to the EOG Resources 2008 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Mark Papa. Please go ahead sir.</p>

          <p>Good morning and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2008 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call.</p>
          <p>This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. The SEC permits producers to disclose only proved reserves in their securities filings. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast including those for the Barnett Shale and North Dakota Bakken plays may include other categories of reserves. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to US investors that appear at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website. An updated Investor Relations presentation and statistics were posted to our website last night.</p>
          <p>With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior EVP Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP Operations; Bob Garrison, EVP Exploration; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>We filed our 8-K with second quarter and full-year 2008 guidance yesterday. These forecasts were consistent with the details provided at our recent analyst conference and I'll discuss them in a minute, when I review operations. I'll now review our first quarter net income available to common stockholders and discretionary cash flow and then I'll provide an operational overview. Tim Driggers will then discuss capital structure and I'll close with a gas macro overview and a summary.</p>
          <p>As outlined in our press release, for the first quarter EOG reported net income available to common stockholders of $241 million or $0.96 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP net income available to common stockholders, to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and to exclude the impact of the Appalachian property sales as outlined in the press release. EOG's first quarter adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $473 million or $1.89 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOGs EPS for the first quarter was $1.1 billion or $4.40 per share.</p>
          <p>I'll now address our strategy and operational highlights. Our 2008 strategy can be divided into three elements. First, we want to deliver 15% total company production growth in 2008 and be set up to deliver similar organic growth again in 2009 and 2010 with a gradual shift towards more liquids production. As indicated by our first quarter results and our guidance 8-K, I believe we're on track regarding the 2008 volume target and we're well set up for 2009 and 2010.</p>
          <p>Regarding our shift to more liquids production, our first quarter total liquids increased 38% versus last year, so this shift is occurring as we've predicted. Second, we'd like to maintain our 2008 CapEx excluding acquisition at or near our original $4.4 billion estimate and use any free cash flow to further strengthen our balance sheet. We started the year with a 14% net debt to total cap ratio and based on our hydrocarbon price expectations we'll likely end the year at a much lower ratio. And third, we intend to continue looking for new resource plays often using horizontal drilling. As I articulated in our recent analyst conference, I believe this is the future of the onshore E&amp;P business and EOG wants to capture as many of these new plays as possible using our early mover advantage.</p>
          <p>Today, we've disclosed a new horizontal resource play that we've captured in the Mid Continent. We've now drilled 17 horizontal wells in the Atoka Formation in the Texas Panhandle and feel sufficiently comfortable on the technical side to declare that we've captured a net 400 Bcf potential. Similar to the process for horizontal success that we reported at our February analyst conference, we've been testing this play and acquiring acreage for the last two years. The typical well cost is $3.4 million for 2 Bcf of net reserves. These wells typically have initial production rates of 4 to 7 million cubic feet a day. We currently have 60,000 net acres here.</p>
          <p>I'll now provide some brief highlights regarding some of our other plays. I'll remind everyone that at our analyst conference we noted that most of our recently announced resources base won't begin to have a volume impact until 2009 or in the case of British Columbia likely 2011, primarily because of infrastructure issues. Therefore our 15% 2008 total company organic volume growth is being generated with essentially no contribution from our new horizontal plays, which shows the strength of our base portfolio.</p>
          <p>I'll start with the Barnett gas. We are in track to hit our 470 MMcfe per day average 2008 production target and our year-to date results are consistent with those shown in late February. We're still drilling excellent wells in Johnson County and are in a manufacturing process with a 17 rig drilling program there. In the Western and Hill Counties we're running five rigs and have evolved to essentially a manufacturing process there as well. In short, everything is on track regarding Barnett gas development.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Barnett oil play in Montague, Clay and Archer Counties, we noted at our analyst conference that we need to construct a gas processing plant and related oil and gas pipeline infrastructure before we can ramp up volumes. This work is underway and we expect that this infrastructure will be in place by early 2009. In the mean time we're continuing to drill and further optimize our frac technology to determine the optimum stimulation for this oil reservoir. We have determined that you can't simply take a Johnson County frac and apply it per se to the oil play.</p>
          <p>We recently completed four new horizontal wells in Montague County. The Billy Henderson 2H and 3H, the Key Machine at 1H and the Sockwell 2H and all are producing similar to the model well outlined in February, i.e. initial rates of 150 to 350 barrels of oil per day with between 500 and 1 million cubic feet a day production of rich gas yielding a 65% direct after tax reinvestment rate of return. It's too early to provide definitive answers regarding well spacing, drainage radii and recovery factors, but I expect we'll have more clarification regarding these items in early 2009.</p>
          <p>For the rest of this year, we'll be working on optimizing the well completions, adding more acreage and installing our infrastructure. In British Columbia, we continue to feel very good about the Horn River Basin shale play but we don't have any new UG well test data beyond that disclosed in February. We plan to drill and complete several additional wells in 2008 to further define the potential of the play. With a focus on costs, we plan to run our completion operations in the summer months. We expect to commence first sales from this asset this summer when pipeline infrastructure is complete but we'll note that available pipeline capacity is low, about 40 million cubic feet a day, and we don't expect significant volume growth from this asset until 2011, when a more robust pipeline infrastructure is available.</p>
          <p>Similarly our Colorado North Park Basin oil play won't have a volume impact of any significance until 2009. We're currently drilling an offset to our discovery well and by early 2009, we'll likely know whether this is a 10 million or an 80 million barrel net asset.</p>
          <p>Our Mississippi Chalk Play which we also highlighted in the analyst conference will also be primarily a 2009 and later impact item. Our A grade North Dakota Bakken development is proceeding as anticipated and is still averaging 100% direct after tax reinvestment rates of return. We're consistently making very good wells. The Austin 8-26H well that was completed at the end of February had an initial production rate of 3,060 barrels of oil per day. Recently, we completed the Austin 6-15H well that had an initial production rate of 3,630 barrels of oil per day. These are the two best wells in the field today and I will note that those are probably two of the best wells in recent history in the Bakken play in North Dakota as an entirety.</p>
          <p>Within the Parshall Field, very strong initial production rates are now routine similar to our frequency of monster wells in Johnson County. The more drilling we do the more confident we are regarding our net 80 million barrel reserve estimate for this asset. The upside to this estimate will be determined in three possible ways. First, by extending the field limit through step-out drilling, second by possible 320 acre downspacing and the third by secondary recovery. The field is currently being drilled on 640 acre spacing and we're currently completing our first 320 acre downspace well. We'll need several months of production history from the well in order to determine the impact to any increase in reserve recovery versus acceleration. I expect that by year-end we'll have a definitive idea regarding the Bakken reserve stock.</p>
          <p>On the facilities side, we just commissioned our first EOG gas processing plant to handle the associated gas volumes and we expect to see increasing natural gas liquid volumes from the Bakken throughout the second half of the year. For brevity, I won't provide well-by-well by details regarding the plethora of other plays that are contributing to the 15% production growth in 2008 except to say that these plays ranging from the Uinta Basin to South Texas are obviously contributing their part, because the new plays won't have a volume impact until 2009 and beyond.</p>
          <p>I'll also note the 15% growth is not a pro forma number. We expect to hit this absolute target without adjusting for our first quarter Appalachian sales. Likewise, our Trinidad asset is performing as expected and we're still on track for a 60 million a day net volume increase in early 2010. In the North Sea, we won't be active during 2008 but we have a 3 to 5 will exploration program scheduled for 2009.</p>
          <p>Additionally we're in the process of finalizing an acquisition from ConocoPhillips relating to a tight gas sand asset in the Sichuan Basin onshore China. This is an asset that EOG owned back in the late 1990s before we became a fully independent public company. We will be partnering with PetroChina again and we have received the necessary approval from the Chinese Ministry of Finance and Commerce. Transaction was funded during the second quarter and is expected to close this summer. We're acquiring 130,000 acres and 7 million cubic feet a day of net production. This asset is analogous to our South Texas Wilcox sandstone where we've unlocked about 0.5 Tcf with horizontal drilling. We believe horizontal technology is applicable to the Sichuan Basin sandstones, but it will probably be late 2009 before we know whether it truly works in this area. Strategically this fits with our goal of adding an international asset that is amenable to horizontal drilling in an energy short part of the world.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to review CapEx and capital structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mark. For the first quarter 2008, total exploration and development expenditures including asset retirement obligations were $1.122 billion with $29 million of acquisitions. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $88 million. Capitalized interest for the quarter was $9.4 million.</p>
          <p>At quarter end 2008, total debt outstanding was $1.185 billion and the debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 14%. At March 31, non-GAAP net debt was $980 million, for a net debt-to-total cap ratio of 12%. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 35% and the deferred tax ratio was 65%.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter 2008 we repurchased the remaining $5 million of our preferred stock. We no longer have any preferred stock outstanding. Yesterday, we filed a Form 8-K with second quarter and full-year 2008 guidance and our updated hedge position.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2008, the 8-K has an effective tax range of 32 to 36% and a deferral percentage of 55 to 75%. Using the midpoint of the updated 8-K guidance, our full-year 2008 unit cost, re-leasing wells, DD&amp;A, G&amp;A, total exploration, net interest expense and excluding transportation and taxes other than income were forecast to increase only 2% over 2007.</p>
          <p>With our current hedge position as outlined in yesterday's 8-K filing, for every $0.10 change in Henry Hub EOG's 2008 net income and cash flow is impacted by approximately $20 million. Similarly for every $1 move in WTI EOG's 2008 net income and cash flow is impacted by approximately $10 million.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it back to Mark to discuss the gas macro, hedging and his concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Tim. Regarding the North American gas macro we think prices will remain strong throughout the year, because overall 2008 net supply growth will be essentially flat with 2007 while demand growth will be up about 1 Bcf a day. Given the flat overall net supply and current storage, we think that November 1st storage levels may only reach about 3.3 Tcf which will be a bullish signal for 2009 gas prices.</p>
          <p>For me the most intriguing piece of this equation relates to LNG import levels. To date this year we've noted that non-US LNG demand is significantly stronger than most people would have predicted a year ago. Is this the harbinger for stronger than predicted non-US LNG demand in 2009 and later periods? We now know that LNG import terminals are being constructed or considered in Argentina, Kuwait, Dubai, Chile and Brazil. A few years ago no one would have predicted that these countries would have been importing LNG. This critical area of non US-LNG demand growth I believe is something we'll need to watch closely because this demand growth continues to surprise on the upside then that's a bullish sign for North American long-term gas prices.</p>
          <p>Our 2008 and 2009 financial hedge position has only slightly changed since our February analyst conference, in that we added a few more 2009 gas hedges in late April. For the period June 1st through December 31st, 2008 we're about 30% hedged regarding North American gas at an 8.52 price. For 2009, we're about 24% hedged at $8.80. For the period May 1st through December 31st, 2008 we have about 28% of our total company oil hedged at $92.19, no oil hedges beyond 2008. At some point, we may consider adding more 2009 gas hedges.</p>
          <p>Now, let me summarize, in my opinion there are five important points to take away from in this call. First, we are on track to deliver our estimated 15% total production growth in 2008 while further de-leveraging an already under-levered balance sheet. Assuming the futures market is indicative of actual prices then we may end the year with a net debt to total cap ratio below 5%.</p>
          <p>Second, there is no change to our reserve or production estimates regarding the new horizontal plays we disclosed in February, also further refinements regarding the reserve side of these plays will likely be an early 2009 event.</p>
          <p>Third, using our early mover advantage in horizontal resource plays, we continue to place a high focus on identifying and capturing new acreage and accumulations. Several of the new ideas we are working on involve oil as opposed to gas accumulations. Today's disclosure regarding the 400 net Bcf Mid Continent Atoka play underlies our continued focus in this area. Additionally, we plan to apply our horizontal drilling and completion expertise to China.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we expect that our unit cost will be pretty well controlled this year allowing us to maintain our position as a low cost company. And fifth because of the low front end cost associated with our early mover advantage we expect to continue to generate peer group leading ROCEs in 2008 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Thanks for listening and now we'll go to Q&amp;A.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll go first to Brian Singer at Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wanted to focus on the Bakken with the two wells you talked about and the very strong results there. I know you still need a few more months or through the rest of the year to fully finalize what the resource potential is, but can you add any more color on what you think those rates mean when looking, when thinking about recovery rates or thinking about how far the play extends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I guess what I would say at this point Brian is that what we've seen from the drilling that was done to date in the play is a pretty surprising amount of consistency in terms of pretty much in both the north, south, east and west parts of the play that we've drilled, all have very, very strong wells. Now these Austin wells that we've highlighted that IP'd at over 3,000 barrels a day, they're towards the north end of our accumulation. And we've now got a group of I guess about 4, 5 of these Austin wells that are uncommonly strong I'd say. But the surprising thing to me has been that there is a pretty good degree of uniformity in this accumulation that in other words there's not, the north end isn't dramatically greater than the south end although it's slightly better.</p>
          <p>In terms of expectations and I know there is a lot of expectations out there regarding what's going on with our downspacing well and so on and so forth. What I'd say is we, frankly we just need some time to evaluate this. As I mentioned, we're drilling our first 320 acre downspacing well. In fact it's being completed as we speak, but kind of regardless of what the initial rate is on that well as a reservoir engineer that's not going to mean a whole lot to us. What's really going to mean more to us or what are the pressures in the well and then what does the well look like after three or four months of production and has that affected the rates from the surrounding wells. I will say also that we're taking a hard look at secondary recovery here. In other words our estimate of recovery factors in this reservoir, the 80 million barrels correlates to about a 10% recovery of oil, and in most oil accumulations you can get considerably more than that by a secondary recovery program. So, we'll be evaluating that throughout the year, but I would really just advise everybody to expect that the next meaningful update we have regarding the size of that accumulation is probably going to be in early 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. Taking a step back when you look at the various oilier as in terms of extending your technology, how vast do you think that potential is and how price sensitive is it when considering where oil prices have come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, I'd say that the oil potential for horizontal drilling is large but not as large as for gas. We're taking a page from the same playbook that we used for gas and we're looking for what we call basin-centered accumulations, areas where oil-prone source rocks have been matured to the oil level but not to the gas level and that does occur in several basins, probably a half a dozen basins around the US where encapsulated tight rocks can be accessed with horizontal drilling. And we have a number of those kind of plays on our plate right now that we're maturing from the stages of generation to capture and we'll talking about those in subsequent quarterlies I'm sure. But just in summary I'd say that I think the oil potential out there is substantial and we are moving in that direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, kind of, just to give you a little more color on that Brian, we always have in our closet an inventory of potential horizontal resource plays, that's kind of our little cheat sheet list which we never disclose to analysts until they're actually technically proven but our current cheat sheet list about 50% of the ones on that list are oil and the other half are gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then any sense on price sensitivity, are these projects that when you're considering you're going to need, or what oil price do you think we generally need for our?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frankly at any oil price over about $70 a barrel, these things work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next, we'll move to Gil Yang at Citi Investment Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Sort of following along Brian's question about the Bakken and maybe more philosophically, at the meeting Loren, we talked a little bit about your returns. The Bakken returns are 100% plus given that at some point downspacing would result in smaller wells, the trade-off would be that you'd get the higher volumes at smaller wells and smaller returns. How far down the returns curve would you be willing to downspace to, would you, if you get to 40% returns and downspace in the Bakken, would you be willing to go that far, or would you want to keep it at some higher level rate of return?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Gil, I guess the best way I'd look at that is, we're looking at the downspacing in conjunction with secondary recovery. In other words, pumping some fluid into these wells, and if we technically conclude ultimately that this reservoir is amenable to secondary recovery then the downspacing is kind of a fait accompli, it will happen. But you really can't flood this reservoir on 640 acre spacing. So I would say that we'll be looking at the downspacing. The downspacing if you just ran it on acceleration economics probably it's going to look pretty good, but what we need to sort out is how much incremental oil could we really recover with that. But I would tend to have people focus on, I think the key question that we have to answer in the sell side, buy side should focus on is, is this reservoir amenable to secondary recovery and then the downspacing will be part of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my question is really what's the interpretation of the word amenable, if you could do it at &#x2013; if you could downspace in secondary recovery at 40% rate of return, is that amenable or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair. And second question on China, can you give us an idea of the gas price you'd expect under current market conditions there to receive out of that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The current situation we have in China is this acquisition is funded, it's essentially a done deal but it hasn't technically legally fully closed. And so until that occurs, we're really under some confidentiality provisions that we can't give any other color other than we provided, Gil. So, I know that's not the satisfactory answer, but likely on the next earnings call we'll be able to provide the color that people want regarding China.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. Mark in terms of the Bakken, are there any other opportunities to branch out further there and get more acreage, would it be your desire to do so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe we currently have I think 320,000 net acres in the entire Williston Basin and the field that we always talk about Parshall Field including those 3,000 barrel a day Austin wells really only comes to about 110,000 of those 320,000 acres. So the answer to your first question is absolutely yes, we believe that there are other prospective areas in the Williston Basin, that we have currently leased and will be testing in the future for oil prospects. And we are continuing to lease in the Parshall area that's a pretty hard thing to do but other parts of the basin where exploration prospects are available we are accruing acres currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay that's helpful. And then could you give comments on the dynamics for costs these days. A lot of operators are talking about drilling and completion costs flattening out here, are you seeing the same thing and could you give us some color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes for the first quarter here we've probably seeing through cost reductions and improved efficiencies lowering our cost about 5% overall. But with tubular costs increasing, fuel costs being higher we are seeing that we'll probably give that up overall through the balance of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you comment on fracture stimulation costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stimulation costs have not gone up for us. As a matter of fact in the Barnett area there are some surplus frac equipment and we're seeing being pretty flat elsewhere. Another thing that you'll remember we have in place is vendor agreements through the year 2008. So they're staying flat for EOG.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you and then on China, I know you talked about comparing that to the Wilcox play in South Texas. And you mentioned 0.5 Ts net to you, is it similar in size net to you as well, and can you comment on the potential size net to EOG?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the 0.5 Ts is what we think we've captured in South Texas. It's really got nothing to do with the China and we really can't provide a China number probably until the next earnings call Joe.</p>

          <p>Hi, Mark.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Ben.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a quick question about the Appalachian. Obviously there has been a lot of talk about the Marcellus Shale. You've obviously just exited the Appalachian. Have you taken a look at that and do you have any interest in that, or do you think the quality of the shale is not as good as other stuff you're seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ben we've talked about the Marcellus some in the past, and really our position there hasn't changed. We currently have about 230,000 net acres primarily in Pennsylvania and primarily in Northwestern Pennsylvania. We did sell our shallow production in the Appalachians, but we maintained our deep rights under those leases. So, currently as I said we're at about 230,000 acres, we've drilled a total of probably 9 wells out there, 4 of those are horizontal. And we plan to drill another probably 5 wells in the balance of the year. Some of which would be vertical. Some of those would be on 100% EOG land, some will be in combination with Seneca Resources on the large JV that we've entered into with them in Northwestern Pennsylvania. I'd say we're encouraged by the results that we hear announced by others in the play. Our own results have come fairly slowly. When we get our new rigs there in middle of May we hope to accelerate those results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you give us an indication of IPs that you've had on the wells, you've drilled the horizontals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not really prepared to release any IPs at this point. I think I would say that the numbers that are being thrown around in the industry there, 2.5 Bcf a well seem a little strong to us. Our own modeling of our own test results would indicate more like 1.5, maybe as much as 2 Bcf a well, which is still going to be quite strong economically. We hope and expect the play will work, although we do believe that the volumes are going to come on fairly slowly from that play, both for us and for industry as a whole mainly due to just logistical reasons, a lot of topography, a lot of regulatory work, a lack of people and equipment, that kind of thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On a separate topic, historically you've had sort of better returns on your assets within the US than outside the US, specifically Canada, Trinidad, the UK. With China, what's sort of leading you to increase the international expansion at another country and it appears as though that that money would be better spent at home or are you limited in terms of how much you can grow and do in the US?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I would say Ben, I'm not sure I'd agree with kind of the predicate of your question there. We look at returns in terms of what kind of after tax reinvestment rate of return that we've gotten on our money that we've spent there. And we're very happy with the returns we've gotten in all three of those areas, Trinidad, Canada and the UK over time. And they have been generally quite comparable to the returns we've gotten in certainly in the US, except maybe for the last year when US gas prices went up. The idea in China is one that, where we've looked at areas where there is an energy-short part of the world. We believe that this onshore horizontal technology is going to be amenable to places outside North America in uncovering pretty substantial pools of hydrocarbons. And what I'd say on the reinvestment return in China is that, if it works we expect it to be comparable to some of our other investments in the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And just lastly a quick one, there's been some talk about sort of Eastern European type gas basins, been some gas particularly around Ukraine. Is that another area you've taken a look at or do you see Eastern Europe in the horizon for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Specifically, the Ukraine no we're not looking there mainly just because of political issues but we are looking a bit in some portions of Eastern Europe, although not that far east. Whether we come up with something, don't know but I would say that there are parts of Europe that are on our radar screen. And somebody is probably going to find some substantial basin centered gas accumulations that are amenable to horizontal drilling in those areas.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I had a question on the comments of defining the Bakken north, south, east and west, that is in that 110,000 acre area of consistency around partial not the 320,000 acres, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's correct David. Yeah, we've got what I'd call other ideas on acreage outside that 110,000 acres and we'll likely be testing some of those in the second half of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as you think about secondary recovery, what would be a barrier or a reason why it wouldn't work in the Bakken?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean the two biggest potential reasons are that one, if this thing is, if we deem that it has in situ a high degree of fractures &#x2013; natural fractures, that's a barrier. And then the second reason is kind of the converse, if we deem it that it's got just shockingly low permeability that would be a barrier. On the positive side in a typical oil reservoir and I'm saying a typical sandstone or so you'll usually get something like 15 or 20% on primary recovery, of recovery of the oil in place. And in this rock we're only dealing with 10%. So we've got 90% of the oil that we're not going to get out as it stands now and that's a pretty big prize for us to chase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a relative permeability to oil versus relative perm for water issues that you've identified or no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're just looking at all that stuff now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably too soon to comment really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just going to the Atoka you talked about 60,000 net acres and 400 Bcf. Is that, what's your growth acreage there, ability to continue to expand that? Is that a concentrated area or and then spacing assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I guess, I mean the rough spacing assumption there is a well every 320 acres.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this particular zone is pretty thin so it's not obvious that we'll be able to come back to you in a few months and say wow we can double that and go to 160 acres. But I'd say on adding incremental acreage we've got a chance to take that 400 net Bcf up to a number probably like maybe 600 maybe 700 net Bcf.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so how much money are you going to spend for additional leasing this year now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the total number that we have I think we released in the 10-Q last night for all of our leasehold acquisitions for this year is about 360. And really we'll stay pretty close to that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, you don't think that leasing is going to be something that has an up tick in your overall $4.4 billion budget?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if it is does, it will likely be balanced by other down ticks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then final question as everybody wants to know about Bossier and Haynesville shales. Can you talk about anything you're doing in Louisiana, Texas trying to test the shales and source there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say we've got a position of about 63,000 net acres in that play area. We do not intend to drill any Haynesville horizontal wells this year. We're just going to take a wait and see attitude and see if that play develops and comes to us. But we have not that much data ourselves, we really can't shed much light for you David on the efficacy of the overall play.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. A quick question here on the Bakken for you guys. I'm trying to get a sense of how many wells you've drilled so far and what's in the budget for number of wells to drill in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our total number to date on the Bakken completed wells is about 38. And I think the total number for the year, those are gross wells by the way, on a net well basis for the total year we're looking at 50 I believe. For the gross, that's probably going to be in the mid-70s, is that right Gary?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Quick question on your Northeast BC play up there. How long have you had your three wells up there on production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are not on production. The wells that we have were just extended slow tests that we did during the winter. Our first production is going to commence this summer. So, we'll have those wells on production plus probably one or two others that we're currently drilling.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess would you guys probably anticipate stepping up your drilling there in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah the logic path there is that we've got 40 million a day of available pipeline capacity and we'll drill enough wells to fill that up in the relatively short-term. And then it's probably going to be about an 18-month period to loop that pipeline to allow us to have a significant step up in capacity. So if you kind of play all that out, it translates to maybe mid 2010 before we're really going to have enough pipeline take away to really see a big volume ramp up there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last question here on the Barnett, just curious what you guys are seeing these days in terms of EURs on your western county extension wells as well as costs out there and what you guys are seeing in Hill County in terms of costs in EURs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah in terms of the western counties, we would still stay with the number that we've been kind of quoting for the last year which is about 1 net Bcf per well in the western counties. And the well costs out there are running, oh, probably $1.5 million or so in terms of that. In terms of Hill County, the reserves there look considerably stronger, I would say probably 2.25 Bcf wells is kind of what we're seeing. We're seeing a little bit different set of characteristics in Hill County in that the wells don't come on at the kind of monster initial rates like in Johnson County, but they don't decline at the very high rates that the rest of the Barnett does. We're really completing in a different facese of the Barnett there and so what we get are wells that have initial production rates of maybe 2, 2.5 million a day, but they're relatively flat as far as declines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hey Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Mark I wanted to get your thoughts on the recent 914 data. I appreciate your earlier macro comments but I mean you've got 10.5% year-over-year growth. Is this I guess running the risk of oversupply in the future and how is it likely to impact your hedging strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, our current forecast, we're expecting production to be up somewhere in the range of maybe 3.5% this year for domestic production. That's certainly at odds with the monthly EIA data, although I think the EIA's annual forecast is like 3.0% growth is what they're officially forecasting for '08 versus '07.</p>
          <p>I would interpret, I just flat do not believe that we're seeing for full year anything close to the range of 10% growth. I've always felt that the EIA data consistently overstates production growth, but I do think that this sea change relating to horizontal drilling in gas reservoirs has pretty well put us on a path where we're going to see something like maybe 2 to 3.5% annual production growth in the US in '08, '09 and 2010 is the forecast for the three years. So I think that the sea change with horizontal drilling has changed this from an industry that could barely keep production flat in the US, to one that we will have production growth in the US for the next several years at least in my opinion.</p>
          <p>I also think that once we get a little more flush production coming out of the offshore field that's currently off-line, I think that we're going to see some pretty sharp declines in that 8 Bcf a day from the Gulf of Mexico probably beginning to manifest itself by the third or fourth quarter of this year. Because at the level of rigs that are currently running in the Gulf of Mexico, that's a recipe for some pretty sharp declines that are going to occur. So we will have a counterbalance effect I believe in the Gulf of Mexico to this onshore growth.</p>

          <p>Thanks for that. On the same theme of government studies, I wanted to jump over to the Bakken and ask you about the USGS study indicating multi-billion barrel potential, what are your thoughts on that? You commented earlier on your &#x2013; what you thought the price environment would need to be going forward. Are there issues outside of the partial area in order to achieve that sort of number or come anywhere close to it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the study that the USGS did is quite well founded technically. Mr. Pilastro did a really good job of estimating reserves in the Barnett a couple of years ago. Maybe that will turn out to be a little bit light in the Bakken. I think he has taken a good approach in that he has looked at it as a basin-centered oil accumulation which is correct we believe, covering a very large area although it is relatively thin. So the number that he comes up with, I think his midpoint number is maybe 3.7 billion barrels of oil recoverable is fundamentally technically correct, but perhaps not economically extractable. And I think because he assumes that the entire cell will work to the tune of maybe 25,000 total locations, wells to be drilled. That's where we think it's perhaps a little optimistic. The cell may not be intact. The basin centered oil cell may not be intact over that entire area by our thinking. Portions of it, perhaps large portions of it may not be economic, because the cell has been partially breached, and so you may have water issues in some areas. And also there will be variations. Parshall is such a sweet spot because of fracture density in the faces of the rock and that will probably not be true in very many other places within the Williston Basin. So in summary I'd say that the overall number is not incorrect, it's just perhaps optimistic.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us a feel for what your Barnett gas volumes are doing outside of the NGL impact in the western extensions? Or in generally just gas volumes quarter-over-quarter and then sequentially and year-over-year I should say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't want to get into, we got stung two three years ago on giving quarterly volumes on Barnett where one quarter it was less than what the analysts expected and our stock got dinged. So we've gotten away from giving quarterly expectations and we just have that number of 470 million cubic feet a day equivalent.</p>
          <p>I'll say that between the, what we call Johnson County and then the western counties, both of them are pretty consistently on track for our forecast to hit those numbers. We have a huge backlog currently of wells in Johnson County to complete. And so what we expect to see is the second half of the year we're going to see a more of an up tick in the Barnett kind of in growth than we saw in the first half of the year mainly just due to us clearing out some of the backlog of these huge number of wells that we haven't yet completed.</p>
          <p>The issue we've run into there and this is the longer, more detail than you probably want, is we batch drill and complete these wells and if we have at lease where we think we can drill 8 or 9 horizontal wells at 35 acre spacing roughly each, what we'll do is we'll drill all those wells, we won't produce any of them initially and then we'll come back and we'll frac all those wells one after another without producing any of it. And so then when we turn on the production when it does come on it's kind of like a batch of say 12 or 15 wells at one shot. And in Johnson County a lot of those wells come on at 6 million a day or so. So our production is kind of lumpy or so, but the overall point I'd make is we're going to deliver by the end of the year the annual average that we promised at the analyst conference, and we're on track to do that.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me delve into what you said on the detail. If you talk about the backlog, is it pipeline capacity, is it gathering, is it processing, is it service equipment? I mean it's not unique to EOG, others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really none of those, David. It's not a logistical backlog and waiting on compressors or pipelines. It's really just our people availability backlog to complete say 16 wells back to back to back to back, and then get them online. So it's more, if there is any backlog, it's, we've only got so many people and we can only run so many frac spreads out there to supervise them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair. Then let me ask you one more question, it's on the gas side. Obviously you have some growth in the Barnett on the oil side, but big picture macro, lot of talk about when the Barnett starts to &#x2013; when that growth decelerates and it starts to flatten out and/or stabilize. When do you think that happens industry wide?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's my feeling that happens in about 2010. I really believe that by year-end 2009, Johnson County is going to be pretty well drilled up, by everybody in Johnson County not just EOG. It's being drilled like a pin cushion now because it's such a sweet spot. And I think you'll see a shift about 2010 to more companies focusing on the western counties, but the issue with the western counties are you're basically drilling one net Bcf well out there that doesn't have the volume impact. And I think in the core area the same thing is happening there. So I do not expect that we're going to have another 5 or 7 consecutive years of the year-over-year macro Barnett growth that we've seen in the last couple of years.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Wayne Cooperman at Cobalt Capital.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys, just kind of big picture question just on get a view on gas prices. It looks like production is starting to ramp up again and just was wondering if you guys had a thought about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I kind of talked to that earlier. I guess it's my sense that clearly domestic gas production is rising but it's not rising as much as the EIA raw gas data would indicate. And by our calculations, I think it's going to be a pretty good race to get to 3.3 Tcf in storage and to get above that it's going to be a pretty good pace. So, we feel pretty good about 2008 gas prices.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2009 to some degree is going to be a function of whether we start storage at 3.3 or say at 3.6.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think that as people factor in their supply demand numbers for 2009 and '10, we need to factor in that there will be maybe 2.5, 3% production growth from the US in '9 and '10 primarily due to horizontal drilling applicability to resource plays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But in your intelligence would you say 2.5 to 3% is sort of the net supply growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This year it may be more like 3.5. I don't believe it's going to be &#x2013; it's not 10, some of that EIA data is inferring, in my opinion.</p>
