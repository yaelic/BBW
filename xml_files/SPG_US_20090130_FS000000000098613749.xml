        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you for joining us today.</p>
          <p>As I stated in our release this morning, our fourth quarter performance was strong.  We reported funds from operations of $1.86 per share, up 5.7% over the prior year.  For the full year, FFO was $6.42 per share, representing growth of 8.8%.  I'll remind you that our initial guidance for 2008 was $6.25 to $6.45, so we performed at the top end of that range despite the unprecedented turmoil in the economy and capital markets.</p>
          <p>For the &#x2013; FFO for the quarter included an impairment charge of $.07 per share for costs related to certain predevelopment projects that we are no longer pursuing, and the write down of one operating asset to its estimated net realizable value.  Also included in FFO for the year was the extinguishment charge of $.07 per share incurred in connection with the redemption of $200 million of moppers notes in the second quarter of '08.  Excluding these charges, full-year 2008 FFO per share would have been $.14 higher, or another 2.4% of growth.</p>
          <p>Occupancy in the mall portfolio was 92.4%, at year end, as compared to 93.5% last year.  In spite of the challenging conditions of 2008, mall occupancy is still very much in line with our recent historical results.  Square footage loss to bankruptcy in 2008 in our mall portfolio totaled 508,000 square feet, as compared to only 61,000 square feet in 2007.  During December, we experienced some lost occupancy as a result of certain liquidations and bankruptcy lease rejections.  During the year, occupancy was also negatively impacted by approximately 320,000 square feet of negotiated early store closings and occupancy &#x2013; temporary occupancy reductions also occurred at several properties which were under renovation or redevelopment.  Despite all that, we came in at an occupancy that is consistent with over the last few years of our results.</p>
          <p>Our Premium Outlet portfolio remains fully leased at 98.9%, and The Mills platform gained 40 basis points to 94.5%.  Premium Outlet center retail sales growth remained good, increasing 1.8% to $513 per square foot, and sales in The Mills portfolio was flat at $372 a foot, both a result of the consumer continuing to seek value in this current economic climate.</p>
          <p>Comparable retail sales in our mall portfolio were $470 per square foot, down 4.3% as compared to the year earlier period.  You will recall that our regional mall sales at September 30 were relatively flat, actually they were up 40 basis points.  The fourth quarter decline we experienced was a direct result of the unprecedented weak 2008 holiday season experienced across the U.S. and, in particular, the performance of luxury and higher end retailers.  Even with weak fourth quarter sales, please keep in mind that our 2000 sales are, in fact, in line with our 2006 year-end levels.</p>
          <p>2008 comparable property NOI for the mall portfolio increased 1%.  Comparable NOI growth was impacted by the decline in overage rent due to the weak fourth quarter retail sales, as well as higher than normal bad debt expenses as a result of tenant bankruptcies.  Comparable property NOI for the Premium Outlet portfolio increased 7.7% in 2008.</p>
          <p>Re-leasing spread for our mall portfolio was $8.02 for the year, representing a 21.3% increase, and again speaking to the fact that our leases &#x2013; our expiring leases are still below market.  And the re-leasing spread for the Premium Outlet portfolio was $12.48, representing a strong 48.8% increase, again showing that our expiring leases there are below market.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, we successfully opened two new developments, Jersey Shore Premium Outlets and Sendai Premium Outlets in Japan.  Both centers opened well-leased and projected first year returns are 11%.  Significant redevelopment projects were completed and opened at Northshore Mall in Boston; Ross Park Mall in Pittsburgh; Tacoma Mall; and Orlando Premium Outlets.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., construction continues only on two new projects: Cincinnati Premium Outlets and the second phase of Domain in Austin, Texas; and two significant redevelopment projects.  Net of construction loans already in place, our domestic development capital expenditures are expected to approximate 250 to $275 million in 2009, less than one-third of the 2008 spend, and at this point our 2010 spending is projected to be less than $50 million.</p>
          <p>Our share of 2009 international development capital expenditures is expected to approximate $120 million.  The vast majority of these expenditures will be self-funded by joint venture resources, and will require little or no equity from Simon Property Group. Currently, we do not expect to begin construction on any additional new projects or major redevelopments in 2009.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we completed seven new asset financings that raised $584 million of proceeds.  Our share was $313 million with a weighted average term of 5.7 years, and an average interest rate of 5.9% on the fixed rate financings, and a rate at year end of 2.4% on the floating rate loans.</p>
          <p>For all of 2008, Simon completed 21 new secured financings, generating $3.2 billion of proceeds, our share being $2.2 billion with a weighted average term of 5.2 years, and 5.4% on the fixed rate financings.  In addition, we issued $1.5 billion of senior unsecured bonds in May of 2008.</p>
          <p>As of December, year end, we had approximately $1.1 billion of cash on hand, including our share of joint venture cash; and our availability on our corporate credit facility of $2.4 billion.  In addition, our unencumbered portfolio generates EBITDA in excess of $1.7 billion and retail sales at those centers are approximately $500 per foot, allowing for a tremendous amount of room under all of our bank and bond covenants.</p>
          <p>We recently announced two senior management changes within the organization, both a result of retirements.  John Klein has been promoted and will oversee the Premium Outlet Portfolio's President at Chelsea.  John's career spans 23 years in the retail real estate industry and has been with Chelsea since 1995.  Mike Clarke continues to oversee the Chelsea International activities.</p>
          <p>Gregg Goodman has been promoted President of The Mills platform. In his capacity, Gregg will assume direct oversight of the leasing development property management marketing functions of The Mills asset base.  And Gregg began his career in 1985 and joined The Mills in 1994.  I believe it is a testament to the depth of our company's management team that we're able to promote from within the organization to fill these two key management positions.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to the debit end and then guidance.  First of all, as you all know, our balance sheet strategy has been a conservative one and we believe we should be especially prudent in liability management and the allocation of our capital given today's economy and uncertain capital markets.  Our projected 2009 taxable income is $3.30 per share, and we expect to maintain our dividend at the $3.60 per share throughout the 2009 level, given our taxable income.  Therefore, after much thought and deliberation, our Board decided to adjust the composition of the dividend to be 90% in common stock and 10% in cash.  If adopted for all of 2009, this change in composition would result in the retention of over $925 million of cash.  Needless to say, we have a history of strong balance sheet management and appropriate capital allocation strategy and our past accomplishment in this area should give confidence to our stockholders and all of the financial community that we have made the appropriate decision.</p>
          <p>Our current liquidity, as I mentioned before, is approximately $3.5 billion dollars.  By paying our dividends 90% in stock and 10% in cash, we increase our estimated free cash flow for all of 2009, after debt service dividends, distributions and ongoing capital expenditures, to approximately a billion-five, fortifying our company and maintaining our goal of being one of the beacons of this industry.  This decision is not made in response to the current retail environment, but a means of being conservative with our capital.  We intend to evaluate this decision each quarter, and we've also reserved the right to pay the dividend entirely in cash if conditions warrant.</p>
          <p>Today, we gave 2009 FFO guidance of $6.40 to $6.60 per share.  This range takes into account the dividend composition decision, as well as our view of current conditions, putting those in the retail real estate business.  As a result of our high quality portfolio, strong balance sheet, cost control measures, we were able to grow FFO per share of 8.8% in a very difficult operating environment, when most REITs are reporting negative earnings and no expectations for growth in 2009, which is opposite of what we are saying and what we've done.</p>
          <p>2009 will be another challenging year.  However, we're up to the task.  And Operator, we're ready for any questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  Your first question is from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a few questions.  First of all, for Rick.  Can you talk real time and tell us what you're seeing in terms of occupancy expectations for 2009, what you're seeing in terms of the lease spreads for the mall portfolio, for the outlet portfolio versus what you put up in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As David said, we are well down the road on 2009 activity.  Just to give you some numbers, in 2008 we completed 12,221,000 square feet of executed leases between renewals and new deals.  So far in 2009, we have already executed 467,000 square feet of deals, just in January, and we have another 7,786,000 square feet of new deals, downsizes and renewals in our lease process.</p>
          <p>What we're seeing is that we are very focused on dealing with the tenants across our portfolio.  We are holding our margins and our rents where we can, and that is in virtually all of our very good properties.  And where we have a tenant that we believe is in extreme financial distress, we're trying to work with them to come up with a mutually acceptable basis for maintaining their occupancy in the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just add that, as we indicated to you, we continue to believe that our comparable NOI for the mall portfolio will either be at least what the EBITDA was last year or up 1%.  And that's a pretty good testament to the resiliency of the mall portfolio.  Occupancy might come under pressure in our numbers because of the expected bankruptcies of oncoming tenants.  But even, obviously, that's been factored into our conclusion in terms of guidance.  And frankly, right now our main focus is maintaining the cash flow and increasing it.  And that's where our energy is being spent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Mike, this is Steve.  Just to add one point to Rick's statistics.  We are in the same place as we sit here at the end of January dealing with our '09 expirations as we were sitting here a year ago dealing with our '08 expirations.  We're about the same percentage through the current year expirations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so if you're looking on a full year, if you were to call it a 20% spread or slightly 20.  I mean, what's your best estimate at this point as to '09 and as you look forward to 2010, how they could compress?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think occupancies are going to come under some pressure.  I mean, there's been lots of research about how much it's going to drop.  It's not going to be anywhere near the research that I've read.  I'm happy to point that out individually in terms of who's coming up with these guesstimates.  And we clearly have lots of cushion in our market rents in terms of where our leases are rolling over.  So I think we'll maintain our spreads.  They may come, may not be $8, it may be 5, $6.  We've been outperforming in that category.  We won't back off of that.  And you know, look, occupancy will come under pressure.  I think the bottom line is we think we're going to grow our EBITDA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and before one other big picture question.  Rick, in past calls, you rattled off a list of retailers who are proactively looking for space and still growing.  Can you run through that list as it stands today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  People that we are dealing with right now that are going to be opening substantial numbers of stores in our portfolio in 2009 include Forever 21, H&amp;M, Dara, Coach.  We're still dealing with Express and opening substantial numbers of stores, Buckle, Sephora.  Just to name a few.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then last question here.  It seems like in the '90s you and your peers consolidated a lot of malls from the pension funds into the hands of yourselves and other operators.  I mean, if you look at &#x2013; not specifically focusing on GGP, but it's hard to get around that.  If you look at that entity, it could have a number of malls be sold or liquidated over time, what do you think happens to cap rates?  Do you think pension funds who had been sellers over the past decade and other institutional investors step back in to help support the cap rates, or how do you see that unfolding over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it depends who the seller is.  I think cap rates will go up for distressed sellers of quality real estate.  And I think cap rates will be a lot stickier for strong owners and they're going to want to get their value.  So I think you almost have to look at the seller to come to that conclusion.  And it's very hard to know.  I mean, I do think there will be some distressed sellers out there.  So I think that's going to create opportunities.  And I think there will be some stronger sellers that are going to wait for values to get back to kind of levels that they think are appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But are there more buyers than just three or four players?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We hope not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question will come from the line of J. Habermann with Goldman Sachs.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, here with Johan as well.  David, I want to circle back to your comments, I mean, obviously occupancy has held up well thus far in this cycle.  But just want to zero in a bit on store closings, possibly rent renegotiations; and I guess, perhaps, as you look at, sort of, in line versus anchor space, do you see any sort of weakness with one versus the other in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I think all I can tell you is that Rick and I are pros at dealing with this, in addition to our staff.  So, you know, there is &#x2013; I would say long-term we're more concerned about some of the bigger boxes than we are about some of the small shop tenants and in terms of what they present to the consumer.  But you know, look, I think in terms of how we deal with occupancy and how we deal with cash flow and you know, a lot of these are individual decisions at individual malls, you know, what the individual's mall like, what our relationship with the retailer is, what kind of other growth we can achieve from that retailer.  And you know, we deal with our retailers on a broad account basis, and there's a lot of give and take, and I will try to find a solution.</p>
          <p>I think having the portfolio we do, both in the mall business and in the other value sectors, gives us a &#x2013; given the quality, given the productivity of those centers, our financial stability, I just think gives us a great spot to be able to negotiate the right kind of deal with the retailer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in case there were big box vacancies, where would you see opportunities to fill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the best of the breed, just like in the retail real estate business, I think the best of the breed retailers are going to take advantage of opportunities, whether it's Target, Kohl's, Best Buy, Bed Bath and Beyond.  None of these guys are out of business.  They're all being extremely conservative, as we are. The fact of the matter is their opportunities are going to come from that.  They're not going to come from new development.</p>
          <p>As I said to you a year ago, I don't think anybody believed me, you know, the new development business is dead.  For a decade.  Maybe it's eight years, maybe it's not really completely dead.  Maybe I'm over-dramatizing it for effect, but the odds are there's going to be very, very little new stuff for quite some time.  And the best of the breed, the guys that we want to do business and that want to do business with us, you know, we're going to have our opportunities.  Dick's &#x2013; you know, you go down the category, there's a winner, there's guys that have the potential to win.  They want to know that they're dealing with quality real estate and a well-capitalized landlord, and we offer both, better than anybody in this industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you said, now, in the last few calls, no development for a decade.  What do you think about mall closings?  Could it encompass as much as 15 to 20% of the mall industry over this cycle?  Or is that unrealistic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say that dramatic but I do think there will be malls that will close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just maybe a question for Steve on the financing strategy.  Can you talk about the unsecured maturities this year?  Is that going to come from the line thus far; the savings, obviously, from the dividend change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Jay, our bonds have actually tightened a little bit.  But given where spreads are right now, it's unlikely in the near term that we would be an issuer in the bond market.  And so for planning purposes, we'll just use our line capacity and our cash to retire the $900 million of bonds that come due this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, you mentioned, just quickly, that you guys are percentage leased, I guess, in terms of the '09, the same level as '08.  Can you just remind us where that is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're about two-thirds done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then your same store forecast, would you say that's a worst case scenario or just as you see it today, subject to revision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's as we see it today, but with a &#x2013; through the prism of today, listen, we're just coming off the worst Christmas season that we've seen.  So there's a fair bit of guesstimating in terms of where tenant sales are and the like.  But I would tell you we feel very comfortable with that range and that the EBITDA in the mall business will be positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question will come from the line of Mark Biffert with Oppenheimer.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Rick, first question for you, on the retailers that you listed that were coming into the portfolio in '09, how many of those have come back and asked for renegotiations or concessions on what you've already negotiated prior?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, where we've got deals that were done, for the vast majority, we've been ex-prosecuting them in that basis.  A couple have come back and said, gee, we are trying to relocate our capital into tens instead of nine and we, in some instances, we have perhaps given a little more allowance but gotten more rent in exchange for that allowance.  But the deals have been holding very steady.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And added to it, what are you seeing from tenants in terms of them pulling back or trying to shrink their space where maybe their inventory levels have come down and they want to be in smaller stores?  Or how are you able to accommodate for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, it's an interesting dichotomy.  In our best malls, we are seeing very little of that.  In fact, we have tenants coming to us saying they want more space.  So it is really a mall-specific conversation, and not really one that is driven by an overarching strategy that runs across all properties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then, David, related to the change in dividend payout, how much of that is just related to the fact that you want to have more liquidity in case of discounted asset pricing at some point later in the cycle where you might want to step back in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I mean, that's in the back of our minds. But that's not at the front of our mind right now.  We are being extra &#x2013; what I can really say to you is I think we're just trying to be extra, extra conservative in terms of capital right now, primarily to deal with the unforeseen going forward.  We're very &#x2013; we feel extremely confident about our business and about where we're positioned and what we've done over the last several years.  And we've made difficult decisions.  We've zigged when others have zagged, but I think at the end of the day I'll put our track record up against any other real estate REIT in the industry.</p>
          <p>And right now we just want to be a little bit extra, extra cautious, or maybe a lot more extra cautious when you're talking about maintaining another $900 million of cash.  And we just think that's the right thing to do. This is not a permanent decision, this is a decision that will be evaluated quarterly.  Our Board is obviously very active and engaged in it.  But prudence is the better part of valor right now and I hope you would appreciate something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Steve, added to that, I'm looking at the impairment charges that you recorded during the quarter, and then looking at The Mills portfolio; seeing a number of different REITs take write downs on joint ventures and I'm just wondering how you go about looking at the joint venture with Mills and the potential for impairment at some of the underperforming centers that you have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, The Mills portfolio is performing right in line with our underwriting from our acquisition.  As you know, in December we sold the weakest asset in the portfolio, Cincinnati Mills, which we had kind of designated for sale.  We look at all of our assets on a quarter by quarter basis and run them through the tracks for an impairment analysis.  And we're very comfortable with the conclusions that we've reached.  We wrote down one, it's not a Mills asset, but a weak mall in Tennessee, so basically it's land value.  We wrote off some predevelopment projects that we're not pursuing anymore.  But nothing else on the radar screen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Great.  And then last question, Steve.  In terms of the feedback you're getting from some of your lenders, from the secured lending side as well as the unsecured, what are you hearing in terms of them with an appetite for giving capital right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean if you think about the debt side of our balance sheet, traditionally there have been four pockets of funds for us.  You know bonds, I mentioned earlier, are spreads that actually tightened but they're still at historical wide levels and you haven't seen a reissue, really, since summer of '08.  And that market is not attractive to us right now.</p>
          <p>The banks are all trying to figure out what their cost of capital is, and so while we are having discussions, there's not a lot of activity going on there.  The CMBS market is defunct for the current time and our expectation is it's going to stay that way for a while.</p>
          <p>So the one market that is out there in some sense of normalcy are the life companies.  And there is an appetite. I think one of the very interesting things that the life companies have the opportunity to do is significantly upgrade their portfolio, both in terms of quality of assets, but also quality of sponsors.  And if you think about what one of the things that probably helped the demise of the CMBS market is there was very little attention paid to who the sponsor of the asset was.</p>
          <p>So I think we will get a disproportionate share of what the open to buy is for the life companies.  We're having lots of conversations.  We're showing them assets that they may not have seen a year or two ago.  And there is clearly an appetite on their part to do more business with us.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just add, I think the tone generally is getting a little firmer, but it's not quite where it ultimately needs to be. But it's getting a little bit better.</p>

          <p>Your next question will come from the line of Lou Taylor with Deutsche Bank.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning, guys.  David or Steve, can you talk about the JV cash?  As that balance builds, how much is really freely distributable to the partners, versus you kind of need to have some cash in a venture?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Lou, in the JVs your cash on a relative basis is always going to be higher because you're holding cash in the venture for things like real estate taxes that may only be paid semi-annually or annually, where for us, on a wholly-owned consolidated property, we'll velocitize that cash because we're funding it ourselves.</p>
          <p>But there is no question that there's ample cash in the joint ventures.  We're distributing cash in almost every venture on a monthly basis right now, and attempting just like we would with corporate cash to use that as efficiently and effectively as we can.  But if you look at the gross number, obviously, a half or more is not ours because it's our joint venture partner's.  You have to be a little bit careful because more of it is going to be targeted for future obligations, whether they're real estate taxes or tenant allowances or CapEx or the like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Now, with regards to your secured debt financings, both in the JV and at the unconsolidated level, what are your expectations for excess finance proceeds coming out of those financings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, we've got about a billion dollars of mortgage debt coming due this year, and I would tell you there will be pluses and there will be minuses.  But net-net, we would expect to essentially be able to roll it over at about an even level; may come out of pocket a little bit on some, may need to de-lever a few; but we should be &#x2013; you know, we're not a company that's chased the last five or 10% of loan to value.  So as I look at the portfolio in '09, it's on the aggregate a little under 50% LTV, it's a $500 a foot and as David said we're feeling a little bit better that the market is firming a bit.  And I think within spitting distance one way or the other, we'll roll that paper over.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to &#x2013; Lou, Steve mentioned a billion.  That includes &#x2013; half of that is JV debt.  So our partner is going to be responsible, obviously, for any shortfall there.  If not, they're going to be primed to the extent of capital is required and they don't put it up when we choose to put it up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And last question's either for you, David, or for Rick.  With regards to the outlets, the sales are holding up pretty nicely.  Where's the relative strength in that portfolio, either geographically or by country, or however you slice it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the outlet business generally has &#x2013; you know, Woodbury Commons, as an example, is strong.  We started to see some &#x2013; Las Vegas was pretty good, but we're starting to see softness there. And Florida, you know, Orlando was starting to get soft.  So I mean it's not &#x2013; the outlets business has been great, Lou, but it's not immune to the economy.  I don't think anything, unfortunately, is immune to the kind of economy that we're seeing in any industry.  And people still, obviously, see a lot of reasons to go to the value-oriented centers but it's not immune.  And some of the tourist areas are starting to see a little softness there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And your next question will come from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's Quinton Valonium, here with Michael.  Just the first question, I noticed that you removed the fourth quarter same store NOI numbers.  We calculated that for the malls it was down about between 4 and 5%.  Just wondering whether you could outline what the main drivers of that were.  And secondly, given your forecast of 0 to 1% growth for next year, given than drop in the fourth quarter, I'm just wondering what gives you confidence in those numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Quinton, this is Steve.  I'll try to stay out of the weeds in describing this, but at the beginning of 2008 we were substantially enough converted to fixed CAM that we adjusted how we recognize revenue from common area maintenance payments that tenants are making as opposed to what we had done the prior year.  That gave a disproportionate impact to the fourth quarter.  We actually recognized CAM revenues earlier because we're now recognizing them when the tenant pays, as opposed to, historically, we had matched the revenues to the expense that you would do on a pro rata method.</p>
          <p>It's a long-winded explanation, but that really disproportionately impacted the fourth quarter comp NOI calculation.  You're right in that on the surface that fourth quarter comp in NOI would show down in the 4% range, but it's irrelevant because 300 of that 400 basis points was simply related to the way we adjusted the methodology and how we calculated CAM revenues.  So, be careful in looking at that headline of down 400 basis points.</p>
          <p>The 80 basis points, 100 basis points that David mentioned is more reflective of the trends and that is rolling over our rents at 20% up, we have about 10% of leases expire, that gives us 200 basis points of positive growth.  Over the course of the year, we did get about a 50 basis point positive impact from CAM, both through cost control and our ongoing conversion to fixed CAM.  And then that was offset by the weakness, as David mentioned, in percentage of overage rents as well as higher bad debt expense.  So don't put credence into the fourth quarter number, and really look at the overall trend for the year in that 1% range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So you're basically saying that it would only be down about 1% if you took that impact out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.  If you normalize the way we accounted for CAM in the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter comp NOI in the mall business would have been down about 100 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's a function of overage rent and -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And bad debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And bad debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mostly overage rent in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But that's going to accelerate into next year as well.  You've got to assume that if sales trends continue to go the way they are, the overage trends will continue to get squeezed, you'll have increased vacancy.  You'll be able to still have positive mark-to-market, but I got to assume the same headwinds that affected you during this year where you were able to eke out the 80 basis points positive, but sort of take in more toward the lower end or even negative same store.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Michael, we feel confident about what we've told you.  It's flat to 1%.  We have work to do.  We're pretty good at what we do.  We have leases that will roll over.  We're still making leases, we're watching our costs.  So we don't think our bad debt will be as bad as it was in '08.  We'll work hard to achieve what we've just explained to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there anything, Rick, maybe on the leasing strategy, when you look at your lease rollover on page 19 of the supp, it looks like you took out about a million square feet of the 2009 roll, but 2010 went up by about 400,000 square feet.  So, I don't know if that was just short-term extensions of the leasing that was completed or what was rolling in '09.  Just trying to get a little more clarity on the color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In some instances, we are doing short-term, one-year renewals because, frankly, we want to keep a tenant in occupancy but we also want to preserve our optionality because we believe we're going to have a better pricing market in '10 than perhaps we had in '09.  And we did not want to tie in, for longer term, rents that we believe are not optimal for that space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you look at that 400,000 square feet, what sort of &#x2013; was there an abundance of certain tenants and what were you able to eke out in terms of rents on that space?  Are they paying a higher rent for a one-year lease, or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I told you in our prior statistics, we're dealing with over 12 million square feet of space, and we processed probably 8500 leases, so it's really all built into our numbers.  And as David said, we've taken that into account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just remember, Michael, that if the lease is not longer than a year, it's not included in our occupancy.  We don't weight &#x2013; I think other companies weight, average weight their leases if it's less than a year, and include part of it.  But we don't.</p>

          <p>Just in terms of your Liberty shares which have dropped significantly since you acquired them, maybe if you could explain what the chances are of a write down are in 2009, and what that would be at current levels.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  This year, or actually this quarter, there's been increased chatter about tenants renegotiating rents to the point it seems to come up in almost every discussion about mall REITs.  From your perspective, what's the greatest increase that those negotiations could go in '09 relative to '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've got two-thirds of our leases done, so we're talking about the balance of what we want to get accomplished.  And you know, at the end of the day, Craig, if it happens, it's not overly &#x2013; it's immaterial, I'd say.  We're a company that has over $3.2 billion of EBITDA, so any one tenant on $2 of rent per square foot is not going to drive our results one way or another.</p>
          <p>We're also, as I said to you earlier, I mean, extremely positioned &#x2013; well-positioned to deal with tenants in that area that want to do that.  But we'll make an assessment of whether we want to maintain a relationship with the tenant, what they're doing for us, and kind of trying to carve a win-win.  Are tenants doing that?  Sure.  Is it something that we know how to deal with?  The answer is yes.  Is that reflected in what we think the comp NOI production we're going to have next year?  The answer is yes.  Could it get worse?  Sure.  Could it get better?  Sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But at this point, from you guys' perspective and even looking at deals going forward, it's not really moving the needle to the degree you would expect when you see these conference calls on retailers?  Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Put it this way, it's more important for their results than it is for ours, and that goes without saying.  And I can walk you through that model if you have more time.  So the answer is it's more material for them than it is for us.  We produce a lot more sales and we're a lot more important to their success than they are to ours.  And I guess the best way to describe that is, generally the small shop retailer does about 20% of their sales in our portfolio, and as you can see the percent of rent, the highest is, Rick's showing me, is around 2%.  So you can figure the math out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't &#x2013; listen, I don't think we can anticipate &#x2013; I don't think we can give you a number on that.  I mean, look, part of this is self-fulfilling, right?  The retailers are extremely conservative, they've reduced their inventory.  They're running &#x2013; they are running, I think it's important to note, and I think everybody should anticipate that, that's why their sales are going to be less important to us this year than they &#x2013; than you might appreciate, I guess, is that they're going to have lower sales because they're going to be extremely conservative on their inventories. And you know, now &#x2013; and they're going to be very focused on their margins.  So we expect sales probably to continue to decline because they're just going to have less goods to sell.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're seeing more and more of that.  We've seen that trend over the last couple years and what &#x2013; we continue to see that.</p>

We are working with Bath and Body, who is now interested in expanding their presence in the outlets, and I will tell you as a collateral item to that in our Mills portfolio, we are seeing even more of a growth of the full price retailers wanting to grow in that format and they've been opening a considerable number of stores like Express and Sephora and Victoria's Secret, all with very good results.  So, both of those platforms are benefiting from tenants getting into multiple channels and cross-fertilizing across our platforms.</p>

          <p>Hi, this is Annar.  I have several questions.  So two-thirds of the leases for 2009 have been addressed already.  Does it mean, at this point in the year, that the one-third will not be renewing their leases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're just in the process of negotiation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, do you have a sense of what percent of the 2009 expirations will not be renewed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we tend &#x2013; generally, we tend to not renew, for all sorts of reasons, about 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>20 to 30%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  And that could be a function of they're not paying the rent, we want to re-merchandise, they want to leave.  You know, all of those reasons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And at this point, what percentage have indicated that they will not be renewing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No different than historical trends, I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.  And then you show expirations for malls and free standing and then for anchors.  Have you addressed two-thirds of anchors as well, or is it a little different proportion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The anchors are a very different scenario because they all have options built into their leases and a very high percentage of those options are renewed.  So, those typically do not have to give notice until six months prior to the expiration, and we're working with them, but there are minimal anchors that have indicated, to even discuss potentially not renewing.  They're staying in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.  Okay, and then if you take a look at your less productive centers, let's say sales per square foot of 350 and below, how have they performed?  How's their sales per square foot and occupancy held up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it depends a little bit on where that center is.  So $350 square foot in one area of the country is actually not a bad center; and, you know, if it were in the New York area, it might be a little bit tough.  It somewhat depends on the competition and the retail market there.  The vast majority of our &#x2013; the vast, vast majority of our centers are dominant in their trade area and even if they produce 350 are fine, they're hanging in there doing their business they need to do.  They may not have the growth characteristics of some of the higher productivity centers, but we're maintaining the cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So would you say that occupancy for those centers have held up singularly to your overall portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a case by case basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you mentioned that, also on case by case basis, you will work with tenants that are struggling, to maintain occupancy.  What percent of the tenants, would you say, are struggling or how many tenants are you talking to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frankly, it is a very small percentage.  I mean if you look, again, David indicated we're a $3.2 billion enterprise, and the number of tenants that we are even having conversations with is a very, very, very small fraction of that.  And candidly, in many instances we do not agree to give any kind of accommodation.  These are not one-way negotiations.  We're going to be talking to them about what their prospects are, what the rent they're willing to pay, are they willing to extend their term?  There's a lot of other aspects of this, and happily we are positioned with that strength of our portfolio and our balance sheet to be able to have these negotiations on a very even footing with the tenant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and my last question.  In your lifestyle center portfolio there was, I think, a significant drop in occupancy.  Was there anything in particular that happened?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the community center and lifestyle division.  The preponderance of the GLA in that portfolio is in the strip centers and some of the large boxes.  So the ...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good.  Going back to the sales theme, it looks like comparable sales in your mall portfolio fell about 16% during the fourth quarter.  Can you first comment on whether that number is in the right ball park, and then is there any reason to believe that the trend won't continue into 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're much too high. You know, sales did drop, but if you looked at &#x2013; I think you said, Ben, 15%.  Yeah, it's &#x2013; I don't have &#x2013; do you have the number, Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more like a 10% range, Ben.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So look, I mean, we can't prognosticate where sales are going to come out.  We all know what's going on in the general economic environment.  And I think, Ben, as we've said, the retailers are very focused on what they're going to have in the stores in terms of inventory management.  So we are expecting sales to decrease.  That's one of the reasons why you see our comp NOI projection for '09 to be flat to 1%, because we are still projecting our overage rent to decrease for '09, which is a direct result of sales.  I wish we knew exactly where that is.  There's variability in it.  It's not going to drive us one way or another, 'cause you can see what overage and percentage rent mean in terms of our EBITDA.  But we are expecting sales trend to continue downward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, what exactly are you expecting for 2009 in terms of sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a tenant by tenant analysis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But for your portfolio, could it be down 10% for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't &#x2013; we're not projecting that much.  But for overage, we actually trend it, so it depends on how the tenant did, and it's really a tenant by tenant analysis when we do our [gap in audio]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then given your experience in the industry, do you think there's been a secular shift in consumer spending and that mall sales could be permanently lower once the dust settles?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I really don't sense that, Ben, at all.  I mean, there are going to be &#x2013; look, retail obsolescence has been increasing over the last decade.  I think any time you run into this kind of downturn you're going to see, maybe, an acceleration of that.  But I firmly believe that good centers and strong centers with appropriate sponsorship and management will hold their value.  They're much more resilient in terms of cash flow generation than any other product that exists.  Look at hotels. You know, if you lose one office tenant, you can't replicate that income stream any time in the near future.  The malls are a lot more resilient than you'd think.  I do think there'll be more obsolescence in this environment, but I don't think we're in a five or ten year secular shift.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then you commented earlier on seeing some weakness in luxury.  Can you just comment briefly on the sales trends between your high end and kind of your less productive malls?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, I don't have that -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They were pretty much the same, interestingly enough.  There was not an outsized &#x2013; in fact, they were each down about the same.  And again, the luxury tenants in some instances were down significantly, but part of that is because they were up so much in 2007.  And one of the issues that the luxury tenants had is that they were basically caught in a U-turn in their demand, so when they ordered their inventory for 2008, it was based on very robust trends in 2007.  The more moderate priced retailers had less robust trends in 2007, so had more modest inventories in 2008 and were not as substantially impacted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would just add that &#x2013; lots of retailers have already posted their comp sales. The vast, vast majority of them, and we keep track of this, when they &#x2013; if they post their comp sales up or down, we will tend to &#x2013; our portfolio will tend to outperform.</p>
          <p>So let's say a retailer reports 8% up, our portfolio will probably be 10 or 11% up. Or if they report down, we'll be less down.  And again, that's the vast, vast majority.  Sometimes it doesn't quite happen that way.  But that's the vast majority.  So I think when you look at comp sales for the retailers, you can make a probably a pretty reasonable assumption that we're outperforming slightly on the positive and slightly on the negative.  And that's something we track about, and that's why we continue to be a very important ingredient to the retailers' success.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  David, you mentioned you have more concerns about some of the box tenants, and I'm just wondering if you might comment on where Sears/Kmart goes, given you have them in more than half of your locations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I really, David, don't like commenting on specific retailers. You know, it puts us in a tough spot other than I feel very confident from a financial point of view that they're in good shape, producing positive operating cash flow, and they're focused on becoming a better merchant. So beyond that, that's really all I can say on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You had approached them at some point about maybe taking some stores back and they didn't entertain that. Is that something that you still think you have alternative uses should there be an issue going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean, again, I think what we'll see is some of the very good centers will ultimately get some good real estate back because &#x2013; I'll take an example.  The one Sears store that we were able to purchase was in South Park, in Charlotte, where we had a Neiman and Nordstrom and other tenants, and Sears just wasn't the right tenant for that higher end mall.  And that's not always the case, they perform very well in a number of higher end malls.  So I think in those cases there may be those kind of deals. Not just with Sears, but with some of the other boxes or department stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. How did the Cincinnati Mills sale come in against your basis and expectation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right on it.  Otherwise we'd have a gain or loss associated with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last question -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right where we thought the value was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Bankruptcies in general for the small tenants have been below, I think, what most people thought and I think you've indicated that for January. But what about as you look forward in terms of factoring inventory this summer?  Is there anything you might be prepared to do to help your tenants who won't find financing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, sometimes we do, and part of that, David, would be what we can do on the rent side. But the one area that is a concern for retail when they &#x2013; a number of retailers are still good retailers; their financial structure may not be appropriate or they took on leverage from a buying-out of a tenant or they went private with too much leverage, there are all sorts of things.  And some of those are just good retailers with too much leverage.</p>
          <p>The one concern that we do have, I mean, we have lots of concerns, but one thing that we &#x2013; one concern that doesn't seem to be breaking the ice, is that those retailers with a good plan or a good operator, who maybe have bad capital structure, the lack of DIP financing continues to be an issue.  And we saw this in December a little bit, and that's why our occupancy got hit.  Normally, if a retailer went out of business, or it went into Chapter 11 proceeding, they'd get DIP financing and they'd restructure their capital structure and they'd be able to operate.  Given the lack of DIP financing right now, retailers are just liquidating.</p>
          <p>So, we would like to see some stability or some market to come back in the DIP world.  I don't think that's something we're going to play in, but we would like to see that &#x2013; we would like to see that market come back.  It's always been a profitable market for the lenders of that, but as they reined in their loans, this is one area where they're not taking any risk.</p>

          <p>And David, just one other comment on that.  The vast majority of our retailers have very strong balance sheets, with virtually no debt.  So the retailers David are talking about are those that were maybe involved in some LBOs and added on a lot of debt.  But the credit profiles of our retailers, which we monitor on a weekly basis, is frankly stronger, even after taking into account substantial declines in the last 12-month EBITDA reflecting December's results.  So the good news is that the concerns you're talking are going to be isolated among a small number of tenants.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, good morning.  Thinking about re-leasing times for a minute, if you guys have some bankruptcies in the first quarter, how quickly do you think you re-lease that space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, and achieve it in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be a challenge, and that's where I mentioned earlier, Rich, that the occupancy, if that happened, could come under a little bit of pressure.  Because that will be a challenge.  Because there's not a huge open to open for the retailers.  So if that happened and we weren't able to &#x2013; and that retailer liquidated and went out of business, to achieve that in '09, we would make that up by doing some local leasing or some temporary tenant leasing, which is still maintaining its demand.  But to get to full occupancy, the way we calculate it, which is to have a lease over a year, might be difficult to achieve for that calendar year in '09.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right, very good.  Thanks, David.  And then thinking about the financing picture for a second, Steve, are any of these guys talking about extensions?  Is that a more prevalent conversation, or how do they feel about extending debt if you or, I suppose, some of your peers can't get a piece of debt done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's two things, Rich.  Let's separate the life company market from the CNBF market.  A life company who has a loan coming due knows the asset, in the case of our portfolio is very comfortable with the asset, and wants very much to extend.  So, renewals is kind of an ordinary course of business there.</p>
          <p>The question is when you've got a CNBF loan and the loan is performing, and you have the conversation that you're going to have with a servicer and we'll see.  There's clearly maturities that are coming due.  Having said all that, Rich, for us, as I mentioned, very comfortable loan to values, very modest leverage.  So happily it's not a situation that we've been dealing with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then Steve, the unsecured note you have that's due today, that goes on the line of credit, I assume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Or we do have cash, too, so ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right.  Okay.  And then private equity, is there any thawing in terms of the interest in the real estate space from pension funds and other equity sources?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say generally U.S.-based, by and large, no.  International-based, yes.  I think &#x2013; but I think the U.S.-based pension fund is much &#x2013; is tougher because of their own &#x2013; what's going on either with their endowments or their retirees or their own &#x2013; not so much that real estate's been black-lined, it's just they've got lots of things to worry about:  hedge fund performance, private equity LBO performance, capital calls, commitments, retiree benefits, poor performance, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And is that international interest in U.S. assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then the last thing, guys, from me, is the three Vegas assets that General Growth has, I mean, you guys are obviously a logical potential buyers of those assets.  Is that something you're looking seriously at?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm doing all right.  The majority of my questions have been answered.  I had one follow-up.  You guys commented that the number of retailers struggling and coming back to renegotiate rents was very small.  I was just wondering, how does that translate into delinquencies?  Where are they now versus a year ago, or even three months ago?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, our receivable balance at the end of January will be pretty much right on top of where it was at the end of December.  And December '08 was pretty much right on top of where it was at December of '07.  Not to say we're not having to work harder and chase a little harder to get those dollars in the door, but we have not seen a significant change in the composition of our receivable balance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Very good.  My last question, I don't know if you guys can comment, but who's currently on your credit watch list?  Which retailers are you guys concerned about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I mean, I think it's no different than what probably a lot &#x2013; you know, everybody else's.  Again, it's very tough for us to name retailers publicly, but there are a handful.  And again, some of these are good operators that are on there because they bought something and &#x2013; or they went private or those kind of things, as opposed to just bad performance.  But it's very tough for us to name retailers publicly like that.</p>
