          <p>Great, Trevor, thanks and good morning everyone. On the first page, which is the overview page, I'd make just a couple points that will tee up our presentation for the quarter. First, the GE environment has improved. We've seen orders strengthening. Service orders grew by 14%. Our delinquencies have stabilized. Non-earnings are down. The world we look at really has improved and we're looking forward now into 2010.</p>
          <p>The GE business model has performed in the fourth quarter. The things we've talked about in the past in terms of how we're running the company I think really did achieve and perform on plan in the fourth quarter. Services grew nicely. Our margins and cash flow performance were very strong. We won a lot of the big global orders. And the Capital Finance metrics are either at plan or better than plan as we end the year.</p>
          <p>The 2010 framework we talked about in December is achievable and balanced we think. The outlook for Capital Finance is improving. We've got high visibility, and our backlog and margins and again our service revenue is very strong. And we've done a substantial amount of restructuring over the past few years, and a lot of those benefits will carry over into 2010 and beyond. So we think that really gives us a real sense that the 2000 (sic) [2010] framework is very solid.</p>
          <p>We're positioned for growth in 2011 and beyond. We think that losses in Capital Finance will stabilize in 2010 and start to decline. The infrastructure visibility again is very high. And by the end of 2010 and during the year, we should have $25 billion of cash at the GE parent that we can use to keep the company safe and secure and also have ample opportunities to create shareholder value. And we just take a lot of strong actions to position the company for the future. The portfolio is simpler and stronger. Our R&amp;D investments increased in 2009, so we have lots of new products. We're very well positioned globally. So I think we accomplished a lot in the quarter and feel pretty good about how we finished the year.</p>
          <p>On the next page, just some results versus the December outlook meeting. I'm not going to go through all these, but on the left hand side, here were some of the key things we talked about in December versus how we finished. And we're at or above plan &#x2013; at or above outlook on virtually all the metrics. There're some encouraging signs: orders strengthening, services very strong. We were able to do more restructuring in the fourth quarter than we originally thought, cash and margin levels at near &#x2013; margin performance at near record levels, losses stabilizing, and high margins on new lending. And there are still some cautious areas. We're still very cautious about commercial real estate; and there's excess capacity, high unemployment. So we're cautious about certain areas, but as we finish the year, we did see some encouraging signs.</p>
          <p>Now there are four areas of execution that we've talked about as we went through 2009 in a very difficult economy, and I want to recap each one of those. The first one is the focus on keeping GE Capital safe and secure, and really we're ahead of plan on virtually all the metrics that we've talked about. We're fully funded for 2010 and we've done $4.4 billion of funding in 2011 at attractive spreads, so we feel great about our funding performance. Commercial paper is below 50 billion. We're again ahead of plan there. Our leverage reduced in the quarter and again ahead of plan there. Our Tier 1 common ratio continues to improve. We've got lots of GECS equity. We're very strong and getting stronger in terms of balance sheet strength. And our ending net investment is ahead of plan at $472 billion, so really strong execution by the GE Capital team.</p>
          <p>From an orders standpoint in the slow economy, very important to get the orders that are out there. We saw a good bump quarter over quarter, a $3.7 billion improvement quarter over quarter. Our total orders were only down 3% versus the fourth quarter of last year, which was still a pretty good quarter for the company. From an equipment standpoint, we're seeing a pretty good bounce back as we went through 2009, and we think equipment orders should be positive for the year of 2010 versus 2009. Services were very strong. I mean a 14% service fee was as good as any quarterly service fee we had even pre-crisis, so we feel great about how our services are positioned.</p>
          <p>Our backlog is at record levels. A lot of that is driven by service, but again at or ahead of plan. And we won a lot of the big deals. Our Oil &amp; Gas business won a lot of the big global deals in Australia.</p>
          <p>Healthcare, we really saw good strength across all geographies. About 60% of our orders are global. It's a very diverse global frameworks via from Kuwait, Australia, India. You really go across the board. And we saw pretty good order strength in the fourth quarter, and we're increasing our backlog going into 2010.</p>
          <p>The third area of execution was on margins, and what we did here is broke out our Infrastructure and Consumer &amp; Industrial margins and then total Industrial, which includes NBCU, and we did that really for two reasons. One is that our focus going forward is going to be Infrastructure and C&amp;I with the announced Comcast deal. And the second one is just the Olympics tend to distort what we're doing. I think what you see here is very good margin accretion both in the fourth quarter, total year. And also in Infrastructure and C&amp;I, we see margins improving again in 2010. And the basic is we've got &#x2013; the dynamics of margin enhancement really are working and really are repeatable. And I'll just recap those. We've done lots of restructuring. It has enabled us to really take lots of structure out of the company. We've closed more than 400 facilities. Our head count is down, and these benefits will carry over into 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>The second point is that our services are growing faster than equipment, which has a nice mix impact. At the same time, the margin in our Service business is also improving, so that's really a double tailwind, if you will. Our contribution margins have grown and are growing. Our pricing is reasonably stable, and deflation is accelerating, so that adds to our value gap improving in 2010. We've had disciplined execution around discretionary costs. Our indirects are down 16%, and so those are things that have helped our margins expand.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we've continued to invest in R&amp;D. Our R&amp;D investment grew 7% in 2009. It's planned to grow 15 to 20% in 2010. So we have lots of high margin new products coming into the pipeline as well. So we think the margin story is very good and very good compared to our peers in 2009.</p>
          <p>Lastly on cash, which was a big focus area for the year, we started 2009 with a target of 14 to $16 billion of industrial CFOA [Cash Flow from Operating Activities]. We actually beat the plan with $16.6 billion of CFOA. The teams did a great job of reducing working capital by more than $3 billion.</p>
          <p>And so where that leaves us right now between GE Capital and the GE parent, we have $72 billion of consolidated cash on the balance sheet. We've got $8.7 billion of cash at the parent. If you add in the announced dispositions of Security and the Comcast JV, that's an additional 10; so our cash execution has been strong. We've got lots of cash we'll be accumulating during the year. And we think this really helps us from a financial flexibility standpoint.</p>
          <p>So with that I'll turn it over to Keith to go through the fourth-quarter performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. I'm going to start with the fourth-quarter consolidated results summary. For the quarter, we had revenues of 41.4 billion, which were down 10%, better than we had during the first nine months of the year. Industrial sales of 28.3 billion were down 9%, and Financial Services revenue of 13.5 was down 14%.</p>
          <p>We earned $3 billion in net income, which was down 22%, principally driven by the GE Capital comparisons. For earnings per share, we earned $0.28, including the cost of the preferred dividend. And as Jeff covered, total cash flow from operating activities was $16.6 billion, exceeding the high end of our estimated range for the year, and that's a great result.</p>
          <p>In terms of taxes, the consolidated rate for 2009 ended at a negative 11%. You can see the GE rate excluding GE Capital came in at 22%, in line with our third quarter outlook. And the GE Capital rate of 173%, it reflects the fact that we had a large tax benefit or credit divided by negative pre-tax income at the total GE Capital services level, and that results in the large positive rate, similar to the first nine months of the year. I'm going to cover more on taxes on the next page for the impact in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>On the right side, you can see the segment results. Infrastructure businesses had 4.3 billion of segment profit. It was down about 4% from last year. For the total year, the Infrastructure businesses were up about 1%, pretty good performance in this economy. NBCU segment profit of 602 million was down 30%, again consistent with the first nine months of the year. GE Capital Finance earned 336 million. It's down 67%, also in line with the first nine months performance. And C&amp;I had another good quarter. They delivered 136 million of segment profit, almost triple from what their results were last year. So overall, the segment profit was down 16, and the difference between our total earnings down 22 and segment profit down 16 reflects the additional restructuring that we did in the fourth quarter, and I'll cover some more on that in a minute. I'll cover all the business details in the next several pages.</p>
          <p>Before I get into the business results, I just want to summarize the fourth quarter items that impacted the quarter. The first one is one we've done all year long. We had $0.09 of restructuring and other charges that were recorded in corporate. We continue to invest in lowering our cost structure. And this $0.09 was aligned by business. I'll give you a couple of the numbers as follows. Capital Finance was 256 million. Energy Infrastructure was 130 million. Technology Infrastructure was 110 million. C&amp;I was 102 million, and NBC was 48 million. The balance was in corporate, primarily environmental.</p>
          <p>The significant projects that we completed in the quarter included exits of some non-core leasing platforms in our Equipment Services business and GE Capital. We closed some factories in lighting in Europe, and we continued service shop consolidations in Energy, so a continued reduction of our cost structure.</p>
          <p>The second item in the quarter, we had a gain associated with Fanuc. As you know, we dissolved our Fanuc JV this quarter. We transferred the CNC business back to Fanuc at fair value, and that resulted in a gain of about $0.01 after tax.</p>
          <p>The third item in the quarter is our industrial taxes. And as I showed on the previous page, the fourth quarter industrial rate was 10%. That was low versus our total year estimate. I signaled that in the third quarter, and that contributed about $0.05 of earnings in the quarter versus a mid-20s average rate for the industrial earnings. The rate's lower in the fourth quarter to true up to the total year rate. For the first nine months of the year, the industrial rate was higher than our total year estimate because of the mix of Financial Services' lower taxed earnings. And then in the fourth quarter, we had to reverse basically the first quarter charge to get to the expected annual rate of around 22%.</p>
          <p>Net-net if you look, $0.09 of restructuring, $0.06 of positives from the tax and the gain. There's an additional $0.03 of charges that basically help us improve our cost structure going forward.</p>
          <p>For the business results, I'll start with Capital Finance. Mike Neal and the team continue to make progress while we're working through this tough credit cycle. For the fourth quarter, revenues of 12.5 billion were down 15%. Again, that's driven by our assets being down as well as lower interest rates. Segment profit of 336 million was down 67%, driven by lower tax benefits in GE Capital quarter over quarter, lower assets as we shrink the book. Fewer gains, and that was partially offset by having lower impairments in the quarter and also lower costs. Assets of 537 billion were down 6% year over year. They were down 10% excluding the impact of FX. And assets were also down 14 billion from the third quarter. I'll cover more on assets as I go through the businesses.</p>
          <p>If you start on the right side of the page and you look at the activity that the team has done, first we've done a great job on funding. If you look at constant FX rates, we reduced our ending net investment by 53 billion from the year end 2008. We completed our 2010 long-term debt needs. We also absorbed the extra costs from prefunding our debt maturities and carrying that extra cash. We did 34 billion of commercial originations for the year. And fourth quarter was $10.9 billion, up 7% from last year's fourth quarter but up over 50% from the third quarter, so the origination team is fully engaged and back in business and allocating capital to high margin opportunities. Return on that volume was over 3% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Total year losses came in at 10.9 billion, and losses and impairments were 12.6 billion, which was below the Fed base case that we laid out in March. Reserve coverage continues to be higher. I'm going to cover more on reserves in a few pages. And the team took out 3.3 billion of SG&amp;A costs during the year, a great job on controlling costs and reducing our cost footprint and helping to deal with the problems we have in the credit cycle.</p>
          <p>If you look on the left side, I'll make a few comments by business. As we said, every business was profitable in the quarter except for Real Estate. Starting with Consumer, our Consumer business delivered 259 million of earnings. That was down 69% from last year, principally because we had lower tax benefits partially offset by lower credit losses, so a little improvement in credit year over year.</p>
          <p>In the Consumer business, a couple of pieces; Global Banking earned 184 million, which was down 50% from last year because of higher credit costs. Our US Retail Finance business was profitable in the fourth quarter. They earned a modest amount. And again, that was driven by lower credit losses and lower costs. And our restructuring operations earned $90 million, up over $90 million because of lower credit costs and principally in the UK home lending business.</p>
          <p>The Real Estate business had a loss of 593 million in the fourth quarter. We incurred 350 million of after-tax credit costs, which helped boost our reserve provisions. And we also had 315 million of marks and impairments on the equity book. Reserve coverage increased 47%, and reserves are up to $1.5 billion now in Real Estate. We just continue to see pressure on property valuations, and we'll build reserves as they're needed.</p>
          <p>Commercial Lending and Leasing had a good quarter. The business earned 362 million, a positive $500 million swing from last year as marks and impairments improved by 300 and costs were lower by 200. GECAS had another great quarter. They earned 277 million. That was up 16%, driven by core growth. We also funded $2 billion in new volume at over 4% ROI. And asset quality remains strong with only three aircraft on the ground at year end.</p>
          <p>Finally, Energy Financial Services earned 31 million, down 86% from lower gains and lower tax benefits.</p>
          <p>Overall, Capital Finance earned 2.3 billion of net income for the year. And let me go into some of the portfolio quality details. First, on portfolio quality are the stats on delinquencies and non-earning assets, and on the left side is our commercial equipment finance data. The 30-day plus delinquencies for equipment are down 20 basis points from Q3 to Q4, which is a good sign. Americas delinquency was down 27 basis points, and we also had declines in both Europe and Asia. Commercial non-earning assets declined $600 million from Q3 to Q4, which is another positive sign, and we remain well collateralized on the remaining non-earning assets.</p>
          <p>In real estate, 30-day delinquencies were up 14 basis points to 4.33% and non-earnings were actually down almost $70 million in the fourth quarter, down 11 basis points.</p>
          <p>Over on the right side on the consumer data, you can see the delinquency data has leveled off. We've had a slight decline in the mortgage delinquency, which is good news. For North American retail, the delinquencies were up 32 basis points to 7.59%, and a lot of that is driven by seasonality. In a normal Q3 to Q4 seasonal change, we'd have over 50 basis points of increase on delinquency. So I think it's up a little bit but manageable relative to the normal seasonality.</p>
          <p>The good news in the consumer segment came also in the UK home lending business. Delinquencies were down 52 basis points from the third quarter. The UK mortgage portfolio is performing better. We had six months now of house price increases in the UK. And we continue to realize gains on the properties that we repossess and sell. And our inventory also declined. Our inventory of homes we repossessed declined by over 36% in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, so some good signs in the UK home lending business.</p>
          <p>Global Banking delinquencies were stable at 4.6%. And on the right side, the far right, on non-earnings you can see the consumer non-earning assets. They were up about $100 million, up slightly in the fourth quarter, but the mortgage non-earners declined. And the non-mortgage increased about 30 basis points, driven by continued pressure in the US with the high unemployment rate; so overall a pretty tough environment, but I think some signs of stabilization with the leveling off of delinquencies and decline in non-earnings.</p>
          <p>If you look at reserve coverage, we increased our reserve coverage every quarter last year. You can see that in the bars here. In the fourth quarter, our provision for loss was $2.9 billion and with write-offs staying flat. In Q3, we increased reserves by another $730 million. Coverage was up to 2.36%. In December, we had forecast that we'd have coverage of about 2.25%, so more than 10 basis points better in the final close here.</p>
          <p>For the Commercial business, our reserves increased over $500 million, principally in real estate. As I mentioned, non-earners came down over $600 million, and we continue to benefit from our strong collateral positions.</p>
          <p>For Consumer, you can see the reserves are up 230 million. Coverage was up 24 basis points, and the impact of secured and unsecured consumer lending comes out here. If you look, our North American retail coverage is up to 7%. And then in the secured lending on the Consumer side where we have the mortgage collateral and the mortgage insurance, the coverage is up to 1.62%. And on the houses that we're repossessing, we're realizing all year long, all four quarters, 115% proceeds versus the foreclosure marks on our mortgage assets, so pretty good performance on taking over the assets.</p>
          <p>For the year, we increased our reserves by $2.8 billion, and the coverage is up 94 basis points. Now the non-earning charts on both Commercial and Consumer, we put those in the supplemental deck, but you can see we continue to believe that we're adequately reserved for the non-earning assets for each of the business segments.</p>
          <p>To wrap up Capital, I thought I'd just resummarize the sub-business dynamics that Mike Neal and the team outlined in December for the 2010 outlook. If you start at the top, consumer loans and leases, that represents about 200 billion of our assets. The outlook for 2010 is much better. Losses will be lower. Most of the portfolios in this business have stabilized already in terms of delinquency and lower non-earnings. And the outlook is pretty good with the new volume that we're originating.</p>
          <p>For US Consumer, 2010 should also be better. Losses should be stable. But our underwriting discipline that paid off in 2009 should continue to give us benefits as we've raised our underwriting standards and we've cut open lines to buy and we've been very disciplined on collections. Overall, the result here is going to depend on where unemployment goes.</p>
          <p>For Global Banking, the outlook is also better. Losses should be stable, and we expect to benefit from the positive growth where we operate. CEE, Central and Eastern Europe, GDP growth should be over 2% in 2010 versus 2009, and that's good for these business. I mentioned the UK mortgages improving. We expect lower losses in 2010 as the market dynamics continue to improve. And for the verticals, we expect about flat performance. We're being cautious in this aviation cycle but our business does remain highly secured and well positioned here and when you look at the asset performance we have.</p>
          <p>And finally for real estate, we expect continued pressure. We expect losses to be higher, but we're working our way through the cycle. We've got an intense focus on operations and risk management, and some liquidity has returned to the real estate market.</p>
          <p>So if you look in December, our outlook for Capital Finance was about flat. We have some encouraging signs that show the potential for earnings growth in 2010, and we should be well positioned for solid capital growth for 2011 based on the outlook we have today.</p>
          <p>Let me switch to Industrial. I'll start with NBC. For the quarter, revenues of 4.3 billion were down 4%. Segment profit of $600 million was down 30%. And just a few comments on the market before I cover the business segments; the advertising market is definitely improving. Probably the best indicator of that would be the scatter pricing that you get on top of the inventory that you sold in the upfront. We have available inventory that's sold in the quarter. Pricing on scatter for the broadcast network was up low double digits in the fourth quarter. And the outlook for the first quarter, it's up over 20%. And then pricing on scatter for cable was up over 30% in the fourth quarter, and it's also up over 30% in the first quarter. So we're seeing benefits on the network and cable and the local stations and the ad market is definitely getting better.</p>
          <p>If you look at the business segments, cable had another great quarter. Revenue of 1.3 billion was up 8%. Op profit was up 8%. It was led by entertainment. USA delivered more total viewers in prime than any other cable network in history, so they continue to have just a great performance. We've got a bunch of great new shows that are new series coming. Syfy, Bravo, and Oxygen were all up over 20%. On the news side, CNBC had a revenue and profit growth despite tough comparisons with last year's fourth quarter, so they're performing well in this economy.</p>
          <p>On the broadcast side, revenues of 1.6 billion were down 2%. Op profit was down in broadcast, driven by the NFL sports fees and by new programming investments that we've been making. Everyone's aware of our decision to move Leno back to the Tonight Show and to reset the 10 PM lineup after the Olympics. I'm not sure I could report more than has been written on this subject. News continued its leadership position, and the local stations also had good earnings growth in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now the toughest part of NBC and the thing that has driven our earnings all year long has been film. Revenues of 1.2 billion were down over 400 million in the quarter. We didn't have any big films in fourth quarter in terms of theatrical, but we had very tough DVD comparisons. In the fourth quarter of '08, we sold over 33 million DVDs with hits like Mamma Mia, Hulk, and Wanted. And this year, we only had 12 million with Inglorious Basterds and Public Enemies the two biggest, so that was really challenging. The film op profit was down over $200 million in the quarter, which really drove the NBC results not only in the quarter but for the whole year. NBC ended 2009 with segment profit down 28%.</p>
          <p>For the first quarter, we're seeing pretty good demand for the Olympics. As I said, the advertising market is picking up. Revenue should exceed our December estimates for the Olympics by 25 to 50 million. But even with that demand, we expect a loss of somewhere around 250 million on the Olympics in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And obviously the big news in the fourth quarter for us was the Comcast announcement. We're working jointly on preparing our regulatory filing and our other notices with the Department of Justice and the FTC to get that underway.</p>
          <p>Next is Technology Infrastructure. John Rice and the team delivered revenues of 11.3 billion.</p>
          <p>They were down 10%. And segment profit of 2.1 billion was down 16%. You can see the business results on the bottom left. Overall, this was a tougher quarter for Aviation and Transportation, but we saw some very positive signs in Healthcare. Let me just take you through the three businesses here.</p>
          <p>Aviation, fourth quarter orders of 4.4 billion were down 16% year over year. Major equipment orders of 1.5 billion were down 48%. Basically the airframer backlogs are still full. We had 900 million of commercial engine orders, 600 million of military orders. And the backlog on equipment ended the quarter at just under $20 billion, down about 5% versus last year, so it's still a very solid position. Service orders were up 19%, driven by one large order, a $350 million order with Aviall for parts deliveries that will occur in late 2010 and most of 2011. Without that, commercial spares of 19.5 million per day were down about 11%. And commercial overhaul was pretty good, up 8%.</p>
          <p>Revenue in the quarter was down 8% driven by equipment revenue, down 21, partially offset by service revenue up eight. The main driver on that was fewer military engines. We shipped 238 military engines, down 14%. We actually shipped 516 commercial engines, which was up 5% in units, but still a tough revenue comparison. Op profit in the quarter was down 18%. That's primarily driven by the absence of some prior fourth quarter '08 transactions that don't repeat and also lower spare parts shipments in the quarter. Spare parts shipments were down 4%. Excluding those, op profit would have been about &#x2013; up a slight amount as positive pricing offset lower volume and higher R&amp;D costs in the Aviation business.</p>
          <p>If you go to Healthcare, the fourth quarter was the most positive orders quarter we've seen since the third quarter of 2008. Orders of 5.1 billion were up 11%. Equipment orders of 3.4 billion were up</p>
          <p>13%. We had about four to five points of benefit from FX, but the trend was very broad. If you look, I'm just going to give you a lot of numbers on the different modalities and regions of the world. They're all positive. Diagnostic Imaging up was 24%. We haven't seen a quarter like that in a long time. Inside Diagnostic Imaging if you look globally, China was up 32%. India was up 53%. The US was up 34%, so it's very broad. Clinical Systems was up eight. Life Sciences was up 11. Surgery was up 13. In the US, equipment orders were up nine, and CT globally was up 20%. MR globally was up 36%. X-ray was up 16. The lowest growth was MDx, and that was up 1%. So service orders were up six. Healthcare IT was up four. It's just a much better quarter than we've seen in a long time.</p>
          <p>In terms of the actual results in the quarter, revenue of 4.7 was down 2%. That was driven by equipment being down 2% and services down 3%. And segment profit was down 3% as the lower volume and a little bit of price were mostly offset by deflation and cost productivity.</p>
          <p>If you go to Transportation, that team continues to deal with just a really challenging environment. Orders of 900 million were positive though. They were up 3%. Equipment orders of 500 million were up almost 300 million, driven by international orders including 300 Evo [Evolution] kits for China, 50 units for Brazil. Service orders though were really tough. They were down 40%, and that's driven by the impact of the parked locomotives. We still have about 5,000 parked locomotives, and that's impacting the service business in Transportation.</p>
          <p>Revenue of 600 million was down 56%. We're delivering significantly fewer locomotives. We did 91 locomotives in the fourth quarter of '09 versus 219 in the fourth quarter of '08.</p>
          <p>And then finally, we had a service contract review in Erie as well. Over the last two years, we completed reviews of our service contract portfolios in Aviation and Energy. And in the fourth quarter, we finished a project to relook our total contract cost estimates in Transportation, and we had a charge of about 300 million in the quarter. That took Transportation's results from a positive 150 to a negative 160. And this does complete our service contract review for the three businesses.</p>
          <p>We've also had a lot of structural cost out in the business to counter the effect of the slowdown, taking out close to 30% of the employee base in the business as we're just going to have lower locomotive shipments as we go into 2010.</p>
          <p>For the year, Transportation earned $470 million of operating profit. And with a lower locomotive forecast for 2010, we currently expect the team to deliver about the same result &#x2013; same total result next year. So overall if you look, Technology Infrastructure for the year delivered 7.5 billion of operating profit, down 8%.</p>
          <p>And the final business is Energy. John Krenicki and the Energy team finished the year strong. Revenues of 10.4 billion were down 9%. It's a similar profile to Q3. We had positive operating leverage with segment profit of 2.2 billion, up 9%.</p>
          <p>You can see the business results on the bottom left, and let me start with Energy. Energy orders of 8.8 billion were down 6% versus last year, so the trend continues to improve. And they were up 33% from the third quarter, which is nice sequential improvement. Thermal orders of 1.7 billion were down 19%. We had orders for 40 gas turbines versus 70 last year. All 40 orders were for outside the US. And if you look at the orders price, it's still pretty good. The thermal order price index up was 1% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Wind orders of 1.5 billion, they were down 25% from last year, but they were also up 20% from the third quarter. We're seeing more activity. We had also quite a few push-outs. We had about 400 million of European orders that pushed into Q1. And we haven't included in orders any of the 1.4 billion Caithness commitment that we announced in the fourth quarter, so pretty good activity in wind. And the wind orders price index was down 2% in the quarter. Aero orders were down 40% to 400 million. Jenbacher orders were up 3% to 270 million; seemed pretty good to me in there. And service orders up 15% to $4.5 billion, driven by just strong contractual service commitments. During 2009, we also built a 700 million backlog in Smart Grid orders that will deliver in 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p>So revenue in the quarter at Energy was down 13 to 8.3 billion. That's really just driven by the lower volume. Wind unit revenue was the main driver. It was down about 30%. Thermal revenue was down 6%. We shipped 585 wind turbines versus 988 last year, and we shipped 34 gas turbines versus 58 last year, and service revenues were up two.</p>
          <p>On that revenue, segment profit was up 11%, and we got the benefit of the higher prices that we've had in the backlog. We've got the benefit of deflation, and pretty good service productivity which more than offset that lower volume. Segment profit margins also grew 470 basis points to 21.9%. Overall it was just a great performance in the Energy business.</p>
          <p>Oil &amp; Gas, they also had another good quarter. We're seeing some positive orders growth globally, a lot of demand in the LNG segment. Orders of 2.5 billion were up 30% in the quarter. Equipment orders of 1.4 billion were up 30%, and that's driven by the strength in LNG and also drilling and production, subsea great demand. We had 600 million of orders just from the Gorgon project in Australia, and there are several more projects coming in Australia around LNG. Service orders were up 30%, driven by incredibly strong repair and field service orders. They were up 30%. Plus we had solutions orders for equipment upgrades to help people with their productivity that more than doubled to over 230 million.</p>
          <p>Revenues of 2.3 billion in the quarter were up 10%, driven by the strong pipeline and services revenues. And segment profit of 422 million was up 4%, driven by positive deflation partially offset by some higher project costs as they implement these projects globally. So overall for the year, the Energy team just had a great year. They delivered 6.8 billion of segment profit. It was up 13%.</p>
          <p>I want to walk through on the next page a few of the changes that we're making, some simplification that we're doing to help make things a little bit cleaner in GE as we do our reporting and also as we operate the company. These are going to be effective January 1. First, we're going to put everything associated with industrial, electricity, equipment, and components and Smart Grid into Energy. So the Industrial business out of C&amp;I is going to go into Energy. The businesses from</p>
          <p>Enterprise Solutions associated with sensing and inspection and digital energy are going to become part of Energy, and it's going to align everything we have around Smart Grid. I think it's a good move. As a result of this change, we're going to transfer about 3.5 billion of revenue and about 300 million of segment profit into the Energy business. And that will start again, as I said, as of 1/1.</p>
          <p>Second, if you take the Industrial business out of C&amp;I, we're going to leave appliances and lighting together and they're going to be combined with the Intelligent Platforms business from Fanuc, and it's going to be renamed GE Home and Business Solutions. It helps us to further focus appliance and lighting on the energy efficiency game. Compared to the current C&amp;I segment, revenue in '09 for the Home and Business Solutions will be about 1.3 billion less, and it will have a minimal impact on segment profit.</p>
          <p>And the third thing we're going to do on simplification I think is a great benefit for simplifying reporting for investors. We've had Capital Finance as a reporting segment for Mike Neal and his team. And then we have GECC, the registrant, GE Capital Corp. And then we have GE Capital Services. We're going to make Capital Finance equal GECC starting 1/1. And basically what that will do is it will take the treasury operations and the corporate cost and it will put it into Capital Finance and it will streamline our reporting and simplify our reporting. On that basis, Capital Finance's net income will be 1.7 billion for 2009. So around 600 million of after-tax expenses that are in corporate and treasury will show up in the segment instead of capital corporate, and I think this is just going to be a nice simplification.</p>
          <p>To help with the changes, in the supplemental package that we put out today, we have a summary of all three of these changes on the reporting basis. We have the full year 2007 and then we have by the quarters for 2008 and 2009, so it's not a big deal. But we tried to give you this to just simplify how we're going to change the reporting, and I look forward to this in 2010. I think it streamlines things for investors and for our management team.</p>
          <p>The final thing on &#x2013; the fourth point here on the shelf, one of the results of the SEC settlement we had last summer was that we lost what's known as a well-known seasoned issuer status for GE for a period of three years from the time that we file our 2009 10-K. That does not affect GE Capital. But because of this, we're going to have to file an updated registration shelf statement prior to filing the 10-K, which we anticipate will be sometime in the end of February. This is not a substantive change, but procedurally we'll have to file a shelf as a result of that settlement.</p>
          <p>So next just for 2010, I thought I'd revisit the framework that we covered with you in December. We expect the Industrial profit to be about flat. Basically as you look at the businesses, we're going to have growth in Energy, Oil &amp; Gas, and Healthcare, and that's going to offset any potential pressure that we have in Aviation and Transportation. Media will be down driven by the Olympics, as I mentioned, otherwise about flat for the year. Capital Finance will be about flat. And now that Capital Finance will equal GE Capital Corp., based on the early signs we see in delinquency, non-earnings, and margins, GE Capital is positioned for upside. We've got to remain cautious on real estate, but the outlook has improved.</p>
          <p>Corporate will also be about flat. We're going to have higher pension costs in 2010 versus 2009, but that's going to be partially offset. The fact that we have lower restructuring, and again the total amount of restructuring will depend upon the projects that we develop during the year and what the paybacks look like. And then we expect another very solid year of cash flow, 13 to $15 billion from industrial businesses in 2010. We're not giving EPS guidance, but those drivers will describe our operational outlook as you look at 2010.</p>
          <p>And finally, I wanted to just cover one page about the outlook going forward for cash and the macro picture for GE. The fourth quarter of 2008, most of 2009 was just a really tough period for GE. And our teams executed very well and we've dramatically changed our future financial flexibility, and I think this page summarizes it. On the left side, you all know the capital story. We closed 2009 with $64 billion in cash. We prefunded our 2010 long-term debt needs in 2009. With our focused shrinkage and our alternative funding, we're going to redeem $71 billion of long-term debt this year. We're going to keep our commercial paper below 50 billion. And we're going to be able to prefund $25 billion of 2011 long-term debt.</p>
          <p>We're managing our collections ahead of our originations. Our restructuring business is funding growth in other areas. Our quality of earnings are going to be better. We're going to deliver growth in pre-tax pre-provision earnings in 2010. And losses are going to peak and our capital ratios are going to stay above the regulatory requirements. Our estimate right now is that we're going to contribute about $2 billion of equity into GE Capital in 2011 based on our income maintenance agreement, and that's the extent of what we see as the potential capital needs that GE might have to put into GE Capital.</p>
          <p>On the right side is the parent story. We continue to grow our cash balance from free cash flow. We're very cash efficient as a company. We expect 10 billion of proceeds from the security in the NBCU transactions. And we should end the year with over $25 billion of cash at the parent level.</p>
          <p>That's going to lead to a different framework for us in terms of capital allocation. We've pretty much reserved the $2 billion for GE Capital, but we're going to be able to invest in infrastructure. We're going to be able to look at buyback. We're going to be able to grow our dividend in line with our earnings. Jeff, when you think about this picture versus where we've been, I don't think it's an either/or here on this menu. I think these are things we're going to be able to do when we get this flexibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Keith, I think this is an immensely stronger story for the company. I think we always look at bolt-on acquisitions and infrastructure, and we think they'll be available. We'll be very opportunistic on the buyback and look at where the share price is and look at the preferred and things like that. And then I think we really see the ability to grow the dividend in line with earnings by 2011. So we're committed to safe and secure for the company, but we've got lots of flexibility to enhance shareholder value as we get through this picture during 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's just a tremendously positive outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The team has done a great job, a great job here. Lastly, I think to recap something that we talked about in December in terms of how you think about the company going forward, we ended the year 2009 at $1.03 a share. We see solid earnings growth in 2011 and 2012. And it really doesn't require a dramatic change in the global economy. We think things are getting better in GE Capital. We should get earnings rebound post this last cycle. Fourth quarter is encouraging along those lines. And as losses probably level off or peak in 2010, this just portends I think good earnings capability for GE Capital in 2011 and beyond.</p>
          <p>70% of our Industrial earnings are in services. I really think that the service business model has been validated during this cycle. The earnings have continued, and the fourth quarter just confirms that. And so I think that's quite strong. Our equipment backlog is still strong. We see the markets generally better. Our margins are good in backlog. We've increased the R&amp;D so we can increase the number of products. And what we just talked about, the cash optionality that we're going to deploy in an investor friendly way and the story just gets better. When you look at the years 2010 to 2012, the management team is going to be compensated to deliver these results for you in terms of EPS, cash, ROTC, and funding. And so the management team is incredibly aligned with investors to accomplish what we've laid out here.</p>
          <p>Lastly just to summarize some thoughts that we left you with in December, we've positioned the company for solid earnings and cash flow growth in the future; 2010 solid, growth in 2011. Our strength in technology services global markets really position us we think well today. We kept investing in the downturn. Our pipeline is strong of new products. We defined the business to fully utilize the GE competitive advantage. We've got a simple and strong portfolio where we can invest and grow. We think the worst is behind us in Financial Services, and GE Capital will be smaller but still a meaningful contributor in the future. We should get this profit snap back as losses go down. And we'll generate significant available cash to be thoughtful, and we'll be that thoughtful about creating long-term shareholder value. We want to be safe and secure, but we also are going to have lots of optionality as we look at the future.</p>
          <p>So with that, Trevor, I'll turn it back over to you and let's take some questions.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff and Keith, for that. Noelia, I think we're ready to open up the phone lines for questions now.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Bob Cornell with Barclays Capital.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. Going back to just Capital Finance, could you give us an idea of what you provided? Apologize for the granularity of this question in a big picture quarter, but in the commercial real estate loan book in the quarter, what sort of provision did you take there? Can you tell us, Keith?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I mentioned it in the quarter --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I may simplify the question. What was the provision for loss in the commercial real estate loan book for the year? The charge in the third quarter was something like 559 million. What was that charge for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fourth quarter was 350 million after tax. If you go to real estate for the whole year, we started the year with 300 million of reserves and we ended the year with 1.5 billion, so it's a $1.2 billion increase for --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's in the loan book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess the question is when you tick off all the pieces of Capital Finance and the only piece you target as being a problem is commercial real estate &#x2013; is real estate, so how much realistically could the provision go up in '10 and '11 even given the cycle off the 1.5 billion that you had in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have a forecast for what the provision is going to go up. I can tell you that in December when we showed you our outlook for 2010, and we don't have a 2011 framework here, Bob, for 2010 on real estate, basically we said that we thought you could end up with losses and impairments being somewhere between 1.9 and $2.9 billion in the real estate business for 2010. So that's a combination of what we've put on the books as provisions. What's left in the reserve will depend on the write-offs. But I think that's the range.</p>
          <p>If you look at the business loss, $1.5 billion this year, and the range included in that was about $2.2 billion of losses and impairments, and then for 2010 we're basically estimating the losses and impairments could be 1.9 to 2.9 billion, I think it gives you a range for how to think about how we're thinking about --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, apologize. What was the '09 summary and the 2010 summary for real estate losses and impairments? Just let me have those numbers again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>$2.2 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the point I'm getting to, Keith, is if you don't see a big increase in the losses and impairments in real estate, then out of the 11 billion in total provisions for this year and everything else coming down, why aren't we going to see a bigger drop in the overall provision for loss in Capital Finance in '10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at it, we've tried to give you a framework based on the framework of stressed cases in December that said the losses and impairments should be about flat in 2010. There could be an increase in real estate. And there could be stabilization in other places and there could be declines in other parts of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>And I think when you look at what we see on delinquencies and non-earnings, that's why we're basically cautiously optimistic. We think there could be some upside in GE Capital, Bob, but you're dealing with a call on future outlook based on what happens to unemployment, what happens to the real estate valuations, and you just got to be sensitive to that. I think we've given you a pretty good framework. I think we feel pretty good about it today, but there's a lot of activity that will happen between here and there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, a totally changed question. You talked about wins in big projects, Jeff. And yet the Koreans out there won a number of nuclear projects. I understand the pricing of those projects pretty aggressive. What are you seeing with regard to some of these big projects wins globally and are you seeing some pretty tough pricing environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Keith said it, Bob. I think the pricing of what's going in the backlog is still pretty attractive. I think the numbers for Energy was that gas turbines was up 1%. Wind was only down 1 or 2 %. Meanwhile, our deflation is very strong. So look, I think on balance we won the deals we wanted to win, and the margins and backlog are still pretty attractive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that bar chart on 2011. Appreciate it. On the Transportation business, when you look at what happened in the quarter, you said there was a $300 million charge. Could you just explain the accounting and what you're doing there? And then you said I think it's going to be flat next year. Is that sales or is that profits are going to be flat next year in Transportation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Basically when you look at our services businesses, we have to look at the lifetime revenue that we're going to get from our customers. We estimate the lifetime costs over these 10 to 12 year customized service arrangements. And what we had to do was update those estimates based on the activity we see, the utilization in the fleet, the costs that we have as estimates of what it's going to cost to keep the fleet running with whatever the productivity and efficiency and guarantees that we may have made. And as I said, over the last couple years we've done those reviews in Aviation and in Energy, and in 2009 we completed that review in Transportation.</p>
          <p>And basically with 5,000 parked locomotives and with the cost estimates of what we have for what we're going to need to do over time, we had to true up the cost estimate of the lifetime of those CSAs of about $300 million. That is not something that repeats. And when I said profitability for the business, we said they made about $500 million of op profit in 2009, and we expect the business to make about $500 million of op profit in 2010 on much lower locomotive volume deliveries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So even adding back the $300 million, you're still going to be down. On a core basis you're going to be down next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a core basis, we'll be down. But a lot of that $300 million &#x2013; some of that $300 million would relate to 2009 activities. Some of it might relate to prior periods as a cumulative catch-up, so hard to split it.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So they step some things. Shouldn't that be a tailwind to next year's profit?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It should be. But if you look at the locomotive delivery, Steve, if you --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's the answer to my question. That's great. And then on the GE Capital side, you're still deciding to prefund even though the capital markets continue to heal up. How much do you estimate prefunding in 2009 hurts your net interest margin? And when you look out in 2010, how much do you estimate? I understand you're originating more than probably we would have thought here in the fourth quarter, so you're starting to put some of the money to work. But can you give us an estimate of how much prefunding has been a headwind for the last year and maybe in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think first of all, everyone has recognized you've got to carry more cash from a liquidity perspective on how you run the business. I think the extra cash, the calculation we have is about $700 million of impact on GE Capital for the prefunding and the fact that we're carrying a lot of cash. We borrowed that money. We're not earning that same amount, obviously, on putting it to very safe and short-term places, so it's about $700 million.</p>
          <p>We're not going to continue to carry 60-plus billion dollars of cash. We're going to bring that down over time. But we've got quite a few debt maturities that we'll refinance. In the first quarter, we'll bring it down quite a bit actually. But &#x2013; excuse me. So on a year-over-year basis, I think it's in the run rate. It could be a little bit better, but last year it was 700 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then one more question, just price/cost; what was it in total for the company, the value gap in 2009, and what would you expect that to be in 2010?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, in 2009 I think was a very good year. It was probably in excess of $1 billion. In 2010, it will be a couple hundred million bucks, something like that.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Maybe just trying to gather up all the pluses and minuses versus where your thinking was in December. Very clear on GE Capital that you've got a little bit more positive there. Your numbers have come in. You've got better confidence there. On the Industrial side, Jeff, I thought I heard you talk a little bit more positively about the value gap in your opening remarks. But I think the 200 million or so is in line with where you were thinking before. On the Industrial side, what else has changed overall in terms of giving you a little bit more positive outlook on the 2010 picture?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, why don't I, Terry, &#x2013; I'll do some and then Keith, if you want to add anything. I would say that the &#x2013; I went through the value gap on equipment. I think you got to like the services orders and the services margins. Another part of the overall profit drivers are there. So I think that's quite encouraging.</p>
          <p>I think the second thing is, is the healthcare performance in the quarter. As Keith went through, it's just broad based both geographically and technically. So I think that's a plus. And then the third thing I would say, Terry, is that we did a lot of restructuring in the quarter. And as we're able to do that restructuring, that allows us to improve cost base in 2010 and beyond. So those would be the three things that I would talk about.</p>
          <p>I'd say the last thing is the orders in general were slightly better than probably we had thought about even in December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, maybe I can &#x2013; I'll add a little bit of framework. In terms of last year at year end we talked about the Commercial deliveries, Terry, that we had. And I'll lay those out by business.</p>
          <p>If you look at aircraft, in 2009 we had about 1,939 commercial engine deliveries. The 2010 plan has 1,846, so it's down about 5%. In 2009 we had about 915 military engine deliveries. In 2010 it's 874. It's down 4%. The outlook in Aviation is for equipment to be down. I think you've seen the spare parts order rates, and those are going to be a key determinant of how Aviation performs in 2010.</p>
          <p>For locomotives, it's a big change. I think in 2009, we delivered 511 locomotives. In 2010 right now the team is planning on 250. It's a very difficult environment in terms of equipment. I think the outlook for '12 and '13 looks great based on environmental standards that are going to come into place. But 2010, they're really going to be dealing with a lower volume outlook.</p>
          <p>And then Energy, 2009 we had about 134 gas turbines. 2010, the plan is somewhere around 117. And wind turbines are about flat. We had 2,633 units in '09, and we've got 2,616 in '10. So the units in Energy are a little more stable. So that helps to put a little bit of framework around what we think the volume is going to be in the major equipment drivers for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That does. And Keith, on the Aviation services and spares in total, that whole piece of the puzzle, are you expecting profit down in that piece as well, did you say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not in Services in total. I think if you look right now, for the year the commercial spares orders were down 4%. We've got a lot of &#x2013; it has been a tough year for aviation, right? but there are some positive signs. In the first three quarters of the year, revenue passenger miles were down; freight traffic was down. If you get into the last quarter, though, the last three months passenger traffic was up 0.3, 0.6, and 2.1%. Cargo grew almost 10% in November. Load factors have held up around 75%. And I think the main positive for us in Aviation if you think about it, we've got about 23,000 engines. We actually had 1,000 net adds in 2009 because our engines are going in and they're not the ones being retired. The less fuel efficient ones are the ones being retired.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And then, Keith, just on restructuring expense, can you give us the all-in dollar number for '09 and where that's pegged for 2010? It sounds like you may move that number higher over the course of '10, but maybe just give us the starting point thinking there, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In 2009, we spent $0.20 in restructuring and other charges. It was pretty split between Tech Infrastructure and Capital and C&amp;I and Energy and about 100 million in NBC. For 2010, we've got that down somewhere less than half of that. We have to see. We'll see what the projects are.</p>
          <p>We have pension going up. Pension should be up, and I think that's a little less than what people thought, about $1 billion pre-tax in 2010 versus 2009. That includes the impact of the discount rate and it includes the impact of the losses in 2008. That's about $0.07 after tax, so that's a good item. And then that gives us a chance to be able to be flexible as we see good projects, to be able to do restructuring. And we don't have a final number pegged, but we do have the opportunity to do more restructuring in 2010 to continue to work on the cost structure.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Keith, just to follow up on the restructuring question, what sort of a restructuring contribution are you guys expecting in 2010 based on the activities that you did in 2009? And a follow-up would be just are you expecting any kind of material compensation headwinds perhaps because you have to restore merit pay or anything like that this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I think all the compensation stuff is factored in to the way the plans that we've outlined. I think on restructuring, we basically get a two-year payback. So we ought to get $1 billion of benefits or something like that.</p>
          <p>I would say beyond that, if you go back to 2007 &#x2013; 2008, we also had pretty good restructuring in those years. And if you think about just base cost between &#x2013; if you go from 2008 to 2010, our overall base costs will be down 5 or $6 billion, something like that over that time period. At the same time, we'll have increased R&amp;D 7% in 2009 and probably 15% in 2010, so...</p>

          <p>I appreciate that. By the way, Keith, what's the outlook for &#x2013; or Jeff, what's the outlook for the gas turbine business in the US and possibly the wind business as well? If you frame it between what happened this year, your orders next year, just how do you see that business shaping up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say there's a macro and a micro there, John. I think the macro story is that gas and wind are the fuels of choice, right, and so there's always a lot of interest from the US utilities around both of those businesses. And then it comes down to the demand for electricity was down in '09. It's probably flat in '10. So where will the excess capacity be needed?</p>
          <p>And then the third part is just how many more projects like Caithness will we see vis-&#xE0;-vis US focus on green energy and renewable energy. I think there will be some of those in 2010. So I don't know, Keith, would you...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, at least for '10, that would be my sense, John.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask you just -it has been reported in the press, the proposed Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee. You guys didn't really talk about it. I don't remember what news service quoted possibly 800 million could be ascribed to GE Capital. What are you thinking about that or is it too soon to even talk about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say it's a little early. I think there's a lot of activity that still needs to go on that. Based on what we understand from the press conference and then there was a clarifying call this week, for GE Capital if this were enacted exactly as it's proposed, we would estimate that it would be about 500 million after tax impact on GE Capital Corporation for a full year. Our understanding is it's effective after June 30, so on a half year it would be about $0.025 if it were enacted exactly as proposed. And our expectation is that based on the outlook we have that we'd still be able to stick to our framework if that were put in place that way and still have GE Capital about flat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe just lastly, Keith, if I look at your 11 billion of net income this year, I think about 35% came from capital tax credits. Where do you guys stand in terms of the ability to maintain those credits call it in 2010 &#x2013; 2011? I'm presuming they can still be held relatively intact as long as there's offsets. Is that fair? Otherwise on paper it looks like these could be some significant headwinds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's true. We don't anticipate in the framework that Mike Neal and Jeff Bornstein laid out in December the tax credits being anywhere near that level. We had about 3.8 billion of tax credits, as you said, in GE Capital this year. It's not only from our structural benefits we have but also the fact that we have the losses in GE Capital, and it's the benefit of GE and GE Capital being together. We're able to offset those losses with our GE Industrial income from a tax perspective. We expect in Capital somewhere around $2 billion of tax benefits in the framework that Jeff Bornstein laid out in December, so it would be substantially less. And we absolutely believe that we will be able to continue to utilize all those benefits with the consolidation of GE and GE Capital without creating any deferred tax assets or anything like that.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Theoretically, in 2011 you're going to be dealing with pre-tax profitability in GE Capital that we'll end up with &#x2013; you're still going to get tax benefits from our structural benefits as long as the legislation that's in place today stays in place. But we expect substantially more pre-tax, which would in some ways lower the overall tax benefit at GE Capital, John.</p>

          <p>Of that, okay, just so I'm clear on that. And then secondly, in the wake of the Capital One call last night, it raised the question of the increase in the 166/167 reserves coming up, magnifying the sensitivity of loss provisions to improving economic conditions down the road; in other words, reserve release for private label credit cards. As you think about it going forward, how are you guys thinking about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Jeff Bornstein laid that out pretty clearly in December. We can go back to those charts. I don't have them in front of me, Steve. But the way 167 is going to work is we're going to put those receivables back on our books. We already have the retained interest on our books. We will have a charge to equity in the first &#x2013; January 1 as part of the accounting change to reflect the reserve posting associated with those receivables. And then we'll earn on the full balance as we go forward in the year that will more than offset the fact that we don't have securitization gains. So I think in total for the year it will be a slight net positive.</p>
          <p>We've already included from a capital ratio perspective a risk weighting on those assets in our ratios that this won't have a big impact on the ratios in terms of capital. We've accounted for those receivables in what we deal with the rating agencies and what we've thought about in terms of our capital ratios for the year for GE Capital. Jeff showed you what the impact was on those ratios, but I think...</p>

          <p>I think the question was more, was that, but also more the magnitude of the coming release. But basically you're saying it's no change from what Jeff shared with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in terms of the Healthcare business again, I'm just trying to get my head around the sustainability of those margins going forward of the incremental or the decrementals and the business. Can you just lay that out a little more in terms of not only did you see a really strong quarter but your expectation for sustainability as you look through 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I think the demand was so broad and deep; in other words, so many different geographies and so many different product lines that &#x2013; and the back &#x2013; call it the backlog was high, so the backlog build. That leads me to believe that the market has at least stabilized and might be improving and I think we've got a nice lineup of products.</p>
          <p>I think there's still &#x2013; look, there's still some uncertainty around reform and what it means and things like that. But if you go back to the meeting you guys had with John Dineen last fall, the average age of the installed base is old. Our offerings are strong. I think you have to at least be guardedly optimistic about how this business can perform in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There has certainly been some market paralysis based on all the discussion in the US about what's the reform, what are the changes in reimbursement going to be, what do hospitals plan on from a budgeting perspective. We certainly saw some of that free up with more clarity in the fourth quarter. And I think that just certainty around what the regime is going to be is a real positive as you look at the US specifically. Global growth was great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the market from a working capital standpoint, I think the team is executing better, and so I think our ability to sustain margins and cash are I think quite strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally on the capital allocation discussion that you put out there in terms of the cash you're going to put to use, can you maybe, Jeff, provide a little more strategic color again about how to think about what you will define as attractive in terms of acquisitions so that investors, we won't be surprised as you announce things over the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say is that the cash builds during the year. I think any acquisitions we do will be bolt-ons, and they'll have a good way to execute towards a 15% cash return by year five with experienced management teams and clear synergies both on costs and revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you say bolt-on, that means in your parlance smaller than what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I just &#x2013; I hate to limit it, Steve, but I just don't see us doing a big deal. I think they're going to be reasonable size, from a couple hundred million dollars to maybe a couple billion, in that frame.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe [Deutsche Bank].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It sounds like you had a fairly huge month in December for the major equipment orders, probably the CSA as well. How do we interpret that? Is this just customers holding back on their budgets until the last possible moment so is there a real improvement in the end market you're seeing? Maybe then has that trend continued into January?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think if you look at the long cycle businesses, there's anybody looking at their budget in the quarter when you buy gas turbines or aircraft engines. I mean these are long-term projects that people plan for and we're a piece of the scope. So I think if you look at the Energy business, if you look at the Oil &amp; Gas business, those are based on economic activity globally.</p>
          <p>Aviation, again, we're dealing with a phenomenon where we had such great orders over the last three years that the airframer backlogs are pretty much full through 2012 &#x2013; 2013.</p>
          <p>And then finally in Healthcare, I think you see a little bit of both, as Jeff said. I'm sure some people had budget money and they spent it, but that's not a driver of the overall orders when you look at major equipment orders for the company, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the uptick we saw, that's a real uptick and it should be sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's real global growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's real global growth, Nigel. We've tried to be in '09 and '10 appropriately conservative about what we see and when we see it, and maybe it's just some of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the comparisons back in '08 &#x2013; '07/'08 were just really a little lofty. I think these also &#x2013; we look &#x2013; while there may be a negative V on some equipment here, Nigel, these are very healthy levels for us to operate the business at when you look at these order levels when you have a negative V, but we can run the business profitably at these levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sure. And then on the Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee, first of all, Keith, you mentioned net of tax. Has that been clarified that that will be eligible for tax deduction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a conference call this week with the administration where that was clarified publicly is my understanding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then if it does come to pass in its current form, what are your options in terms of limiting that? I mean could you reorganize GE Capital offshore? Do you shrink the balance sheet more than you're currently guiding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are incremental things. I think first of all there's a lot of work to do in terms of what's the basis for this fee, if it's a TARP, a loss recovery, is it on financial services and auto. So there are some macro questions that I think need to be answered above what we're thinking about.</p>
          <p>I think at a GE level, some of this right now we've just calculated off our total liabilities except for our Tier 1 equity and our deposits, FDIC deposits. We've got TARP. We don't have any TARP, but we do have TLGP debt. We paid a fee on that. Does that get included in the base of liabilities or not? And then finally, the size of GE Capital. Obviously we're going to continue to shrink GE Capital. As we bring GE Capital down, that will benefit us. But again, I think those are around the edges.</p>
          <p>I think there's a strategic question about what comes out in the President's budget, what does the Congress pass, and then how does it get implemented by the regulators. There are three steps here that we're going to have to work our way through. We've given you, if nothing changes based on our understanding today without deducting anything out of the liability bucket other than what has been defined, $0.05 on a total year basis, $0.025 in the second half is our current estimate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just a couple quick ones here. First of all, if I back out the $300 million service true-down I guess within Transportation, it looks like you underlying margin is about 24%. Is that right? That's pretty remarkable at these kinds of volumes. Is that sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure if you back that out. Is that out of the Tech Infra segment in total?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's within Transportation. So if you add back the $300 million, I think you get a $150 million...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's also in revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's also in revenue. I think if you do it that way you'll get closer to their 17 &#x2013; 18% margin rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fine. And then if you can call out what the pre-tax was on the Fanuc gain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jeff. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, very good, just a couple questions. I don't recall ever hearing one of these adjustments in service like this. If it was, I don't think it has ever risen to this size. How frequently do these reviews take place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, in the size of Transportation, it's more significant, and that's why you're seeing it here in the quarter in that business. We basically over the last few years have done a complete review of all of our service contract businesses. We started in Aviation. We moved into Energy, and we completed those.</p>
          <p>Today, the process is on an annual basis. Every contract with a customer that has a CSA with us is reviewed. Usually it's about a quarter of the contracts each quarter. And we'll do a complete update of our long-term forecast of what the total revenue of the life of the contract and the total cost over the life of the contract are. And if it needs an adjustment, we make those adjustments every quarter. So they're more in the actual ongoing operations of Aviation and Energy. They're every quarter.</p>
          <p>In Transportation, our practice was not to do it on a contract-by-contract basis until this year. And in the fourth quarter, we said we've got to standardize this across the company of every business, do it the same way. And in 2010, Transportation will do about a quarter of its long-term service contracts every quarter and review them the same way the rest of the company does. So we've been going through this for a number of years. We haven't had in a business on a relative basis something of this magnitude, but we have had adjustments in both Aviation and Energy. Some of the adjustments in Aviation were back in some of our corrections we made two years ago, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the thing that just raises the concern is I just think about the demand destruction in electricity demand the last couple years. Has there been pay-as-you-go headwinds in energy on just lower gas turbine utilization? <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There have been and on the costs of the overhauls and everything. I mean if you look at the last several years, if you go quarter by quarter in Aviation, we've had periods in every quarter where we've had a little pressure in service costs. In Energy, we've talked about it. So yes, absolutely, every quarter those are looked at and adjusted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just moving on, I think price was addressed a little bit earlier on. Just looking at my notes, I think you guys said wind price was up 10% in Q3, and now it's down 2% in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you're dealing with revenue. The price in the backlog was very strong. The orders price in the fourth quarter was down two. So the backlog pricing in wind is very strong. The orders pricing for the year is about flat. In total in the quarter, it was down about two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so you still have positive price coming through backlog probably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And our material deflation, Jeff, is probably 4%, something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For next year. Right now, we've got about 1.5% this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So again, I think the value gap will remain positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then just on commercial spares, actually very strong performance, down four, and for the year I think you said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously you had very good utilization relative to what was being parked and what was not being parked. But was there any comparison issue there that creates any particular headwind into 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think if you look at the numbers that I'm giving you on spares rates, they take out the impact of any one-time order with Aviall or anything like that. The fourth quarter spares orders were $19.5 million a day. That was down 11 in the quarter; but for the year, as I said, down four at 19.4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And does the guidance in any way anticipate or allow for potential gains on security in NBCU? Would those be restructured or --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't have anything in the guidance on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And then finally, Jeff, I think you addressed it in December, and actually I'm just looking at my notes and I don't have it clearly. On your last slide, you talked about driving people to compensation as it relates to these metrics. Obviously, all we're seeing on the slide is the triple-plus for 2012. But what is it exactly that people will be compensated for and how are they being measured?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, we have a three-year long-term incentive plan, and so they've always been aligned with earnings per share growth, return on total capital, cumulative cash flow. And so those will be the metrics that are the backbone of it, and they will be reflected in the team with the double-plus and the triple-plus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are we going to know what those are though? Is that going to show up in the proxy? Are we going to be able to track and measure the company relative to that so we know how you're doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't looked at the proxy yet. We haven't historically done that, Jeff. But again, I just &#x2013; I want to make sure you get a sense that the people are very much aligned with what I would say will be a strong performance on earnings per share in the future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, that's right, the Fanuc gain is in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So basically it wasn't...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple hundred million dollars, otherwise it would be close to flat.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. On finance, a little bit higher level question I guess, but you're talking I think a little bit more optimistically than you had been about the commercial side, the commercial lending and leasing. But it sounds like consumer is more stable, not necessarily down next year, but fairly stable. Typically &#x2013; earlier last year and certainly when we talk to our finance guys, you would expect the consumer business to turn around faster and the commercial tends to be later cycle. Is there something different going on there or are the dynamics different this cycle or is it just your business mix; any thoughts there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're just looking at unemployment staying at around 10% and that's what keeps the delinquencies and keeps the non-earnings where it is. It hasn't crested over. I think if you look at the commercial side, we've actually seen non-earnings go down by $600 million in the quarter. We see delinquency starting to roll over. Basically we've dealt with the restructuring on quite a few of the early companies that went into distress as part of the recession, and that's starting to show some signs of improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We see both positive next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're both positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but was I wrong to say you perhaps were more optimistic on the commercial side or seemed a little bit more positive there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's more visibility on commercial outside of unemployment on consumer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think consumer actually was slightly better this year than we thought it was going to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure it was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think actually in some ways this is playing out. Some of it started in the second half of the year on consumer and will carry over. And then the commercial I think gets better during the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then last one. You talked a little bit in terms of cash deployment on the criteria that you might use for acquisitions. Are there particular broader business areas that seem more or less attractive going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we talked about infrastructure in general as being the sweet spot of the company, and that's where the capital will go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but within that just very broadly, not one particular part relative to the others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just our little secret.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Great, Noelia, I think that's the list of questions. We've gone through everything. Just to close out today, the replay of today's webcast will be available this afternoon. JoAnna and I are always available to take questions. Just to announce, our first quarter earnings release will be held on April 16, so please reserve that date. And thank you everyone for your time today.</p>
