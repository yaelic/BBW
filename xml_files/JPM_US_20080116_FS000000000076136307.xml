        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.  Good morning everybody, welcome to the call.  Thanks for joining us.  We are going to do the usual today.  I will run through the quarterly results by business.  I'm going to hand it over since it's the first call of the year to Jamie at the end to give a little bit of comments on what we see looking ahead and then we'll spend time answering whatever questions you have.  So again, please refer to the presentation that's on the website that I'll start going through now.</p>
          <p>So if we go right to page 2, we'll start, which is some overall comments on 2007.  So I'd say for my part anyway, it would be hard for us not to be pleased and satisfied with the 2007 full year results in light of the market and operating conditions we faced particularly in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>So to just hit the points here, we had record earnings for the year, 15.4 billion on record revenues of 75 billion.  EPS again a record &#x2013; also a record at 4.38, up 15% from 2006 on a continuing operations basis, and that really just means if you recall that in the fourth quarter of 2006 we had a 600 or so million dollar gain related to the sale of our corporate trust businesses to Bank of New York that was accounted in discontinued ops.  So, no difference between continuing ops and reported ops for 2007.  For 2007, we had a return on tangible common equity for the year of 23%.  As I've talked about recently, when you look at the wholesale side of the house, the Investment Bank, Asset Management, Private Equity, and Treasury &amp; Securities Services, return on capital in those businesses for the year together was 30%.</p>
          <p>And then talking about credit reserves.  So, through the P&amp;L we added $2.3 billion to bring credit reserves in total to $10.1 billion.  Now, just say that we always talk about managing through a cycle.  And so we remain focused on credit cost as a predictable part of the cost of business for us, and again, we spend a lot of time focused on improving operating margins over the past several years, so it's satisfying to be able to allow us to significantly increase the reserves as we did this year while still producing record earnings.  And so you see there what we think are strong reserve ratios across our businesses here at a pretty aggregate level, you will see more as we go through the businesses; 4 billion on the wholesale side or 1.67% of loans and on the consumer side 6.1 billion or just over 2% of loans.</p>
          <p>And so lastly, we're very pleased that we've done all of that while maintaining strong capital ratios.  So, you see we ended the year with a Tier 1 ratio of 8.4% and that is same as last quarter and actually same as we ended June 30 of the last year.  So a lot of focus across the firm on preserving capital and efficiently we are using the balance sheet and I'll spend a little bit more time later on that.  And all the while, we did that while continuing to invest in and grow across our businesses to build for the future.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter, I'm going to hit the businesses in detail.  So I'll just say here, mixed performance, earnings though $3 billion on revenues of 18.3 billion, and EPS of $0.86 for the quarter, down 21% from fourth quarter 2006 on a continuing ops basis, and a 17% return on tangible common equity.</p>
          <p>So now going to page 3, I won't spend time on this, you can just glance at it, but this is a quick look at the numbers that I just described for the full year of 2007 for the firm.</p>
          <p>And then again on page 4, it's a quick look at the same for the fourth quarter of 2007.  So, moving right now to our business results, let's start with the &#x2013; as we usually do with the Investment Bank on the fifth slide.  So here you see we had a net income of 124 million on $3.2 billion of revenues for the quarter, an ROE of 2%.  For the year, we had $3.1 billion of net income and a 15% return on equity.</p>
          <p>Moving down the P&amp;L for the fourth quarter, you see we had 1.7 billion of investment banking fees which were up 5% from a year ago and driven by record advisory and equity underwriting offset by lower on the bond and loan syndication side. For the year and you will see in the next page some details around this, we had a record year in investment banking fees of $6.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the next item, the circled number, $615 million worth of Fixed Income Markets revenues.  So let me just tick through some items here.  So, on the leveraged finance funded and unfunded commitments, which we talked about last quarter; we had a modest gain net of hedges.  I'll show you a page to go through the details there in a second.  On the subprime side, which is subprime positions inclusive of subprime CDOs, we had markdowns net of hedges of $1.3 billion and I'll have a page to go through the details there in a minute.  We also had a little bit of improvement, a gain of about 154 million related to the widening of credit spreads impacting the value of certain structured liabilities, and then that gets you back to about $1.7 billion worth of fixed income markets revenues for us, not as strong as we would like to see. And what's going on in those &#x2013; in the remainder there is additional pressure in the remaining securitized products business away from subprime and losses in the credit trading side were offset in part by very strong revenues in rates and currencies.</p>
          <p>In the Equity Markets business $578 million of revenue, down 40% from a year ago and up a touch from last quarter.  Some weaker trading result was the story there, partially offset by strong client flows in the quarter and again a little bit of revenue related to the widening of credit spreads on structured notes related to that business.</p>
          <p>Moving to credit costs, you see we added credit costs of $200 million which was largely or almost totally additions to reserves in the business which is really driven by growth in the loan portfolio.  Overall we ended the year with a 1.93 ratio of reserves to loans for the Investment Bank, and then lastly on the expense side, expenses down a bit year-over-year and &#x2013; but impacted in particular, see, by a true-up of comp expense where we had a 49% comp to revenue ratio in the fourth quarter bringing the full year to 44% on that line.</p>
          <p>Flipping to the next slide, slide 6.  Here Jamie can comment further on this a little later in his remarks, but I've got to say we're very proud of the Investment Bank's results here that you see on this page.  Steve, Bill and team have done a great job building the business over the last several years.  So you see on the right side the league table results and work down the page, you see that we either have leading or very strong positions all the way down the page and you see a circle in the places where we have grown share year-over-year.  So another great year after several before it in the Investment Bank on this score. And so it's not surprising to look at the left side of the page and see the external recognition that we've got particularly the recent Institutional Investor coverage where clients of ours named us the best overall investment bank.</p>
          <p>So flipping to slide seven and shifting gears back to what went on in the P&amp;L in the Investment Bank for the quarter, I'll start with the leveraged lending side of things.  Again modest gain in the quarter for &#x2013; in the Fixed Income Markets revenue line.  Let me just take you through the details of the remaining exposures and talk about where we're marked.  So if you recall last quarter we predicted or forecasted that if nothing got funded, if the market stayed closed we would end the year with 40.6, around $40 billion &#x2013; $41 billion funded and unfunded commitments was our expectation.  We did in fact close or distribute $16.5 billion in &#x2013; inclusive of some deals that went away.  So in the quarter we actually sold inside the marks or better than the marks we had put up last quarter which if you recall was a $1.3 billion mark taking the mark down to 4.9%.  So on what we sold in the quarter we did better than that, creating a little bit of P&amp;L pickup, but on what remained we ploughed back much of that money into lower marks on the 26.4 billion that we remain in exposure, funded and unfunded and so that gives us markdowns in excess of 6, close to 6.5% in the leveraged loan space.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the next slide, I'll take you through a little bit on subprime and subprime related.  Remember last quarter we &#x2013; just a little different than last quarter, where we captured all CDOs in one bucket here.  We are capturing all subprime exposure inclusive of subprime CDO on this page.</p>
          <p>So, here you see we had markdowns net of hedges of $1.3 billion.  Obviously here we've seen a significant deterioration in this asset class during the quarter. The $1.3 billion for us includes a write-down related to 1.4 billion par value of subprime CDO assets that we removed from two of our multi-seller conduits onto our balance sheet during the quarter.  These suffered significant markdowns in the quarter before we were able to put on any hedges there. And these were the only subprime CDO assets in any of our conduits and they are not going to be allowed in the conduits in the future. And importantly, with this action we're very comfortable with the remaining assets in our conduits and the ongoing conduit business plan, but obviously that is a major part, or is the major story in terms of the write-down we took in subprime CDO this quarter.</p>
          <p>You then see in the table we've tabulated here for you in the various buckets of risk categories or asset categories, $2.7 billion of remaining exposure in the asset class, and just note that against that we have about $2 billion worth of hedges and short positions.  So obviously these numbers we think are very manageable in context of the JPMorgan Chase, given the hedge position we have, we could make money or we could lose money here as we look forward. But the size is obviously something that we wanted to just give you a sense of &#x2013; manageable in our minds.</p>
          <p>And lastly on the Investment Bank, moving to slide nine, we just want to flag for you the size of our exposures in some of the other categories, which I know you have an interest.  So rather than repeat myself, if I work through the page, let me just make two points here.</p>
          <p>First, everything you see here is carried at fair value. So our fourth quarter P&amp;L that we already saw reflects whatever write-downs we think are appropriate given the spread widening we've seen in some of these asset categories during the quarter.  And the second point is that we actively risk-manage all of these positions, meaning that we may have first loss protection in some places, hedges, short positions, and others which again like I just said on subprime you shouldn't take that meaning we have neutralized all risk, just looking to give you some sense of size and dimension in these categories, which again we think are reasonable given the size of our investment banking company.</p>
          <p>So, starting at the top, CDO warehouse and unsold positions, so again this is largely our corporate loan and corporate bond CDO business and the warehouse related to that. So $5.5 billion of positions there easily marked by &#x2013; easy visibility into marks on this stuff, negligible subprime included in there.  Of the 5.5 billion above, again talking to risk management we have about &#x2013; significant first-loss protection against about half of it.</p>
          <p>Moving down to CMBS, we have got 15.5 billion of total exposure, 14.5 of that funded. The mark &#x2013; majority of this is stuff that's 64% AAA rated and again credit-hedged and risk-managed there that I don't try to describe for you but it exists.</p>
          <p>Alt-A, in the Investment Bank we get 6.4 billion of total exposure, 4 billion of securities, 2.4 billion in loans and you see that mostly highly rated or first lien positions in the case of the loans.</p>
          <p>Just to make a comment away from the Investment Bank in this category while I'm on it. Between the investment portfolio that we hold at corporate and our warehouses that we have in our retail mortgage business, there's $2.5 billion away from the Investment Bank number here related to Alt-A which we think is noteworthy and very manageable, noteworthy in that it's small relative to the size of the portfolio we hold at corporate and mortgage loans.</p>
          <p>Fair value accounting, last point here is that the &#x2013; obviously the addition of some more leveraged loans on to our balance sheet during the quarter.  And the movement of the Alt-A positions from observable to non slightly increased the amount of investment banking related Level 3 assets in the firm overall will likely move from 4% of total assets to 5 in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now moving on, I'll finish with the Investment Bank, let's move on to Retail on slide 10.  So Retail Financial Services as usual, let me just talk you through some of the drivers of what goes on, what's driving the P&amp;L that we will see on the next page.</p>
          <p>So here you see average deposits for the year-over-year up 4% to $209 billion, checking accounts up 8% to 11 million accounts.  And then related to that is just the improvement in sales productivity really through those branches with credit card sales up in the branches by 34%, mortgage originations up 4.</p>
          <p>Going to the home equity business, originations down 24% but average loans held up 12%. And I'm going to give you a page in a second that goes to the details on home equity.  Mortgage loan origination, as we talked about, great opportunity to use our balance sheet and capital strength to grow business.  That's going to be important to us over the long-term.  So you see we had a 34% increase in mortgage loan originations despite substantial cut backs in terms of our underwriting standards, and our market share in this space increasing to around 11% versus 6% a year ago.  So we feel very good about that.  And the mortgage loan serviced up 17%.</p>
          <p>Going on to slide 11 to the Retail Financial Services P&amp;L.  You see here we had profits of $752 million for the quarter, up a bit from a year ago. Moving through the revenue side, $2.7 billion worth of net interest income, up 5% from a year ago, reflecting higher balances and a little bit wider spreads and higher deposit balances as well. The $2.1 billion of non-interest revenue up substantially from a year ago.  I'll take that in two buckets.  You can see that lending and deposit related fees, asset management fees, and all other income, all up well into the double-digits and that's goes back to the growth in the branch system and the sales productivity of the branches that we've been talking about and investing in for a while now.</p>
          <p>The other big piece of noninterest revenue is the mortgage fee line. You see $888 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of '07 which included just about a $500 million write-up to the value of the MSR asset, which is really driven by the slowing of expected prepayments given less refi activity, given lower home prices.  So, and it's predictable dynamic on that score just given what we are seeing in the mortgage market.  We also had higher mortgage originations which I talked about on the prior page, driving higher production revenue in the mortgage side.</p>
          <p>Credit cost here, I'll spend a little time again on home equity and subprime in a second, but total credit cost of $1.1 billion includes some reserve additions in home equity and subprime as well as higher charge-offs, pretty much across the board, home equity, auto finance, and subprime mortgage where again you see a credit cost normalizing in all cases.  And expense growth really just related to the investment in the business that we have been talking about for many quarters.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 12, just goes back to the same slide of taking you through before on the home equity business.  So you see that the -in the upper left, the 30-day delinquency trend continues to march higher for the reasons we've talked about before.  In the upper right, you see the portfolio just shy of $95 billion and charge-offs stepping up as we expected from 150 to 248 in the quarter and a charge-off rate of 105.  So in the quarter as we did for two quarters prior to this given the continued increase in delinquencies, we've added $395 million to the reserves in the business to bring it to a total build of during the course of the year of just over $1 billion in the home equity portfolio. And that brings us to cover this for the increase in charge-off rate in the portfolio to somewhere in the range of 155 to 160. And we do expect to move up in the first quarter of forecasting something in the 140 or so range of charge-off rates in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>I won't go into the details below there, but again same reasons in terms of the layering of risk and home price appreciation declines that we've seen in various parts of the country that is driving this.  And along with that, though, as we've talked about before, a significant tightening of underwriting standards for production that we're doing today.</p>
          <p>Going to page 13, subprime mortgage similar trends again, 30-day delinquency has continued to march higher. The portfolio now at 15.5 billion, charge-offs is 71 for the quarter, and charge-off rate of 208.  Here we added a $125 million to the loan loss reserve for subprime.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 14, now I'll finish retail and move on to Card.  So Card Services, you see we have profits of 609 million, down 15% year-over-year with credit &#x2013; increase in credit cost really being the story.  For the year, we had 2.9 billion in profits and a 21% ROE.</p>
          <p>Average outstandings, you see the circled number 151.7 billion, up 3% and up 2% verses last quarter. Charge volume of 95.5, overall growth of 2% year-over-year, but an 8% growth in volume and it relates to actual sales.  And as we talked about before, with strategies that we implemented during the mid-part of 2007 to cut back on promo offers to gamers that's reduced our balance transfers.  That also has had an effect on end of period outstandings.  So you see growth from 152 to 157, but for that change in targeting, so it deeply would have been several billion dollars higher end of period outstanding.  So better underlying growth we see than what appears in the aggregate number.</p>
          <p>All that leads to the 6% growth in revenues; but going to credit costs, the real story here you see the 3.89 net charge-off rate in the quarter up from 3.64 last quarter and 3.45 a year ago and 30-day delinquency rates following a similar trend.  So, overall, credit cost of $1.8 billion again up 507 or 40% inclusive of the $300 million addition to the allowance for loan losses in this business as well as higher net charge-offs.</p>
          <p>Jamie will comment a little bit later on the outlook, but we &#x2013; as we've said before, we do see visibility into the first-half of the year where are we see charge-offs going to the 4.5% from the 3.89 plus or minus a little bit, and that's driven by the worsening trends in credit that we, or the normalizing trends really, that we saw in mid to late 2007, which includes higher delinquencies and losses in parts of the country that are suffering from the greatest pressure in home prices, same as we talked about last quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving on to page 15, in the Commercial Bank; $288 million of profits, up 13% from a year ago; 1.1 billion up profits on the year.  Average loans here of 65.5 billion for the quarter as of the end of the year, up 14%, and liability balance or deposits up 22%. So, a nice growth in the business driving the record revenue we had in the quarter of $1.1 billion really coming across the board but, particularly Treasury Services revenue, which is the cash management side and the lending side and a sequentially lower investment banking revenues.</p>
          <p>Credit costs here really just follow a little bit of addition to the reserves, very low charge-offs.  You see the charge-offs continue to be 21 basis points, which is running below the 50 to 75 we talked about as a normalized number for the business.  And with the reserves against &#x2013; additional reserves against the growth we've seen, we maintain a very strong reserve to loans ratio of 266 basis points in the business.  And on the expense side, you see the real improvement we have had in the overhead ratio, to 46% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 16, Treasury &amp; Securities Services; here again third quarter in a row record profits of $422 million, up dramatically from the year ago, 65%, and a pre-tax margin of 35% in the business.  Similar stories at Commercial Bank, growth in activities with existing clients and new business volumes helping to drive liability balances and assets under custody as indicators of the growth up 30 and 15% respectively.  So, overall, you get 26% growth in revenues in the business versus a year ago.  Market conditions obviously did help a little bit in the quarter with spread earned on seasonal deposits being helped a bit by market conditions and a little bit better revenues in securities lending as well.</p>
          <p>Asset Management on slide 17.  Again, a record profit in the business of $527 million, up 29% from a year ago.  Here again you see it's driven by the continued growth in assets under management which were up to $1.2 trillion or 18% from a year ago and I would just point you to the supplement that shows the positive inflows we have been seeing in the business up 33 billion for the quarter and 115 billion for the full past 12 months.</p>
          <p>Record revenues of 2.4 billion in the quarter, up 23% really coming across the board in the business, inclusive of strong performance fees, seasonally high in the fourth quarter and that's about half of the revenue growth we saw versus last quarter came in performance fees &#x2013; increase in performance fees.</p>
          <p>Lastly, on the businesses or the P&amp;L, let's go to Corporate on slide 18; here another strong quarter with in Private Equity with 712 million of Private Equity gains on a pre-tax basis driving Private Equity profits to $356 million.  And then in Treasury and Corporate Other, negative $93 million inclusive of some higher litigation expense related to some of the credit card litigations, but that's a net number of a few items there.</p>
          <p>Last page for me, let me tell you a little bit about the capital and reserve side, so you see on page 19, $89 billion worth of Tier 1 capital up from 81 billion a year ago and that's inclusive of $8 billion of share buybacks for the year, though as you know we substantially shut down the buyback program with only buying back less than 200 million in the fourth quarter to hold on to our capital, that allowed us to see &#x2013; you see the risk-related asset growth year-over-year 935 billion to 1.050 billion &#x2013; 1.050 trillion, sorry, and about 30 billion or 20 billion of growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.  So, we're there for our clients, growing our balance sheet, growing our business. Yet very pleased that we maintained the capital ratios, which we think are very important obviously in this kind of environment.</p>
          <p>The liquidity and funding position very strong for the company and as we've talked about business-by-business, it's all in the context of what we think are very strong allowance to loans ratios across all of our businesses and you just see a table at the bottom giving you a little bit of the trend of what's gone on.</p>
          <p>So, with that, let me hand it over to Jamie for any other comments on the fourth quarter and then '08 outlook.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, thank you very much.  We go to page 22, you can follow along with some of my comments.  I think this is a difficult year for analysts because you all are going to have to be making a lot of your own assumptions about what you think the environment is going to bring.  So, I am going to separate my comments a little bit into what we know and what we actually see, and then the things we obviously have to be thinking about, about the future.</p>
          <p>In Investment Bank, it's an uncertain environment.  It changes by the week and by the month and obviously we pay a lot of attention to it.  Mike took you through some of the large positions which are liquid, largely hedged, though the syndicated leveraged finance positions are idiosyncratic so they are not largely hedged.  And, those are largely liquid positions.  I would point out, while the hedging is there and we actively try to handle all of that, you can lose money on the asset side and hedge side all at the same time because they are not perfect hedges.  And I think one of the key points, Mike, to this notable is that some of these positions just aren't that big risky particularly anymore, the subprime or the subprime CDO.</p>
          <p>Equally important, and I think we don't normally put a marketing slide in our investor presentation but the slide that Mike showed of our positions in &#x2013; around the world in underwriting, debt equity, fixed income, you name it, it is &#x2013; the most important thing we do in the Investment Bank is build all the time to serve corporations, institutions, and investors around the world.  And, we don't normally rely on anecdotal evidence, the II [Institutional Investor] survey, which just surveyed 350 CEOs and CFOs around the world, we were &#x2013; said we are the number one investment bank based on reputation, consistency, innovation, et cetera, and you see that in the numbers in the market share.  Another survey, which I don't think is on that page, which is &#x2013; about six months ago is, Greenwich did a survey on Fixed Income sales and service and research, and again we were number one, two or three in most of the categories.</p>
          <p>We have a good management team, they are disciplined, they pay a lot of attention.  I think we told you a while ago that we are going to build a mortgage business and we weren't going to try to pick the cycle.  We didn't obviously.  Maybe we could have paid more attention but I would tell you we are going to build one of the best mortgage businesses on the street.</p>
          <p>And so we are going to continue to build this business.  We are really proud of the progress across the board.  We think in the environment with so much of people and we have a lot of stability, we can just keep on marching step-by-step ahead to make it a great company.</p>
          <p>One other comment on the syndicated and leveraged finance, there is a small chance we are looking at moving $5 billion &#x2013; up to $5 billion from held-for-sale and held-to-maturity. The reason I am pointing it out is because we are doing a long-term investment.  At some of these prices we think that some of those are very, very good and we will rue the day that we sold them.  So we are still thinking about it and for no other reason than making a good long-term investment.</p>
          <p>And the Investment Bank, I just want to comment again on what we call normal cyclicality.  And I think it is true for all of our businesses, you have to manage all these businesses knowing there is going to be a cycle and I think it's very hard to always be surprised when a cycle starts.  We shouldn't be surprised.  We know them and we try to build them that way and we understand and we want the management teams to think about it that way.  In the Investment Bank and we still think these numbers are good.  And we would hold to our 20% ROE on average through the cycle, which means 30% in really good times; hopefully 10%, no worse than 10% in a bad year and no worse than 0% in a quarter.</p>
          <p>And what you did see is the first half of the year we were at 30% and in the second half of the year we were at &#x2013; I think we averaged around 4 and obviously maybe we would have liked to done a little bit better than that, but we still think those are kind of guidelines you should look at.  It is a cyclical business; it always has been; it always will be.  There should be no surprise about that.  And we still would expect some of that.  I think you will have to make your own forecast about the profitability over the next few quarters of investment banking, you know the volume, the liquidity, et cetera.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Retail Financial Services, Mike went through the home equity reserves.  I do just want to point &#x2013; I will not go through them again that for all consumer credit and I think we have pointed out consistently that we see in auto, home equity, subprime, credit card that where home prices are down, delinquencies, charge-offs are going up.  And so, we've kind of been preparing for that, thinking about that and trying to build that into some of our models and that's what you see in home equity and I hope we are getting to the end of this, but this is certainly higher than we would have expected even at the peak of the cycle by the way.</p>
          <p>In retail also, we are going to continue to build; we are going to open branches where we can and should.  And I don't want to mask again here the fact that the underlying numbers are just terrific, from the investment sales to credit card sales to opening branches to adding bankers to refurbishing the branches; checking accounts up 8%; credit card sales up 34% in the branches.</p>
          <p>And we are going to continue to grow the mortgage business.  I think we had told you three months ago or six months ago that we are going to try to gain share in the mortgage business and that you might be able to accuse of having done it too early here to.  I think you could now accuse us for that because we do know that some of the stuff we did in the first and second quarter we probably would have &#x2013; which we hadn't done.  On the other hand, our share in the mortgage business has gone from 6% to 11% and we are going to continue to try to build it in the right way.  It is one of the largest markets in the world.  It is a necessary product for consumers.  We do it the right way.  And so we are going to continue to build this business even if it causes a little bit of problems in the short run.</p>
          <p>And credit card, Mike mentioned visible losses that I think of the next two quarters of 4.5% percent.  I think after that we don't know and it really does depend on the economy and unemployment levels, et cetera.  I think we mentioned at one of the prior analyst meetings that if you roll through just what we know about home prices and I think they are worse than the numbers you see.  I think they always lag &#x2013; they don't capture all of the down price in home prices.  That would bring you to at least 5% by the end of the year and that's without a recession, so that's kind of in my mind where we are kind of planning for in the company.</p>
          <p>Overall, again I don't want all the conversation here about the issues and problems in consumer recession to mask that we are growing TS&amp;S, Asset Management and the Commercial Bank.  And just to give you some numbers which we really are happy with, Commercial Bank with loans up 14% year-over-year, deposits up 22%.</p>
          <p>Asset Management; assets under management up 18%, loans were up 13%, deposits were up 26%.  They added 200 bankers during the course of the year and we think we are adding really great people.</p>
          <p>TS&amp;S deposits up a staggering 30%, custody &#x2013; assets under custody up 15%.  So these businesses record or near record profits almost quarter-by-quarter and we are going to continue to grow them.  Obviously they could be affected by the economy, but we are going to continue to grow them.</p>
          <p>I just want to point out that both TS&amp;S and Asset Management, there's a little cyclicality between the fourth quarter and the first quarter which you should probably build in to your models and I think Mike mentioned the factors why.</p>
          <p>Private Equity, we had just an outstanding year.  I think our folks at One Equity Partners took advantage of &#x2013; when they saw an active market they sold some assets; we had $4 billion of profits.  We have told you a more normalized, would be a lot lower.  So the year before that we were 1.3 billion.  We don't really have visibility into what this is and we obviously tell the folks there to do what maximizes investment values.  So it's going to be volatile by quarter, a lot of you have 300 million a quarter in your model, it could be a little bit lower because I think we have kind of brought forward a lot of the gains in the year.</p>
          <p>And Treasury/Corporate, same kind of loss, 50 to 100, that's unallocated corporate overhead, et cetera.</p>
          <p>Maybe the most important thing, we have &#x2013; if the economy weakens from here, you should expect in I think all of these businesses, the credit losses will start to go up.  You're going to be reading a lot about how loan loss reserve is adequate and what happens to business bonds; we all could be affected.  And so we're not predicting a recession; it's not our job.  But we are prepared in almost every way possible to the extent that we can see it.  And we've always believed in a fortress balance sheet.  We don't believe in a fortress balance sheet because we have a philosophical bent to be conservative, we think it's a strategic imperative and you see it in environments today.</p>
          <p>We believe in strong loan loss reserves to the extent you can.  And accounting rules make it hard sometimes to do that, but the Commercial Bank at 2.68%, I would say is as high as anybody in the business.  The Investment Bank is now almost 2%.  I think large corporate losses are very idiosyncratic and they could be kind of large and lumpy but the 2% is a healthy number.  We've increased credit card loan loss reserves.  We've increased home equity loan loss reserves and obviously if things get worse, then may be more but we feel pretty good about the position there.</p>
          <p>So this company &#x2013; we end the year thinking that we've done &#x2013; the other thing I should mention is important, the systems, the back offices, the branding, the reputation, we're getting stronger and better in every way.  So whatever the environment holds, we think we're going to build one hell of a great company here.  So I will stop there.</p>
          <p>One other thing, we do have an Investor Day.  It's February 27th, starts at 9 o'clock, goes to the end of the day.  The whole management team will pretty much be there to take you through all current issues and facts.  So please come by and we'll try to talk &#x2013; and everything that's on your mind.  So we'll stop there and Mike and I will be happy to take questions at this point.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there.  I heard your comments loud and clear on balance sheet rising due to facilitating clients especially when I think competitors are on their heels.  But in terms of &#x2013; I think there's a 35% year-on-year increase in trading assets and we still have the same 21 billion allocated, to the &#x2013; equity allocated to the IB. Do I need &#x2013; does that need to change or is that just inter-department accounting and I shouldn't get too caught up on it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't get too caught up on it.  You're right to see that the leverage has increased.  We look at that relative to like a rating agency would and you have seen leverage of investment banks picking up so we take that into stock.  But as we look ahead we'll definitely be looking at capital in a possible two worlds against all our businesses.  You know the theme which is that hold the amount of capital in each business related to what each of them would need if they stood alone and needed to get a single A rating.  So that's still the framework that we think about but you're right to point out that as the environment evolves that could lead to changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Cool.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we did consider that in leaving the number flat this past quarter, these past few quarters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  And then Jamie, you've been abundantly clear over the last couple of years about what you would and wouldn't do.  I think we've seen a lot of investments and financial companies that are on their heels from all around the world.  So, as the environment thinks, you're doing a great job building your own business organically.  You have the capital ratios and reserve ratios that you talked about contain all the exposures. How do you think about timing given the outlook that you just described in terms of you too partaking and troubled but still good franchise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in terms of either buying assets or buying companies we are very open-minded and if we think we can do the right kind of due diligence and understand the values and that we're giving the value that we're getting, we'd be very happy to do it. This environment doesn't change that at all, it just may make it more likely</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's cool.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you said it well, Glenn, I mean the first priority is to use our capital and balance sheet floor to build our existing businesses, meeting client needs across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Well, that's clearly happening.  Last just follow-up on your comments on potential for 5 billion or so going from held for sale to held for maturity you said. What type of assets are those and what would be the theoretical accounting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are the assets that in syndicate leveraged finance of 26 billion that Mike spoke about and what I'm saying is that at these price levels we think some of them may be terrific long-term assets to hold.  And so since we have the capital we might very well &#x2013; and we will try and look at the ones we think are good long-term investments, hopefully recession-proof and the accounting is simply that you move it over to &#x2013; fully disclose and all that &#x2013; you move it to held for maturity and there will be no &#x2013; market or fair value and then over time you have to build up proper loan loss reserves against those and we would fully disclose that so that there's no issue about what that did to the company.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you comment just more broadly on consumer credit conditions?  I think you're guiding credit card losses to be 50 to 100 basis points higher than you were before but you said that's without a recession.  So what do you think the root cause is for these consumer losses getting worse at an accelerating rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have to remember credit card was always kind of abnormally low so part of what you have seen, we think is the catch-up to getting back to more normal.  Forget everything else.  The second effect is that in HPAs where price is down, think of California, Arizona, Miami, Michigan Ohio, we have seen that credit card delinquency losses simply going up so where we have real visibility we know it's going to get hit 4.5% or there about in the first and second quarter.  We are obviously a little less certainty about the second quarter.  What I'm saying is I believe that home prices are worse than people think.  That's my own personal belief, okay, just looking at numbers and thinking of lags and what goes in those things and that therefore if you kind of roll that through, while there's nothing in current data that shows it, I think that more likely that will be 5% by the end of the year and that is barring a real recession.  Remember in the credit card and consumer business on top of all this other stuff we talk about which is normally driven credit losses, real cyclical credit losses is unemployment.  I think that will still be a factor to see unemployment going up on top of this other stuff.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Charge-offs. You were already at 71 million in fourth quarter, so is that part stabilizing or is that unique?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we can actually, the additional reserves contemplate real increase of call it 40 million a quarter, Mike so that is a little bit of noise in the numbers so we put them on the page.</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reserve is for losses higher than what we are currently running at, by a little bit.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if I could follow up to your other answer about acquisitions.  You said it's more likely, is there preference to troubled situations or healthy firms U.S., non-U.S.?</p>

          <p>Hi, guys.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to follow up on consumer credit and sort of the outlook ahead.  Now, you had given us some expectations of 250 to 270 million a quarter of write-offs in home equity and this quarter you came in at 248, so sort of inline with the guidance but I think if I translate your 155 to 160 loss rate ahead into something else that could speak to maybe an extra 100 million or so quarter of losses which presumably we would then see reflected directly in the P&amp;L. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, like I said we do see in the first quarter, Guy, losses ticking up from the level they are at to something like 140 to 150 from what was it?  A 105 charge-off rate in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That is what you said, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so that -- we do see a tick-up from the level we are running at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reserves would be sufficient if we stabilize ultimately at a charge off rate in the 155 to 160, so that's the way to think about the guidance there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so if we don't stabilize at that level we could probably anticipate provisions would be higher ahead but otherwise the provision would still show up probably in the 250 to 270 a quarter, range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The provision will equal charge offs in the near term but that is the way to think about whether we would need to have future reserves ever is if we saw the stabilized rate going through those 155 to 160 numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And you had spoken at a conference a couple of months ago in Boston about loss rates, the delinquency in loss rates spiking specifically in home equity from the third party originated area.  Can you give us any kind of update on how that's performing relative to your self-originated portfolio and at this time would you be willing to give us some color as to what percentage of your portfolio is originated away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at home -- first of all this is a lesson that's been learned over and over about broker originations and how much worse they perform than our own originations.  If you separate home equity into, we call it kind of good bank, bad bank and broker.  So I would say it is about, it's less than 20%.  But a lot of the losses are coming from that 20% which is high LTV, broker-originated business. Stated income, high LTV broker-originated business. The high LTV business is also bad in our own, but I would say if you look cell by cell it's probably two or three times worse, any broker cell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the 20% you referred to a minute ago in round numbers is the sort of specifically high LTV and originated away; is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's been very consistent, okay.  In both our own originated and brokerage originated, high LTV, stated income is bad.  It is 3 times worse in broker than it is on our own.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And Charlie I think made a presentation that actually showed people some very specific numbers and so if people are interested you can call Julia Bates and actually kind of get those charts that he did when he made a presentation about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and then if I could switch for a minute to the Investment Bank.  Obviously there is rising concern about the credit default swap market and that's a product that in many ways you originated.  What have you done in recent months to make sure that your counterparty risks there are well controlled and what you want them to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one of the good things that has kind of been tested a little bit in the market here is the problems you didn't see happen.  And one was in derivatives.  That would have been something a year and-a-half ago that people had said watch out for derivatives and that wasn't what happened.  I think we do a very good job having collateral against old derivatives including CDS, marking the CDS, making sure the counterparties are good, and but obviously there is a risk in that. And I think you know, I guess it was Bill Gross who pointed out part of the risk is the operational side. What happens when these things actually are called upon. So like a couple years ago we had a couple of examples, I think it was Collins &amp; Aikman and Delphi and stuff where you had to settle large CDS positions, in fact they were much larger than the outstanding bond positions and you know the Street came up with a procedure to do it that worked fairly well and was fairly consistent and when, if it happens that there is going to be a lot of it there will be winners and losers in that like in anything else.  I think if you have good counterparties, if you know your collateral, if you are marking the stuff all the time you will be much more okay than anybody else.</p>

          <p>No, we &#x2013; so this is a very complex subject so I'm going to separate it into two pieces, okay. What I'm going to call primary risk, which is where we have it, need it, own it, direct exposure to monoline.  I think we are kind of okay and that's including everything you could mention.  And, but kind of okay -- there are exposures there and so I want to be careful.  I wouldn't say there are none.  What would worry me far more is if one of these entities doesn't make it is kind of the impact on markets and people who won't be able to own certain bonds or will have to sell certain bonds on the auction-preferred market and all these various things, kind of the secondary effect which I think could be pretty terrible but it is really hard to predict where and how that would happen through the system.  But our direct exposures, you know we think we have some, but think of them as almost normal credit exposures.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning.  Couple of the other banks are showing some trouble in commercial real estate and their exposure to home builders, residential construction, your commercial banking results look pretty strong.  Could you just comment on maybe how you have avoided some of the issues in commercial real estate, and Mike, have you disclosed your exposure to residential construction in CRE?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, John, we have been talking about for a couple of years now how we have been very cautious in commercial real estate.  It was an easy place to book loan growth.  So I would say we lagged behind what was going on there.  So Todd Maclin and team have done a good job there.  Overall size of the outstandings in all real estate and the commercial bank, about $7 billion, about $2.5 billion of that related to residential side.  So again, a lot of focus on the space, but we think we're size wise, again, not out over our skis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Mike, any other comments about expense trends in the fourth quarter?  The comp is up in the Investment Bank, you trued that up, but it seemed like overall expenses are up a decent amount in the fourth quarter.  Was there any other true-ups across the company?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they mentioned the litigation expense in corporate, a couple hundred million dollars of litigation expense higher on the corporate side, and then I think you saw comp expense in the Investment Bank, comp expense in the Asset Management business and no other big trends for me to point to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is there any outlook you can give in terms of how you think about comp expense in the Investment Bank next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'd say &#x2013; you know, we talked about a 43, 44% comp to revenue ratio in 2000 and &#x2013; 42, 43 I think it was.  So we ended the year with a tough year-end revenue environment going up to 49, bringing us to 44% on average for 2007, and we'd say, you know, a number in the similar range is the best way to think about '08, you know, 43%, plus or minus a little bit.  But it's going to be highly dependent upon the revenue environment and the actual market environment when we get to the end of the year next year and look to what proper pay needs to be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  I would just like to dig in a little bit on the reserving methodology and analysis.  I know there is a lot of moving parts in here.  But, you know, my basic question is how far ahead of what you are experiencing can you be with the reserve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Betsy, I mean you are embedding everything you know today about what's going on in your portfolio.  So, you know, Jamie mentioned, you know, we've got the -- recent trends we see in delinquencies and what's going on in various different geographies with weak home prices.  So you have seen us quarter to quarter to quarter taking that and factoring it into our forward expectational losses that we have in the portfolios that are on the books as of now, and topping up reserves to cover you for that, and then telling you what we think the amount of charge-off ratio that reserving covers us for.  So that's the 155 to 160 as an example in the home equity portfolio versus this quarter's 105 rate.  So, the real question goes back to Jamie's original point, is everybody needs to take their own view about how bad housing conditions get versus the trends we already see and also what goes on in the broader economy that could affect just how deep we go in terms of credit pressures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one of the challenges we have is what's viewed as a little bit of a different regulatory environment prior to &#x2013; as opposed to prior cycles.  And you know, from our seats what we have are things like you mentioned, what are your inputs going to be on the economy, et cetera, but we also have what kind of portfolio you have and what type of reserving you have done in prior cycles.  Is it fair to look at prior cycles, and I am talking about not only, '01/'02 but the early '90s and I realize that the company is very different from that so you would have to take a view on the piece parts that you were back then. But is it reasonable to consider, you know, a prior cycle piece in that type of analysis that we need to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you know, I think we &#x2013; first of all, you could assume that we try to be as conservative as we could be on loan loss reserving, and, you know, I could give you a lot of complaints about the pressures put on banks not to reserve, to reserve, the regulators want X, the SEC wants Y, et cetera.  But we try to be really conservative, really transparent.</p>
          <p>We have been talking about the cycle -- forget -- I wouldn't go back and look at what the company did before &#x2013; about what is reasonable cycles.  We've actually shown you all in prior things what we think the cycle could be. Okay, so, on credit cards, we have said the normalized is X and the cycle could be 50% higher. In home equity the normal is X and that we thought we were below that. In fact, we always -- we knew &#x2013; I think we told people that we thought we had the most benign consumer and wholesale credit environment that we will ever see in our lifetimes in '06 and early '07 and we were trying to prepare for that.</p>
          <p>So loan loss reserving just simply follows charge-offs. You could think of it very simply &#x2013; if your loan losses are going to go to X, well your reserves have to proportionally go up to X. And so, you know, one of the problems in the business has been that when charge-offs go up, not only do you have higher charge-offs you've got to add to loan loss reserves.  Then people question are other people properly &#x2013; not just capitalized but are they properly reserved.  And I would say relatively look at our numbers, we are almost 2% in the Investment Bank against loans.  We are 2.6% in the &#x2013; over -- almost 2.7% in the Commercial Bank against loans, I mean most regional banks are 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4.  And so, we're trying to &#x2013; we try to do everything we can to protect this company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You know it's clear that you are in a much better position than peer group and to your point -- our issue is where do we think we are going, is it a slowdown, is it a mild recession, is it a deep recession, that's for all of us to consider --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but that's &#x2013; you'll have different opinions on that.  That's why I said it's a tough year for analysts. You have to make clear what you think because that's going to drive someone's forecast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Just separately, on CDO valuations, I know it's a small issue for you but I just want to understand, you know, the consequences of something that happened last night, S&amp;P revised down expectations as to how they're analyzing subprime -- or MBS and subprime CDOs and I'm sure you saw that.  Does that have any implication for how you value your CDOs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, positively not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you just give us some color on why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because again they're a day late and a dollar short, you know.  So we look at, and take subprime, we have our own underwriting. And we know by the vintage, by the type, by the LTV, by the location, by the MSA, we make our own forecast about what is going to happen to real delinquencies, real roll rates, real charge-offs, real recovery rates.  And so if you take &#x2013; and we don't have that much left anymore so hopefully we don't have to talk about this very much more in the future.  So if you take the subprime we know, we have been talking being about the delinquencies being much higher for a long time.  So we take all that, we make our assumptions, we discount at high rates and that is how we come up with our number.  And I think it already incorporates what you heard from S&amp;P.  But you know again it is very idiosyncratic. You have some subprime ABS out there that was well underwritten, not broker, et cetera, et cetera, with a loss &#x2013; you know, cumulative loss rates with the &#x2013; you know, 7% to 10%, which is much higher than they originally were estimated and you have some others out there where they could be north of 20%, and that is what S&amp;P was saying.  The market already priced a lot of that in.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I had a question on, about a detail you provided on page 12 on the home equity slide, and that relates to mortgage, but I really wanted to focus on the prime book.  You had said that some of the problems were based on the over reliance on FICO and underlying property values.  How much have you protected yourself or is it too late to protect yourself from what you thought was a prime loan that has a prime FICO score that the LTV has just run away from you and the rest of the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you live with what goes on with what you have originated and address it as it relates to your new production Meredith, build in bigger cushions and therefore willing to originate at lower LTVs than we were before, but once it is on the books we don't, we just try to manage it through mitigation, that more than anything else.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  But in terms of the, you know, you guys take an incredibly detailed approach to your underwriting and certainly your accounting.  But it seems as if the delta of change, sorry, the delta of loss rates has accelerated beyond anyone's expectations.  So, and faster than your provision rate.  So will you look back a quarter from now and say, well, things have changed so much more materially, in terms of, can you sequence what has gone on in the last three months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we &#x2013; what we see in the last three months we've built into the projections, why we have upped the reserves.  Could it get worse from here?  Yes it can.  Are we saying it is going to?  No, we don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So and then the follow-up question is the thing that struck me as most concerning was the American Express announcement last week that said that they saw a rise in delinquencies across every bucket, and I know you had said that clearly the states that have the higher home price declines are showing evidence of the higher loss rates.  Can you comment on general trends outside of those states, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Outside of where, first of all, there's very few home markets now, that are not down, okay.  So I think in the top 20, the latest numbers are 17 are down and three are up, and the three are like --.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously some are more extreme than others, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but I think those are probably down now, too.  So where home prices weren't down, you didn't see a lot of changes in delinquencies and loss rates, that does not mean it is not going to happen, that's why I say I still think it is not recession-proof.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, I guess a follow-up on that, to Meredith's question.  My first would be what type of home price depreciation are you guys factoring in to your loss assumptions that you are giving?  And I guess the piggyback to her question is, you know, just given the acceleration in the delinquency trends and loose underwriting standards that had taken place in the mortgage world, what gives you the level of comfort that these models are going to hold up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you say we're building in, I would tell you, again that's why I was very careful about the visible versus guessing.  Your guess is as good as our guess about future home prices.  But we are being a little conservative and assuming that they still continue to go down in terms of our reserve, and I was using a number like 5 or 10%.  But honestly, it is just as much as your job to guess what that's going to be as it is our job to guess what that is going to be.  The second part of your question is what again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the acceleration that we are seeing in the delinquency trends in home equity and, you know, given some of the loose underwriting standards that we have seen in the mortgage world, what gives you the confidence that these kind of models care going to hold up in this environment?  And I guess just a follow-up to your question, just so I understand, you are assuming 5% type of home price deterioration, further home price deterioration in your models?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You know, I think if you go to traditional underwriting, you know, when you have, home equity has been around a long time and FICOs and stated incomes, and you go back to very traditional, you know, 80% or 85% LTV, you are much more rigorous on appraisal and stuff, you probably are making pretty good loans at this point and we are willing to make that bet.  So we are doing that in home equity, we're doing it in subprime, we're doing a whole, in jumbo loans, et cetera, it does not mean that there is a severe recession.  You might wish you didn't make those loans.  But, you know, we like the business, and we've just gone back to kind of old-fashioned tougher standards.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then my follow-up relates also to the mortgage business and you have talked, acknowledging about how you want to continue to grow that business and build that business and you have done a very good job of that organically.  Is that something that you are going to continue to focus on in terms of organic growth or given some of the carnage that's out there, is that an area of focus for you guys as well in terms of inorganic growth there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's organic, because we have a boundary, we're putting jumbo loans in our balance sheet, and the new subprime which I think, again I probably was wrong with the first quarter, but I think that this quarter the vintage &#x2013; one day will be right that this vintage will be good. And so we're going to use our own balance sheet, we are building our own systems, the folks in mortgage have hired a lot of &#x2013; and moved around a lot of sales people.  We are doing far more production of our own retail branches and so we're just going to continue to build organically.</p>

          <p>A quick question for you, Jamie in light of what's happened with Citigroup and the fact that Bank of America seems to be more or less leaving the Investment Banking business you are kind of the last universal bank left, and I think probably the most ardent proponent of that model.  Do you see the allocation of resources within your bank changing as a result of what's happened in the last few quarters or are you kind of happy with where you are right now and you are going to go on with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know honestly what a universal bank means, and I've never been a proponent of universal banking.  I'm a proponent of serving the customer really well.  And I think that the businesses we have, and there are a lot of what I would call natural linkages and natural product sets, and I've always hated the word cross-sell because it sounds unnatural, but our retail branches serve consumers, small businesses and middle market across a broad variety of bench products.  That's what a bank does, I remind people that five of our business lines other than the IV are done at the average regional bank.  So we didn't invent putting those five businesses together TSS, Private Client, middle-market, small business, consumer.  They have been together for eternity, and to me the question is can you do something for the client better, faster, quicker cheaper, not because you simply like it.  And so we are going to continue to build our client businesses.  We think we've solved everything that doesn't fit.  We don't really see that people talking about we needed a leg or not.  We normally see a need for another leg.  We think we can expand these businesses for the foreseeable future and if, somehow we are wrong and the world changes and we think this is a strategic misfit then we should reconsider that.</p>

          <p>It seems that the Commercial Bank which, I know you have been emphasizing the commercial bank over the past couple of years, but it kind of has gotten lost in the crush of everything else there.  It seems like it's -- one of your best performing units at this point.  Do you see more capital being allocated to the Commercial Bank going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean to the extent they can use it.  So you know the Commercial Bank does a lot of investment banking business now.  They have started a &#x2013; what we call Chase Capital, but think of it as kind of a mezzanine investment, they've put on $700 million of loans.  And I think the folks have done a great job growing the bank, but growing it carefully with a real conscious eye on credit.  And I think these markets will just play to our strengths.  We could do more for the clients, we could be very competitive on prices, we could bring them things that other banks can't bring them like, checking accounts in China if they need that you would be surprised how many middle market accounts need that now.  And so yeah, as long as they can do it and do it well, we would happy to give them capital.</p>

          <p>This is the final piece of the question.  Does the core deposit base i.e., the retail generated core deposit base need to be significantly bigger to kind of support the plans, the growth plans you have going forward?</p>

          <p>I don't think so.  And I think, we want it to be bigger, that's because we like it.  I don't think it is needed to support the growth trends going forward, no.  If you look at this company, I mean we are deposit rich.  I mean, take just the Commercial Bank.  If my numbers -- if I remember correctly, $66 billion of loans $95 billion of deposits.  TS&amp;S, $250 billion deposits, so we are probably the largest corporate depository in the world because, and as long as we are sound and strong, we will always be able to attract cost effective deposits.  And obviously we love the retail bank to close as aggressively as it can.</p>
