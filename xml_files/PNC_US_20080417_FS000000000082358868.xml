        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bill, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today.  This was a solid quarter for PNC as the fundamentals of our businesses performed very well.  In an extremely difficult market, we remained focused on our strategies for growth.  We grew average loans, deposits, and assets.  We saw a record in net interest income, strong fee income, and our margin improved.  Equally important we grew our diverse revenue streams faster than expenses creating positive operating leverage.</p>
          <p>We strengthened our tier one capital position in the first quarter through successful hybrid issuances and through retained earnings as well.  In our strategic decision making continues to serve us well by maintaining a moderate risk profile our credit quality is solid and our loan portfolio is performing as expected.  Most importantly, we continue to deepen our customer relationships.</p>
          <p>That having been said, we are disappointed with the impact that the capital markets had on our commercial real estate loans held for sale and our trading activities, we have spoken to you about our commercial real estate loans and we mark these high quality assets to market as we did not want to sell them in the first quarter and trade away our economic value.  However I'm especially disappointed with the loss in our trading activities.  Similar to our commercial real estate loans, these assets were affected by market illiquidity and a lot of volatility in the hedging of these assets.  We've taken significant actions and we've reduced our risk positions by over 50% in this area.</p>
          <p>Losses were commercial real estate loans held for sale and trading activities were largely offset by gains from several other unusual items.  Most importantly, our business fundamentals are sound, and PNC is well positioned for growth.  Given our business model and our ability to create positive operating leverage, we believe that we will continue to deliver solid results even in this challenging environment.</p>
          <p>Now, Rick will discuss the details of our financial performance in a few minutes, but let me give you some highlights from our business segments.  Our retail banking segment continued to see a flight to quality as more customers are coming to PNC from weaker institutions.  We grew organic net new checking account relationships by more than 12,000 in the first quarter, a 50% higher growth rate than the same period a year ago.  Including in the impact of acquisitions, our average noninterest bearing deposits grew 18% year-over-year.  And we're already seeing some excellent results from our investments in the Mercantile branches.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, consumer DDA new account production was up nearly 400% from the fourth quarter of 2007 and over 400% of our expectations as well.  Merchant originated accounts increased more than 300% from the first quarter a year ago.  And the demographics of Maryland and Virginia markets are as favorable as we expected them to be.  In fact, the average consumer money market account is twice the average balance of PNC's legacy accounts.  Now, let me move to corporate institutional banking.</p>
          <p>They posted a strong year-over-year net interest income growth due to loan and deposit growth.  Treasury management and capital markets revenues, our relationship based activities was up 18% year-over-year.  And at a time when M&amp;A activity is down nationally, our Harris Williams subsidiary had a strong quarter posting a $5 million increase in revenue compared with the fourth quarter of last year.  Now, with this difficult market and increasing number of business customers are using our liquidity management services, and some small and medium sized banks are accessing our balance sheet management activities as well.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, with CNIV, our performance was primarily offset by the valuation adjustment for commercial real estate loans held for sale, which I mentioned earlier.  The PFPC our global fund services provider that reported servicing revenue growth of 14% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year.  The increase was driven primarily by the acquisitions of Albridge and Coates and the continued growth in the offshore markets as well as a robust sales pipeline. Regarding Albridge and Coates, they continue to grow their client base and the integration of both is on track and progressing well.</p>
          <p>PFPC continues to expand internationally as we are transforming this business segment from a domestic information provider to a cumulative data provider to a cumulative information provider.  Last year, we also launched depository services in Luxembourg.  We opened a sales office in London and just recently established a processing center in Poland.  All three of these initiatives are performing well.  Total fund services by PFPC grew to 2.6 trillion in the first quarter, up from 2.2 trillion the previous year.</p>
          <p>Our fourth segment, BlackRock yesterday reported another strong quarter of core earnings with assets under management now at 1.4 trillion.  The strategic decisions to grow the distribution network, expand the product range, and their overall focus on investment performance and client service should continue to benefit BlackRock and PNC.  Now, clearly there are challenges facing the financial services industry both in terms of the credit environment and the U.S. economy.</p>
          <p>And as we have said before, we're not immune to all of those forces, but as we look ahead, we see many more opportunities than obstacles.  We raised capital in the first quarter; we strategically strengthened our capital position.  We also announced an increase in our dividend, reflecting our confidence in the future.  And all of our acquisitions are now in house.  We successfully integrated Yardville in March, adding them to our industry leading technology platform and we are delivering on the cost savings.  And earlier this month, we closed the acquisition of Sterling.</p>
          <p>In this environment, it's important our asset quality is solid and our NPA migration is manageable and from a balance sheet perspective, we are benefiting significantly from the current yield curve.  With our diverse revenue mix, we expect continuous &#x2013; continued positive operating leverage to offset the impact of these increases in credit cards.</p>
          <p>Now the capital markets will continue to be volatile, but we're actively working to limit the impact of this volatility as I mentioned before.  At PNC, we remain focused on what we do best, growing our businesses, controlling expenses, managing risk, and taking products and services to new and existing markets.  In summary, we believe we're well positioned for a good 2008.  Now, Rick will provide you with more detail about the financial results and the strategies.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone.  The key takeaways from this quarter are our overall business model continued to deliver solid results as we reported $1.09 of earnings per share with strong growth in net interest income and net interest margin resulted in strong revenue growth.  Good expense control resulted in positive operating leverage.  Asset quality performed as we expected, and we significantly improved our tier one capital ratio.  All of this has positioned us well for the current market environment.</p>
          <p>As Slide 6 shows, we continued to grow high quality diverse revenue streams.  Our first quarter revenue grew 13% year-over-year, and 12% compared to the linked quarter, a significant achievement is this environment.  Net interest income represents 47% of total revenue.  And net interest income grew 8% linked quarter to 37% on a year-over-year basis substantial increases compared to both periods of comparison.  Our liabilities sensitive balance sheet positioning has served us well in aggressive rate reduction by the Federal Reserve.</p>
          <p>Our margin has improved the 3.09% and we expect continued improvement next quarter.  We also expect net interest income to grow next quarter as we pass these rate reductions through our deposit base and grow our balance sheet.  For the year we still expect deposits and loan balances to organically grow in mid-single digits with acquisitions we expect loan and deposit growth in the mid-teens.  As a result, we expect year-over-year net interest income growth to exceed 20%.</p>
          <p>Now, if you turn to Slide 7, noninterest income, represents 53% of total revenue, and declined 2% from the prior year, and increased 16% from the linked quarter.  As you can see on the slide, overall growth in noninterest income in both periods of comparison is significantly affected by other noninterest income, so we thought Slide 7 would be of more use in understanding the performance of our core fee categories.  Fund servicing revenue grew 12% compared with the first quarter a year ago driven by our merging products, primarily offshore activities, and our acquisition of Albridge.</p>
          <p>Compared to the fourth quarter, revenues were up 6% primarily due to the acquisition of Albridge.  Asset management revenue was up 28% compared to the same quarter last year due to BlackRock and our wealth management businesses.  On a linked quarter basis, revenues were down 6% due to comparatively lower equity markets in the first quarter for our wealth management business and lower results at BlackRock.  Our consumer service fees and deposit service charge revenue were up 8% year-over-year but down 6% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality.  Corporate service revenue in the first quarter was up 3% year-over-year despite challenging market conditions but down 9% linked quarter primarily due to seasonally lower affordable housing revenue.</p>
          <p>So all in all, our core fee income businesses continue to perform well.  We also sold securities during the quarter generating a $41 million gain.  We replaced these securities with high quality securities at equivalent or better yields so that there is no negative impact to net interest income.  Now, wrapping up our discussion on noninterest income, we did have a number of items reported in other noninterest income.  The most of these items are highlighted on page 6 of the financial supplement.</p>
          <p>As we discussed before, we expected losses in our commercial mortgage origination business, and as you can see, we've reported losses of 177 million during the quarter due to portfolio valuations as spread widened from 86 basis points at year-end to almost 200 basis points at the end of the first quarter with unprecedented interim volatility.  We continue to hold about 2.1 billion in held for sales loans, our held for sale commercial mortgage loans are high quality assets that are performing as expected, in fact none of these loans were delinquent in the first quarter.  These have strong fundamentals such as loan to value, debt service charge coverage, and long-term leases on properties that are diverse in terms of both property type and geography.  We intended to reduce our inventory in the first quarter as we talked about, but we elected not to participate in the few deals that were in the marketplace as we believe the fundamentals of these loans are better than what the market is offering today.</p>
          <p>While we did not expect spreads to widen more than two times beyond where these were at the end of the fourth quarter, we're not willing to forego the value we see in these assets.  It's important to note that we have recognized the market valuation adjustment here but we have not realized a loss.  Our intent is to reduce our inventory but only at the right price.  As such, we could see more volatility, positive or negative, in earnings going forward.  A loss in our trading businesses resides in our proprietary books and is very similar to the commercial mortgages loans issue I just mentioned.  These are high-quality low-risk assets that were affected by very illiquid market.  We believe that the dislocation in the markets provide an excellent opportunity for relative value but spreads moved against us.  In response to the first quarter volatility, we substantially reduced these positions and increased our hedges throughout the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, given strength of our client related trading activities and our reduced risk position and our proprietary activities, we expect to return to positive trading results next quarter.  That being said, these markets are very fickle and continue to be very volatile and we could see further earnings volatility in the future.  We also generated a pre-tax gain of 114 million from the sale of Hilliard Lyons  at quarter end.  The tax rate on this was high and as we had virtually no tax basis in this entity resulting in a 23 million after tax gain.</p>
          <p>As a result, our first quarter effective tax rate of 40% was much higher than what you normally expect of approximately 31%.  So if any of you are trying to adjust our earnings by taking the table on page six of our supplement and adjusting for tax rates, you probably be off by about $50 million of taxes, and you'd be understating earnings by about 15 cents per share.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect a quarterly effective tax rate of around 31% through the remainder of the year.  We also had two items related to our VISA relationship, one we reported a $95 million gain related to a partial redemption by VISA of some of our stock following their IPO which was recorded in other noninterest income.  And second, a 43 million expense reversal related to our share of VISA's litigation exposure which was recorded in other noninterest expense.  We now hold 3.5 million class V VISA shares which currently would convert to 2. 5 million class A shares and based on a March 31 closing price of $62 per share, our ownership would be valued at 155 million.  Finally in other noninterest income the quarterly BlackRock LTIP mark-to-market adjustment was a $37 million gain as the price of BlackRock stock declined from $217 at the end of the fourth quarter to $204 at the end of the first quarter thereby reducing the valuation of our share obligation.</p>
          <p>Now as you can see on Slide 8, we continue to create positive operating leverage on a quarter over quarter basis.  This has been accomplished with a 13% growth in revenue, and a 10% growth in expenses.  This reflects our success with growing revenue in new and existing markets while continuing to manage expenses through our continuous improvement program.  In January I said we expected full year total revenue growth to exceed 10% driven by strong net interest income growth and growth in noninterest income.  Given the aggressive Fed fund rate cuts and our resulting expectations for noninterest income growth, we are more confident and are expecting revenue growth in the low teens on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>We also expect to continue creating positive operating leverage with noninterest expense growth expected in the mid-single digit numbers.  This clearly benefits 3 percentage points from the VISA indemnification reversal.  From a risk management perspective PNC is well positioned because of the strategic choices we have made and our operating discipline.  Let's start with asset quality.  Let's see if I can put our loan portfolio in context for you.  Our loan book represents 71 billion of our $140 billion balance sheet, so it's about half.  Of our 71 billion in loans outstanding, 29 billion is in consumer assets, which is primarily in high quality home equity and residential mortgages with net charge-off levels less than half of industry averages.  And 42 billion is in commercial lending with a high percentage of collateralization.  Of the 42 billion in commercial, 9 billion is in commercial real estate of which only 2 billion is in residential real estate development.</p>
          <p>On a strategic level, we have made decisions that enable us to avoid sub prime mortgages, high yield bridge loans, leveraged finance loans, and limit our commercial real estate exposures, products that continue to create challenges for the industry.  On a daily basis, we make credit decisions based on our assessment of risk adjusted returns.  Our asset quality continues to be strong with nonperforming assets representing .42% of total assets at quarter end.  We did see an increase in MPAs compared to the fourth quarter, albeit at a slower pace than the prior quarter which was primarily due to continued softening in residential real estate development.  Our exposure continues to be very granular.</p>
          <p>Our largest nonperforming asset is 20 million and our average nonperforming commercial loan is less than 500,000.  Our residential real estate development portfolio continues to be the primary source of stress.  It is very granular and manageable as the average size of these exposures is about 1.4 million per loan.  These are primarily located in Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, and New Jersey.  As we previously disclose we expected our first quarter provision would be modestly below the 188 million we recorded in the fourth quarter which included a 45 million provision related to Yardville.  The provision of 151 million in the first quarter is a little bit better than our expectations.</p>
          <p>In fact, if you back out the change in the charge-off policy as described in the release, the actual charge-offs would have been 44 million less leading to a 31 basis point charge-off ratio versus the 57 we reported.  So we are not seeing a significant increase in charge-off levels.  We see the full year provision to be around 600 million, and this will include an additional $25 million reserve for Sterling when we complete as we have completed the closing here in April, and obviously the 600 million is highly dependent upon the strength and weaknesses of our economy as we move forward.  The other major portion of our balance sheet is the securities portfolio, and as you can see, it declined by 1.6 billion on a linked quarter basis primarily due to liquidity driven valuation adjustments in the current market environment.  However, the quality of the book remains very strong as we had no impairments during the quarter.  Next is balance sheet management.  Now, I've already spoken about our balance sheet positioning and benefits so let me focus now on liquidity and capital.</p>
          <p>From a liquidity perspective, PNC loan to deposit ratio of 88% is amongst the lowest of the peers and in addition to this, I have mentioned above we are very comfortable with our liquidity position given our ample unsecured borrowing capacity of 27 billion.  On capital, I said in January that we wanted to improve our capital ratios in 2008, and we are making good progress towards achieving that objective.  Through a combination of successful hybrid issuances and retained earnings in the first quarter, we grew our tier one capital ratio to 7.7% up from 6.8% at year end.</p>
          <p>We will continue to focus on enhancing our capital position to support our customers in this period of economic uncertainty.  We will accomplish this through a combination of earnings growth, balance sheet management, and accessing nondilutive capital sources.  In summary, let me say we are pleased with our first quarter results.  We had a strong growth in net interest income and net interest margin resulting in strong revenue growth.  Our expenses were well managed resulting in positive operating leverage.  Our assets performed as expected reflecting our moderate risk profile.</p>
          <p>We raised capital and increased our dividend and we completed several strategic initiatives we integrated Yardville, closed the sale of Hilliard Lyons and earlier this month we closed the acquisition of Sterling.  These accomplishments reflect a solid performance in a difficult market environment.  We believe that positions us well for the remainder of 2008.  With that I'll turn it over to Jim.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rick.  Just in conclusion, I think we all know the industry is facing an extremely difficult time.  It's unusual from the point of view that many sectors of the economy are performing extremely well, but two aspects are clearly not.  There's a current capital markets liquidity crisis that we're all experiencing, and the residential housing industry is in a depression.</p>
          <p>For PNC we're pleased that we have limited exposure to residential housing much less than many of our peers that are being affected by these difficulties.  But the illiquidity of capital markets has affected even our high quality assets.  Going forward we're going to continue to reduce the most volatile aspects of this balance sheet and manage them as aggressively as we can.  As Rick told you, our credit quality is solid and our outlook for revenue growth is very strong.  Given our diverse revenue mix, and our moderate risk profile especially on the credit side and the way we're positioned for interest rates, we're very comfortable with the outlook for our performance for the rest of the year.  And with that we'll be pleased to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Morning, Betsy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning.  Couple questions.  One on the CNBS, you went into some detail to the marks, and I think we're all aware of the CMBS spreads having widened out in the quarter.  I think you had been pretty close to some transactions that might have reduced the balances this quarter.  Could you comment a little bit as to what led you to not pursue those transactions and give us some color on where those transactions potentially stand at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there were a couple that actually got done in the quarter in the marketplace which we just didn't feel as comfortable with the asset quality in the pools or in terms of the pricing that was being afforded, so we didn't -- we decided not to participate, and there are two other deals that we're very actively working with at the moment.  The challenge for us is right now is just that these are taking a long time to find investors to participate in the market, so that could take some time and I'm not expecting them to be closed any time &#x2013; in the near term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  All right.  So and what's the best index that you would lead us -- I mean, is it just the CMBX that you would look at with regard to where your marks are as of today versus where they were at the end of the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd take a look at &#x2013; we have to look at 2.  I think you have got to a cash triple-A index on the inventory positions which you can take a look at, then separately you've got CMBX hedges triple-A 1.  I think if you look at the two of those and kind of track along there, you'll get a pretty good indication of how our inventory is pricing and the only piece we haven't disclosed to you is just how much we have or have not hedged.  I will say we have &#x2013; we did hedge all new originations in the fourth quarter of last year and the beginning of this quarter, but we have stopped originating at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  But that doesn't mean that your entire exposure is hedged, right?  The majority of your exposure is probably not hedged?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the challenge with hedging in this environment is there is so much basis risk between how the underlying and how the hedge move, and you can see them actually moving in different directions, so you have to be very careful when you're putting those hedges on.  Otherwise, you'll actually cost yourself more money than you need to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the NII comment, looking for 20% increase year on year, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At least 20, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So does that imply some slow down in Q on Q increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I didn't give any guidance specifically on how much Q1 to Q2 will be, but I tell you I know net interest income will go up and I know that the margin will go up.  There's just so many other factors involved.  I'm really not in a position to pinpoint.  I'm pretty confident it will go up by as much as it did from fourth quarter to first quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>And margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And is there &#x2013; could you just give us a sense as to the degree to which maybe yield curve swaps are driving that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not yield curve swaps.  It's more what the Fed has done with rates and our ability to pass that through our deposit base and the fact that at the time this happened, we were 2.2 years positive duration of equity so very liability sensitive and as a result, as rates came down, we were able to take advantage of that by keeping our assets invested while repricing our liabilities.  That should get even better too, because I think if you look today, LIBOR is way out at like 80 basis points over fed funds and I think as that comes down, we expect to benefit from that as well.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then lastly on the trading line, I think there was a loss generated in the proprietary book.  Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you comment a little bit on your changes that you might be making to risk management or your leverage that you might be taking in that type of business going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we're very disappointed in the performance.  The spreads have widened out to a point where our traders felt that it was an attractive asset to own.  They acquired the assets, obviously the spreads widened out as they did with CMBS most particularly in March, and then the basis risk became even more of a problem as we began to hedge the portfolio, so it was a unique &#x2013; it was clearly a unique market, but that having been said, we're extraordinarily disappointed.  We have already reduced the risk profile by over 50%, and we're doing a number of other things to curtail our risk taking in this environment, so suffice it to say, we're extraordinarily disappointed in the trading performance and we're taking actions to deal with it.  The other thing is that net interest income is going to grow so rapidly that I mean quite frankly that the need to take a great deal of risk is just inappropriate in the trading line.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have three questions.  First as far as acquisitions, are you in the market for large acquisitions?  I mean you have a little bit in Ohio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our plans for the rest of this year as far as I can see is to run our business, we're doing extraordinarily well, we're adding lots of new accounts in our Western markets as well as our Eastern markets, so I think running the business in this environment is our No. 1 opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question relates to your NPAs which were up I guess 23%, reserves to NPAs declined, and you did not provide quite as much as maybe said in your regulatory release.  Can you give us some thoughts around what NPAs might do in future quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I expect they're going to continue to go up.  What I'm not seeing yet is a significant increase in charge-offs.  I think as we showed in the release, when you adjust for the change in the charge-off methodology that we have, charge-offs are still back at third quarter levels at 31 basis points, and so I think for the moment, we're very comfortable with how we're reserved.  We do expect NPAs to go up.  I think the question is really going to be what kind of nonperforming assets are we going to have.  I think as you know, certainly we may see more in the residential development space.  We may see a little bit more in the suppliers to that business.  Most of our other businesses are doing fine, so we don't see increases there.  But then we also have a very large asset based lending business, business credit, and that business was kind of made on nonperforming assets, so we expect them to be very active in this environment, and they already have a very large pipeline, so that ratio for us is kind of a little bit misleading in terms of the expected loss that we may incur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it looks like linked quarter the biggest increase was commercial real estate real estate projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, residential development projects, correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how much of that would be from Mercantile?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just say that about half of all of our NPAs come out of that region.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also one of the things, Mike, as you know &#x2013; the average real estate nonperforming loan is less than a million and a half dollars, there are a number of personal guarantees which were more typical of the Mercantile lending capability, but that having been said, guarantees are not counted until cash is put up in terms of putting a credit on nonperforming.  If you believe that &#x2013; in our policy, if we believe that the asset doesn't repay you, then you have to put it on nonperforming, so even though there might be a strong guarantor, so that's one of the reasons why the risk profile except for those loans might not be the same as tract housing in Florida.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the third question relates to revenues.  Linked quarter fourth quarter to first quarter revenue growth, I'm getting it actually being down or negative.  So if you could help educate me, what I do is I take out VISA, I take out BlackRock LTIP, I take out the Hilliard Lyons  gain and add back the trade losses and commercial mortgage valuation losses, and that gets me kind of flat, and then if I take out something for Yardville, it would actually be down on a core basis revenues.  So am I missing something?  Are you kind of thinking about year-over-year or that kind of momentum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Year-over-year, because what you have in particularly in the consumer space as well as in the affordable housing business that we have, is you've got a lot of seasonality in revenues so fourth quarter to first quarter is not typically a good comparison.  I think if you look year-over-year, I think you'll be very comfortable with the revenue growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  How much did Yardville add in spread revenues, fees, expenses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll have that for you in a minute, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, I can just call you back with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you add it on the call, if you get it by then, I look at core revenue growth stripping out deals I guess it added a little bit in the first quarter more in the second, so I want to haircut revenues and give you credit on expenses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, Yardville's net interest income was about 16 million and fee income was around 6.  You're not talking about big numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And expenses?</p>

          <p>Morning, Matt.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys.  Couple questions here.  You mentioned about half the NPAs are from Mercantile.  Is the same true for charge-offs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, much lower actually about 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Secondly, the delinquency trends just across your portfolio, can you give some comments on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, home equity, you know, has ticked up a little bit in terms of, delinquencies haven't ticked up at all but charge-offs have gone from an average last year of about 24 to 26 basis points to this quarter about 35 basis points, but quite frankly that's still half the industry average, so we're still feeling really good about that portfolio charge-offs in our residential -- residential mortgage portfolio which is really an asset and liability play.  That's still in low single digits very low level there, high quality assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there's no delinquency at this point in our commercial mortgage book, but that's the good news about the commercial mortgage book is that we did originate at very, very high quality assets.  That's the pricing on the liquidity is the difference there</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's a good point, Jim, and that's the same in the available sale portfolio we've been very careful about the credit quality we take into that book and as a result we had no valuation adjustments related to credit in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So on the delinquency trends when we see the Y-9Cs it will be relatively stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It should be, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That's helpful.  And then just third, just out of curiosity, the reserves for unfunded commitments went down a little bit I think18 million is that from line reductions or line draw-downs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably from draw downs because draw downs sounds like the right answer.  We've seen utilization go up in our corporate space.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question about the Mercantile footprint.  I mean, we're seeing certainly a number of residential issues, residential real estate issues down there.  Are you seeing any sort of slopping over in the commercial sector down there if you could just speak to sort of the economic trends outside what we're seeing in residential real estate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not seen any of it slap over into the commercial portfolio really at all, so we're very, very pleased with the acquisition there.  Some of the really we see residential real estate mostly on the Eastern seaboard out on the Eastern shore being soft.  Baltimore is still pretty strong, pretty strong market in all those military jobs moving to Baltimore, that's going to be a good housing market for quite a while, so it's really a little bit of the bank that they acquired in Virginia, and some of the East coast assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jim could you just repeat what you said at the first?  I kind of missed it about demand deposits are about -- the Retail Banking environment down there being so much better than legacy footprint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our average MMDA account down there is double the size of the average for PNC legacy.  So its -- there's a lot of money in those hills a lot of money in those hills.  As you know, the Washington DC SMSA is the highest income per household in the United States.  And that SMSA is now larger than Philadelphia.  So it's -- it has the highest education per household as well, so it's a very, very wealthy marketplace, and it's growing nicely.</p>

          <p>Morning, David.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning two sort of unrelated questions.  First, in the your table on page 9 of the supplement that talks about nonaccrual loans, could you distinguish between the real estate related under commercial and the real estate projects line, basically are residential development loans in both of those categories, or in just one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Residential development projects would be in the real estate projects category, but what you'd also have in real estate related is we do have loans to national and regional homebuilders.  And that would be about an outstandings of about 200 million.  We managed that down pretty aggressively in terms of outstandings, so you might have some of that 63 million of nonperforming loans to be related to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the real estate projects line at least in terms of nonaccruals is primarily residential related.  Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then secondly, Jim, your language about reducing risk in the trading business, does that also suggest perhaps a change in strategy in terms of management's view of that business and if so will there also be personnel changes related to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I didn't -- I didn't say that.  I don't expect a lot of personnel changes.  I would say that we're looking at the risk profile of our trading book.  You know, we do a lot of trading for our customers.  So you can't get out of the trading business.  I mean, we do a lot of hedging of our credit risk.  You know, we make on average about $30 million a quarter just doing customer business.  And so we have to be in the trading business just to have that activity.  Theproprietary trading business helps us -- helps us accomplish a number of those things as well as hedge our credit risk, hedge our interest rate risk, and quite frankly if you look at how we positioned the balance sheet and the net interest income going forward, it's the same group, and so they've done quite an extraordinary job positioning us net interest income-wise going forward.  That having been said, this quarter we had a very disappointing experience in the proprietary trading book which lost approximately $100 million.  And if you look at how it was done, I mean, quite frankly the spreads blew out to a very attractive rate.  We added those assets; other people may have added those assets in the AFS book and just enjoyed the spread.  We had them in the trading book when the spreads blew out, you know, we have a loss in the trading book, and those types of strategies I think we have to be much more thoughtful in terms of managing the volatility around our quarterly P&amp;Ls.</p>

          <p>Morning.  On your comments about the provision for this year, I think you guys mentioned that you think you might have a provision of $600 million granted that's obviously going to be impacted by what happens to the economy.  What is your outlook for the economy to come up with about a $600 million number?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>With think today, we're effectively in a mild recession and that's something we see ourselves in for at least the first half of the year with a modest recovery from that through the end of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>If you look at it we have a very unusual economy with 5% unemployment which is a fabulous number historically.  Here we have -- we have a number of our businesses doing extraordinarily well.  When you talk to technology people, aerospace people, commodities people, health care people, you know, they don't know anything about recession.  I mean, life is as good as it gets.  Then you obviously talk to somebody who is in a housing or housing related business, they're not in a recession.  I mean, we are in the worst housing market in recorded history of the United States.  When you talk to a supplier in that space, they're in a world of misery, so we're just very glad that we're not in -- we're not in Florida and California and Las Vegas and a number of those places that have those depressions going on, so I think our loss experience I think reflects some of that.</p>

Under your loan balances, I noticed that the real estate projects I think balance was up over 300 million quarter to quarter.  I wonder if that has anything to do with funding.  What drove that growth?  And is there any incremental funding of interest reserves reflected in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That's just utilization growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On existing commitments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And Rick, previously I think you guys had suggested that based on your prior expectation for loan loss provisions over the course of the year that you thought provisioning the second half could be lower than that of the first half.  Have you changed your views on the trajectory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it might be slightly higher than where we are this quarter simply because we're going to take on Sterling in the quarter, and that will be probably somewhere between a 20 and $25 million additional reserve to get their reserve levels consistent with ours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I think, yes, based on that, I assume the rest of the year will tail off a little.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That makes sense.  Is there anything to update us on with respect to Market Street?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Has there been any draw downs of liquidity commitments?  Is Market Street still functionally rolling paper without too much difficulty?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're having no issues with Market Street at the moment in terms of funding.  It's actually it's a lot better situation today than we were at the end of the year, it's a lot smoother.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Great.  And then one final question, in your discussion on the margin outlook, Rick, you mentioned that &#x2013; you mentioned the LIBOR over fed fund spread, and if that spread were to tighten, that would provide some incremental benefits to you.  I think it's an interesting topic of discussion.  Obviously there were some articles out yesterday and this is something that's been talked about for a few weeks that the quoted LIBOR rates are painting a much rosier picture than actually exists in the marketplace over there and we've seen LIBOR gap up a little bit this morning.  To the extent that LIBOR were to continue or the LIBOR fund spread were to continue to gap out, could you maybe talk about how that would impact you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am very comfortable with the full year growth rate of over-20% taking that into consideration as well.  One of the things is &#x2013; the really bigger factor in our forecast, so I'm very comfortable that even if LIBOR doesn't come in, we should be able to still achieve 20% plus.  The bigger factor is the question right now market by market is how much do you cut rates to optimize the portfolio, how much do you increase rates to take market share in this environment?  We are seeing potentially great opportunity to take market share, which will benefit us in the years to come.</p>

          <p>Hi, Collyn.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks good morning.  Most of my questions have been asked, but just a follow-up I think Rick to something you had said when you talked about while we may see, you know, material increases in NPAs that won't translate into net charge-offs.  Is that a function of  the equity that's in some of these deals or just a more aggressive workout policy what would lead you to say that net charge-offs may not materialize to the level the NPAs have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the latter.  I think when you look at the residential development space and average loans of 1.4 million, were just going to take us some time and going to have to have the patience to work through them and just have a hard time believing that the actual ultimate charge-offs will meet those levels.  As well as the fact of the asset based lending business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They have lower loss given default ratios than the FHA based lending business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So you're speaking as to what's in the portfolio today, not necessarily identifying trends that may be in the pipeline, but in terms of what's on the portfolio today, it would migrate to net charge-offs that would be fairly minimal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I wouldn't say minimal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's a strong word obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it wouldn't go directly from nonperforming loans straight to charge-offs, so I think we'll have obviously good recoveries in a number of spots there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>I have a quick question that has very little bearing on PNC but has some bearing on some of your counterparties.  When Sterling Financial was selling EFI loans, there were two types of frauds discovered that I'm aware of, vapor loans which were loans with absolutely no backing, and then fraud loans that actually had somebody down in the Carolinas who was sort of playing along with the fraud.  Towards the end, Sterling was buying back the vapor loans, but they were walking away from the loans that had anybody backing them and saying, well, it was a legitimate loan when we made it even if it was fraudulent and we're not going to buy it back, you're going to have to collect against them.  I was wondering what your intention is as far as repurchasing those back in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think each and every one of those loans is a unique situation, and frankly we have &#x2013; we really couldn't comment on what Sterling was doing or what we might do in the future.  I think that's a &#x2013; that's a customer relationship loan by loan, and we really wouldn't have a comment on how that would be done.</p>

          <p>A short follow-up.  One part of the call, you said you had a hundred million dollar trading loss and then in the release it says 76 million.  I didn't know if this simply rounding up or if there's something else there?  And then --</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, okay.  And then so the 100 million was proprietary related, and I'm just &#x2013; you pride yourself on a low risk profile, you've done better than the industry, yet here we have a regional bank with $100 million proprietary trading loss that is not client related.  I'm just trying to reconcile those two if you could help me?</p>

          <p>We're very &#x2013; quite frankly we're just not very &#x2013; we're very, very displeased about it quite frankly and we have taken actions to reduce that position to make sure that the moderate risk profile that we believe that we should maintain and that we have on the credit side is maintained in the trading side as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we should minimize the unique quarter either or the unique month of the unique month of March.  I think this group as I mentioned before has done an extraordinary job on our balance sheet positioning, and a number of other things in our credit hedging and other things, so they've done an extraordinary job in most cases quite frankly this quarter showed remarkable volatility, and also even worse volatility in the ability to hedge the risk I think shows us that this is not a place where we should be spending a lot of time trading assets.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys I just had one follow-up after digesting a prior answer.  Rick, if the LIBOR fund spread were to widen, I know you're comfortable with the guidance for net interest income.  Does that having any meaningful implications for other areas in the bank perhaps trading positions or anything else that you'd be able to discuss?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course.  If the credit spreads continue to widen from their already extraordinary wide levels today, then there's always risk that as I mentioned, CNBS portfolio trading positions although we have reduced the risk dramatically, you still could have further impacts there.  You could have further impacts on our available for sale portfolio if spreads widen, but again I think those are all -- those are illiquid valuation adjustments as opposed to real credit losses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're comfortable with that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was talking more specifically about the LIBOR Fed fund spreads not credit spreads in general.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing that I think is important to note is we're looking at credit spreads today that we haven't seen in 20 years, and so the ability to add assets in this market and fund them at a very, very profitable spread with an excellent return on economic capital is unique today, so I know we talk a lot about the difficulties we've had in the mark-to-market, because spreads have widened.  But quite frankly on the other side of the -- on the other side of the balance sheet just on our loan portfolios and we have talked about how margin has increased this quarter, it will increase next quarter, net interest income was growing a lot, these wider spreads have benefited us to a great extent and a lot of our assets high quality assets on the asset side of the book too.  There is bad news that we talk about in the mark-to-market, but there's good news in lots of other parts of the balance sheet.</p>
