          <p>Welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell Q1 Results Announcement Call. There will be a presentation followed by a Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would like to introduce our host, Mr. Simon Henry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and good morning to those in the U.S. Welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell first quarter 2010 results presentation. Let me take you through the results and the portfolio developments for the first quarter and we'll leave plenty of time for your questions.</p>
          <p>Firstly, could you take a moment just to read the definitions and the cautionary note. Our CCS earnings, current cost of supply earnings, excluding identified items for the quarter were $4.8 billion. That's an earnings-per-share increase of some 61% from the first quarter 2009. Our results have stepped up from last year, and profitability has certainly increased from the low levels that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>This year-over-year improvement has been driven by higher oil prices and higher chemicals margins, but that's combined with increased sales volumes and that's as a result of our operating programs &#x2013; our operating performance and our growth programs. These are better results from Shell, but we're not relying on economic recovery or seasonal effects from here on in. The macro environment will be what it will be. We continue with our focus on growing our cash flow underpinned by new projects and lower comps.</p>
          <p>Back in March we outlined our strategy for the next several years. We're working on improving our near term performance, delivering a new wave of growth into 2012, and maturing the next generation of projects for growth for 2013 and beyond, and we've made progress on all three of these themes so far this year.</p>
          <p>We had successful startups at two new projects in the quarter, deepwater oil and gas production at the Perdido platform in the Gulf of Mexico and new ethylene capacity came onstream in Singapore. We're delivering on the downstream asset sales in what is still a difficult environment with an agreement to sell our New Zealand position. And we're making good progress against our target to reduce costs by $1 billion in 2010. We are embedding a culture of continuous improvement, commerciality and cost control in our day-to-day activities.</p>
          <p>Looking to the longer-term, we're building on our 2009 exploration success with new discoveries. We've taken up new gas positions in China and Australia, a new Brazil biofuels joint venture, which includes of course more downstream potential.</p>
          <p>So, overall it's a good start to 2010. Now let me give you some details on performance in the quarter, and I'll start with the macro environment. If you look at the macro picture compared with the first quarter last year, the oil prices were significantly higher than the $44 a year ago. Brent averaged $76 a barrel. The natural gas prices increased in most regions but were slightly lower in Europe. The industry refining margins were significantly lower than the year ago levels and that's in most regions, although refining margins did improve from the fourth quarter '09 and they were supported in this by high levels of industry downtime for maintenance in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The chemicals margins increased in all regions compared to the first quarter of 2009, with the most pronounced improvements coming from Asia and Europe. So, it's a pretty complicated picture overall, but some trackers up and some down, but overall the trends were positive for us in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our earnings. The earnings for the quarter did include identified one-off items of $75 million. So excluding those items, the current cost of supply earnings were $4.8 billion and the earnings per share increased by 51% and that's compared with the first quarter a year ago.</p>
          <p>The quarter was characterized by higher earnings in upstream and a decline in the downstream. That's mainly a result of higher oil prices and chemical margins, the higher volumes in the upstream and the lower refining margins in the downstream. The cash flow from operations for the quarter was $4.8 billion, but excluding the net movements in working capital, it was just over $10 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let me talk about the individual business performance in a bit more detail. Firstly, on the upstream, the upstream earnings increased by 132% to $4.3 billion in the first quarter of 2010. The higher oil prices, the higher oil and gas production and the higher LNG sales volumes were the main drivers in the upstream results, and these are partly offset by the lower realized gas prices in Europe.</p>
          <p>Some of you have asked to see our gas realizations, including our large affiliate company in the Netherlands, the NAM. So we have now included the NAM realizations in the European information in our supplementary tables for you to use, and hopefully this helps you with your modeling and on that basis you will note that the European price went down year-on-year.</p>
          <p>The upstream production increased by 6% first quarter to first quarter, and we reached some 3.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. If you set aside what we call uncontrollable factors, things like the OPEC quota, the weather, and look at the underlying performance and the barrels from the new fields and the ramp-ups contributed some 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and that more than offset the 150,000 barrels a day impact from the natural field decline.</p>
          <p>Our LNG sales volumes grew by 38% first quarter to first quarter and over 4.2 million tons in the quarter; that's our highest volume ever. That's driven by increases from Sakhalin II in Russia and from Nigeria LNG, where we had a limited restart at the Soku gas plant and that improved the gas supply picture for Nigeria LNG.</p>
          <p>Looking into the second quarter, while the weather-related gas sales added some $200 million to Q1 earnings comparison; this is unlikely to repeat of course in the second quarter. Let me also remind you that the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada that produces between 70 and 80,000 barrels a day for Shell, that went into a planned shutdown and significant turnaround in mid March and that will restart again in June. We're also expecting some Q2 downtime in the Gulf of Mexico on a planned basis &#x2013; that was in April &#x2013; and some operational issues in Nigeria.</p>
          <p>So, overall in the first quarter, a much better earnings performance from the upstream. But we're in a delivery window, particularly for the Group, with a sequence of 13 new projects, 12 of which are in the upstream, and they'll come onstream in 2010 and 2011. These projects underpin the cash flow and production growth targets for 2012 that we discussed back in March, and last year's start-up Sakhalin in Russia and BC-10 in Brazil deepwater, they've both had very successful ramp-ups, contributed to Q1-to-Q1 uplift of around 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And both of these projects are currently producing above the planned expected levels.</p>
          <p>In the last few weeks, we've had a successful startup at Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico. A reminder that Perdido is the industry's first production from the lower tertiary reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico. This star development is expected to produce around 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in some 2.5 kilometers of water depth. This really is a high-tech first development with many industry firsts incorporated in the design. And more importantly, I expect this to be a highly profitable hub development with additional growth potential in the future as we've now developed that new infrastructure in the region.</p>
          <p>The next suite of start-ups includes the mine expansion in Athabasca in Canada and our two gas projects in Qatar. These projects remain on track and they will underpin our growth across 2011 and 2012.</p>
          <p>Turing to the downstream earnings, in contrast to the upstream where we have the large increase, the downstream earnings declined by 36% compared with year-ago levels to $0.8 billion. This decline was due to losses in refining, the low contributions year-on-year for marketing and trading, partially offset by strong earnings in chemicals. However, it's worth pointing out that downstream earnings have rallied somewhat from the low point that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2009 at the back end of last year.</p>
          <p>So, starting for a change with chemicals. The chemicals earnings have improved from a loss making position a year ago. This is due to the shift to more flexible feedstocks, i.e. gas, in our Gulf Coast portfolio and to more favorable market conditions worldwide. In Singapore, the new chemicals plant, which is integrated with the Bukom refinery, came online in November last year with the monoethylene glycol production, and the main ethylene cracker production started there at the end of March this year. The first quarter 2010 chemicals earnings were pretty close to the full year performance in 2009 and it's good to see that.</p>
          <p>In refining, the industry conditions were sharply weaker on Q1 versus Q1 basis, but we did see a reduction in the losses compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. Our first quarter refinery intake, it fell by some 5% as a result of weak demand and turnaround. First quarter 2010 also saw an unusually high level of maintenance downtime in our refineries, and our availability was 89% versus 92% availability a year ago.</p>
          <p>The marketing and trading earnings, they decreased from year-ago levels and we benefited from parachute effects from the falling oil prices that we saw in that quarter. However, marketing earnings, they did increase from the fourth quarter of 2009 returning back to more normal levels with higher earnings from retail, from lubricants and from commercial fuels. Overall, through the last couple of years of digital market environment, our marketing portfolio has been pretty resilient in the face of that tough environment.</p>
          <p>So, those are the earnings. Turning to the cash flow and the balance sheet. The upstream and the downstream cash inflows and outflows have been broadly balanced over the last 12 months. However, we've been running a cash deficit at the Group level as we've used the balance sheet to maintain the gross spending programs, to top-up the pension funds and to pay an attractive dividend.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to see the cash flow from operations excluding those nice movements in working capital was 10.4 billion in the first quarter, more than double the cash flow in the last quarter of last year. However, we have continued to increase borrowings, and this will likely continue in 2010. The balance sheet gearing was 17.1% at the end of the first quarter, a slight increase from the end '09 levels, and around the middle of our guidance range of 0 to 30% of gearing. So, we watch the cash position and the balance sheet very closely, and we're putting particular emphasis on costs and capital discipline within the company.</p>
          <p>We reduced Shell's underlying operating costs by some $2 billion in 2009, and we're on track to deliver a further $1 billion of underlying cost savings in 2010. This will come from head count reduction, around 2,000 positions in 2010-'11, in addition to the 5,000 staff reduction that we saw in 2009. It'll also come from simplifying and standardizing our activities that help to reduce the supply chain costs that form such a large part of our total cost base. So, we made progress here and there is clearly more to come.</p>
          <p>So let me update you on portfolio developments. There've been quite a few of these here and it's been a rather busy start to the year. Exploration made three new discoveries and drilled a successful appraisal on the 2009 Vito discovery, all of this in the Gulf of Mexico. 2009-'10 drilling to-date has delineated over $350 million barrels of oil equivalent resource for Shell in the Gulf of Mexico, and we continue to evaluate these discoveries. We're looking at options to fast track the development of the &#x2013; these exciting new finds with over 150,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent production potential.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in the world, we built up new gas potential in the Asia-Pacific region with tight and shale gas acreage additions in China and a bid for the coal bed methane to LNG play at Arrow Energy in Australia. This is a joint bid with PetroChina, and still obviously subject to final approval. In the downstream, we announced potentially a $12 billion Memorandum of Understanding with Cosan, a Brazilian company, to create the joint venture for our Brazilian activities; that is both downstream and ethanol &#x2013; sugar to ethanol &#x2013; and we will work with Cosan on biofuels growth.</p>
          <p>On the disposal side, we completed the divestment of our New Zealand downstream activities and we've agreed to sell three production licenses in Nigeria to a domestic company, subject to government approval of that. We've also announced a review of 21 downstream countries in Africa as part of our plans to exit from 35% of the number of retail markets we're present in by the end of 2012. And these positions, they can be profitable &#x2013; in fact, they are profitable in their own right, but we want to focus on scale in our own operations.</p>
          <p>So as you can see, we've been pretty busy on the portfolio side already in 2010. Just let me summarize and then we'll go for questions. I am pleased with the performance in the quarter despite a difficult environment. We are in that window &#x2013; the delivery window for new growth. We are making progress on the strategic themes, the shorter term performance focus, the delivery of the growth projects and the generation of the new investment options.</p>
          <p>And at the same time, we're keeping an eye on the medium and longer term. We're picking up new assets on a very selective basis and continue to invest at relatively high levels for more exploration barrels.</p>
          <p>The priorities are for a more competitive performance, for growth, and for sharper more focused delivery of strategy. By taking these steps, each of which you can see appears in the Q1 results, we're bridging the company and our shareholders into a period of production and cash flow growth into 2012 in pursuit of the targets we discussed in March.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to move to your questions. It would be good if we could restrict ourselves to couple of each please so that everybody gets a chance. Could I ask operator please could you poll for questions. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />: Our first question comes from Michele della Vigna from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Sam, it's Michele here. I had a couple of questions. The first one is in Nigeria; you've seen a big improvement in Q1. Are you seeing any further improvement now in April, and what would you expect at this point for the full year? And also related to that, you have not upgraded the guidance for production in 2010 despite delivering a strong Q1. What are the key uncertainties that you need to lift before being able to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michele, good question and the two answers related, as you might expect. Nigeria in Q1, yes good performance; offshore we are running at relatively sustainable levels that we expected. Onshore, we did well operationally in two areas. One was the Soku gas plant, where we have been up and running for most of the first quarter, and we also brought onstream the shallow water slightly offshore EA producing unit as a floating vessel. They both performed well in Q1. They drove the increase of roughly 80,000 barrels a day in the Nigerian production that we saw in the first quarter. The EA platform is currently down for maintenance again in the second quarter. And Soku has some issues getting liquids through the system. So, inventory management, so in fact although we ramped up well in the first quarter, both of the two projects that actually helped us to do that are currently either not producing or producing at lower levels. So, that's difficult to sustain. The rest of Nigeria, clearly the usual uncertainties apply, but it's not &#x2013; there have been worse quarters, there have been better quarters.</p>
          <p>2010 production guidance, just to remind, our actual production in 2009 was 3.15 million barrels a day of oil equivalent. Our stated guidance was to be broadly flat in 2010. We obviously take into account the fact that our production is obviously quite seasonal; Q1 and Q4 are typically highest production quarters, largely driven by European gas demand when it's cold. And Q2 and Q3 are sometimes impacted by planned shutdowns in the North Sea in particular and in Q3 by hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico. So, we cannot project forward 3.6 million barrels a day.</p>
          <p>I did mention oil sands downtime. We also have had a few weeks out in the Marversa corridor for planned maintenance in April, so quite a few factors already affecting the second quarter production. It is true of course that having 3.6 million barrels a day in the pocket from Q1 is a help, but given the uncertainties I've just run through, it's a bit early to be projecting that we'll end up ahead of our expectation for the year. But it's a good start.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Alejandro Demichelis from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good afternoon, gentlemen. A couple of questions here from me. The first one is on the downstream segment. How do you see that going forward? We're still seeing some drops in refining. When are you expecting that to change? And the second question is in terms of the exposure that you have been talking about, when is that you're expecting to close those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alejandro. The downstream environment in the first quarter, the over refining margins recovered from a previous quarter. They're still fairly difficult and they're difficult for two reasons. One, lack of demand recovery particularly in the West, in Europe and North America, and secondly, because that very significant Asian supply, new refineries that came onstream during last year, around 2 million barrels of recent capacity additions, is still an overhang. The Asian margins, despite growth in demand, are still impacted by quite the significant new capacity. On Q1, in particular, there were a lot of planned turnarounds or maintenance activity, including our own. And that did help underpin refining margins in both North America and Europe. So, if anything, there was probably a bit of downward pressure in refining in the short term. Medium term, it is driven entirely by the factors that I referred to: the demand growth or lack of in Europe and North America, and we don't yet see sustainable improvements there.</p>
          <p>The last factor worth noting is that stocks typically remain relatively high, particularly stocks of distillate, and Shell in particular has a refining configuration that is distillate heavy. And that's something we need to work the stocks out of the system.</p>
          <p>The chemicals have picked up a bit year-on-year, for sure. It's still a little early to say there's real sustainable demand improvement, but we're quite pleased &#x2013; we've actually improved our margin position in the Americas from more gas feedstock, and we're well positioned for that Asian demand growth. The marketing and trading business returned more to its typical level, somewhere between 0.5 billion and $1 billion a quarter is typically what we've seen, and we're towards the upper end of that range in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The disposal program, we have talked about both marketing and refining disposals. The marketing disposals, we are continuing to progress. We concluded New Zealand in the quarter. There is still a lot of interest around the world in the different markets that we look at. The refineries, obviously the European refining market is not an easy one to sell refineries into the moment. We have been talking to Essar about the three European refineries, and that's Stanlow in the UK, Heide and Harburg in Germany. Those negotiations are probably taking a bit longer than we would have initially hoped. We are talking to potential other buyers, but we continue with Essar and we're still hopeful of reaching an agreement there. We will of course not enter into a fire sale of assets; we've been clear about that all along, and if we have to consider either closure or moving to a terminal operation, then that's what we will do.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil McMahon from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Simon, I've got a few questions. The first is really on the strength of the realization in the upstream business. Could you tell us how much this is due to any lag effects there may have been from picking up from some crude sales from last year? And also if it was due to any strength in the LNG pricing, given the fact that you've increased so much LNG volume with Japan and Korea, and other places seemingly having strong LNG demand over the winter. And then just a quick second question was on some of your key exploration wells over the next six months especially those in the Arctic. Could you give us sort of timing of when you would be expecting those wells to be drilled? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Neil. But I think you meant oil price realization rather start with gas price realization. What we saw in the first quarter this year was the flip side of what we talked about in Q3 and Q4 last year. Gas prices even where they're oil price linked are typically lagged. So, we did see some strength in those markets, and that helped obviously in LNG pricing. It was also a particularly cold winter in Europe, bitterly cold in Northeast Asia, and fairly cold in North America as well. So, spot LNG pricing was relatively attractive too. That helped the realizations through the whole of the portfolio, so there is some linkage.</p>
          <p>On oil price realization, there is nothing particularly specific to talk about. It's just the timing of cargos. There are no specific issues behind what you see; it's just a mix of what we were selling. The key exploration wells, good question. What &#x2013; where are the key expiration wells is where I'll probably start. We are drilling in the Gulf of Mexico follow-up wells on the discoveries that we've had particularly in the Eastern Gulf or in the Appomattox discovery three follow-up wells over the next 12 to 18 months, and spudded later this year. We have a couple of others elsewhere in the Gulf later this year as well. In Alaska, the situation at the moment is we are good to go in terms of the permits that we have in hand, but obviously it's a legal environment where not everything is under our control. We've seen these uncertainties before, but at the moment we're planning to drill. It's not likely that we will spud before August, but we are making the plans and preparations ensuring we've got the logistics and support in place to drill. We haven't yet decided whether we drill Chukchi or Beaufort. They are different plays, but the intention is that we will drill at least one of them this year and if we can, we will fit a couple of wells into the window. It's a three to four month window, and we will update obviously as we go forward what our intention is.</p>
          <p>The other key well is clearly Brazilian Subsalt, the BMS 54 block. We have 100% block there. We've got two prospects identified. We will spud, the intention is in July, the first prospect. Most likely we don't drill the second until next year, because we like to look at the results of the first well there, but that's 100% Shell, Santos Basin pre-salt, looking forward to that.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Lucy Haskins of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon Simon and a great set of numbers. Two questions please, the working capital movement, it was a very big charge this quarter, sort of unusually so relative to what we normally see at 1Q. I wondered if you had any color on that. And then the second question was on DD&amp;A guidance, because I think in the past typically you have been talking about a rising trend. But do the reserve bookings of 2009 actually start to change that picture?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Lucy and thanks for the acknowledgment. Working capital $5.5 billion negative movement in Q1. A little unusual, but not that unusual in a cyclical industry. Some of this reflects inventory increases in the downstream price and a bit of volume. The prime driver is additional working capital allocated to the trading business. During last year, there were playing contango positions, as I'm sure you are aware. During the fourth quarter they closed quite a few of them out and they closed them out to realize the value. And as they open new positions, the cash impact has moved into this year. And their actual inventory level is not much different at the end of the first quarter to the end of 2010 so it's just temporary timing effects.</p>
          <p>I'd also say that this is working capital, which is not tied up for years. We keep a pretty close watch on this, as part of our balance sheet management. And you can see at the marginal rate of borrowing, we're likely to get a rather better return on that by using it in the trading business. So, that's the prime driver.</p>
          <p>DD&amp;A guidance, gas overall it rises with new projects and that's why we give the general guidance that over time unit DD&amp;A is likely to grow. Of course it does come down to the lifetime of a project as you prove up more reserves associated with a given the project. And yes, you're absolutely right, the fact we added three plus billion barrels of reserves &#x2013; proved reserves at the end of 2009 has a direct arithmetic impact on our depreciation rates in the year. As we go forward I'll be able to give you a very specific forecast going forward, but Q1 is relatively clean in that respect in terms of the depreciation in the upstream. What we will say, of course, as we bring, for example, Perdido online, the Athabasca Oil Sands online, it's likely to go back up again.</p>

          <p>Hello Simon. In the first quarter your dividend cover was over two times. You had free cash flow excluding working capital, and gearing was modest as you highlighted. Under the newly introduced dividend policy, what exactly has to happen before the Board contemplates a dividend increase? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question, Irene. I might put the question to the Board, but fundamentally we set the new policy &#x2013; of course we aim to grow earnings and cash flow through the cycle and the dividend to grow accordingly. There are clear issues over the next one to two years that we talked about in March, where if refining, gas pricing and oil prices were to be at the lower end of the cycle, we are spending more than we are earning. And in those circumstances, it's probably not prudent to be increasing the dividend. So, fundamentally, we will as I think you probably recall, we indicated 2010 dividend flat. We also talked about the potential introduction of a scrip dividend. And we will review as we go forward and see the big projects deliver. I really think trigger will be big projects kicking off, ramping up, showing that production growth towards 2012. And of course the big machines won't really be ramping up until next year, which is why we gave that indication for 2010. So, it will really be successful project delivery will be the straight answer.</p>
          <p>A short burst of higher prices will probably not do it. It's the underlying cash flow that really matters. Hopefully that's good guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, brilliant results for the quarter, which you don't need me to tell you; absolutely delighted. I was rather wondering given that your company is relatively more exposed to natural gas than some of your competitors, does the increase in unconventional gas in the United States and the application of some of that technology to Europe and possibly other areas put any question on or in the forecast with respect to LNG growth and the margins in LNG?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Joseph. Thanks for the acknowledgment and good strategic question for the long-term in terms of the positioning. The U.S. growth in unconventional gas has undoubtedly changed that market from being potential import of LNG, where LNG may have been linking U.S. gas prices to the rest of the world, we see that as an island market, but still a very attractive one. So, we have built a very strong position onshore in the U.S. to play that. We talked about 20 Tcf and very significant growth potential in our March meeting. There are 4 to $6 breakevens on the portfolio we've got. Good business, potential to make it better. Your question I think is primarily about the rest of the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there is potential for unconventional tight or shale gas in Europe. We don't see it developing as quickly in Europe for a variety of reasons. One is just the infrastructure; there are 65 onshore rigs I think operating in all of Europe at the moment compared to the thousands that you can rustle up in a few phone calls in the United States. So, that plus pipeline infrastructure plus planning and environmental and the fact that, to be honest, we don't see the geology as quite so prospective either, means although there is potential, it's not going to be short-term a major factor.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in the world, we would say China and of course coalbed methane in Australia are the two areas that we are interesting two of. In one of them, we are established as a player now, coalbed methane to LNG, the bid for Arrow Energy with PetroChina, clearly is an aim to play that into the LNG market. And the fact we're doing it with PetroChina, although we've not confirmed, it's quite likely we will take some of those LNG volumes to China and a very good business opportunity for us.</p>
          <p>The unconventional gas opportunities in China, we do see as potentially very significant, which is why we're delighted to get the two 4,000 square kilometer each blocks in China in partnership with PetroChina for exploration and appraisal. So, we do think it will impact the overall gas market. But medium and longer term, we still see strong demand for LNG long-term contracts into, amongst other places, China as well, but Japan and Korea, the typical customers, still strong interest, and we are negotiating out the volumes of LNG supply that we potentially have particularly from Australia at the moment. So, it's a factor, not that big in Europe; we don't see 5 to 10 years, but further out, the balance in Asia will be largely driven by Chinese gas demand where we see all the signals being fairly positive. Hopefully that covers the market.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It covers it, indeed, and thank you very much. I did have one other question which is maybe a trifle pie in the sky in that it's politically driven. There is clearly some problem with the &#x2013; with respect to the future of the European currency system. How do you see that impacting upon, number one, any accounting write-offs that might need to be taken, any changes in lives of assets or in the other write-offs that might fall into the DD&amp;A category? And also in terms of currency exposures and the hedging that might be applicable to them, to the extent you can comment on it obviously, without giving away strategic or <mark type="inaudible" /> information?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Interesting question, which I've really not thought through in terms of the impact on carrying value of assets. We're a dollar-driven company; our revenues are in dollars and many of our costs are in euros. So, arguably a weaker euro is good for us. Of course, a weaker euro, if it were to impact on the European economy generally, given that we still have very strong businesses in Europe, would have some indirect impacts. In terms of direct exposures, difficult to say what they might be. It's really the underlying economic exposure to the performance of the European economy that is of potential concern, but I would say to rather more than just Shell. And probably I'll leave it there; difficult to speculate further.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question on the gas prices Europe, which apparently held up quite well in view of the strong winter, also that happened in Asia. How do you see gas prices going forward the rest of this year, as also in the view of the ratio between spot prices and contracts? And the second question is about your Iraq efforts in Majnoon. Will you count, I understand you're already started there, and we will have some production next year or so. Will you show those production figures in the total production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Bert. The gas pricing in Europe, I'll basically reiterate what I said in March; there's not a lot to update. Typically we're 60% oil price linked, 40% spot price in Europe. The particular market conditions in Q3-Q4 last year plus the fact that the contracts have some inherent flexibility, meant that in Q4 we switched more to 40% oil linked and 60% spot, and that carried on through most of the first quarter. We &#x2013; the one thing that is relatively new is we have been re-looking at the &#x2013; any renegotiation clauses with quite a lot of our longer-term customers. And we've done several deals which confirm that most customers are very interested in longer term linkage to oil prices and contract volumes as opposed to spot volumes and so we traded off longer or extensions in the longer term that are oil price linked against greater flexibility to spot prices in the short term. So you will have seen that. Actually spot prices in Europe were reasonably firm, mainly because of the very cold winter during the quarter. And so it worked in our favor in that sense.</p>
          <p>Majnoon, good question; what we are currently focusing on is that first commercial production. We have to get the production up to 175,000 barrels a day from its current 45, before we really get any return, volumes or cash. Thereafter, we will be looking at a major field development plan, which would consume significant investment, but also produce significant cash flow back to Shell as a result. As we get to the point of recovering our expenditure, i.e., beyond first commercial production, we will, we do expect to recognize production, and that will be done effectively like a production sharing contract. We divide the, our commercially available share of revenues by the prevailing oil price to get the number of barrels produced. It's very similar to a PSC. A small amount was included in the 2012 target, because we do expect to reach our target by 2012. Looking out beyond, it's very difficult to say how much volume we're talking about, because we haven't yet defined the scope and particularly the pace of the second level of the major field development. We should take the field itself up above 1 million barrels a day of production. Relatively small spend in the first couple of years, no volume till 2012. We will recognize volume thereafter, but it will depend on the pace of the development. So, hopefully that's clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks very much. Very small follow-up on the gas one. Do I basically understand that you have a sort of 20% of flexibility between spot and fixed contracts, long-term contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the way it worked, but the amount of flexibility in the contract goes down during the operational year, which typically starts the 1st of October. They're not all the same, but it's the general rule. If you take all the flexibility in the first quarter you've got rather less left for the next three quarters.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the LNG business, which accounted for I think over $300 million of the beat in earnings today, still a bit of black hole for forecasting. And I was just wondering if there was a case for increased disclosure or better guidance on EBITDA in the LNG business? I know from your full-year results that the producing activities in the upstream give one number, and you have a reported upstream number and there was some implication that gas and power in midstream activities obviously make up the rest. But are you not at risk of having the LNG business undervalued if we don't see better disclosure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think perhaps we're the only one of the majors to actually split out the LNG business, so, in this kind of way to show the integrated earnings. And I think also, as we we've only really been doing this for two to three quarters, I do fully understand some of the challenges that you guys may have, and also 38% volume increase is not something that you may have projected. I think all of those factors play into the improvement that you see. The one other thing is that some &#x2013; if some of our LNG businesses are actually cost dividend again because we're left with a 20% shareholder and you get &#x2013; some quarters you got the dividend, some quarters you don't. And finally there is in the integrated gas business, in some businesses, such as Sakhalin, there is some liquid. We don't try and separate out obviously the liquids production contribution in Sakhalin; it would be a bit meaningless. And so all of those factors are playing into the ability of the analyst model, but I think over time you will see significant growth in this part of the business. You will see the Qatar volumes coming in there, and it will settle at a level which you'll see is not only strategically very, very relevant, but also gets easier for you to model over time. Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I just had a short follow-up, if I may. You mentioned that gearing may increase modestly through the year; are we talking towards the higher end of your 0 to 30% guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you &#x2013; we've put 5 billion into working capital; we could always take some of that back out again. That's one of the factors, and the oil price and gas price are the others. And we're not talking anywhere near the top end.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, they're in Sakhalin, and we don't &#x2013; we can't separate out separate earnings streams. That's &#x2013; it's around a quarter of the total volume in Sakhalin, it's about 25,000 barrel a day of our share.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could I also ask you to clarify, I believe you indicated 350 million equivalent barrel resources identified; was that strictly a Gulf of Mexico comment. Did that include all of Vito?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's strictly Gulf of Mexico. It's Shell share though, it's not the 100%. Our share in Vito in particular is 55%. That includes everything we've seen from well bore so far. It don't necessarily include what we might hope to see as we further appraise particularly around Appomattox, and obviously potentially Vito, because we've more appraisal to do there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding Majnoon in Iraq, thank you for your comments as to how you'll treat the volumes going forward. But what will happen with respect to the costs you incur in moving up toward the threshold level? How will you treat those costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically the same as a production sharing contract in principle. They are recorded as CapEx. When you get to the trigger point, you're allowed to recover them as available revenues. The revenues that are available are limited by the contract, which is relatively transparent, but I won't repeat it here. And as long as the oil price is high enough, there is a pretty rapid recovery of the sunk costs and thereafter your recovery is on a quarterly basis virtually, because there is a lot of volume and lot of available revenue to recover the cost, even though the CapEx cost will be quite high. So there is not a big cash sink in Iraq. There is going to be quite a lot of cash going in and coming out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So those costs will go on the balance sheet essentially until you reach the trigger point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then finally just one more: you stated your Asia-Pacific gas realizations fairly significantly. Could you discuss what that restatement was about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Northwest Shelf essentially; in the past because we have an EP and a GP business, we have what is, in effect, an artificial transfer price between EP and GP, because the Northwest Shelf, like Sakhalin, is a fully integrated project. So the change is primarily Northwest Shelf, but it gives us a much more realistic basis going forward. The gas realizations in Northwest Shelf are LNG. Of course Sakhalin and Qatar are also fully integrated, and basically the rules that you would expect applied from the way we choose to report them. Okay, hopefully that's clear.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>In China, we've taken on two 4,000 square kilometer blocks in joint venture with PetroChina. They will operate as PSCs. They are exploration blocks. So it's acreage we know is prospective. We know there's gas there. What we don't know is what's the quality of the reservoir, very much similar to an early North American play. We need to explore, learn from the initial wells, do the seismic, look for the sweet spots, get into the reservoir, do the frac jobs, look for the productivity, have we got the commercial development. We will do early activity on both of the large blocks this year. It's probably a two-year program before we know we've got, so unlikely before 2012 that we'd be looking at a major FID. We may do some pilot work before them.</p>
          <p>In the FIDs, back in March we gave a really full list of the 2010-2011 potential list, but the two key ones we're looking at at the moment, obviously <mark type="inaudible" /> second platform in the <mark type="inaudible" /> basin and <mark type="inaudible" /> floating LNG in Australia. You mentioned tight gas as well, of course. We don't take quite the same kind of FID, but the level of spend on our tight gas, shale gas positions, particularly in the Haynesville and in Canada, we look at at the moment as to what's the appropriate level of spend in the current market on both the cost and the revenue side. So, they're the key I think investment decisions in the next 6 to 12 months.</p>

          <p>Hi, couple of questions. Just on the gas pricing. If we stand now and assume oil prices remain at the current levels, how long would you estimate before your European portfolio, nation portfolio, would catch-up with where the oil price is now? And also within that, is there something we should sort of take into account with the way that NAM works as high price gas that you're going to sell more off in the winter than the summer? And then the second question, just to come back on your depreciation comment. As I understand it you depreciate over proved developed reserves, so can you just talk about whether that's on a field-by-field or a region-by-region basis or whatever, just so I can get a feel for how that depreciation charge could move with the bookings?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our stocks are back-in-work with proved developed reserves drive depreciation at a field level. It's certainly economic unit level, if you can identify cash flow associated with a given reservoir, that's the real, the level at which you calculate depreciation. So, even within a basin you can get quite different rates of depreciation, and hence it's sometimes a bit difficult to be completely unequivocal about the direction of movement. On gas pricing lags, we typically, on average, about a five-month lag, but within that there are anything between about three and six-month lags, and that applies to both LNG and the way that oil price linkage is structured in a European contract. So, if you're meaning today's oil price, mid 80s, how long to catch-up with that? Well it might be sort of late Q2, early Q3 before you get close and maybe mid Q3, late Q3 to average that amount.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Will it be fair to say you've also got some upside on mix effect sort of if you were to normalize out your spot to oil price linked mix as well?</p>

          <p>Difficult to project really what the gas demand in particular in Europe is going to do. I will say while the cold winter has been good for demand, it's not been very good for demand projections. We're not &#x2013; we're just not able to separate out what was weather driven and what was commercial industrial recovery driven. And that was the big drop in Europe, 15-20% down in some markets in '09 versus '08. So we really don't see real indicators of sustainable demand recovery yet, and if that stays low, stocks are reasonably okay and reasonably high, then gas pricing will still be under pressure during 2010.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon to everybody. One quick question if I may. If I look at the breakdown of cash costs in particular, production and manufacturing costs by business area, I can see that there is reduction in cash costs year-on-year of around U.S.$1 billion. In particular this comes from the exploration and production division. This is quite impressive considering also the growth you recorded in production. This seems to suggest a fall in unit production cost of around 15% year-on-year. Can you give us an idea of what are the drivers? In particular can you give us a clean number adjusted by ForEx effect, contribution to pension fund and so on, in order to reconcile this number with the $1 billion cost savings target you have for 2010? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sergio, well spotted. Obviously there are some impacts from all the things you mentioned, FX, pensions. If you just look at the headline numbers, we've not broken out for you this quarter specific underlying cost reductions. They are there. They're of the order of a few hundred million dollars for the Group. We're on track to deliver the 1 billion for the year. And what I would expect is that by in Q2, we'll give you a more specific update there when you can see and we can see to be honest the real sustainable underlying trends. Q1 is always a low quarter because as people get use to the new budget they have been allocated, so that's not untypical and Q1 is always difficult to project the full year from. But we'll say a bit more about that in Q2.</p>
          <p>Okay, which is probably a good segue into saying thank you very much for your questions and for the time you spent to join the call today. I hope it was valuable for you in understanding results and the delivery of strategy that we are starting to see. The second quarter results will be released on July the 29th, back to the Thursday. I look forward to speaking to you all then if not before. Thank you for your time and have a good day.</p>
