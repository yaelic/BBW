          <p>Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon and welcome to this teleconference regarding TeliaSonera's year-end 2007 report. I am Martti Yrj&#xF6;-Koskinen, Head of Group Investor Relations. At my side are Mr. Lars Nyberg, President and CEO, and Mr. Kim Ignatius, Executive Vice President and CFO.</p>
          <p>In the conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding the future business and financial performance of TeliaSonera and th telecommunication industry. These statements are predictions that involve risks and uncertainties. There can be no assurance that the actual results may not differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, due to many factors many of which are outside control of TeliaSonera. For your convenience, you'll find supporting slide presentation available at our website, teliasonera.com, and the aim is to finish this call in approximately 45 minutes and a replay will be available on the web at end of this conference.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to hand over to our President and CEO, Mr. Lars Nyberg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marty. And good morning, good afternoon to all of you. Let me give some initial comments before we try to answer your questions. I am now on the slide number two, which has a heading of "Investing in Future Growth." In general, I'm happy with the top-line growth and the bottom-line development for the fourth quarter, as I actually am for the full year. At the same time we have seen pressure on the EBITDA margin every quarter in 2007.</p>
          <p>During the year we continued investing in growth by strengthening and expanding our presence in Eurasia, building our Xfera brand in Spain and offering IP-based services with the ambition to migrate our fixed voice customer base, particularly here in Sweden. These investments together with price erosion or regulatory interventions unfavorably impacted our EBITDA.</p>
          <p>We are doing well in Eurasia. After some issues in 2006, we are again investing and gaining customers in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan and we have added two new markets Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.</p>
          <p>In both these markets we are currently rolling out our new networks. These are attractive growth markets for us, but also here we see challenging price pressure, like we do in all other markets. Looking at broadband and mobility in all markets, our share has been stable during another very competitive year and I view that as positive, as we quite often are the number one player, the one to challenge.</p>
          <p>Let me talk about fundamentals for success going forward. First and foremost, we must deliver high quality in our networks and services in all markets. We are a services company and therefore nothing can be more important. Specifically in Sweden, we need to succeed with our IP-based offerings or triple-play. As you all know, a big portion of the Group free cash flow is coming from fixed voice in Sweden, a business that we all know is in steady decline. We did succeed in 2007 launching our IPTV service and we need to continue the success during 2008.</p>
          <p>Our growth is currently mainly coming from Eurasia. This region is very important to us and we need to be successful in our new markets and, at the same time, find new opportunities in this region.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next slide, I want to talk about the planned efficiency measures. They are mandatory to implement for two reasons. First, this is a highly competitive market with sharply falling prices and any player with structurally higher costs will lose and we do not intend to lose. The second reason why this is mandatory is that we need to free up resources enabling us to invest in growth, be it in Eurasia or be it in network capacity due to exploding mobile data demand in our home markets. We also need to invest in migrating fixed voice to value-added services and continue to invest to ensure the highest quality in our networks and our services. These efficiency measures add up to a gross saving of SEK5 billion compared to the actual of 2007.</p>
          <p>As you remember, the 5 billion was the result of extensive analysis of best in class competitors and by function. We have now worked the details and we believe this is achievable. These are the management's opinion of what is possible and it's a sum of many initiatives. Now, in line with our agreements with unions, every initiative has to be discussed and concluded together with the unions, particularly in Sweden and Finland.</p>
          <p>The guiding principle for these initiatives has been and will continue to be that functions that are nice but not vital to have are the main targets for savings. The functions that are vital and efficient might actually in the future even get more resources if required. We believe that the majority of these savings will be materializing in 2009. We estimate that the impact of jobs is a reduction of a total of 2,900, divided with some two-third in Sweden and one-third in Finland. We also estimate the corresponding restructuring cost to be about SEK4 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me now address another topic: Yoigo in Spain. After having reached our first year's target in 2007, we will continue to execute our plan. When this investment was launched, we said we will be cash-flow positive in earnings accretive in 2011.</p>
          <p>For 2008, our plan says we should achieve close to 1 million subscribers and an EBITDA loss or investment of less than SEK1 billion. In 2009 the EBIDTA losses need to be significantly lower for us to achieve that target of 2011, I just mentioned. Let me now turn to the outlook for 2008. Our net sales developed well in 2007. We expect also in 2008 to show stable growth. The growth will come from Eurasia, Spain and Nordics-Baltics, mainly in Mobility.</p>
          <p>The market environment is consistently changing and we do not control the activities of our competitors. Despite this our ambition is to now maintain our EBITDA margin levels for the year 2008. We believe that the associated companies will continue to perform well and that our net income, excluding one-time positives in '07 from 2 billion will improve. Our CapEx will increase to some SEK15 billion. We are investing building networks in our new Eurasian market, selectively building fiber access in Sweden and Finland, and adding coverage in capacity to our existing mobile networks.</p>
          <p>Finally, before I leave the word to Kim, a couple of words about capital structure and the proposed dividends. Our target is to keep a solid investment-grade rating, meaning we want to have strong balance sheet with some flexibility. I would rather use this flexibility to invest in growth opportunities than to pay extraordinary dividends. Of course, if you don't see investment needs on mid-term basis, then excess capital will be returned to our shareholders. Our ordinary dividend will be at least 40% on an annual basis. And the proposal for 2007 is an ordinary dividend of 1.80 and then extraordinary dividend of SEK 2.20.</p>
          <p>Now, over to Kim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Hello, everybody. I will now walk through the financials for the full year and the last quarter, and also to point out some recent events. If we start with the net sales, we finished the year with SEK96.3 billion and the quarter at the level of close to 25 billion. We did have a growth between 6 to 7% throughout the quarters, a very stable development during each of the quarters.</p>
          <p>Looking at the EBITDA margin, we had a margin of 32.2 for the full year and the level of 28.9 for the last quarter. During the first three quarter, we saw a very stable trend of being roughly three percentage points below '06 levels and there are three main reasons for that. One is the development of Swedish fixed voice broadband operation and its profitability. The second is our investments in Spain. And the third is the margin erosion in some of our mobile operations.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the income from associates, very good year. We actually have an income which is 2 billion higher than the level in '06. We do see an increase in the net financials, 900 million in '07, and the increase is based on the higher net debt levels that we currently have. Income tax is low this time in Q4; we have around 600 million compared to last year's 1.5. This is because of the tax authorities have confirmed some of the tax losses that we had, and we have booked deferred tax assets in Finland and in Kazakhstan adding up to 850 million.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share for the full year, 394; so an improvement compared to '07 and, for Q4, around SEK1. CapEx levels 13.5, clearly a higher level than what we had in '06. '07 levels is 14% of net sales. This is as we communicated in the beginning of the year and the reason for the increase is our investments in improving coverage and adding capacity to support our mobile and broadband services. Free cash flow at the level of 13 billion.</p>
          <p>When we looked at the business areas, Mobility is really growing well. Very positive development in the Swedish market, where the volume increases are adding quite a lot despite the price erosion that we see. In Denmark, we added close to 1 billion, mainly through the acquisitions of debitel. This is still a transition year where we are transferring customer to our network and the profitability level of the Danish debitel part of the business is low. They are also growing in Spain and the Baltics.</p>
          <p>Looking at the Broadband Services, the fixed-voice decline trends continue to be pretty much at the same level where they're been during the last few years and we're not able totally to offset the decline with new broadband services. Integrated Enterprises growing in their area of managed services and mainly through acquisitions. Eurasia showing very good signs after some difficult years in the markets, real good growth in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan and we are adding to new market being Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.</p>
          <p>Looking at the operating income for the full year. Of course, the net sales having a positive impact We are really improving earnings in Finland and Sweden, but do see declining earnings levels in Norway, Denmark and Lithuania. The impact of Spain is a good-size impact. We have an additional EBITDA loss of 1.2 billion between the two years.</p>
          <p>On Broadband Services, two items to point out: We do get, we do have the impact from the cost savings in Sweden and Finland, adding up to close to 800 million, but at the same time, we have an increased cost for growth initiatives in Sweden and Finland, again adding up to over SEK1 billion. In Eurasia, the development is, I said, very positive, 2.3 billion improvement.</p>
          <p>On slide 11, when we look at the net sales year-on-year, you could say that the trends that we've seen for the full year have been the same trends for all of the quarters. And that goes for each and one of the BA's.</p>
          <p>When we look at the year-on-year, Q4 operating income in the Mobility part of business, again good growth levels, but we do see price erosion and volume growth, decreasing the gross margins. And in many of markets, we have added marketing spending to retain customers, but also to increase our customer base.</p>
          <p>Looking at Broadband Services, again the same trends, meaning that we do have cost savings during the quarter, but we have spent more in the growth initiatives in both main markets. Integrated Enterprise Services growing through acquisitions. The negative impact on the operating income level comes from that decrease margins in the large corporate customer sales. Then, Eurasia improvement to 500 million. This improvement comes mainly from Turkcell and MegaFon. In Q4, we do not see a big impact of the increased sales on the EBIT level and this is because of the fairly aggressive marketing levels. We have, though, increased our customer base, which will help us, going forward.</p>
          <p>Cash flows, on slide 13, miss on the EBITDA, 1.2 billion. We gain 1 billion on dividends received from associated companies. A major difference between the years is on the income taxes paid. We paid 5.1 billion and last year 2.4. Last year, we had a one-time tax refund of 1.5 billion related to the operations. Positives from changes in working capital and then at the higher CapEx levels impacting negatively our cash flows, ending-up with a free cash flow level of 13 billion compared to 16.6 last year.</p>
          <p>Then jumping into Eurasia quickly, two transactions that we made there. We acquired Coscom in Uzbekistan, during the summer of '07. We have now sold 26% of the company to a local partner and, as part of the same transaction, we have acquired some assets related to licenses, frequencies and number lots, with a net cash consideration from our part at the level of $30 million. We have granted our partner a put option, which can be used after December '09. And this put option needs to be fair-valued on an ongoing basis. And the put option valuation can have an impact on the profit and loss statement for TeliaSonera.</p>
          <p>The second transaction done in Eurasia in January '08 is that we have acquired 14.3% interest in Geocell from our local partners and we now own 97.5% of the company. Overall the financial key ratios, on slide 15. We had a very good year. The return on equity is at level of 18.6. A very good achievement under return of capital employed, at 19.4%. For '07, as told by Lars, we are a very high yielding share, and even after the good returns to our shareholders. We continue to be one of the best-rated telecom operators in Europe. I'll end my part here and I'll hand back to Mart.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Peter Nielsen. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Peter-Kurt Nielsen from Cheuvreux in London. The two questions please. Firstly, you talked about investing in new growth opportunities and I think you mentioned new opportunities in Eurasia. It would be interesting what kind of opportunities you would be referring to here? And secondly, have you seen or, do you see, an opportunity for any movement in your position relating to Turkcell in Turkey and MegaFon in Russia, in terms of ownership stakes, etcetera. That will be interesting, in your comments, how much you believe you can do yourself in this respect? And thirdly, I believe you mentioned at an earlier conference call this morning. It related to a question of your relatively high CapEx forecast for this year, that you might have underinvested slightly in the home markets and I'd be interested in where is it you believe you would need more CapEx in the next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Lars. Let me start with Eurasia. I think, we are, first of all, willing to invest in the markets we are already established in, but more importantly, we are also looking for neighboring countries, like the two we acquired during the last year, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. There are other countries in the region that we are not present in and if the right opportunity presents itself, we certainly will, with interest, look into that opportunity.</p>
          <p>On the issue of associated companies, Turkcell and MegaFon, not much has changed since the third quarter. I can repeat what I said then. We are very interested and very happy with our investments, of course, in these two companies. We would like to have a majority position if it was possible. If the markets are very interested, then we could also consider to maintain a minority position. If we have a minority position, we would like to have a degree of control and a degree of liquidity in our ownership. The latter, for us, more to the way we own a minority position. It's a fairly complicated setup today. I would like to see it simpler.</p>
          <p>And, as in the case of Turkcell, I think having these companies listed make the valuation more transparent. We have been supportive of potential listing of MegaFon from day one and we're still supportive of it. Since the third quarter, we have kept open communication lines with our co-owners, with the people in Turkey, with the people in Russia. And we continue to discuss this. What I have told you is what I'm telling them. Nothing has changed in any way dramatically, so, but we'll continue to discuss and hopefully, one day, something will change and we can see what I have described.</p>
          <p>And generally CapEx. You asked me about CapEx. We have taken the decision, as you know, to invest in migrating our fixed-voice business in Sweden, particularly in Sweden, to value-added services and that is very important to us, because the fixed-voice business, although it's a declining business, it's still generating a lot of free cash and profits for us. And I think it's absolutely natural that we try to migrate that important customer base into new services where we, actually, I think, have the possibility to add a lot of functionality going forward. Having said that I think you should realize that one revenue krona in the fixed-voice generates more of bottom line impact than one revenue krona in the value-added services. So that's the background to these, the remark about making some more investments in the home markets.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Comes from the line of James Britton. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I have got a number of questions. It's James Britton from Lehman Brothers. First question around Swedish fixed. You said in the Q3 release that the decline in sales of Swedish fixed was slowing down and approaching the point where growth in broadband compensates for the decrease in legacy voice. In that context, can you just explain why growth has fallen sharply again in Q4 and should we expect a strong rebound in 2008, if you haven't changed your view? Second question is on Yoigo. Does KPN's launch of the Simyo brand have any implications for how challenging you might find your targets for 2008? And how long would you suffer any deviation from plan before you consider other strategic options for that asset? And then third question, can you just clarify whether or not MegaFon's shareholder disputes are now fully settled from your point of view. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the first question regarding the fixed-voice development and the trends. We said in Q3 that, before that quarter, we saw that the broadband services were picking up nicely and, at the same time, we had bundled some traditional fixed services together with our broadband offerings and, for that period, the trends looked better. I think I made it, even myself, fairly clear in our communication that I did not believe that there was a change in the trends, that the 10% decline in fixed voice that we had seen during the last few years, that that would continue. And I still today believe that that is the case, going forward. We, of course, aim to increase our broadband services and sales from that part, but the declines will continue. So the Q3 was a more positive quarter than I foresee taking place in the near future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is Lars, responding to your question about the KPN. I mean, I think there are two reactions to it. It's interesting that there is a player who thinks Spain is attractive to be the first entrance to it. You know there's a healthy debate among our owners whether this was a good investment or not. On the other hand, which is negative, we get more competition. What we here believe all along that -- Spain isn't an interesting market, that almost the argument we had when we took this decision about two years ago. And we did deliver on the plan in '07 and I joined the company at the point in time when we had made the majority of the investments already. And I decided I want to support this as long as you deliver the plan, and we delivered the plan in '07. I have now shared with the market not only the number of subscribers before '08, but also the result in Yoigo for '08, which is the plan, and that has to be delivered, for continued support, obviously. On the question on settlement, no, all the legal things have not been settled. There are several things pending or at least not settled. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>It's from the line of Andrew Hogley. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, it's Andrew Hogley at Execution. I hope you could just say a few words about the Enterprise business. It's had negative operating cash flow now for the last three consecutive years, losing money every quarter. What can you do to turn that situation around and is it fair for us to assume that you've reached cash-flow break-even or preferably cash-flow positive any time in the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Lars again. This is one of issues that I identified when I came. It's actually one of the five priorities that I have been publicly communicating. How do we organize our B2B efforts? The background of the IAS was that we, at that point in time, a couple of years ago, I believe four years ago, saw a trend, like several other operators, that we believed that the customers were asking for a combination of IT services and telecommunication services from a main contractor, and I think TeliaSonera, at that point in time, was a little bit afraid that we would be down -- degraded to a sub-supplier to the main contractor and, sort of, lose the direct relationship with the end-user. On top of that, we believe that if we could expand our managed services, that could, in itself, in its own right, be an attractive business.</p>
          <p>I have another background. I joined the company five months ago. I am coming from the IT side, and I saw this a little bit different and I think also the development in the last four years in the marketplace confirmed, sort of, my somewhat different opinion.</p>
          <p>The business-to-business market is very important to TeliaSonera. Don't get that wrong. We were also not organized very efficiently. We actually had three units, separate units, that claimed, sort of, claimed to the business-to-business market. What we have done now, we have combined all the sales people from these three units that were involved in the business-to-business and created one sales organization. That's one decision.</p>
          <p>The other decision is also important is, we have reduced, not eliminated, reduced, our ambition when it comes to managed services. We want to sell managed services. Don't get me wrong. But I want to sell managed services that we are experts in, because otherwise, my experience in managed services, it can become very expensive. We have done a couple of acquisitions, Cygate for instance. And, obviously, in that kind of managed services, we are experts, and certainly intend to continue. But fundamentally these business-to-business sales organization is to sell our &#x2013; first of all, our standard products and systems and services for Mobility and Broadband, and then some very well defined managed services. And we think we can partner with the IT companies. Nobody has to be main or sub-supplier. I think we can be partners and we see trends today with big customers that actually want to buy the IT separate from the telecommunication.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I hate to, sort of, bang on, a sort, of old theme, but I missed the first part of the call and I wondered, Lars, if you could just clarify exactly the message that you're wanting us to take away about how you expect the dividend to evolve over the next couple of years, as a first thing, and then secondly. I wondered if you had any comment about the remarks that we saw last week from the MegaFon CEO about the outlook for the Russian market, which seems to be quite conservative, and I wonder if you had anything to add or any clarification you could give, in terms of what you heard from him in your end discussions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, the proposed dividend for 2007 is the SEK1.80 and extraordinary dividend of SEK2.20. This is the 10 billion that we sort of scheduled three years ago, and said we will, over three years, pay at least 10 billion extra dividend. So that's the end of this program.</p>
          <p>We came out already in the third quarter with our policy on dividends and we said that our target is to keep a solid investment grade rating, that we want to have the flexibility. I added today, that I want to use their flexibility in the first instance for investment for growth rather than paying extraordinary dividend. We also said that if we don't see those investment in the mid-term, we will return excess capital to the shareholders. And we've changed, and we did that already in third quarter. We changed the earlier policy, which was 30 to 50% to minimum 40. And I believe that 1.80 that is proposed now is in the range of 45, 46%.</p>

          <p>Can I come back to you on that one, quickly? In some respects, it sounds almost the same policy in terms of &#x2013; I'm assuming "if we didn't have any other greater uses of the cash, we'd give you the 10 billion" seems to be the message before. But I'm sensing that &#x2013; that's the message now, almost -- although, I guess you're not talking in terms of 10 billion. And, but, you seem to be, wanting us to make, just to understand, that you're more likely, I guess, to sort of, the -- to close out, also to go actively looking perhaps for the acquisition than perhaps was the case previously. Am I right, in thinking that's the message I should be taking away?</p>

          <p>I'm not sure. Let me say some word and Kim can correct me if I'm wrong, because Kim was here the years when I was not. What I think, the company did was three years ago, they said -- they went out and said, we're going to pay 10 billion per year for three years. And we're going to finance that by gearing up the company. That's what &#x2013; that's what we said. And this is now, this process is now over. We've geared up the company. Our net debt is significantly higher than it was then, and we have paid out the money.</p>
          <p>What I'm saying now is, we want to have a solid rating, to be high flexibility. And then I am saying, yes, I would prefer to spend that money on investing for growth. But I'm also saying, I'm not going to sit on that money forever if I can't find those investment, because it belongs to the shareholder and they will be returned to the shareholder. And I suppose you can do that in many ways. At that point in time, it's for the Board to decide whether they want to do this or that, buying stock back or having extra dividend. We are not there. But as a policy, if we don't find these investments that I think should have the highest priority, excess cash will be returned. MegaFon, going to questions further.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hello. This is Stefan Pettersson at Kaupthing Bank. I know that the Integrated Enterprise Services will not be reported as a separate business area going forward, but until then, we still have to model it. And after capital markets day, you had a rather positive view on this business area, both in terms of organic growth -- this year you had a negative organic growth in this business area. Also it was stated that it's no reason why Integrated Enterprise Services should not be able to have 10% EBITDA margin. Now, in the report, you state that, it will not have profit and loss responsibility, partly measured by growth, market share and sales efficiencies. Can you just comment on: Is it totally unreasonable that you can reach for this kind of business, the 10% EBITDA margin? Do you not see that as a possibility, going forward, and also regarding your new view on the business, do you not see this kind of growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is Kim, first on the growth levels in the plans that we communicated to the capital market days. We had a -- just a second --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the benefit in years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. It's better. In the growth targets that we communicated during the capital market days, we had, let's say a broader scope of the IES business in our thoughts, as Lars just stated, we are down-scaling a bit the ambition what comes to the IT part of the service to be offered and are sticking closer to the basic Telco sector where we actually believe that we have the competence to drive that business. So in that way, the growth ambitions will be lower, going forward.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the EBITDA margins, the benchmarks we've done there and our understanding is that even with the existing sales levels, we could have reached the 10% margin levels through efficiency improvements within the operations and these efficiency improvements will continue to be on our agenda, but not in the form of IES improvements, but improvements that we can do in Broadband Services and maybe partly Mobility as well, when we have restructured. IES will not continue to be a BA and they will not continue to have profitability responsibility, but this is now transferred to Broadband and Mobility. They are responsible for the product offerings that we had. They are responsible for the profitability and they will be responsible in executing many of those savings programs and targets that we had originally for IES.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, James Rivett from Citigroup. I've just got two questions, if I can. The first is: there's clearly a seasonal impact within the Swedish fixed-line cost base. But on an underlying basis from here, going forward, should we now expect to see EBITDA margins rising Is that your, sort of, best-case scenario. And the second is on Finland. We've seen a bigger-than-usual, sort of, year-on-year decline in EBITDA margins in spite of the fact that all of the substrates have been predominately prepaid this quarter. Should we take that as meaning that the Finnish market has changed in some way over the last quarter and it's no longer the improving environment that it was? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, on the broadband margins. We are not giving guidance on the different business areas or specifically not on the business units. I think the components you have to build in is that that, as you seen earlier as well, we do have the fixed-voice decline and that trend will continue, so that puts pressure on the margins. We do have savings programs, have been put in before and now are launching a new target, which will help us and the same time we have a third component, which is really launching IP based services, which will  increase our spending on a short-term basis. What you saw in the Q4 were some positives impacting, partly the interconnect releases and partly lower network maintenance cost than what we had in '06.</p>
          <p>Sorry that I cannot give you more specific guidance. Overall in Finland, I would say that we've had a good year. We really improved the margin levels from '06 going to '07. We having a more stable situation right now. No reason to get worried about the coming quarters in that market. And, of course, the efficiency measures that we are launching now will help us also in the Finnish mobility part of the business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can I just ask one follow-up, just in terms of the capital returns, I know its very boring, but should we expect for the Board to review the policy that you set down on an annual basis or is the fact that you can go looking for acquisitions, is that sort of set-in-stone for the next three or four years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can comment. The policy is what it is and I don't think the Board will review that on an on-going basis. And the policy as you said that is there is excess capital that should be returned, but the Board will look into the matter if there is or isn't excess capital and that will then depend on the acquisition opportunities, the cash at hand and so on. And that is something that the management together with the Board will need to take a view on an on-going basis. There is no automatic kind of system, going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and we have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Comes from the line of Ulrich Rathe. Please go ahead, announcing company name.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ulrich Rathe at Dresdner Kleinwort in London. Two questions maybe. One on IPTV. In the morning conference call, Lars, you stressed very much IPTV as sort of the key growth opportunity where a lot of the investment is going to flow. Could you just talk a bit more about where exactly the investments are going to go? So areas like, maybe, into the set-top boxes, into the access network, into the content area and into the <mark type="inaudible" />. I mean I assume it's all of it. But where is, sort of, is the split or where is the focus I mean in terms of the spending? That will be question one.</p>
          <p>The second question, maybe, on Swedish Mobile and I was wondering whether if you could gives us a sense of the cost of mobile broadband growth and what is the subsidy level in mobile broadband, on average? And also do you believe, in Swedish mobile, there is the risk of cannibalization in fixed broadband or do you think this is complementary product, predominantly, to fixed broadband? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Lars. Let me start with the IPTV. IPTV is important in Sweden for two separate reasons. The first reason is the customer base. We have big, still, a big customer base that, I think, is very valuable and I believe that offering value-added services, and particularly IPTV, will enable us to maintain that customer base.</p>
          <p>The investment is actually not so much in set-top box, is really in the fiber access. We need, ultimately, we need, I think, 100 megabit per second. When people want to see HDTV, they want to see different channels on different sets. I don't think 24 megabit per second will be enough. Now, we won't do that overnight. We'll do it step by step and also feeling that we have the response from the marketplace. So, that's, sort of, the answer on that question.</p>
          <p>Yeah and you've talked about fixed broadband and mobile broadband. I think we'll live with the both technologies and -- the decision to be made on IPTV, it's an important decision. We happen to believe, and I certainly happened to believe, that for a long period of time, in counties where you have already fixed-network cannibalization and everything, the fixed line will be the most efficient way to provide high-speed access. And that's why we have decided to invest in this IPTV thing, and upgrading the fiber access. But at the same time, mobile data is a fact. I think it will always lag behind in capacity, or at least temporarily lag behind. It'll catch up and then the broadband will go further. People expect to be able to do basically everything at home and they expect to be able to do it on the road. So I think you need both technologies and I feel very comfortable with the decision to do the investments in the fixed network and we will do, over time, investments in the mobile networks. So, we can provide exactly what I said, you can do it at home, you can do it on the road.</p>
