      <participant id="6" type="corprep">Our exposure to commercial mortgage-backed securities is also negligible. As the data on page 26 indicates, we held only $607 million of nonagency USCMDS's at year-end, representing less than 1% of our fixed-maturity portfolio and having an average credit rating of AAA. And all of these investments were acquired in 2004 and prior, well before recent increases in commercial real estate values.</participant>
      <participant id="7" type="corprep">On page 27, we show certain information for our remaining real estate-related holdings. This is a highly diverse portfolio, and recent appraisals for wholly owned properties and joint ventures are well in excess of current carrying value. Here, too, we feel very comfortable with our investments and their carrying values. The common theme in all of this is a highly disciplined approach to investing, recognizing that as a company we take most of our risk on the liability side of the balance sheet and making sure that on the investment side we're appropriately compensated for the risks that we do take.</participant>
      <participant id="8" type="corprep">Pages 28 and 29 provide information about our guidance for full year 2008. We expect fully diluted operating income per share to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.75, generating an operating return on equity of approximately 13% to 14%. Based upon expected market conditions, we are anticipating somewhat lower NII due to a more challenging investment environment, particularly for nonfixed income investments, and a 1% increase in our underlying combined ratio due to a continuation of the somewhat more competitive underwriting environment.</participant>
      <participant id="9" type="corprep">Our guidance assumes full-year catastrophe losses of $525 million pre-tax and $340 million after tax or $0.55 per share after tax, which represents the average annual loss expectancy as indicated by our CAT modeling; no prior-year reserve development, either favorable or unfavorable; growth in average invested assets in the low single digits after approximately $2.7 billion of share repurchases; and weighted average diluted shares of approximately 618 million after share repurchases and employee equity awards.</participant>
      <participant id="10" type="corprep">Finally, on page 29 we have provided certain information that should help you understand the major differences between actual operating income per diluted share in 2007 and our 2008 guidance.</participant>

          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth quarter and full-year earnings review for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Connelly, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Connelly, you may begin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and welcome to the Travelers discussion of fourth-quarter and full-year 2007 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com, under the investor section.</p>
          <p>Today with me is Jay Fishman, CEO; Jay Benet, CFO; Brian MacLean, Chief Operating Officer; Joe Lacher, Head of our Personal and Select businesses, and Tom Kunkel, President of Bond and Financial Products, as well as other members of senior management.</p>
          <p>They will discuss the financial results of our business in the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through their prepared remarks and we will open up for questions.</p>
          <p>Given the number of topics we plan to cover in our prepared remarks, we'll run past our normal one hour, but we'll still leave 30 minutes for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Before I turn it over to Jay, I'd like to draw your attention to the following on page one of the webcast. Our presentation today includes certain forward-looking information as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Specifically, our earnings guidance is forward-looking and we may make other forward-looking statements about the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of the company's reserves and other topics. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from our current expectation due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Also, in our remarks or responses to questions we may mention Travelers's operating income which we use as a measure of profit and other measures that may be non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplements and other materials that are available in the Investor section of our website, Travelers.com. With that I'm going to turn it over to Jay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased with our company's performance in the fourth quarter and for the entire year. On the bottom line, for the full year, we posted operating income of $4.5 billion or $6.71 per diluted share, with a strong operating return on equity of nearly 18%. Operating income per share increased nearly 14% over 2006. On the topline, net written premiums increased 3%, adjusted for the sales of Afianzadora Insurgentes and Mendota. We're pleased with this result, particularly given the somewhat more competitive marketplace we faced this year. With disciplined underwriting, we've been able to grow our business profitably and that's what we will strive for again in 2008. Each of our business segments contributed to the $1.1 billion of operating income that we earned in the fourth quarter. Retentions remain and are at historically high levels, and margins continued to remain strong as evidenced by our fourth-quarter and full-year overall combined ratios of 88.4% and 87.4%, respectively.</p>
          <p>In keeping with our commitment to active capital management, in the fourth quarter we repurchased $1 billion of our company's stock to bring the total amount repurchased to $4.1 billion since inception of the program in the second quarter of 2006. The board of directors has approved an additional $5 billion of common share repurchases, bringing the total remaining authorization to just under $6 billion.</p>
          <p>The company remains very well capitalized and highly liquid and our balance sheet is strong. We're well positioned for the marketplace ahead. This morning we're broadening our call to provide insight and transparency into a number of issues that may be of investor interest, particularly given recent events. We've covered our residential subprime exposure previously and we will update that, but we're also going to provide insight into our commercial mortgage-backed securities position and our real estate-owned portfolio.</p>
          <p>We're going to discuss our directors and officers and errors and omissions exposure to the subprime environment generally as this has received some attention in the press over the last few weeks.</p>
          <p>We're also going to cover our subdivision surety bond position, and update you on that portfolio. In all of these areas, we are pleased and comfortable with our position and will share with you our analysis of these various exposures. We think you'll be pleased with the transparency and candor of the analysis as well as the conclusions we've reached.</p>
          <p>To make sure we cover everything, Jay, Brian and Joe are going to go through the customary materials somewhat more quickly than we have in the past. From an underwriting perspective, the fourth quarter was not much different from the third, and we don't anticipate a meaningful change in our marketplace strategy for 2008. We do expect that the investment environment will be somewhat more challenging. Nonetheless, that is all factored into the 2008 guidance we provided in our press release and Jay will have more to say about that later.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Jay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jay. Page three of the webcast summarize our fourth-quarter and full-year financial performance. Net earned premiums increased by 2% quarter over quarter and by 3% year over year. Fourth-quarter operating income exceeded $1 billion for the sixth quarter in a row, and full-year operating income climbed to 4.5 billion, an increase of 7% from an already highly profitable 2006.</p>
          <p>Importantly, notwithstanding the very challenging investment environment that's recently hurt many banks and other large financial institutions, our investment portfolio performed very well for both the quarter and the full year and it remains very healthy and well positioned. I'll speak to NII and certain components of our investment portfolio in a few minutes, but I wanted to specifically point out the $6 million of after-tax net realized investment gains for the quarter and the $101 million after-tax net realized investment gains for the full year.</p>
          <p>These net realized investment gains include impairments of only $38 million pre-tax for the fourth quarter and 70 million pre-tax for the entire year. These low levels of impairments truly speak to the high quality of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our weighted average diluted share count of 649 million has dropped significantly due to our share repurchase activity. We repurchased 19 million common shares in the fourth quarter at a total cost of a billion dollars, bringing full-year share repurchases to 8.3% of outstanding shares as of the beginning of the year. And since the second-quarter 2006 inception of this program, we've purchased 78.8 million shares at a total cost of $4.1 billion, representing 11.3% of the outstanding shares as of the beginning of that period.</p>
          <p>Given our strong operating performance and financial position, we expect to complete the current $5-billion share repurchase program near the end of the first quarter of 2008, although as always we modify our repurchase -- we will modify our repurchase activity based upon current market conditions.</p>
          <p>And as Jay already mentioned, our board has approved an additional $5 billion multiyear program under which share repurchases are expected to begin immediately after completing the current program.</p>
          <p>The information on page four speaks to many of the reasons why we feel so good about our company. Let me start by saying that our balance sheet is in terrific shape. We ended the year with almost $26 billion of common equity ex-FAS 115, up 5% since the beginning of the year and book value per share ex-FAS 115 of $41.23, up 14% since the beginning of the year, each after $2.9 billion of share repurchases and $738 million of common stock dividends. Our capital is at or above target levels for our regulators and rating agencies, and we have no current need to add to our capital base other than for normal growth which we are self-funding. We're currently under review for possible upgrade from Moody's, from whom our claims-paying rating is already at AA-3. And we continue to generate significant amounts of excess capital.</p>
          <p>Our debt-to-capital ratio of 19.4% favorably compares to its 20% target. And with a very low level of debt maturing in 2008 and 2009, coupled with our very strong liquidity, we have the ability to self-fund all of these maturities, placing us in the enviable position of being able to refinance debt in the capital markets if and when we believe market conditions are favorable.</p>
          <p>Our holding company liquidity of 1.6 billion significantly exceeds our target of one year's worth of interest and dividends by $500 million, and we are not reliant on commercial paper for funding or liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio had a pre-tax unrealized gain of $937 million at year-end 2007, and we have determined that we have immaterial exposure to ratings changes from municipal bonds insurers. We've closely examined our exposures to subprime Alt-A mortgages as well as to commercial mortgage-backed securities and SIV assets and found each of them to be negligible, and the rest of our real estate portfolio is well diversified and appropriately valued.</p>
          <p>Lastly, while not on the slide, I'd like to point out that our insurance reserves have continued to develop favorably as we've had net favorable prior-year reserve development in each of the last of the last eight quarters.</p>
          <p>The data provided on page five highlights several items that are contained within our consolidated operating income and GAAP combined ratios. I will make just a few comments here. Net favorable prior-year reserve development was $83 million after tax in the current quarter, and we made no adjustments to our asbestos or environmental reserves other than for payment activity.</p>
          <p>Current-quarter catastrophe losses of $45 million mostly resulted from wildfires in California. And we also experienced a favorable revision to our loss ratio estimates for the current accident year, resulting in a $35 million after-tax benefit in the current quarter.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to now turn the microphone over to Brian MacLean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jay. I'll start on slide six and talk a little about the marketplace, go through the segment results for our commercial businesses, and then offer some specific comments on our subprime exposure generally.</p>
          <p>Our commercial businesses performed very well this quarter, and for that matter, throughout 2007. The fundamentals of our business are very strong. Margins remain strong and are consistently solid across all our markets. The renewal book has performed exceptionally well, with very high retention and, in general, modest price declines. The new business environment has been somewhat more competitive, particularly in the fourth quarter, so even though we saw some softening, our performance was extremely favorable.</p>
          <p>Looking at the details on slide seven, you can see that retentions are very high; across all the businesses they've been consistently strong, and we had improved retentions across the board in the quarter. These levels reflect our strategy to leverage our excellent margins and keep the profitable business we have on our books. We believe these high retentions clearly reflect the value of our franchise to our agents and our customers, and have not been attained at the expense of meaningful rate accommodation.</p>
          <p>This is clear from the pure rate change on the renewal book, which shows a modest decline. Comparing rate change in the fourth quarter 2007 with fourth quarter 2006, you see that Select, our small commercial business, has experienced only a two-point rate change. In addition, Commercial Accounts has seen a two-point rate change and remain consistent with last quarter.  In our international and financial products businesses, pure rate has come down but gradually. In all, you can see a gradual decline in pure rate change over the past several quarters with the biggest declines being in larger account markets.</p>
          <p>On slide eight we show total renewal price change, which reflects both the rate and exposure change. RPC can be more erratic due to these exposure movements, but as you see our experience over the past eight quarters has been generally consistent with the pure rate trends.</p>
          <p>New business dollars are also shown on slide eight, and you can see that overall 2007 was a very strong year. In almost all markets, new business submissions were up dramatically from 2006, a result of the initiatives we've discussed in previous calls, including Express and Express Plus and Select and the new products offered through our Industry Edge initiative. In the fourth quarter we were still seeing good flow but the number of new accounts we actually wrote as a percentage of quotes, our hit ratio, while steady through 2006 and 2007, moved down slightly in the quarter. This decline in hit ratio indicates a more competitive marketplace for new business, with pricing sometimes at levels lower than we're willing to go. Even with this competitive environment, new business pricing on the deals we did write remained at acceptable levels, and for the full year 2007 showed strong performance, with a total of $2.8 billion written in these markets.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide nine, business insurance turned in a great performance, with a 4% increase in operating income in the quarter and a 15% increase for the full year. The combined ratios for both the quarter and full year were 87.8, an improvement of 3.1 points from 2006.</p>
          <p>Severity was benign this quarter, again in the lower single digits, continuing the trends seen in previous quarters. As we outlined in last quarter's call, frequency, while continuing to decline slightly, is leveling off. This quarter's results have demonstrated a continuation of that moderate trend, again still within a favorable range. When we adjust our combined ratio for net favorable prior-year development, business insurance had a terrific full year result at 91.1, consistent with 2006.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide ten, you see that net written premium is down 2% in business insurance this quarter due to our disciplined underwriting in the new business environment we discussed. If you look at the full year, most of the markets were up year over year, resulting in a 2% improvement, again driven largely by the strong retentions and the impact of our initiatives in products and analytics.</p>
          <p>Looking at slide 11, the Financial, Professional &amp; International Insurance segment continued to produce positive results with operating income up 5% from the same quarter last year. Full-year results showed an 11% increase. The combined ratio improved 5.1 points quarter over quarter, and for the full year, it was 87.6, a strong result, again improved over 2006.</p>
          <p>The lower portion of the slide shows net written premiums up 2% for the quarter and 4% for the full year. In Bond &amp; Financial Products, growth in our Surety business was offset by declines in management liability products. Underlying the growth in Surety is our high retention of existing accounts, solid flow of new business, and a credit profile that continues to get stronger.</p>
          <p>The international operations premium increase was favorably impacted by foreign exchange rates, as well as solid growth in our Lloyd's and Canadian businesses.</p>
          <p>We are pleased that even after adjusting for net favorable prior-year development, the FPII segment combined ratio for 2007 was 90.6 versus 89.4 in '06. In a minute I will provide comments specific to our Management Liability book and subprime environment, but want to emphasize here that even after taking into account the impact of any losses or all the losses from these issues, this business continues to perform at very profitable levels.</p>
          <p>Overall, in this quarter our commercial insurance business has produced great results. The fundamentals of our business are solid. Retention of our profitable book is strong and margins remain excellent. We recognize an increasingly competitive marketplace and certain underlying economic pressures. However, we're maintaining our focus on growth, albeit in a disciplined manner, and that discipline produced another terrific quarter.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going to take a few minutes to talk about our Management Liability book of business and how we evaluate potential exposure to the subprime environment. On slide 12, we've shown our Management Liability premium for 2007 and broken out the portion of this book by product that we estimate is exposed to this issue. You can see that we have 1.6 billion of Management Liability premium, and have separated it into four product groups. Directors and officers, fiduciary, errors and omissions and all other products. The other category contains a variety of products that are footnoted at the bottom of the page and would not directly respond to the issues created by subprime.</p>
          <p>In the three exposed product groups, the percentage of our book that we estimate is exposed to subprime is relatively small, primarily due to the diverse nature of the book. For example, approximately 40% of the total book is with private and nonprofit accounts with negligible exposure to this issue. Additionally, we have a very industry-diverse book, and specifically, our market position in the financial services industry is led by our community bank portfolio. These are smaller banks which so far have not been associated with the subprime issues and we don't currently anticipate that as a class they will. Our portfolio is not heavily weighted to larger public company financial institutions or money center and investment banks. Overall, our total exposed management liability products are less than 1% of our total company premium.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 13, it's important to consider specific characteristics of these products and our approach to underwriting. D&amp;O, E&amp;O and fiduciary products are issued on claims-made policies, which dramatically reduces the latency tail on the business and the ability to stack limits. Very importantly, policy limits are low, between five and $25 million, and are weighted more heavily towards excess coverage than primary, with relatively high attachment points.</p>
          <p>Specifically for the exposed D&amp;O policies, our average limit is about $8 million, and 70% of the premium is excess. On these excess accounts, we typically attach at over $50 million, which is very important when you consider the defense costs due to this issue could be considerable.</p>
          <p>We also have a reinsurance program that further limits our exposure. On a policy level basis we see it approximately two-thirds above a $5 million retention, which reduces our net exposure per loss to $12 million up to an annual aggregate of approximately $375 million. In addition, we've been proactively taking into account the subprime pressures throughout much of 2007 incorporating the environment into our underwriting. So considering our diverse book and the way we've approached the market, you can see that we've acted to restrict our exposure, and we expect that any potential issue would be a frequency, not a severity one.</p>
          <p>If you turn to slide 14, I'd like to walk you through the detailed analysis we've performed to determine our potential exposure to subprime claims. For starters, we conducted an individual account analysis on all accounts that we felt had an elevated level of exposure. The definition of what was elevated obviously began with accounts that had current reported claims or notices, and I'll speak directly to them in a moment. Second, we identified and individually analyzed accounts for which we had not received a claim or notice but which we determined to have a heightened risk of loss. This group was broad and included large financial institutions, subprime lenders, bond insurers, home builders and suppliers, as well as related accounts we saw mentioned in major financial press.</p>
          <p>For this analysis, we reviewed each individual account from an actuarial claim and underwriting point of view. Our team factored in relevant circumstances of each account with particular attention to the structure of the coverage, including limits and attachment points, as well as reinsurance. The result is an account-by-account estimate of ultimate gross and net liability.</p>
          <p>Third, we performed an aggregate analysis to estimate losses not identified in the individual account analysis. In this portion of our portfolio, which included accounts such as community banks, we conducted an actuarially based frequency and severe analysis to understand our level of exposure. The net result of this entire process was a robust review of loss pertaining to subprime events for this market.</p>
          <p>On slide 15 we provide some data from this analysis specifically regarding claims and notices as of December 31st, 2007. As of the close of '07, we had 30 subprime-related management liability claims. You can see in the chart that we were primary on five and excess on 25 of these policies, which again is typical of our approach within the large financial institutions marketplace.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, in general, limits range between five and 25 million, and you see the average related to these claims is 11 million. Limits management is an active part of our liability underwriting strategy. So overall a limited number of claims and consistent with our overall profile.</p>
          <p>We have fully recognized these claims in our 2007 earnings results, and the overall provisions in the 2007 financial statements and the 2008 guidance incorporate the results of the analysis we conducted.</p>
          <p>The estimate for subprime losses in 2008 guidance is not materially different from the estimated losses for 2007. After considering all of the above actions, our management liability business continues to meet our return thresholds. Our projection is based on what we believe to be a realistic assessment of our exposure to the subprime environment, but you could obviously ask, could it be worse? Given that we view this as fundamentally a frequency issue, we think a material variance from our assessment would require systemic changes to the insured's litigation environment, expanding our exposure to segments that currently appear to have low correlation to the subprime environment.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me round out the conversation on our bond and management liability business by touching on our Surety segment, specifically about potential exposure to residential real estate developers. Slide 16 and 17 speak to subdivision bonds, which as you know provide coverage to real estate developers in the event of a financial or operational failure -- prevents the developer from installing improvements guaranteed by the bond. These typically include sewer, roads and sidewalks. We generally do not provide performance bonds guaranteeing the construction of individual homes.</p>
          <p>Our construction surety business is comprised largely of infrastructure and public work projects, and importantly only one percent of our construction surety accounts are subdivision programs.</p>
          <p>During the past quarter, we took a very close look at the potential for subdivision exposures. We have scrutinized the portfolio and evaluated the financial condition of many of our insureds, the extent to which the credits are secured and the general progress towards completion of the obligations.</p>
          <p>We then applied a series of stress scenarios, assuming market conditions worse than we currently anticipate. This analysis, which is outlined on slide 17, concludes that under scenarios worse than we currently anticipate, we wouldn't expect losses over time to exceed approximately 100 million.</p>
          <p>In summary, we have thought in a comprehensive fashion about the evolving implications of financial sector stress on our management liability and surety industry exposures. The net conclusion of our in-depth exposure analysis at year-end 2007 are that the issues are very manageable for us and we're comfortable by both our diversity and profitability of business in the management liability and surety lines.</p>
          <p>Now before I turn it over to Joe for Personal Lines, I'd like to address one more topic relating to this. Recently we've gotten the question about how a recession would impact our security book. So I'd like to turn it over to Tom Kunkel who runs our Surety book. I'd like to turn it over to Tom Kunkel who runs our bond and professional liability businesses to give you our response.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brian. That is a legitimate question so here's some perspective on our Surety portfolio. 75% of our surety premium is actually in our construction surety business. Within that construction surety industry, we are seeing some slowdown in the amount of privately funded construction projects. But it's important to realize that we estimate that 90% of our construction portfolio is driven by public works spending, for example, federal, state and local funding for building and infrastructure projects. The level of public work funding is currently historically robust. We write some of the best capitalized contractors in their class. And the condition of their balance sheets as well as the condition of the backlog of uncompleted work continues to look very strong.</p>
          <p>And lastly it's important to realize that in the event of a contractor default, we typically do have the right to the owner's unpaid contract balance, thus mitigating our exposure under the bond. For these reasons, we feel very good about the profitability in this construction surety book.</p>
          <p>We feel equally strongly about the commercial surety portfolio. Commercial surety makes up approximately 25% of our overall surety premium. Again, the credit quality and underlying financial strength of this portfolio is very strong. This book is well secured and, where appropriate, it is collateralized. It's a very diverse portfolio, and we pay very close attention to managing the underlying makeup of the individual obligations that we assume.</p>
          <p>So again, while these are very legitimate questions, we feel very good about the profitability of our Surety portfolio. Joe?</p>
          <p>Joseph P. Lacher Jr., Executive Vice President, Personal Insurance and Select Accounts</p>
          <p>Thanks, Tom. Looking at slide 18, Personal Insurance segment had another terrific quarter with a combined ratio of 91% and $201 million in operating earnings. Continued to deliver strong retention, renewal pricing and year-over-year PITH growth, both the auto and homeowner lines. If you look at the profitability, there's several items affecting the comparability of results I'd like to discuss to make sure the underlying results are clear.</p>
          <p>Our reported combined ratio was 12.7 points worse than the fourth quarter 2006. Adjusting for lower levels of favorable prior-year reserve development and current year loss ratio re-estimation and for higher levels of catastrophe losses, the difference was only a modest deterioration of 1.4 points of combined ratio.</p>
          <p>Shifting to production results on page 19, let me talk first about the homeowners business. Here we continue to produce strong results in spite of the declines in housing sales. We've maintained a stable retention rate of 86%. Renewal price change at 8% was in line with what we've seen in the last four quarters. Policies in force increased by 3% versus the prior-year quarter. We've been pleased with the reception in the early sales of Quantum Home in the market. Quantum Home offers industry-leading product sophistication, enabling us to continue to deliver profitable growth. Over the last quarter the program was implemented in six additional markets, bringing our total to date to 31 states plus the District of Columbia. We're on track to roll out the remaining targeted states during 2008.</p>
          <p>We're also very pleased with the production results of our auto business. Excluding the impact of the Mendota sale, net written premium and policies in force both grew 1% over the prior-year quarter. Retention remains strong and stable at 83% and RPC was a plus 2%.</p>
          <p>Quantum Auto now represents over a third of our countrywide annualized written premium. This was the first full quarter in which Quantum Auto was available in New York which represents the final planned launch in our Quantum Auto rollout.</p>
          <p>Page 20 shows our combined ratios for auto and homeowners. As I mentioned before, several items impacting comparability need to be considered when looking at results across periods. There are three principal items: first, combined ratios in the fourth quarter 2006 benefited from significantly greater favorable prior-year reserve development and the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios. Second, results in 2007 had significantly greater catastrophe losses than in 2006. Third, there's typically a quarterly seasonality impact in auto loss ratios with the fourth quarter being the highest quarter. This results largely from weather and usage differentials. When looking at this seasonality impact, the fourth quarter 2006 results were somewhat better than typical, and the fourth quarter 2007 were somewhat worse. Thus, when comparing the results, the bulk of the difference in combined ratios between fourth quarter 2006 and 2007 were attributable to these three items. When comparing the auto combined ratio for sequential quarters the bulk of the difference is attributable to the seasonality issue.</p>
          <p>Please recall the renewal price changes were plus 2% for auto and plus 8% for homeowners. Clearly price reductions were not driving combined ratio changes. Let me try to wrap this all together. Although not displayed here, as you look at the full year 2007 results, excluding the impact of prior-year reserve development and catastrophes, the combined ratios for both auto and homeowners were within half a point of the prior year. This underscores that underlying results were generally consistent period over period.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 21, I'd like to spend a few moments on auto loss trends. The far right side you can see that we're seeing total loss trends in the low- to mid-single-digit range excluding the impact of the Quantum Auto introduction. Looking underneath this result, frequency trends drive the total loss trends. Severity is down slightly overall. This is a combination of a modest increase in physical damage severity trends and a decrease in bodily injury severity trends. I know that our bodily injury results are counter to what a number of competitors have been disclosing. We attribute this to the continued impact of our claim initiatives on these coverages.</p>
          <p>As we flip to page 22, I'd like to spend a moment on Quantum Auto's anticipated impact on our frequency. The product's broader reach to more standard drivers anticipated an increase in overall absolute frequency. Our pricing appropriately reflects this change. When we look at the chart on the left, the red line shows the expected impact on the overall book's frequency from Quantum. The blue line shows the actual results are generally in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>Again, we remain pleased with our results from Quantum Auto, and the overall program is performing consistently with our expectations. Wrapping it all together, we had another great quarter and year, and look forward to carrying our success into 2008.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back over to Jay.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Joe. Shown on page 23, average invested assets grew to $75.2 billion in the quarter, increasing over 3% when compared to the prior-year quarter. Operating cash flows were approximately $1.4 billion in the current quarter and over $5.3 billion year-to-date.</p>
          <p>The average quality rating of our fixed maturity investment portfolio remains very strong at AA-1 or AA+. Below-investment-grade securities comprise only 2.5% of the portfolio, and the duration of the portfolio remained at four. Fourth-quarter net investment income as shown on page 24 was 696 million after tax, reflecting lower yields on nonfixed income investments than in recent quarters.</p>
          <p>NII for the fixed-income portfolio benefited from the increased invested asset base as well as higher reinvestment rates. Overall, our after-tax yield was 3.7% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In our continuing effort to be highly transparent and responsive to our investors and the analyst community, we're providing detailed information about certain portions of our investment portfolio. Last week provided detailed information about our municipal bond holdings in a form 8-K filing. And as the data indicated, we estimated that the average credit rating of the portfolio would be AA+ without any of the benefits from the insurance wrappers, as compared to an approximate AAA- including the wrappers due to the very strong underlying ratings of the insurers -- of the issuers of these bonds.</p>
          <p>We've concluded that we have immaterial exposure to ratings changes for municipal bond insurers. And for your convenience we've reproduced the schedules contained in that 8-K as an appendix to this webcast.</p>
          <p>Page 25 provides an update of our exposure to subprime and Alt-A mortgages, while pages 26 and 27, which are new, provide information about all other of our real estate-related holdings. Our exposure to subprime Alt-A mortgages remains negligible. The only change of any consequence in the quarter was that we selectively took advantage of favorable pricing to add modestly to our position, increasing our total subprime Alt-A mortgages to 286 million or 0.4% of the fixed maturity portfolio at the end of the fourth quarter from 192 million or 0.3% at the end of the third quarter.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Jay. First we apologize for the length this morning, but thought it was very important to go through these various topics. And before we open it up for questions let me just make a couple of closing observations. First, we've got very good positive momentum as we head into 2008, and we're optimistic about our performance. Second, we're pleased with the analysis that -- pleased with the results of the analysis that we shared with you this morning, and believe that it speaks well to our size, the diversity of our business and the smart, disciplined approach that we take to underwriting and to investing. We plan on running our business with that same focus as we look to the future, and with that we'll open it up for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and good morning. And just want to say thanks again for all the increased disclosure on the subprime and the surety. I think that helps.</p>
          <p>If I could come at that issue from another angle, based on your current expectations for the subprime D&amp;O and E&amp;O and surety-related components, if you look back to where, say, we were in 2001, 2002, with the meltdown in the Nasdaq, Enron and WorldCom, what were your initial expectations in terms of D&amp;O and E&amp;O-related losses then versus the ultimate result? I'm trying to get a sense of how bad it could get relative to your expectations.</p>
          <p>And then, in addition to that, if you can give us a sense of how high your surety combined ratio can go in a recession-type environment, I think that would be helpful for a historical perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me -- Jay, let me start with making an observation about our expectations with respect to D&amp;O and E&amp;O, the management liability losses. You've been in this industry long enough to understand that we actually write insurance and expect to have claims, and that we anticipate a level of claims in the business and we price the business accordingly. And one way to think about the management liability exposure anticipated losses that we see, or anticipate at the moment, is that it's envisioned, incorporated, accommodated by, if you like, the loss ratio that we would ordinarily peg against this business.</p>
          <p>We don't make an assumption that any business that we write is going to be loss-free. We make an ongoing assumption that there will be claims and there will be losses, and at least there isn't anything yet in the management liability arena that would cause us to believe that there would be a dramatic difference between the ongoing expected loss performance and what we see coming out of this, which is why we make the comment that says that we continue to view these businesses as operating within the return thresholds that we set.</p>
          <p>We've spoken earlier on investor days about having return thresholds in our business of from 13 to 18% depending upon the business itself. And even after giving effect to expected losses in this business, we continue to view the returns in the business being in those ranges. So I've got to start with the premise that says after a detailed account-by-account analysis, it looks to us as though the expected losses will fall within the expected range of losses that we would have for this business. That may change. It may be different because of a systemic difference in the kinds of losses that come at us, but again, as Brian mentioned before, it's frequency, not severity. I'm looking at Tom. I don't know how to go back to 2001 and comment on expectations versus actual, kind of on the run here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the run it's a very difficult question to answer, Jay. I share your sentiments on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question, I think, Jay, that you asked was about the Surety business. And I think you asked about &#x2013; and I'm not sure whether your question is specific to the subdivision environment or the Surety business more generally. First, in the subdivision environment, the stress test that we provided in this webcast does, I think, exactly as you asked us to do, which is we've assumed that &#x2013; we've assumed only those accounts that are of the strongest quality, either because of their strength or their collateral position would in effect be money good. And we've assumed that 33% of all of the remaining accounts default and have zero recovery associated with them. That would be a awfully bad environment. Yeah, I'm assuming it could probably be worse, but in our experience that would be, I suspect, unprecedented in terms of loss experience in that book.</p>
          <p>And even in that highly remote scenario, we're talking about cumulative net losses which would evolve over obviously a number of years of less than $100 million. In the context of the business, just reporting four and a half billion in earnings, I just don't see that as anything particularly problematic when you view it as a stress case scenario.</p>
          <p>If you look more broadly at the Surety business, again, going back to Tom's comments, 75% of the Surety business is construction-based, 90% of it in public works projects. Importantly, look at the customers that we've been engaged with in that business and remember in the end that we have rights to the remaining contract proceeds in the unlikely event that a contractor defaults. That has happened. It certainly has happened in our book and to others as well. But fundamentally the project is collateralized by the remaining proceeds due from the municipality or the state government.</p>
          <p>So our view of looking at the construction side of the business remains pretty confident, and wouldn't envision a dramatic change in losses from historical experience. The commercial side is carefully underwritten. We focus on collateral and security. And, yeah, you tell me the economic environment or the level of distress that you want to place at it, and sure, I think losses would tick up. But again in the context of a company our size, I don't think that they would become problematic. I know I'm not answering your question with the level of specificity that you'd like, but it's virtually impossible to do so. Is there anything, Tom, you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just add that our experience in this business shows us that recessions in and of themselves don't necessarily cause surety losses. But they do tend to expose the underwriting that took place when times were good, when the economy goes into a recession. And I think our position on that is that even in robust economic times, our underwriting has not changed. And so in a recession, it's not necessarily going to follow that our losses will increase.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate that. And just a separate one for Jay Benet on the investment portfolio. For the other investments, I know I've asked this question before, but what do you think is the right run rate or right investment yield for the other investments so we can model that?</p>

          <p>In the past, what I have said, given some steadiness in the marketplace, the quarterly analyses show ups and downs, but we would generally advise averaging the quarters. I would say at this point in time, given the way the markets are, at least for our planning purposes, we think the fourth quarter of '08 is &#x2013; I'm sorry, of '07 &#x2013; is more indicative, again, for planning purposes of what we would look for going forward into '08.</p>

          <p>Hi; this is Bill Heyman. In typical times, there is some seasonality in distributions by private equity funds. I think we're in a climate right now in which that is not the case and not likely to be the case for awhile. Also, in December, private equity funds often make distributions before year-end. That was not the case this December. So I think for the moment we have to take a somewhat longer-term view of the portfolio which we think as a matter of risk thresholds ought to perform over time much as public equities perform, possibly plus or minus a few points.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the other point, Jay, that I would add &#x2013; and Jay Benet did mention this but simply to reiterate it &#x2013; is that our guidance for 2008 assumes a somewhat lower level of net investment income than we actually realized in 2007, driven really uniquely by what we perceive to be the potential for a more challenging realization environment in the investment arena. It's not attributable to cash flows or anything else. It's purely a question of perceiving or an issue of perceiving the realization environment to be somewhat more challenging, and then the rest of the guidance is accounted for by about a 100-basis-point change in the ongoing run rate of combined ratio, simply to incorporate the continuation of the more competitive environment that we've been witnessing. We are assuming for '08 that that environment will continue to look very much like the change in '07 looked, that it will get increasingly somewhat more competitive as '08 moves along.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks; good morning. Back to management liability, Brian, in your prepared remarks you &#x2013; rhetorical question: how could it be worse? And you mentioned that it would be more likely frequency-driven than severity. And then you went on and I think, Jay Fishman, you also used the word "systemic," that there would have to be a systemic change in the litigation environment, presumably entities that you're not currently contemplating brought into this mess. Could you expand on that some?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think your characterization is actually quite right. We, for example, do not currently see &#x2013; this isn't a conclusion that we're reaching, these are facts &#x2013; we don't currently see the small local community bank being dragged into the subprime issue. And again, there are a couple that have and in our account-by-account analysis we've incorporated that into the work. But when we refer to a systemic change, we're really talking about a class of risk not currently identified in any way with this &#x2013; not currently associated with it in some way being dragged into it.</p>
          <p>Brian's comment about frequency versus severity is driven by our limits profile. We have low limits, relatively small limits, I think, compared to other people who underwrite the business. And so an individual account won't change much of anything. It would actually take a systemic change in the class of business that was associated with this and for there to be litigation which our policies would respond to. Ultimately, there has to be litigation to the insured for our policies to respond. So that's what we think could trigger a worst-case scenario, but so far, there's no evidence of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that. I guess are you currently contemplating defense coverages that would obviate some of these claims or policy <mark type="inaudible" /> vis-&#xE0;-vis the nature of the claims you've seen so far? Are there issues or questions as to coverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very important, first, to remember that in claims-made policies, defense costs are contained inside the limits, unlike traditional occurrence policies where the obligation to defend runs outside the limits. and so the obligation to defend can simply run on in effect forever, at least theoretically. With claims-made policies, defense costs fall inside the limits, so they are very much quantifiable.</p>
          <p>To the extent that defense costs emerge, they emerge first at the primary level. And those who have the primary policy will provide defense. And of course they will, assuming that there's an indemnification obligation. And eventually it will run up the policy to where, if it continues to go, excess riders eventually get dragged into the defense obligation sequentially. I think one of the things that we take some comfort in is that &#x2013; and it's in the analysis of the 30 claims and notice of claims that we've got &#x2013; is that only five of them are primary; 25 of them are excess. So at the moment you see the average attachment points there. One can make an assumption as to the litigation costs and all the rest, but it sure feels good in this case to be an excess provider rather than a primary provider. But the limits really &#x2013; they are there and obviously if either the defense or the indemnification obligation extends through the policy, then those limits will be tapped as well. But it is important to note that defense costs are inside the limits.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>Commercial surety entails a variety of what typically used to be called miscellaneous surety bonds. So they can entail anything from small mom-and-pop compliance bonds to bonds which may guarantee appeals of court judgments for larger, better-secured companies. So in the class, there are obviously &#x2013; there are a wide variety of obligations. And in our underwriting, we consider the nature of each of those underlying obligations, and we tailor our underwriting approach to the risk of that obligation and then the financial solvency of our customer.</p>

          <p>The larger end &#x2013; and this is real time, so correct me if I'm wrong &#x2013; but in all likelihood &#x2013; because you've got permit bonds, sales tax bonds and tobacco bonds and all that, which would be small on an individual basis. At the larger end might be a commercial surety bond issue for a self-insurer of workers' compensation obligations.</p>

You mentioned foreign exchange was helpful to the top line. Could you quantify that?

          <p>It's important to mention, to reinforce this, that we are not a long-tail casualty writer in Lloyd's, that our appetite in Lloyd's is virtually exclusively to property, to marine, to aviation, to other short-tail coverages. So don't perceive in this that we've gone out and begun writing long-tail casualty coverages in Lloyd's. Not the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So our opportunities in Lloyd's have been heavily focused in the marine industry, for example. Some in the power generation area.</p>
          <p>The other place where we've had a decent amount of growth and think we've got opportunity is in our Canadian franchise, which historically had been very focused on a couple of products. And we think we've got an opportunity there to expand both geographically in Canada and expanding some of our product profile that we've got in the U.S. into our Canadian operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the next question relates to the market environment. Are you seeing any &#x2013; I'm sure anecdotally there's unreasonable competitor, but any broad unreasonableness either by product line &#x2013; is there any product line or segment that you're concerned that's already not meeting your hurdle rate or concern that in 2008 is unlikely to meet the hurdle rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's certainly the case that the largest end of the insurance business, largest accounts, is clearly the most competitive. The thing I think that's often misunderstood about our franchise is that that's not where we live. We are a small- and middle-market company. Our large account business is largely, largely a loss responsive business. So there will be other companies that do guaranteed costs in the largest account segments. And the commentary that you'll hear from them in the aggregate of their business is, I think, different from the commentary you'll hear from us. The small- and middle-market segments have not nearly been as competitive as the largest guaranteed cost segments are. Again, that's not where we do business. But in terms of size, that would be the breadth.</p>
          <p>One of the interesting dynamics, and this is sort of highly anecdotal, is that we actually still see some softness overall in the D&amp;O market, which actually is quite interesting given all of the questions that are coming at us this morning about management liability. That's true both on the reinsurance side as well as on the primary side. The market as of yet is not, from a pricing standpoint, reacting as though there's some insurmountable crisis here that needs to have an immediate reaction in the pricing dynamic. Those would be the two that I'm closest to. Brian or Jay?</p>

It becomes very much a local market and a local environment issue, and you get a couple of companies in one environment might move up or down a little bit. We're not seeing anything that's fundamentally causing big swings either way. And we're watching it. We hear the same reports and are looking for those impacts and are anxiously awaiting to see them in the market.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. And then secondly, Jay, as aggressively as you guys are returning capital to shareholders, you're building capital even more quickly. Has anything changed in your view or your opinion on whether you would like to be acquisitive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That sounds a little bit like have you stopped beating your wife. So let me try and answer the question my way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It wasn't intended that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it would be irresponsible for a management team to say in the broadest sense that it would never consider an acquisition. I think we have a responsibility to be thoughtful, to see how we can create shareholder value and to use all of the tools that are available to us to do that.</p>
          <p>Having said that, our instinct about it is really no different than it was, which is that the risk of any transaction is very high. There's culture risk and balance sheet risk. Reserve risk. People risk. Financial risk. It's significant. And we recognize it. We're experienced at it, and we recognize that those risks are real, so that any transaction that we might evaluate will inevitably be compared to the very high hurdle of the risk assessment that we put into any transaction. So then I go back to can we create shareholder value, can we complete our mission, with the tools and skills and the assets that we have. And the answer is we're absolutely convinced we can. So you take a transaction, you evaluate it in the context to accelerate the growth of shareholder value, again evaluating against the risk. So I think it's all on the table, Larry. I don't think that that's any different than it was three months ago or six months ago. Risks are high. They're difficult to do. We have a lot of experience doing them. So we feel pretty good about it. But the risks are nonetheless high.</p>
          <p>So there's nothing in our capital profile that's driven towards accumulating capital in anticipation of a transaction. We are returning capital as aggressively as we think prudent in the marketplace that we're in. And to the extent that we feel comfortable doing more, we will do more. I think it would be nice to be AA straight with both agencies. We are on watch on upgrade from Moody's from AA-3 to AA-2. I don't know if that will occur or when. We're currently rated AA- with Standard &amp; Poor's financial strength. I think it would be nice to be AA rated. And the financial targets that Jay sets and the ways in which we measure our business are geared to doing that. But we're not sitting on $0.05 of capital without a good reason, and a good reason is not sitting on it to create a war chest for an acquisition. That's just a silly and really a silly way to run a business, and we just don't do it.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi; good morning, everyone. First question is for Joe. Could you just -- you talked about in the presentation some of the declines in frequency you're seeing in auto are expected based on some of the changes you're making. Is the same also true for severity that there's some impact there, because of some of the underwriting changes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a little bit of a change. It's much more modest and sometimes almost goes counter to what you would expect. As you move deeper into some parts of the standard marketplace, you might see lower limits. You might see in some cases we're seeing different numbers of limits, is probably the easiest example to see. And lower limits you'd anticipate getting some lower severities. Again, when we described for you on page 21 loss trends, what we're doing there is describing all of those trends, loss frequency and severity, excluding the expected impact of the product changes. So we're trying to take out that noise and the aggregate statistics so that what we look at underneath is the real and appropriate numbers for financial projections; the environmental inflation that's going on and any difference between our expected numbers and the actuals. So those two items together would roll through what you see on page 21 and give you the best set of numbers to project what our numbers or the environment were doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fair. And then also, just on the claims side, what inning are we in terms of the benefit you're getting there, just from the implementation of processes, procedures, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've commented before, and it would still hold true. On the physical damage initiatives, we're most of the way through there. If we were picking an inning, maybe it's the ninth, maybe it's done. It's hard to tell exactly. But it's on the tail end. On bodily injury, it's hard to project when the end is. It's definitely in the last half of the inning. But until you really get closer to the end and see the shift change, it's hard to project it. I guess seventh or eighth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify on that point, because importantly when the ball game's over, to use your example, it doesn't mean that trend goes up. What it simply means is that &#x2013; simply &#x2013; what it means importantly is that the expected declines or the expected benefits from that investment -- they may actually not necessarily be declines -- but the expected benefits have now run their course and will continue to be evident in our loss trend. I don't...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously dividends are a board decision. We typically review them with that annually. And if you look at our history you'll see that to the extent we've changed our dividend, we've done so in connection with the annual meeting, which would take place at our -- not this board meeting but the meeting after. We'll obviously evaluate the marketplace, our capital needs and everything else and make a recommendation to the board. But it's premature at this point to speculate on anything.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just one question left. Could you talk about lost cost or -- I'm sorry --  terms and conditions in the commercial lines environment and what you're seeing there? You mentioned the frequency is kind of flattening out. Does that have anything to do with maybe a little loosening in terms and conditions or is it just the great favorable frequency trends coming to conclusions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and we've talked about that a little bit last quarter. And I'd say we're seeing continuing of the same. We've not yet been in the spot where we felt we had to move our terms and conditions significantly. So it's not really affecting our frequency numbers. We are starting to see more of that in the softening in the market as everyone would anticipate. It somewhat goes with the comments Jay made. If you talked about larger property accounts, that would be the most dramatic example. And at the other extreme nothing really significantly happening in the smaller account market. But some movement, but it's not really driving the frequency in our book. I think it's just our frequency trends are more just coming out of really an unprecedented period of, for many of our businesses, declining frequency numbers. And they're really leveling out at something approximating zero trends. So not a bad place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And actually, is there anywhere in your commercial lines book of business or business lines that you're saying you're actively just like pulling back from it or trying to reduce exposures because of market concerns?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes; thank you. There seems to be a foregone conclusion, and this is probably the right one, that the pricing environment will just continue to deteriorate until there is absolute stupidity, like what we've seen in the past. Can you envision an environment where the pricing essentially begins to stabilize over the next two years and returns kind of stabilize at a still reasonable level? Is that a possibility at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jay, I've been talking for a couple of years now, actually, at some risk to my perceived sanity, that there's lots of factors that could cause one to believe that the traditional cycle that we've seen in the business may be somewhat different this time. We've talked about terrorism. We've talked about the management of various companies and how much that's changed. We've talked about the tools and analytics that are available universally in the industry now and the fact that people are not running the business by the seat of their pants but in fact the analytics are really much improved. We've talked a little bit about the Sarbanes-Oxley process that all companies, I believe, certainly as we do, go through. I mean there are so many people internally here that certify to financial statements that any concern about loss trend or reserve development gets evidenced very, very early and filters up to senior levels of management. And I think you can make thoughtful decisions about risk-taking.</p>
          <p>I think it's interesting that virtually every company in the business of any size has been involved now in share buybacks or dividends, and if you look back in the '90s, that was not the case. There were companies that had programs but there were precious few who were actually in the market returning capital.</p>
          <p>The fact that we're this long into the cycle and our guidance would translate to a 13 to 14% return-on-equity range, even before the impact of any development, I think is sort of an indication of the fact that we are believers that it may not necessarily be as dramatically bad as it's been before. I think there's lots of signals -- and I've said this before: look at the retentions. The retentions -- and ours are exceptionally strong, but there were other companies that also have had strong retentions. That is a counterindicative signal with respect to a highly competitive, as you say, stupidity environment. We were looking at middle-market retentions in the '90s that were in the high 60s, and we're talking now in the mid '80s. These are very dramatic differences. And although I've worked for people who said don't ever assume that it will be different this time, so I think we look to next year and assume that it will continue to be somewhat more competitive than it was this year. But I still think there are lots of indications out there that it may indeed be a little bit different. So we're hopeful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And then last question: on the share repurchase, you obviously have been very aggressive in buying back your own stock. If you base success of this buyback on your stock price, in other words creating shareholder value, you could conclude that it's just not doing a lot for you. Does that ever disturb you? Do you ever consider, hey, what if we don't buy back stock what would happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, sure, to answer that portion of the question. But the share buyback has had a meaningful impact on our return on equity. We actually -- we do measure the cumulative impact of the share buyback on our return on equity. I think it provides clarity and transparency to investors because there always seems to be the question that if we didn't buy it back, what are we holding it for? So I'm personally a believer that this is absolutely the right thing to do. The only alternative that we'd have is to plunk it into the bond portfolio. And when I last looked this morning the ten-year treasury was yielding 3.6%. I'd rather that you all decide what to do with the money that comes back if you don't want to own our shares.</p>
          <p>So I think it's the &#x2013; I continue to believe it's the right thing to do. It's sort of obvious to us, frankly. Again, I don't know what other alternatives there are. It's interesting that we get sometimes, I say, modestly criticized for growing our business too aggressively. I don't understand that criticism. I think our numbers support our growth appetite significantly. And yet we're only absorbing modest amounts of capital in doing so, so what would you do with the rest? So I think it's sort of obvious.</p>
          <p>And to give you some sense of it, the 2007 return on equity was 1.3 points benefited by the share buyback cumulatively over time. That's 130 basis points positive. Eventually, eventually one would think that investors will take note of that. They will perceive that the return on equity in our company is better than it otherwise would have been, and I believe better than many of our competitors, and will ultimately choose to say that's a security we'd like to own. The fundamental reason for doing this is to maximize shareholder value. So no, certainly it's disappointing when things like this work out, but it doesn't cause any concern about our strategy.</p>

          <p>This is Jay Benet trying to answer that question. There really weren't any major trends that were underlying the favorable development in this quarter. This was a lot of little changes that came about in actuarial reviews of each of the business lines. As I've said before, we do these very thorough reviews on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So this isn't like an annual review that was different from what we've been doing in previous quarters. So I would say overall there's no great information or great trends taking place. What I would say is that we've had more data come up on recent years. And I think most of what you're seeing here is related to property business and some liability business in recent years.</p>

          <p>Gross and net in this case is in the eyes of the bolder. I mean we look at things on a segment basis, each individual product line. I mean the level of granularity we use here is very significant. I don't want to give the impression that every single reserve that we had developed favorably. But the amount of movement in any of the reserves tended to be quite small. So this is not the result of some large negatives being offset by large positives. But I'm hoping I'm answering your question, but I'm struggling a little bit with...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the answer I was looking for. Thank you very much, Jay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of David Small, representing Bear Stearns. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just two quick questions. You mentioned that you bought some ABS in the quarter that's backed by subprime. Could you just tell us when in the fourth quarter? Was that the beginning of the fourth quarter, the end of the fourth quarter that you bought that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We bought &#x2013; this is Bill Heyman &#x2013; we bought them at various points, highly selectively, less due to the climate that particular day or week than due to what was shown on some of it by you. Typically to buy a $10-million piece requires two people to spend an afternoon, one doing the modeling and the other negotiating with a dealer. It's a highly labor-intensive process, and each purchase is really sui generis. It's hard to characterize the purchases as a whole. We bought maybe $100 million consisting of ten pieces.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just two other quick questions. In the quarter did you revise your management liability current accident year loss ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that goes back to my earlier comment that at least at the moment, that the experience that we're both seeing and anticipating in the management liability business falls within the normal loss expectation that one would have for the business when taken as a whole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a last question was: I think, Jay, earlier you were talking about a desire to be AA from all the rating agencies. Could you just help us understand what you think the benefits to the company are of having that rating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and it's not a big deal, meaning I wouldn't -- let me be very clear about this -- I wouldn't pursue a lot of cost in pursuing a AA versus a AA-. I just think as a financial services company where ratings matter, that to be a AA company and afford that to your customers has some long-term value associated with it. At least -- I've been out of the treasury business for a number of years, but it used to be that AA flat also made you an A1/P1 short-term issuer, and the AA- makes you an A2/P2 issuer. Again, not that we're in the commercial paper business, but I do think that financial services companies should aspire to have the highest ratings. So that's the only reason, not that we would spend a lot or go through a lot of excess capital position to acquire it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is Jay Benet. If I could just add, there are no conversations with rating agencies that suggest to achieve those goals we have to increase our capital base over and above what it already is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There should be no confusion by anybody on this call about our aggressiveness with respect to returning capital to shareholders. It's not transactional. It's strategic. It is strategic. We do it consistently. It's part of our philosophy, and it is not -- it is not limited or driven by any particular dynamic. It's just the right way, we think, to run a business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then the last question would be, if you think about the commercial book, you're talking about -- I think you talked earlier about frequency trends being flat. Just curious where -- I'm trying to get the idea of what is the spread right now, do you think, between the loss trend and the price change? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What's the spread...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you think about, well, frequency is flat. What's severity doing if pricing is down a few points? It seems like you're going to get that margin compression. I'm trying to figure out how wide that would be right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we were very up-front about that comment. We said that our guidance for 2008 envisions about a 1% increase in our combined ratio. That's being driven by the fact that we're planning for, I would call it, modest loss trend and some declining rate. And that's what accounts for that 1% difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then you've got mix and you've got new initiatives that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's a lot of other things that go into it. But our guidance for 2008 does envision a one-point increase, and I would characterize that as very reasonable under the circumstances, reflecting the notion that pricing may continue to decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Charlie Gates representing Credit Suisse. Please proceed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi; good morning. Two questions. My first, on both the Markell conference call and the RLI conference call, they opined that they saw standard markets companies entering the excess and surplus lines business. To what extent do you think that the Travelers might be one of those standard markets companies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We seem to continue to get that question and we actually went back a couple of quarters and looked at our data on our middle-market book of business, and we are taking virtually no business and moving it from the E and S market into our standard commercial environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our answer very directly would be not at all, to your question. Not at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That was my first question. My second question -- I'm on slide number 22. George Joseph out at Mercury General opined several years ago that I think he thought your company was adopting a, with regard to personal auto, a take-all-comers strategy. He put other companies into that same box. That said, reading from your slide, "Quantum intentionally targeted a broader spectrum of drivers than captured by historic product reach." Is that what he's referring to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not 100% what he's referring to. You'd have to check with him. What I can tell you, Charlie, is we very clearly have talked before that back in the 2000, 2001 timeframe, our product was very focused on a highly preferred segment of the marketplace. And we very clearly talked about Quantum and its rollout, that we were not moving into the nonstandard segment of the market which generally is described as running 20, 25% of the marketplace, but we were moving out of our niche in that highly preferred segment into more preferred and standard business. So it is by no means a take-all-comers strategy. And we've demonstrated any number of times with underlying data that that's not the book of business that we're writing, but it is in fact broader than the niche we were hunkered in in 2000.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you give an example of the new standard market, and that's my last question. Say the standard market before was a guy who lived in the suburbs who drives to work; what's the new standard market guy look like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the standard market might look the same definition of a -- I'm referring to that as highly preferred, preferred, standard and nonstandard. And what we would have done before is we might have had a book that had less youthful drivers, drivers with fewer incidents than average. That would make them a more preferred set of risks. As we move out to drivers who might have one or two speeding tickets or a minor accident on their record or might have more presence of youthfuls on the policy, that might be something that might move them into a more standard classification.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A way to think about Quantum, is that it represents or will eventually represent the broader spectrum of the American driver, as opposed to the old programs which were very targeted at the highly preferred segment. You can think about that from an IFS score, if you like. You can think about it from an incident. But it simply broadens out and provides a price for a broader group of customers than our product really did before. But it certainly is not a take-all-comers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Gentlemen, your final question comes from the line of Paul Newsome representing Sandler O'Neill Partners. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping you could spend just a little bit more time on the auto frequency results. And particularly it looks like many folks assume that the frequency trend would continue to be favorable. What's your view on that topic? And do you think at some point in time we start getting negative frequency trends and see some price increases as a result of inflation at your firm?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we've seen is that loss frequency for the last, if you look over the last ten years, had a significant decline, and we are near historic lows from an absolute frequency perspective. So it wouldn't surprise us if we saw those frequency numbers climb a little bit. And when you measure frequency trend, that's, of course, the change from period over period. So picking up a little bit could see some positive trend but still be near historic lows. We're seeing a little bit of increase in frequency in the last several quarters. It's not at alarming rates, alarming rates of growth. And we project when we project forward total loss trend and project total loss trend to be in the low to mid-single digits, and that's what we think about through our environment over the next year and which is incorporated in our underlying guidance. We don't usually break that apart when we're disclosing it between frequency and severity, because sometimes those move counter to each other. We -- so it's really more appropriate to project them in aggregate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Independent of the mix change -- which we are trying to highlight on page 22; obviously page 21 shows a modest increase in frequency -- it's very difficult to look out and predict with any thoughtfulness what's going to happen. You're talking about everything from numbers of miles driven to the impact of fuel and seatbelt usage and cell phone usage and changing state laws that prohibit, that require hands-free cell phones. There's so many variables that go into frequency. I don't think that we particularly have any great insight into why something would change. And again that's independent of the mix dynamic on page 22.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you pricing for low single-digit claims inflation currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The guidance that we provided anticipates that running through the environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but I guess that's not the question. The question is whether or not you're pricing for it in your policies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, our pricing...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let's back up for a moment. We provide and have at our investor days given insight into the recurrence that we're recording in our businesses, and as it relates to the Personal Lines business broadly and particularly, it's well within the targeted returns of the business. If you're asking how we price a particular product in a particular market, it's a very complicated question. We look for the returns on a book of business overall, and the book of business continues to meet our target thresholds. We're pricing it to do that. I'm not sure how to exactly answer that question. But we're pricing the product to achieve our targeted returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at targeted returns. We look at the marketplace dynamics. We look at opportunities for growth. And we look at what we expect will be the underlying loss trend, and we put them all together. We don't take any one of those variables independently and solely make a price change on that. We're not trying to dodge the question. You've got to take all four, five of those things and mix them together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, what we said we priced the product achieve our targeted returns given everything we see happening in the marketplace. So a silly assumption would be that we price it to achieve targeted returns assuming a decrease in loss trend. We are not assuming a decrease in loss trend. We are essentially assuming that loss trend will continue at low single digits. And that's how we price our product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're all just trying to figure out if auto has bottomed out industry-wide. And there's certain mixed results from various companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have a comment I can make on industry-wide dynamics. Page 21 is giving you very specific insight into our book, and you can see that our loss trend has been running for the last several quarters in the low-single-digit total loss trend, and that's how we're pricing our product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="q">
