          <p>This presentation contains forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of Deutsche Telekom management with respect to future events. They include, among others, statements as to market potential and financial guidance statements, as well as our dividend outlook.</p>
          <p>They are generally identified by the words expect, anticipate, believe, intend, estimate, aim, goal, plan, will, seek, outlook or similar expressions, and include, generally, any information that relates to expectations or targets for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, earnings, operating profitability or other performance measures, as well as personnel-related measures and reductions.</p>
          <p>Forward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections. You should consider them with caution. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond Deutsche Telekom's control, including those described in the sections Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors of the Company's Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>Among the relevant factors are the progress of Deutsche Telekom's workforce reduction initiative, restructuring of its German operations, and the impact of other significant strategic or business initiatives, including acquisitions, dispositions, and business combinations and cost-saving initiatives.</p>
          <p>In addition, regulatory rulings, stronger-than-expected competition, technological change, litigation and supervisory developments, among other factors, may have a material adverse effect on costs and revenue development.</p>
          <p>Further, changes in general economic and business conditions, including the significant economic decline currently underway in the markets in which we and our subsidiaries and associated companies operate, ongoing instability and volatility in worldwide financial markets, and changes in exchange and interest rates, may also have an impact on our business development and availability of capital under favorable conditions.</p>
          <p>If these or other risks and uncertainties materialize, or if the assumptions underlying any of these statements prove incorrect, Deutsche Telekom's actual results may be materially different from those expressed or implied by such statements. Deutsche Telekom can offer no assurance that its expectations or targets will be achieved. Deutsche Telekom does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements to take new information or future events into account or otherwise.</p>
          <p>Deutsche Telekom does not reconcile its adjusted EBITDA guidance to a GAAP measure, because it would require unreasonable effort to do so. As a general matter, Deutsche Telekom does not predict the net effect of future special factors, because of their uncertainty. Special factors and interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including impairment losses, can be significant to Deutsche Telekom's results.</p>
          <p>In addition to figures prepared in accordance with IFRS, Deutsche Telekom presents non-GAAP financial performance measures, including among others EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted EBIT, adjusted net income, free cash flow, gross debt and net debt. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with IFRS.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP financial performance measures are not subject to IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Other companies may define these terms in different ways. For further information relevant to the interpretation of these terms, please refer to the chapter, Reconciliation of Pro Forma Figures, which is posted on Deutsche Telekom's Investor Relations webpage at www.telekom.com.</p>

          <p>Dear investors, welcome to the Deutsche Telekom Q2 conference call. As always our CEO, Ren&#xE9; Obermann, will lead you through the operations for the first time, alongside our new regional structure, followed by our CFO, Tim H&#xF6;ttges, on financials and balance sheet topics. Thereafter, we're happy to answer your questions. May I hand over to Ren&#xE9; Obermann, our CEO.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Stephan. Ladies and gentleman, Q2 highlights and half year highlights, we are pleased to report our second quarter results, especially the improvement in adjusted EBITDA trends.</p>
          <p>Including OTE, Group revenues grew by 7.4% to &#x20AC;16.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.4% to &#x20AC;5.3 billion, up from plus 3% in the first quarter. Below the EBITDA line we had an encouraging increase in reported and adjusted net income, which increased by more than 19% to &#x20AC;0.8 billion.</p>
          <p>In Systems Solution we achieved a further significant profitability improvement with an adjusted EBIT margin of 2.7% in Q2. We did overachieve our Save for Service 2010 target already, with an annualized gross savings run rate of &#x20AC;4.9 billion. We achieved the targeted 2009 full year OTE synergies also already in the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>As demonstrated by the EBITDA results, our measures to achieve the full year guidance are starting to bear fruit. Free cash flow increased to &#x20AC;1.8 billion in the first half, despite significantly higher cash CapEx year-on-year and a higher negative impact from changes in provisions, including variable compensation.</p>
          <p>There was a strong cost-cutting driven margin improvement in the United States, in the U.K. and in Poland. Given our second quarter results, we are reconfirming our full year guidance.</p>
          <p>Operational highlights in the quarter included a German broadband retail net add market share of 59% and PSTN line losses of 473,000, which is the lowest level of line losses since 2005. The definite acceleration of non-messaging data growth in the U.S. as a first result of the 3G rollout in the U.S. in the last year.</p>
          <p>In connection with our guidance revision in April, we outlined a number of initiatives in the key markets in the U.S., in U.K. and in Poland. As a result of the measures already implements, OpEx in all three operations decreased significantly compared to the first quarter and the adjusted EBITDA margin increased accordingly. However, I would like to emphasize that we are not cutting OpEx or CapEx at the expense of future growth.</p>
          <p>For example, in the U.S. SAC per contract gross adds in local currency remains essentially flat year-on-year. In the U.K. SAC per contract gross adds in local currency even increased year-on-year. Also U.S. CapEx will remain at a similarly high level in 2009 as in 2008 in connection with the accelerated 3G rollout. That being said, the U.S. adjusted EBITDA margin increased from 26 to 30% from Q1 to Q2 and OpEx in U.S. dollars were cut by almost 7%.</p>
          <p>The cash cost per user, or abbreviation CCPU, dropped to $23 from 25 in both the quarter &#x2013; the first quarter 2009 and the second quarter 2008. Compared to the first quarter, all three components of CCPU G&amp;A network and retention costs increased. G&amp;A expenses in particular were down significantly from Q1 to Q2, reflecting considerable work being done to get costs in line, mostly in the personnel area.</p>
          <p>We also made good progress with the roaming overbuild initiatives to reduce roaming costs; adding more than 500 cell sites in 2G in the second quarter and ending the quarter with a total of 1,200 roaming overbuild sites. And due to accelerating data growth we were able to stabilize service revenues and ARPU versus Q1.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., OpEx were reduced by 1.5% sequentially and the margin increased to 17.3% from 13.5 in the first quarter. As a result of the first cost cutting measures implemented, cluster costs, especially technology costs, were reduced by &#xA3;14 million, or more than 6% year-on-year. Total SRC and SAC spendings were reduced by &#xA3;18 million, or 12% in connection with the sale of more SIM-only products. Also we achieved head count savings due to a reduction in employees by more than 200 compared to the end of Q1.</p>
          <p>Due to improvements in prepay churn rates and net adds, as well as stabilized ARPU, service revenues showed an improvement over Q1, which compares favorably with Vodafone and Orange.</p>
          <p>I am very pleased with the result in Poland, where we achieved a sequential 13% reduction in OpEx and an increase in the adjusted EBITDA margin to 39% from 26 in the first quarter. This improvement was achieved through a combination of SAC and SRC, and a handset subsidy savings, as well as a reduction in marketing spendings and in other measures.</p>
          <p>We are very satisfied with our relative market performance, be it on customer net additions, be it on service revenue developments or margin improvements. Our results compare favorably to the recent results of TPSA.</p>
          <p>German fixed line, trends from the first quarter continued into the second quarter. Revenues decreased by 5.1% compared to a year-on-year decrease in last year &#x2013; sorry, in the first quarter of 5.7%. So it's a slight decrease in the decrease. Due to OpEx cuts, OpEx are down 5.8% year-on-year. The adjusted EBITDA decreased only by 3.7% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The margin improved further, EBITDA margin, from 32.9% to 33.4% in the second quarter this year, which is the best quarterly margin since 2007. In terms of Save for Service, T-Home, the fixed line division achieved significant savings in the area of sales and service, production and others, as you can see on the slide and that all together made the results possible.</p>
          <p>With regard to German broadband, we had another excellent quarter with broadband retail net add market share of 59%. Over the past year, we had expanded our domestic broadband retail customer base by 1.3 million. The overall broadband market slowed down significantly in Q2, adding only 0.4 million customers overall, of which we captured more than half, 246,000. The cable operators also had a good quarter, while the alternative operators, including resellers, had a negative share in aggregate.</p>
          <p>As a result of our high retail broadband share and the slowdown in the overall broadband market, our PSTN line losses improved significantly. In the second quarter, we only lost 473,000 lines compared to 648,000 in the second quarter last year and still 602,000 in the first quarter of this year. That does reflect the success of our single and double play offers in particular and the success of our win-back campaign. Approximately a 175,000 customers were won back from our competitors in the first half of this year. Over 400,000 customers have been won back since last year from our competitors and are already booked into our systems.</p>
          <p>In addition, our triple-play product, Entertain, is starting to gain some meaningful traction. As of Q2, we had sold 721,000 Entertain packages in total, of which a large degree is already installed. This represents an increase of 188% over the second quarter in 2008. 20 million roughly households can now receive Entertain by either VDSL or ADSL2+. Entertain has proven to be an important instrument for keeping the average revenue per access, or ARPA the abbreviation, keeping that stable, also for reducing churn and for upselling.</p>
          <p>As of tomorrow, on August 7 we will launch LIGA total!, which provides viewers with live access to soccer games of the Bundesliga. And we have the exclusive audio-visual IPTV broadcasting rights for the next four seasons. In addition, T-Mobile also delivers the Bundesliga live to 3G cell phones.</p>
          <p>Turning with that to the German mobile business, we do further expand our position as a service revenue and customer market share leader in Germany versus our main competitor in an overall declining mobile market in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>While service revenues were down 2.4% in the second quarter, this can absolutely be explained by the MTR cuts, which became effective on April 1, and the fact that that quarter was impacted by Easter holidays, which fell into Q2 this year.</p>
          <p>Excluding these impacts, service revenues would have shown a stable development in Q2. In addition, total revenues in Q2 were impacted by lower O2 roaming revenues. That is primarily due to the accounting treatment, under which we can currently book these revenues only to the extent that actual roaming traffic occurs. The difference to the contract obligation will then be booked in Q3 and in Q4.</p>
          <p>We also realized a decent adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter with 38.3%, up from 36.6% in the first quarter. Cost reductions amounting to &#x20AC;25 million realized in Q2, were reinvested in growth and in churn prevention. Total minutes of use, or MOUs, increased by 8%, or 5% on a per customer basis. We continue to benefit from the iPhone. In the second quarter, we dispatched about 235,000 iPhones, which is up 14% from the first quarter. In total now almost one million iPhones have been dispatched in Germany so far. The quality of our customer base is demonstrated by the continuing low contract churn rate of 1.1%, which is stable if we compare it to the quarter one year ago.</p>
          <p>A few words on the economic impact in Germany. In general, we haven't seen yet any material adverse impact. While the overall German broadband market has been slowing down, we are still seeing good sales of our high end Entertain product. In German mobile, we are observing a negative impact on visitor and roaming revenues, but also continuing growth in minutes of use, in iPhone sales and also in data revenues.</p>
          <p>In terms of U.S. mobile, cost-cutting measures initiated resulted in a significant margin improvement in the second quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 30% in the second quarter from 25.7 and 29.4% in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>We improved our contract churn rate to 2.2% compared to 2.3 in the first quarter of 2009 and 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008. That does reflect the success of our Unlimited Loyalty Plan, which was launched nationally in March. Just in time before the important holiday quarter, we significantly expanded our distribution in the U.S. through our recent retail agreement with RadioShack to offer T-Mobile products in more than 4,000 stores.</p>
          <p>Data ARPU increased by 50% sequentially to $9.90. That is a significant acceleration in sequential and in year-on-year growth compared to the previous quarter, reflecting the first impact of the 3G rollout and new devices. However, total end-service revenues were down year-on-year due to continuing weakness in ARPU. Year-on-year ARPU was impacted in particular by the economy and the loss of core customers to competitors due to exclusive devices, which was offset partially by the growth in data ARPU.</p>
          <p>The economic impact can be seen in lower roaming and digital revenues, and also in lower overage. Encouragingly, service revenues and ARPUs were stable sequentially compared to the first quarter of 2009. The continued weakness in voice ARPUs was offset by a stronger growth in data ARPU. We're hopeful that we have seen the bottom for blended ARPU, given the acceleration of data growth.</p>
          <p>T-Mobile USA continued to grow its customer base in the second quarter, though at a significantly slower rate than in the second quarter of last year. In total we added 325,000 customers in Q2, of which 56,000 were contract customers. Contract net add performance was impacted by the launch of the new iPhones in June.</p>
          <p>While I'm pleased by the first signs that our strategy is working, you should be aware that this turnaround will take some time given the economic and the competitive environment in the United States.</p>
          <p>In terms of our key initiatives in the U.S., we made good progress in the second quarter. With continued high CapEx of $1.1 billion, we laid the foundation for continued 3G network coverage expansion. 3G coverage will be expanded to approximately 160 million POPs around the end of Q3 and approximately 200 million POPs around the end of Q4. Recent new market launches include Cleveland, Columbus, Milwaukee and Reno. At the end of Q2, 16,000 3G cell sites were on air, which is an up of almost 1,500 just in Q2. We also have a strong positive HSPA+, which gives us a speed of up to 21-megabits per second within the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
          <p>We are beginning to see the benefits of 3G in our financial metrics. In Q2, the data ARPU growth of new customers in early 3G markets, such as New York, was three times higher year-on-year than in 2G markets. The accelerated launch of 3G markets is important as the 3G data ARPU benefit takes time to realize at least in our experience.</p>
          <p>We continue to enhance our 3G handset portfolio. In May, we launched the 3G enabled Sidekick LX. Yesterday we launched our second Android device, which is the T-Mobile myTouch 3G, and other 3G devices are ready to or being launched in Q3, include the best 3G three new Samsung devices and the HTC touch Pro 2. In total, we expect to have 11 3G enabled converged devices by the end of the year. 2.1 million already 3G enabled converged devices were on air as of Q2, which is an up by almost 40% from Q1.</p>
          <p>As already mentioned, we achieved meaningful OpEx savings in the U.S. through our cost cutting measures which we initiated. And that is demonstrated by the reduction in cash costs per user, or CCPU, down to $23 in Q2 from $25 in the first quarter of 2009, as well as in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our roaming overbuild program to reduce roaming costs is gaining traction as well with more than 500 roaming overbuild sites added in Q2. In terms of mobilizing the Internet, rapid data growth is continuing in Europe and in the United States. In Europe, data revs without messaging grew by about 30% year-on-year in the second quarter. Compared to Europe, the penetration of mobile Internet services among T-Mobile USA customers is still lower.</p>
          <p>With an accelerated 3G rollout, however, and the launch of many more 3G-enabled converged devices, the prospects for mobile data growth are promising in the U.S. Compared to a year ago, the mobile data growth rate without messaging already more than doubled to 42% year-on-year in Q2. After growing only $0.10 sequentially in Q1, U.S. data ARPU including messaging grew by $0.50 sequentially in Q2.</p>
          <p>Let me briefly review the performance of our European mobile-only operations. All operations, the U.K., Czech Republic, Poland, Austria and the Netherlands, faced some top line pressure in service revenues. In the U.K. a decline in service revenues in local currency of 1.9% represented already a meaningful improvement over Q1, during which service revenues declined by 4.4% and it also does compare favorably to Orange, as well as to Vodafone.</p>
          <p>We saw double digit minutes of use growth in Poland, for Czech Republic and Austria, but usage declined in the U.K. and in the Netherlands. Revenues in all operations were impacted by less travel activities due to the economic environment and regulation, leading to double digit declines in roaming and visitor revenues in all those countries.</p>
          <p>Through strong cost discipline, we were able to stabilize adjusted EBITDA margins in all countries. With regard to the Netherlands, please note that adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2008 included nine months of broadband figures, that's from October 2007 to June 2008. Without this special effect, adjusted EBITDA margin would have been almost stable year-on-year. On a comparative basis, the blended ARPU of T-Mobile Netherlands declined to a lesser extent than Vodafone's.</p>
          <p>In the Czech Republic, revenues and the adjusted EBITDA margin were positively impacted by a settlement of interconnection revenues related to past years. Normalizing for this effect, the adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 50% this quarter, still up from 47% a year ago and service revenues would have declined by 6%. However, even the 6% service revenue decline compares favorably to the service revenue decline of Telef&#xF3;nica O2.</p>
          <p>The Eastern European fixed line operations had a good quarter, considering the economic and competitive environment in these countries. Even though revenues in local currencies declined between minus 2.6 at Slovak Telekom and HT in Croatia, and minus 3.8% at Magyar Telekom, the adjusted EBITDA margins remained solid at or even above 41% in all markets.</p>
          <p>While total lines were down 6% year-on-year, DSL lines grew by 17% year-on-year and the number of IPTV customers by 134%. At HT, to pick just one example, Croatia Telecom, the number of IPTV customers is already equal to one-third of all DSL lines.</p>
          <p>In our Eastern European mobile activities, we clearly saw an impact of the economy, especially with regard to roaming and visitor revenues. In Hungary, service revenues decreased by 4.3%. An increase in usage could not compensate price declines, a decrease in roaming and visitor revenues and the impact of MTR reductions.</p>
          <p>In Croatia, service revenues declined by 5.2% due to a usage and price driven decrease in ARPU, and less visitor and roaming revenues. In contrast, our mobile operations in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, short form FYROM, and Slovakia had stable service revenues. Due to good cost discipline, all operations demonstrated ongoing strong margins in Q2 ranging from 44% in Hungary to 56% in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
          <p>Contract churn remained slow and almost stable at 0.9%. However, prepaid churn increased to 2.4% from 2% in the second quarter of 2008. As the GDP outlook for some of our Eastern European markets, such as Hungry, Slovakia and Croatia, has further deteriorated, the countermeasures considered by the local governments reporting regarding VAT, income or mobile tax increases could have a negative impact on consumer spending.</p>
          <p>Since OTE &#x2013; coming to OTE now, since OTE is also reporting separately today, I will keep my remarks on the operational performance of OTE brief. Looking at the first half of 2009, OTE made a meaningful contribution to our financial performance. Please recall that OTE has been consolidated in our results since February. Therefore, our consolidated H1 results include five months of OTE results.</p>
          <p>During this period, OTE contributed 2.4 billion in revenues, 4.2 billion in free cash flow and 4.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA, which means that OTE is on track to deliver on our guidance of approximately 2 billion full year EBITDA contribution.</p>
          <p>In terms of synergies of the acquisitions of OTE, we are already at a full year 2009 run rate of &#x20AC;84 million. In H1 2009, the realized net effect of these synergies already amounted to &#x20AC;57 million.</p>
          <p>The annual run rate is split fairly evenly between CapEx and OpEx synergies. These synergy figures mean that we have already outperformed our full year synergy target of mid double-digit million amount in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>At COSMOTE, synergies were split into one-third CapEx, mainly procurement of equipment and two-thirds OpEx, mainly terminal procurement. Whereas in OTE fixed line, almost 100% of synergies come from CapEx savings. The savings come from Romtelecom. Roughly 55% of the overall synergy run rate was derived from procurement and 41% from terminals.</p>
          <p>Split in another way, 71% of the growth synergies came from COSMOTE, 23% from OTE and 5% from Romtelecom. Examples for procurement savings are double digit percent savings versus average market prices for wireless and wireline access, as well as core and control. We were also able to achieve significant price reductions for terminals at COSMOTE as a result of the joint portfolio selection between Deutsche Telekom and COSMOTE.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with the ongoing improvement, which is demonstrated also by T-Systems system solutions. While total revenues were down 3.2% in the second quarter, external revenues were relatively stable despite the economic environment. However, we have seen a slowdown in the growth of our international business to 0.9%, reflecting economic pressures in the business customer segment. Economic pressures can be seen in IT budget cuts, project delays and a lower order entry.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing good customer demand for outsourcing projects, as reflected in our Q2 deal lineup. And those deals, big deals concluded since the second quarter include domestic deals with MAN, the Continental Insurance Group, and Lufthansa and international deals with The Nuance Group and Brenntag Asia Pacific among others.</p>
          <p>Both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT improved significantly. Adjusted EBITDA increased to almost 23% to &#x20AC;231 million, that's a margin of 10.6% up from 8.4% in the second quarter of 2008. Adjusted EBIT went from a loss of &#x20AC;7 million in Q2 '08 to a profit of $58 million in Q2 '09. These results demonstrate that our efficiency programs are proving to be successful.</p>
          <p>Let's have a closer look at the efficiency turnaround initiated at Systems. Adjusted EBITDA increased strongly to &#x20AC;92 million year-to-date. The adjusted EBIT margin improved to 2.7% in Q2 from minus 0.3% in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>As a result of the ongoing restructuring, Systems Solutions achieved a Save for Service cost reduction of 252 million in the first half of 2009. Examples of this Save for Service include the optimization of pre-sales, reshaping of our costs &#x2013; of our sales organization, the reduction of production costs and the increase of utilization within our Systems Integration, as well as a consolidation of data centers, and near and offshoring measures on top.</p>
          <p>Coming to the outlook for the second half 2009, we continue to execute on our strategy as we did before. In terms of improving competitiveness in Germany, we continue implementing our one company approach, meaning the integration of fixed and mobile into one customer service &#x2013; customer facing organization.</p>
          <p>Reporting under the new structure will start with the Q3 results on November 5. We will hold an extraordinary shareholder meeting on November 19. With regard to German broadband, the peak of 24-month contracts is coming up for renewal in Q3 and will impact our disconnections.</p>
          <p>We believe, however, the cancellations already received by now are well below our own projections, and therefore we are confident to achieve at least our full year target of a broadband net add market share of more than 45% for 2009. We'll also update you on our new Save for Service initiatives and on our new Save for Service target in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>With regard to German mobile, all the remaining national roaming revenues from the O2 contract will we booked only in Q3 and Q4 this year, as I already mentioned. In terms of the second element of our strategy, which is to go abroad with mobile, we'll continue to execute on the initiatives in the U.S. and in the U.K., and Poland I can say is already back to normal levels as seen in Q2.</p>
          <p>We have installed the new management team in the U.K., good leaders with good industry insight, and we expect a strategy update in September around. And we will continue with the integration of OTE and resulting synergy realization.</p>
          <p>In terms of mobilizing the Internet, in the U.S. we are focused on further improvement of our 3G handset portfolio and continued 3G network rollout. In Europe we strive to further improve our Connected life and work product offering. In the area of network-centric ICT, we'll continue the ongoing efficiency measure to improve our profitability.</p>
          <p>Based on the results year-to-date, we reconfirm our guidance for 2009. We expect adjusted Group EBITDA for standalone DT, excluding OTE, to be down two to 4% from the '08 level. OTE will approximately add &#x20AC;2 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Standalone free cash flow guidance remains around &#x20AC;6.4 billion, respectively around &#x20AC;7 billion for the Group including OTE, and Tim H&#xF6;ttges will have some more remarks on free cash flow in the section.</p>
          <p>Our guidance continues to assume constant currencies and no further significant economic deterioration. We remain committed to an attractive dividend policy as a key support for our share price.</p>
          <p>And with this, I turn it over Tim H&#xF6;ttges for more details on our financials.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ren&#xE9;, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am satisfied with the progress we've made in the second quarter with regard to profitability and cash flow. However, it is clear that we still have a lot of work to do during the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to revenues in the second quarter, Group revenues grew by 7.4%, supported by the consolidation of OTE. Currency impact on margin were actually positive overall with compared to last a year stronger dollar offsetting the weakness in Eastern European currencies. Underlying organic growth for the Group was minus 3.3%.</p>
          <p>In terms of divisions, the relatively best organic performance came from System Solutions with minus 1.3%, ahead of the U.S. with minus 2.3%, European mobile with minus 2.5% and BBFN fixed line with minus 5%. Comparing these growth rates to the first quarter, we saw improvement in BBFN and Systems Solutions, with weaker trends overall in European and U.S. in all our businesses.</p>
          <p>Slide 25, compared to revenues, adjusted EBITDA performance in Q2 was much more satisfying. Supported by the OTE consolidation, adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.4% to &#x20AC;5.3billion. The underlying organic development adjusted for currencies and the change in consolidation was minus 3.2%. This compares to minus 6.6% in the first quarter. With the exception of BBFN while the second quarter was more or less in line with the first quarter, all other divisions saw strong improvement in the underlying organic development.</p>
          <p>In Systems Solutions, adjusted EBITDA increased organically by almost one-third. Also adjusted EBITDA was basically flat compared to a decrease of 7.2% in the first quarter. Organic adjusted EBITDA in European mobile businesses declined by 4.4% in the second quarter compared to a minus of minus 13.5% in the first quarter. So in all these areas significant improvement. In Austria, in Czech Republic and in Poland we had positive year-on-year growth rates.</p>
          <p>On slide 26 I refer to the free cash flow. Turning to the free cash flow, second quarter free cash flow amounted to &#x20AC;1.4 billion up from 0.4 billion in the first quarter. I am happy with the significant improvement in current quarter, quarter-on-quarter. However, we know that we have clearly still a way to go to meet our free cash flow guidance for the full year.</p>
          <p>Looking at the entire first half, free cash flow amounted to &#x20AC;1.8 billion. Despite the improvement in adjusted EBITDA, other sectors continued to weigh on free cash flow, most prominently cash CapEx. The cash CapEx increased by &#x20AC;1.2 billion year-on-year. Of this 1.2 billion increase, roughly 0.5 billion each came from the U.S. mobile and BBFN and fixed line, and the remaining increase of 0.2 billion was due to European mobile businesses.</p>
          <p>The increase in the U.S. was driven partly by currency, but underlying cash CapEx in U.S. dollar also increased by quarter in the first half, driven by the accelerated 3G rollout and the 2G roaming overbuild. Of the total 1.2 billion increase in cash CapEx, 0.4 billion was incremental in Q2. Compared to the first half of 2008, changes in provisions, including variable compensation, had a negative impact of &#x20AC;0.7 billion. Cash taxes and restructuring payments increased by 0.2 billion each. Both CapEx and change in the provisions included a significant amount of front loading this year, which will normalize in the second half of the year for lower CapEx and a less unfavorable impact from the change in provisions.</p>
          <p>We have also redoubled our efforts with regard to working capital management and expect a significant contribution from further working capital optimization, such as even stronger strict management of receivables, liabilities and inventories. We also expect organic EBITDA growth in the second quarter compared to the first half.</p>
          <p>Slide 27, we made significant progress with regard to cost-cutting with the first half Save for Service contribution of &#x20AC;771 million. Of this amount, 500 million was incremental in the second quarter, almost double the first quarter contribution. The first half contribution significantly exceeded the incremental market spend of &#x20AC;560 million.</p>
          <p>With a total Save for Service gross cost reductions of &#x20AC;4.9 billion, we've now exceeded our original target of &#x20AC;4.7 billion 18 months ahead of schedule. Of the &#x20AC;4.9 billion, slightly more than 50% came from our fixed line business, just under 20% each from mobile and System Solutions, and the remainder of our central headquarters.</p>
          <p>Prominent examples of the net impact of our 2007 to 2009 Save for Service programs are, we've reduced our domestic adjusted personnel expenses by 1.4 billion, we've reduced our marketing cost of &#x20AC;200 million as a result of the streamlining of our marketing communication budget, and we've reduced the costs, the OpEx at T-Home in Germany of around 2 billion between 2007 and the first half year of 2009.</p>
          <p>While we are very satisfied of having overachieved our original target ahead of plan, this is clearly not the end of cost cutting at Deutsche Telekom. To the contrary, we are focused on achieving incremental savings and will update you on our new Save for Service program, and initiatives and the targets in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 28, a big driver of part in future cost reduction is continued head count reductions in Germany and other markets. While Group head count increased almost 15% compared to the end of 2008, due to the OTE consolidation domestic head count decreased by almost 12,000 employees year-on-year, a reduction of 8.4%. This resulted in a 6.3% reduction of domestic adjusted personnel expenses and a reduction of 40 basis points in the domestic adjusted Group personnel cost ratio to just over 30%. The first half reduction of head count in Germany was relatively small due to front loading of employee hires, which should normalize in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 29. Turning to the bottom line, we had a good second quarter relatively to the second quarter of last year, and the reported net income increased by 32.2% to 521 million. The consolidation is OTE is responsible for the increase in D&amp;A. This increase, however, was offset by the improvement in EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Reported net income also benefited from lower net interest expenses and lower minorities. Looking at the first half, reported net income remained negative still due to first quarter write-down of the carrying value of our U.K. operation.</p>
          <p>Slide 30, adjusted net income, excluding special factors, improved as well with an increase of 19.4% to &#x20AC;756 million, with improvement driven by more or less the same factors as for reported net income. Special factors in the second quarter amounted to minus 235 million, of this &#x20AC;183 million related to personnel expenses, primarily for severance payment and minus &#x20AC;31 million to other restructuring expenses.</p>
          <p>Net financial results were impacted by special factors of minus &#x20AC;112 million related to accrued interest of personnel provisions, partially offset by positive special factors of &#x20AC;49 million in terms of income tax expenses.</p>
          <p>Slide 31, net debt increased to 45 million (sic) [45 billion] at the end of June as a result of the dividend payment of &#x20AC;3.8 billion, including minorities, partially offset by the second quarter free cash flow of &#x20AC;1.4 billion. This compares to 42.8 billion at the end of March.</p>
          <p>Slide 32, despite the increase in net debt, our balance sheet ratios remain solid and well within the comfort zone ratios. As of June 30, the gearing amounted to 1.1 times and the equity ratio to 31.2%, compared to our comfort zone ratios of 0.8 to 1.2 times for gearing and 25 to 30% for the equity ratio.</p>
          <p>Slide 33 shows the strong liquidity cushion we have. We are also maintaining our strong liquidity bolster and the reserves of &#x20AC;22 billion as of the end of the quarter. This consisted of 6.8 billion of liquid assets and 15.2 billion of unused credit lines. We had 28 bilateral credit facilities of &#x20AC;600 million each, adding up to &#x20AC;16.8 billion. The average time to maturity of these credit lines was 2.1 year per June. OTE had &#x20AC;350 million of undrawn credit facilities, which are maturing almost in the maturity of 2012.</p>
          <p>Let me end my prepared remarks on slide 34 with the look at the maturity profile. For 2009 we had remaining maturities of &#x20AC;2.5 billion. Maturities are well balanced. Generally, we would be able to fund upcoming maturities out of our organic free cash flow generation. Additionally, we have sufficient unused bilateral credit lines at end.</p>
          <p>As of June 30, we have done funding of &#x20AC;4.9 billion at good terms, including a Eurobond of &#x20AC;2 billion and a US dollar bond of &#x20AC;1.1 billion. We will continue to tap the debt capital market opportunistically in the case of favorable market conditions.</p>
          <p>With this, we are now ready for your questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Dear investors, we'll now start with our Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Hannes Wittig from JPMorgan. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much. The question relates to the U.S. I just wanted to understand so far you have covered 120 million POPs; the 3G budget target is 200 million. So &#x2013; and the CapEx, we've seen the CapEx, so I just wondered what causes sort of the delay in bringing markets up to speed and when do you think the full 3G initiatives will start to be effective. Is that the third quarter or should we wait for the fourth quarter to really have the full coverage and the full product portfolio in place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Hannes, 160 million POP coverage by the end of this quarter is expected, because some of the &#x2013; many of the sites which have been built need to be integrated so that has bit of a lead time. By the end of the year, we stick to the goal of approximately 200 million POP coverage. And on the device side, we are expanding our device range by the end of the year to a total of about 11 or 12 devices, of which some are based on Android and some are based on other operating systems. So wherever we have now the network in place, for instance, best example being New York, which was opened as the first 3G network, the data growth is very strong and so the impact is there. Already 2.1 million 3G capable devices have been sold and that number, of course, is in focus. We need to continue to push that number and focus on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Nick Delfas from Morgan Stanley. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. First question on the adjustments you made to EBITDA. I mean, you had special provisions of 3.1 billion in '06, 2.4 in '07, 1.1 in '08. Should we be expecting another 1 billion of provisions this year? I know that was about 230 in the quarter, but if you could give us some idea of how much the restructuring is going to be.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on page 32, you talk about the balance sheet. You don't show the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio there. Presumably one wouldn't use all the EBITDA from OTE, which as I know you consider 100% in your free cash flow. But what is the actual net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio you think of company at the current time and how does that compare to the comfort zone ratios? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first thing, we have still built accruals for further restructuring measures and head count release, so which are beyond the year 2009 on our balance sheet. On top of that, we have not planned additional restructuring charges for our &#x2013; accrued for further restructuring so far, so I don't expect additional negative EBITDA impact from this regard. Nick, could you repeat the second question with respect to net debt EBITDA and especially the reference to OTE once again, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On page 32, it shows your balance sheet ratios, but under net debt to adjusted EBITDA you've written not applicable. I don't now whether that's just because it's the middle of the year, but how should we look at your comfort zone ratios? Are those going to be net debt to total EBITDA including 100 of OTE? Or do you do some sort of proportionate measure to reflect the fact you only own 30% of OTE and a range of percentage of some of your Eastern European assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. We are fully consolidating OTE. We are fully consolidating the OTE net debt, and therefore that is &#x2013; there is no proportionate treatment of the OTE net debt, not at all. And we stick to our comfort zone ratios of two to 2.5 times.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Mathieu Robilliard from BNP. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Thank you. Two questions, please. First in the U.S., there's been a few recent new initiatives by prepaid players in terms of long prices. And so I just wanted your sense as to whether the competitive environment that we think today in the United States is pretty much what we are expecting for and certainly what you were expecting when you gave out the guidance?</p>
          <p>And the second element, the second question was with regard to Save for Service plan. You talked about an update in Q4. Should we think of it as an update for new initiative that will play out in 2010? Or these initiatives things that you're going to start working on, but only communicate to the market by the Q4 of this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mathieu, to answer the second question immediately. Of course, we still &#x2013; you know that we've got &#x2013; alone in the T-Home organization we have got 60 initiatives up and running on the Save for Service initiatives, so that will continue to roll on. And in the fourth quarter we'll give you an update on the new initiatives and the new targets, so there will be a continuation of the targets and of the initiatives we already have implemented two years ago. And there will be new initiatives on top, which we'll be presenting in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. On the price plan, on the competitive environment, it's very clear it has become more aggressive. But the one thing has been already said a few months ago and that's still facing position &#x2013; we will have two defend as a consumer value postpaid player our position, that is the most important, because that's a lot to gain or to lose and therefore that's going to be the focus. Of course, we'll be competitive, but with a special focus on consumer value in postpaid. And, of course, linked with a better range of devices, in particular on 3G and an improved distribution. The most recent agreement with RadioShack helps us to fully expand our own stores and we have an extended retail distribution network, plus better devices and an aggressive position in the value postpaid segment and that is the focus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Peter-Kurt Nielsen from Cheuvreux. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yeah, just one question relates to the full year outlook, which is obviously confirmed with a qualification that it assumes constant currencies and no economic deterioration. You did the same three months ago, and you could argue that both have deteriorated somewhat since then. Now, while you have some flexibility on the free cash flow side, if you look at the EBITDA targets, would you say you are now biased towards the lower end of that range or are you still completely happy with the guidance as before? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We still stick to what we say, a few months ago we were &#x2013; and we confirm that we will achieve these targets. If you look into the trend in Q2, Q2 is significantly better than Q1. All the measures we have initiated show already effects in Q2, but they will continue to show effects in Q3 and Q4. So we believe it's absolutely doable. We need a run rate of somewhere around 5.4 or so in order to arrive well within our guided number. We think that it's doable. Okay, so no change to our guidance despite the fact that the dollar has worsened a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me refer to the currency exchange rate as well. First, we don't give any kind of revenue guidance or country projections with regards to currencies. Second, the effect on currency was positive in the first quarter year-over-year and it was slightly positive as well in the second quarter. The dollar overcompensated shortfalls in the Eastern European countries, as I mentioned. So, therefore, we had two quarters where the currency year-over-year was supportive on our front. We are not doing any speculations on exchange rates with regards to the second half of the year. And therefore our guidance is based on constant exchange ratios and no further deterioration of the economy in this respect and this gives you a stable, let's say, basis for calculating our business case.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. <mark type="inaudible" /> from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions. One on the U.S. again. The CCPU was lowered to $23. I am trying to understand whether the measures you talked about at Q1 are more or less done and that is the result that we are seeing today, or whether you will see significant further momentum on the CCPU side from the measures that you initiated and that you told us about with the Q1 results. I mean, you are talking about the roaming overbuild. I am just trying to get a sense on the supplier contract renegotiations and such things. I remember in the ancient history of T-Mobile, you actually once talked about I think lowering CCPU to maybe $21 and I'm wondering whether you are willing to give us some sort of gauge where this number might trend.</p>
          <p>The second question regards the spectrum auctions coming up in Europe and in Germany in particular. Can you give us a rough sense where you think this is going to go for &#x2013; from maybe in an aggregate perspective, whether this is going to go over next 12 to 18 months in aggregate for T-Mobile? Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the U.S. CCPU, I'm afraid I can't give you more precise outlook on too much detail, but the current trend is a good one. I mean, we are coming from 25 down to 23 and &#x2013; we're really not letting loose of our cost initiatives. We will see some more benefits from the roaming overbuild, because the roaming costs to third parties were pretty high, so that should help. And again cost cutting efforts clearly stay in place, that's clear.</p>
          <p>Spectrum auctions in Europe, to be honest I believe will be &#x2013; first of all, the timing is still somewhat uncertain. Germany is now expected to come early next year. With regards to the Digital Dividend spectrum, I expect the outcome to be reasonable if not even very reasonable. I don't expect big price falls in the spectrum, but you never know before it actually happens. But currently the environment, the competitive environment and the design of the auction I don't think is geared to drive prices up unreasonably.</p>

          <p>Mr. Carl Murdock-Smith from Cazenove. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Just following up on page 28 of the presentation, the domestic restructuring. As you do the domestic restructuring, I was wondering if you could provide any more forward-looking guidance in terms of the cost savings available. And then also in terms of the German fixed line, the scale of the disconnections in Q3 that you talk about, I was wondering if it was possible that you might be able to put some more absolute figure on that scale that you're expecting in terms of potential churn, given the fact that the German broadband market does seem to be slowing. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to the Save for Service initiatives, we have still significant room for cost efficiency, particularly in our domestic businesses. And second, we have no alternative as well to further head count reductions in our businesses. And therefore we have proved that we were very confident in realizing this potential that we have already achieved 18 months ahead of schedule, the communicated saving targets. We are currently working on various new work streams, not only in personnel issues, but as well in other areas. Think about the IP migration, which is one of the topics we have on the agenda. We have not communicated so far internally our new targets, and therefore we need time to do our work internally and then we will come up with a new program, with new initiatives and a target in the fourth quarter with a new Save for Service program. Until then we have still enough to do to achieve, let's say, our full year EBITDA and free cash flow guidance. And for that we need as well further cost reduction, and therefore we keep the momentum we had in the last two years and we keep on running.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On disconnection to be expected in Q3, I expected &#x2013; expecting to go up for the reasons you all know. I do think we will end up with a net share &#x2013; or new net adds in that quarter in the vicinity of 40%. And let's see, I mean, we are doing everything we can to retain our customers and also we have gained customers back also in this year again. And in light of the slowing broadband market overall, after all I don't think the impact is going to be that dramatic and the overall year 45% plus is going to stay in place. So we had a great performance in Q2. We'll have a good performance in Q3 in that regard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have got to say something on top of that. The cancellations that we have already seen are well below our own projections and expectations. So therefore, we are not at all that much worried about our third quarter. And you remember the market share of net adds does not only &#x2013; is not only dependent on &#x2013; actually the cancellations is also dependent on the market growth in the third quarter and that is for us more of an unknown factor.</p>

          <p>Mr. Justin Funnell from Credit Suisse, London. May we have your question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The working capital move of &#x20AC;700 million negative in Q2, I was just wondering if you can break that down a bit more. I just understand that there was an effect from bonuses, but I'd have to mention that the majority of that 700 million is something else. Just wondering if you're seeing an increasing gap or working capital drag in your IT service business as you sign up new contracts. Are we seeing an effect there as you accrue profits, but actually are burning cash on those contracts at the moment? Is there any detail you can give or otherwise to explain the size of that next year working capital move?</p>
          <p>Secondly on margins in the U.S., there essentially some things that you are doing which would help even more in the second half than the first half, such as the 2G overbuild. And I guess just looking at your track record, once you started cost cutting there you mentioned builds for period of time. So should we expect your margins to be better year-on-year in the second half than they were in Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Justin. The first question with regards to our working capital, what we have seen in the first half year was an extra cash-out on bonuses that was based on the good achievements of our targets in 2008. This was a one-time of 250 million. In addition to that one, we had pensions which are to our civil servant services. This was an amount of 600 million and which was a one-timer and that's already covering full year, so not coming in the upcoming quarters again. In addition to that one, we had a negative relation when it comes to our active and passive working capital, so that drove us into initiatives to even further manage better our inventories and this is &#x2013; it has nothing to do or not negatively affected by IT services. I don't see any impact from that one that we are burning cash with big deals on the Systems Solutions side. This is a normal course of the business and the one-timers, as I described it.</p>

          <p>And a brief perspective on margins in the U.S. The second half should be in the similar range as the second quarter. Even through we don't provide detailed margin outlook here, but a similar range should be accomplishable, and really depends also on Q4 how strong and how fast we grow, but overall roughly the same as Q2.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. One question on the U.S. and one on Germany. On the U.S., you've indicated you think that the blended ARPU has bottomed. I was just kind of wondering whether you think there's any risk of going negative on net adds or do you think you've got enough know in terms of the new offers to keep growing the base. And then the second question on Germany, there's elections coming up and there are some concerns amongst the market that maybe there will be deterioration in economy trends following these elections. Just wondering to what extent you're concerned there could be a bit more pressure on your business, perhaps kind of in the backend of this year and in 2010 post the elections?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The U.S. in Q3, I don't &#x2013; I'm not so optimistic that we'll have good growth numbers. Because if you look at Q2, our net adds were &#x2013; of 325 were to a large extent prepay and within prepay even lower ARPU products, also on the MVNO. So I'm not &#x2013; to be honest not sure and not too optimistic, but overall throughout the second half of the year, particularly when it comes to Q4, we should expect an improvement because of a new large 3G device range, extra marketing campaign activities and better network and distribution. So all of that should play a role help us to improve throughout the second half of the year, but Q3 I don't think it's going to be a great quarter with regards to net adds, so don't expect miracles.</p>
          <p>Germany, concerns in the market about economic deterioration. So far we've been pretty stable, particularly &#x2013; I mean, it's all relative fixed line decreased its revenues, but that had different reasons. So Germany pretty well held up so far. I think we got to continue to push on the data side, because that is still the growth area and I don't have very big concerns short term in Germany about the economic impact. I think we can still sustain our business relatively well, even though it may have &#x2013; it has slightly declined, but not so because of roaming rather than economic crisis.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Could we just talk about Poland, which was obviously the source of some concern a couple of months back. The reduction you've made in acquisition and retention costs, to what extent are you confident that investors have followed and to what extent should we assume that some of the marketing reductions you've made recently will have to be reversed as the end of the year comes forward and you push more for growth? And I want to talk about a similar question for U.K. Some recent reductions in marketing expense <mark type="inaudible" /> margin, should we see those as permanent or temporary changes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Poland, if you compare our performance against our large competitor, TPSA, I think we compare quite favorable, not just in terms of profitability development, but also in terms of revenue market share. So quite frankly I think we've &#x2013; we have not given up our relative strength in the market. U.K. reduction in market spends, to be honest I think we even had increase in SAC per contract gross adds year-on-year. So I wish I could confirm that there was a reduction in market spend. I do think so far at least it was stable, if not even increased, but I have to look it up in detail. But Tim has the numbers in detail, just tell --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could give you. On the U.K., it's correct that we have increased our SAC contract per gross add by 8.8% to &#xA3;160. That's true. But on the other hand, we have reduced our blended SACs by 9.3%, which is due to a reduction on the prepaid cost &#x2013; on the prepaid SACs. This is due to the fact that we have more focused on SIM-only products in the U.K. market and to keep the momentum. So we are still focusing on contract in this environment. I think then talking about revenue and their contribution to earnings; this is much better invested money than on the prepaid side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Terry just back to Poland once again, what we did in the second quarter is actually we had that front-end loading in terms of SAC and SACs involved in the first quarter. So we just went back to normal levels in order to flatten that out of the first half year and actually we did also very well comparatively on the subscriber side. We had positive prepay net adds in the second quarter, whereas last year we still lost 364,000 and we're still pretty satisfied in economic conditions with a 114,000 customers we added on the contract side. So I think there is not too much risk from our end.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have a question relating to what we may describe as a change in the reporting of the units starting with Q3. The question is, do you &#x2013; I mean, there's really a German unit created, yes. And I think you earlier this year indicated that you plan to create a Southern Europe, Eastern Europe unit or something like that. Will these other changes to the Group structure be made as variable to Q3 figures? Is it right to assume that your new savings in the &#x2013; that you present, discuss have to do with this &#x2013; your Group reorganization more country focused going forward?</p>

          <p>So Thomas, Tim here. Definitely we are working on restatement for the businesses. We took the strategic decision to focus in the markets in a more integrated approach and converged approach within our business. Therefore we build &#x2013; report in the future within regional segments. The regional segments we are following are the following, Germany with T-Mobile and T-Home business in it. Then we have the U.S. You're going to see the SEEs, or South and Eastern Europe entities. You will find some mobile Europe countries, some mobile only countries and we will report as well in the business as well logic which is less regional, but rather than a customer focused area. We will have a very comprehensive, let's say, bridging process and detailed teaching process on that one. We are preparing that and we will show all the numbers, let's say, in the old logic as well as in the new logic so that you find a new way for this &#x2013; to this reporting here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. A question on your free cash flow guidance. Despite the improvements in the second quarter, it looks still a bit stretched, your seven billion free cash flow target. But it seems you have in mind some significant improvement in the working capital in the second half. Can you give us some indication for the size of improvement you intend to achieve in the second half in the working capital area? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first I think that is very important question with regards to the target we have, the seven billion free cash flow target for the Group, and we have seen 1.8 billion free cash flow so far. So we have 5.2 billion yet to go. The first improvement is coming from an expected operating improvement, so our run rate which is 800 million higher than the number we have seen in the first half year throughout the businesses. The second part what we're going to see is, we have less investments. We will invest around four billion compared to the 4.8 billion you have seen in the first half year. So due to the U.S. and due to some fixed line investments, we have seen a front loading on investments, which we have steered down already for the second half of the year, so around four billion. And we will not see some cash-outs we've seen in the working capital in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>The main part is the improvement in the working capital on the one-off payments in the pension services. There was this advanced payment pension service I mentioned already in one of the earlier questions. There is 250 million bonuses which were once paid in the first half year. And then top of that one there are some settlements we had with the changes at Telef&#xF3;nica, which is standing for another 100 million which is not occurring in the second half of the year. On top of that one we think about other alternatives, managing our inventories, thinking about some factoring initiatives and as well managing the way how we pay our suppliers in the future. So the classical instrument of working capital management is the other part.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, if we're not going to be able to manage our free cash flow, we still have the opportunity to reduce further our CapEx &#x2013; our cash CapEx requirement to fulfill the targets. So there is a detailed plan behind that and I think you've seen the major cornerstones of that.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I've got two questions if that's okay, on slide 27 where you detail the impact of the Save for Service plan. The first one is, looking at the latest contribution of Save for Service, it seemed to slow quite dramatically in H1 in all the business areas except the Systems Solutions. Can you talk a little bit about why that was and how long you think it's going to take to reinvigorate the rate of cost cutting with the new plans? And the second question was, looking at the chart the net impact to Save for Service and market spend was around &#x20AC;200 million, or about one percent of your of cost base. Do you think this is a reasonable amount of cost cutting on a net basis going forward? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me give you a quick remark on TSI. As you may have followed in the media, there are negotiations going on between us and the unions for a further and quite significant and necessary restructuring at TSI, which we believe we can bring to a good end and accomplish a good solution here. So TSI by no means is decreasing in its efforts to improve its cost position. In fact, TSI is profitable for the first time in EBIT. We are looking in TSI more on the EBIT side than on the EBITDA side alone, and therefore TSI is improving its position over proportionately, actually otherwise it wouldn't have turnaround to profitability and they will continue to do so. I think the second question Tim will have to answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to the overall Save for Service initiative, I don't see a slowdown of our Save for Service efforts and as well our achievements. We have saved &#x20AC;771 million in the first half year and of this 500 million was achieved in the second quarter, and this is around all areas. And we have reduced our head count by almost 12,000 year-over-year. There were less head counts leaving us, but this is due to new hires which we had at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>We have to improve the skill set of our people and as well the average age of the system and therefore &#x2013; we took over the apprentices finishing their education at the beginning of the year. Throughout the year we are not seeing on top of new hires, so then we will see further head count reductions coming in. There is no plan from us to reduce it, even to slow the process down as well on cost reduction and as well on the head count releases here.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Laura, the line was a bit weak. Can you repeat the second question with respect to the net impact again, sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I was just looking at slide 27, where if you subtract the market spend from the Save for Service savings in the first half, you get a net cost cut of around &#x20AC;200 million, or about 1% of your cost base. And my question was, do you think that's a reasonable run rate of net cost reductions going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we said, Laura, I think we have to continue and there is no alternative. And we will give more insight and more details on the new initiatives as well as on the targets for the new Save for Service in the fourth quarter. So I may &#x2013; we still have to wait a couple of months.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and I should be brief and probably cover ground that's been partly covered already. Judging about what you said, am I right in thinking U.S. CapEx comes down in the second half and its goes back up again next year? I mean, is there any sacrifice in not pushing ahead with the first half rate in the second half? And my second question relates to MTRs in the U.K., I don't think you've covered it yet. But would you tell us when you are going to take that and what the impact would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first thing is, yes, it's true. We are coming down in the second half of the year, but there was no method or no indication that we are coming up next year again. We have then full coverage of 200 million POPs. There will be further investments, but there is no decision taken so far with regards to 2010 investment that they're going to come up again next year. So that's to the first part.</p>
          <p>With regards to the MTR cut impact on the U.K. business &#x2013; just to check the numbers -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Simon, I know what the question means. I just can't answer top of my head. I think the termination rate cut was around 20% in price, but I don't have the co-relations to EBITDA or revenues off the top of head, I'm afraid. Maybe we can come back to and answer that question separately.</p>
