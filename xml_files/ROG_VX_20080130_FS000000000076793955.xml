      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Together with Bill Burns, CEO Division, Roche Pharma; Severin Schwan, CEO Division, Roche Diagnostics; Karl Mahler, Head of Investor Relations and key members of our team, I welcome you to the annual results 2007 telephone conference.</p>
          <p>This event starts three interesting days for all of us. After this call, we have a 10 AM Media Conference here in Basel, a 3 PM Analyst Meeting in London and on Friday at 12:30 an Analyst Meeting in New York.</p>
          <p>Our comments will be based on the investors' presentation, which you were able to download this morning from the web. This afternoon, our Chairman and CEO, Dr. Franz Humer will address the group section. Let me just select three of his charts for comment. If we turn to chart six, we can clearly say that Roche has delivered on all targets as committed and has achieved excellent results.</p>
          <p>If we turn to chart 14, you will hear from Bill that after another excellent year for Tamiflu pandemic sales to governments and corporate clients in 2007, the outlook for 2008 looks fundamentally different. You will, therefore, understand that we give you our guidance for 2008 for the underlying base business.</p>
          <p>If we turn to chart 15, outlook on 2008 profit. If we have a look on the profit stability outlook for 2008, we can see three different movements. Firstly, we expect a high profit, mainly driven by three items. We are committed and continue to be committed to improve the way we work. For instance, we expect efficiency gains in production, marketing and G&amp;A. We also expect our continuously improving products mix to deliver more margin. And we expect the overall growing portfolio to deliver absolute more contribution.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we plan on a substantial lower contribution coming from Tamiflu pandemic orders. As we have sales between 100 and CHF150 million in our current plans for 2008. This contrasts sharply to the 1.7 billion in our actual results 2007.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, we have considerably more pipelines assets to invest in in all therapeutic areas. We are already a leading like in oncology, rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune disease or a very interesting and emerging pipeline, like for instance, in metabolic diabetes and virology.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we will also have more clinical data in CNS with about four assets where we will have to decide if we move them into Phase II. Of course, we had to plan that all or most of these assets are going to make it and we also have to take a prudent approach on Tamiflu pandemic orders.</p>
          <p>And with this, I hand over to Bill Burns, CEO Roche Pharma.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, absolute pleasure to take you into the highlights of the Pharma year. If we start on chart number 19 we've seen in the year 2007 double-digit growth in sales and profit. Pharma up 11% in local currency, if we took out the Tamiflu effect it would be 14% and we've had a clear and very significant improvement in profit margin, up by 3.8%, percentage points to 35.5.</p>
          <p>We've seen significant progress in our key marketed assets. Launching Avastin in a number of indications in Europe, the approval of the first-line and later-lines in metastatic colorectal cancer unrestricted by the chemotherapy choice, the launch of Mircera in Europe. We've seen in our pipeline, as Erich has started to indicate to you, significant progress, probably since we last talked at the quarter three sales result, the most significant has been the filing of Actemra, both in the United States and in Europe.</p>
          <p>We've also made significant moves forward on the regulatory front with the approval of renal cell carcinoma for Avastin with the, at the turn of the year, the recommendation both for Avastin and for Xeloda into broadening their labels and also in recent days you will have seen that for MabThera in chronic lymphocytic leukemia we've met our target and that's now comes through about one year early. So, a number of significant pipeline progress, which I will touch on a little bit later.</p>
          <p>On chart number 20, this has been our scorecard of these activities during the year 2007. And as I have said, you can see the green tick show that we've fully delivered and in some cases we have had to move the asset to a back up or indeed in some cases move back to the originator, but nothing new since we last talked.</p>
          <p>If we look at chart 21, here you can see the impact with and without Tamiflu, 11% growth local, 10% in Swiss francs and where we'd be a US dollar reporting company that would have come out at 15% growth.</p>
          <p>And what's highlighted in the boxes on the bottom of chart 21, you can see the Roche Pharma in both halves of the year at a 12% growth excluding Tamiflu. So we have been fully delivering Tamiflu as we've indicated to you and that second half of last year &#x2013; first half of &#x2013; I'm sorry, second half of 2006, first half of 2007 were the most significant halves for shipments to governments and that is now easing back.</p>
          <p>When we look on chart 22, at the operating margin, you can see that all parts of the Pharma division contributed here and that we've had a very strong movement forward to that 35.5% operating margin.</p>
          <p>Chart number 23 gives you the short overview of the P&amp;L of the Pharma division. Sales up 22%, significant investment in research and development, a significant background movement both in income into the company and indeed one-off expenditures like the Viracept write-offs, some of the legal expenses associated with Mircera and so forth. However, the net result with good containment of cost of sales, cost of goods and of marketing and distribution costs has resulted in the operating profit growing at twice the pace of sales at 22%.</p>
          <p>I then turn to chart number 25, showing that Roche Oncology, this is still 50% of the sales of the division, the market leader worldwide. And as you can see at the right of this chart, Avastin has been and is now the fastest take off of any cancer drug ever, and is continuing to grow strongly. You've seen growth on an original basis, both in Europe, rest of world, United States and in Japan as some of these assets now come through into the Japanese market.</p>
          <p>If we turn to chart 24, where we show some of the key brands and the growth of those key brands. MabThera, still continuing to be well adopted into maintenance and other lines in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. And to give you a sense of where we've reached in the rollout of rheumatoid arthritis into patients not responding to the anti-TNFs. We believe it's of the order of CHF0.5 billion that are now secured in rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
          <p>For Herceptin, penetration continues. We're still a little bit behind, the United States, only 70% in Europe, some growth to go there, but dramatically more growth to go in the rest of world and still that's, as you can see, growing strongly.</p>
          <p>For Avastin, good uptake in the United States in non-small cell lung cancer as Genentech reported to you in a matter of days ago. In Europe, still a lot of the growth coming in metastatic colorectal cancer and as we've had our first pickup in non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer. That was a 64% growth in Europe, rest of world for Avastin. So it is growing strongly.</p>
          <p>For Xeloda, 19% growth worldwide, with an increasing use in adjuvant colon cancer. Interesting data coming through on the overall survival benefit there which shows that not only is it not inferior to 5-FU, it actually is superior to 5-FU. For Tarceva principal growth has been in non-small cell lung cancer, Europe and the rest of world grew by 76% and we see comparable sales between United States and Europe. That's well evident from chart number 27 where we show the proportionality of where the sales are secured from.</p>
          <p>Herceptin, now two-thirds of the revenues come from international markets, one-third effectively from the United States. And you can see that over time, as we broaden with each of our cancer therapies, we should expect a broad penetration into world markets, a broader than sometimes in the investment community people have been predicting where it's principally been 50-50 between Europe and the United States. We certainly see that as other economies are growing, we also are benefiting by penetrating those markets.</p>
          <p>Chart 28 shows where we've reached in some of the key rollouts, and I'll go into just a little bit more this afternoon in London. Similarly on charts 29 and 30 where we start to show you the broadening of the label that has been achieved and how we will able to expand the sales into patients who perhaps through failure of reimbursement were not able to get the therapy thus far. Chart 31 shows this also for breast cancer.</p>
          <p>So on page 32, we start to highlight for you on oncology some of the key upcoming data flow that we should expect in 2008. The AVADO study, RIBBON-1 will come to profile Avastin further in breast cancer. In terms of HER2 you'll see this move forward with pertuzumab plus Herceptin in metastatic breast cancer.</p>
          <p>Roche and Genentech are partnered on the armed antibody of Herceptin and that had very interesting result as you'll remember at ASCO in May. At the end of the year we've opted into that and we will drive this forward through 2008.</p>
          <p>The large adjuvant studies for Avastin in breast cancer, both HER2 positive and HER2 negative, started either right at the end of last year or right at the beginning of this year and those will run for a number of years, but clearly, like Herceptin this could open up a potentially very large market opportunity.</p>
          <p>In terms of metastatic colorectal cancer, the Avastin and Xeloda recommendations in Europe have come through and we've announced just a couple of days ago the Avastin full label. Xeloda, we expect within days. And for the United States, we continue to discuss with the FDA the appropriate labeling on the datasets. There is some discussion there, it may take us a little bit longer than we first thought, but it's in good shape and the data is solid.</p>
          <p>For chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as I mentioned the large German study group, which actually conducted this study in 11 countries, has now reached the point where the Advisory Board have said we should stop, very clear and very positive results. We will take that forward to an international meeting. It's important competitively and also we will be submitting for an approval with the authorities this year.</p>
          <p>Turning from oncology to inflammation, autoimmune, you can see that as I mentioned with MabThera we were very satisfied with the initial up take. In terms of moving forward in rheumatoid arthritis good data that has come through showing a further benefit from further exposure to MabThera. Data that we presented in Barcelona that showed moving from a first line of attack with an anti-TNF to MabThera has better benefits for the patient than moving them on to a second anti-TNF.</p>
          <p>We will have the broader signs and symptoms clinical database reading out this year. And we announced just a couple of days ago that the first of those studies, the SERENE study has reported and met its primary end point.</p>
          <p>For ocrelizumab, our humanized anti-CD20 the Phase III trials in rheumatoid arthritis have been initiated, similarly with ocrelizumab in lupus. For multiple sclerosis, as you know, we've had positive results with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis which is a market of about two-thirds of the patients with multiple sclerosis. Very positive and we took the view that we would move forward with the fully humanized version. And we are moving into a little bit more dose refinement Phase II studies that will lead us to Phase III.</p>
          <p>So, if I summarize on page 34 where we stand with our anti-CD20s. The second generation ocrelizumab, fully humanized building on less potential for immunogenicity, better tolerability, shorter infusion in times, and we believe that is more appropriate in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, lupus nephritis and in Phase II relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>We also have a third generation anti-CD20. This is a glycosylated version. It benefits from the GlycArt acquisition that was spun out from ETH Zurich a few years ago. This enhances the ADCC and the apoptosis that can result. We have now moved that into Phase I in patients and we are looking for improved efficacy over a very high standard since MabThera sets a very high standard and also less infusion reactions.</p>
          <p>In terms of news flow for this year on chart 35. For Rheumatoid Arthritis, we will have data evolving SERENE plus the others, which will lead to a submission for DMARD &#x2013; post DMARD. For Actemra, by the final quarter of this year, we are seeing an action date in the United States. We would hope by the year-end to have recommendation for approval in Europe.</p>
          <p>In terms of multiple sclerosis, the intriguing and one would have to say the wild card for this year is the role of MabThera in primary progressive multiple sclerosis. There is at the present time nothing available to treat this miserable disease, which affects about one-third of patients with the &#x2013; with it.</p>
          <p>It is a regulatory enabling study, so if that did jump the hurdle, then we would move forward with MabThera for that patient audience, that we would expect in the first half of this year. And similarly, a Phase II, III data set for MabThera in Lupus will be available during the first half of the year. So I think our inflammation autoimmune, which we've been discussing with you now is growing &#x2013; is developing very nicely and we will be taking that forward step-by-step this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of virology, Tamiflu as Erich has mentioned, we peaked now in satisfying governments' demand. The good news is we've peaked without having to build or to install equipment, but we now have an exposure. We've done this intelligently by mobilizing third party suppliers around the world. We have them on standby should we need them, but right now our line of sight into 2008 is for only 100 to 150 million of residual orders to governments. We knew this was coming; we've been sharing it with you for sometime. No surprise or drama here, but that's what we can share with you. For the winter seasonal demand, this is proving rather intractable and we don't expect this to spring ball into high sales for the year.</p>
          <p>For PEGASYS, a year of increased market share, both in the United States and in Europe. In terms of increased revenues most of those have come from the developing markets and also from the launch of COPEGUS with PEGASYS in Japan. There it's off to a good start, about 20, 25% of patients now getting PEGASYS, COPEGUS, although we were one year behind our competitor.</p>
          <p>The other thing to say here, as the year closed, the post approval commitment study, which Schering-Plough had to undertake, so called IDEAL study, to which they attached an arm to study PEGASYS. And in so doing had &#x2013; a built-in bias based upon the dosage for COPEGUS, actually did not result in any improvement in the outcomes for patients treated with PegIntron. So our rock solid position with about two-thirds of the market is absolutely there, and we are the company that is continuing to profile new molecules.</p>
          <p>If I turn you can see 37, pro memoria just the Tamiflu quarter-by-quarter for your reference.</p>
          <p>Page 38, I mentioned PEGASYS plus new activities, clearly both are polymerases and the protease inhibitor are early, but we are seeing very encouraging signs of viral load reduction. There are also interesting elements that we need to address with dosaging and this will be profiled. We think we are on to some improved outcomes for patients of 30 days.</p>
          <p>In terms of metabolism in bone on page 39, BONIVA, strong performance in the course of 2007 in the United States. An exit market share greater than 15%., and in some of the key European markets like France and Spain off to a very encouraging start. So an 85% growth in BONIVA it's about CHF900 million revenues and still a key asset for the company.</p>
          <p>Turning to our decisions in the background here on page 40. Clearly, increasing HDL is known to have benefit for patients. It's known to be a cardiovascular risk factor that along with lowering LDL the bad lipids, increasing the good guys has a benefit. We have studied long and hard and you can see a short summary on page 41. What has happened in the background? What has happened to torcetrapib. We know that we have a very different molecule. We are very satisfied with the profile that we're seeing, and I'll take you into a little more of that this afternoon.</p>
          <p>We've made the decision to go forward. This is a large 15,000 patient Phase III mortality morbidity study. First patient will be in quarter two of this year and we've also built in with the Drug Safety Monitoring Board and some other intelligent profiling work, an opportunity for, if it does not jump the hurdles to gate the expenditures over the years to come, but very encouraging.</p>
          <p>Also encouraging and you'll see on page 43, our GLP-1 product. We have the first of our Phase II data in. We know that we've got a clear dose effect. We know that we've got the possibility of a good once weekly product. We know that we've got a molecule that can be delivered with a very fine needle and much more convenient than some of the other work that's going on in this class from competitors. And so we aim for best-in-class profile. We will have the second and additional data during the first half of this year and this is our goal and intent and therefore, fully budgeted for, that we take this into Phase III in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>So, on page 44, in summarizing metabolism and diabetes for this year, the start of our CETP Inhibitor Phase III trial, the GLP-1 full decision and initiation of Phase III, and we'll also have some interesting background data on Phase II data on our DPP-IV, a controversial area. We've set very high hurdle here, including significant weight loss and also our PPAR&#x3B1;&#x3B3;, where we saw some interesting Phase II work and we'll have to have a serious heart-to-heart on what the target product profile could look like for the regulatory environment and do we move that one into Phase III this year.</p>
          <p>So, on page 46, you can see a summary, as usual, of our &#x2013; of how this would translate into projected submission of the Roche managed projects. This does not include our colleagues in Chugai and our colleagues in Genentech. So this year you can see Avastin, couple of indications potentially, pancreatic still has to be a wild card, Tarceva, Avastin, MabThera, the general signs and symptoms and of course, we should now add to that list MabThera in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</p>
          <p>As Erich has indicated and you can see schematically summarized on page 47, the second half of last year and the first part of this year sees us launching an additional cohort of Phase III commitments. We believe that we have the portfolio which merits and deserves this degree of invest for the future of the corporation.</p>
          <p>I've had the opportunity of sharing with you over recent years the monitoring both of the margin and of the portfolio. And to a person you've all encouraged that we have to do what is right for the mid-term for Roche. And this investment in the portfolio is absolutely right.</p>
          <p>This schematic that you see here is part of a program that if you looked at our key performance indicators, you would see that our clinical programs, our access programs and so forth involved more than 200,000 patients on a worldwide basis. This is a phenomenal undertaking and something that we are proud of that we're doing it, we're doing it well and we're working on the assets of the business for the future.</p>
          <p>Chart 48 summarizes, that's another schematic of how this would play out over time and we believe that this places us in a rather cool position as a company. That not only is shaping up with good performance now, the seventh year, I think, of double-digit growth, of a margin expansion from the end of the last decade of about 18% now to 35, of a portfolio that merits and deserves the investment that we are making in it.</p>
          <p>And that's why, you can see on page 49, our score card for this year of the clinical data news flow that should be coming through and the timing, or whether it's event driven and also the filings that we would make <mark type="inaudible" />. And our outlook for the year is that we will, outside of Tamiflu, continue to be an above market performer.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to hand over to Severin to take you into the Diagnostics Division.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bill. Turning to page 51, 2007 for Diagnostics has really been an extraordinary year. On the one hand we continued to penetrate our markets with a number of new products, but perhaps even more important we had a series of strategic transactions I will come back to in a moment.</p>
          <p>If we turn to the financials on page 52, you can see an overall growth for Diagnostics in local currencies of 6 percentage points in Swiss Francs, of 7 percentage points with different dynamics across the various business areas. Professional diagnostics, clearly outgrowing the market with 8% in local currencies, primarily driven by the success in immunology.</p>
          <p>Diabetes care, we will see later on a positive trend, now with a 5% growth, molecular diagnostics negative with 2 percentage points, however if we correct here for the industrial business, which has sharply declined due to the expiry of the PCR patent, we would actually grow with 3%. Outstanding result for applied science with a double-digit growth of 11%, primarily driven by the sequencing business.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page 53, you can see positive growth acceleration over the last three years. And with the investments which we made in 2007, I am sure that this growth trend will continue.</p>
          <p>Slide 54, shows that we can consolidate our position in the market. We are and remain the clear number one in the in-vitro diagnostics segment, a market which has dramatically changed over the last two years. We've seen an unprecedented number of M&amp;A deals, new player such as Siemens now holding the number two position.</p>
          <p>If we turn to the P&amp;L, on page 55, you can see that the margin has improved to 17.6% of sales. If you look at the various cost items, they are difficult to compare versus 2007, because of a number of one-off effects.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales and R&amp;D has been affected by impairment charges, which we took 2006. So the underlying growth of cost of sales and R&amp;D is higher. On the other hand if you look into the general and administration line, the underlying growth was 5%, and we had a number of one-offs with legal provisions, provisions for VAT, tax and restructuring of the BioVeris acquisition.</p>
          <p>If we turn to the various business areas on page 57, to start off with professional diagnostics, again 8% growth in local currencies and you can see the main growth driver immunochemistry driven by a strong instrument placements and the pick up of important new markets such as NT-proBNP.</p>
          <p>Diabetes care on slide 58, we can see that it is positively turning around after we had a decline in 2005. That is really a reflection of the new products, in particular ACCU-CHEK Aviva picking up and making up for the erosion we had from the former flagship ACCU-CHEK Advantage.</p>
          <p>If we turn to molecular diagnostics on page 59, you can see solid growth in the core business, in virology with 4%. Very much driven by our superior platform in the mid-throughput segment the CAP/CTM, which has already been very successful in Europe, which we launched now in the US and where we see good growth. Blood screening on the other hand is flat, enormous price pressure in this market. And as I mentioned beforehand the industrial business is sharply declining due to the expiry of the PCR patents.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to page 61. And I did say 2007 was a special year and that is very much reflected on this slide. We have completed a portfolio of key technologies. We are now a leader in the research genomic field, where we have built around a real-time PCR portfolio with 454 Life Sciences in sequencing a NimbleGen microarrays. We have and also the research market, the clinical trial market, immunochemistry with the acquisition of BioVeris and of course we have last week signed the definitive merger agreement with Ventana to enter tissue-based diagnostics.</p>
          <p>So with those transactions, we could strengthen on the one hand the core business in our life sciences and in-vitro diagnostics franchises. But I think very important in this context is that now diagnostics can also better support Pharma along the full value chain from discovery to commercialization of drugs.</p>
          <p>We turn to page 62, again a wrap up of Ventana, the leader in tissue-based diagnostics placed in Tucson, Arizona about 1000 employees and we expect the turnover in 2007 of approximately US$300 million. The tender offer has been set at $89.5 per share and will expire on the 7th February that should allow for a closing in the second quarter this year.</p>
          <p>That is certainly a very attractive offer to the shareholders of Ventana. But it reflects the strategic fit to our Roche businesses and it also reflects the value which we put to a friendly takeover where we have the Board and the management fully supporting the transaction and of course then accelerating the integration process.</p>
          <p>Chris Gleeson will continue as CEO. The business will become an independent unit within Roche Diagnostic and it will remain headquartered in Tucson.</p>
          <p>Again on page 64 and 65, you can see the synergies we expect from this transaction. On the one hand we can leverage within diagnostics the know-how and capabilities between the two companies Ventana and Roche, eventually provide better solution for pathologists. And you see in a schematic form on page 65, the various programs which are running in the Roche oncology franchise, where we now can better support Pharma to find the relevant biomarkers and develop the respective companion tests by combining the capabilities of the two companies.</p>
          <p>So to summarize again on page 66, it has been a special year with a number of acquisitions, but what I would like to point out that this is not just a random series of acquisitions to participate in the consolidation process which is ongoing in the diagnostics market. No, it is extremely targeted underlying to our strategy. The strategy is to increase the medical value, that is not only true for Pharma, that is also very true for Diagnostics where we have many diseases where we do not yet have had a proper test. And then able of this strategy, certainly the scientific progress in particular, the progress we see in molecular biology. We have the strong position in molecular biology across all our businesses, life sciences, in-vitro, Diagnostics and Pharma. And certainly those acquisitions have strengthened our position to build on that.</p>
          <p>Returning to 2008, on page 67, based on the transactions we did in 2007 and also the new launches we expect for 2008, we're very confident to grow out the market for the Diagnostics Division and with this I hand over to Erich.</p>

          <p>Thanks Severin. Turning to chart 69, building on our excellent operating performance, Roche finance made important contributions to the further strengthening of the group. In a rather challenging environment, we kept the net financial income at an attractive level. We increased the net cash and we have strengthened the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>As a result the Roche Group has further increased its strategic flexibility. We also continued our proactive disclosure beyond financial reporting standard and I hope you will have acquired moment to really dig into our finance report, which I can really assure you has a wealth of additional information, which would make your life more easy and more attractive and of course puts again the challenge on us what is the next improvement we can do in this field.</p>
          <p>Turning to chart 70, the group results 2007. You may respect, I know that you have to focus on the future, but for a short moment I think, it's worth just to have a look at these results and say, yes, we made it. And it's important for us that we, after five years of really having envisioned a passing to the future, but also see small interim steps are exactly on the trail, we have led out several years ago before and now form a good phase to go into the future.</p>
          <p>Chart 71, both divisions were able to improve their operating profit margin.</p>
          <p>Turning to Chart 72, the clear strategic focus on our core business is Pharma and Diagnostics is showing attractive results at operating level. While our innovative products have gained market share, we have kept our cost basis in both divisions under control and consequently most operating expenses are increasing at a rate below sales growth.</p>
          <p>Due to continued productivity improvements at our production sites, we were able to keep the increasing cost of sales at an attractive level, despite higher royalty expenses for our successful Pharma products like MabThera, Rituxan, Herceptin and Tarceva. And you have all the details in the financial report.</p>
          <p>The increase in R&amp;D expenses underlined our strong commitment to innovation and our readiness to invest into our future. This behavior pattern differs quiet significantly from most of our peers who are focusing on short-term cost cutting measures. The increase in R&amp;D expenses was almost compensated by higher out-licensing income, which is also a result of Roche's innovation power in the past. Overall the growth rate of the operating result is considerably stronger than sales growth.</p>
          <p>Chart 73, this is a small example of what kind of information you find in the finance report, the increase of general and in administration cost is significantly impacted by one time items, like high restructuring and legal expenses.</p>
          <p>Chart 74, in a challenging environment, we were able to keep the level of the net financial income at an attractive level. With regards to the intensive public discussion, it may be of interest that hue to a very clear risk policy, and an efficient risk management, Roche was not affected by the subprime crisis in a material manner.</p>
          <p>On the background of managed assets above CHF20 billion, the impairment of 68 million seems to be an acceptable result. And actually, the actual losses are much lower, but we have taken a prudent assessment of all the exposure, we have which has added up in the whole Roche Group, Chugai, Genentech and Roche to 68 million.</p>
          <p>The foreign exchange losses are based on the increased business success in Eastern Europe and Latin American countries. The excellent results as Bill has pointed out that we are going with most of the products now in two thirds out of the US, one third in the US share. But these excellent results also are done in currencies which are &#x2013; have very high fluctuations and are quite expensive to be hedged.</p>
          <p>Chart 75, the down side of our unique hub and spoke concept lies in the fact that Genentech and Chugai have to pay quite high taxes in their respective environments. We were nevertheless able to significantly decrease the group tax rate. Also the current result is driven by one-time effects such as the reduction of corporate taxes in Germany and Italy. The Roche tax rate excluding Genentech and Chugai is expected to be lower in the future than it was in the past. This is the result of a multi-year project to optimize our tax structure.</p>
          <p>Chart 76, core EPS. This important yardstick shows the continuing improvement of the Roche performance. 77, the excellent net income has helped to strengthen our equity base. Chart 78, with this strengthened balance sheet Roche has significantly increased its strategic flexibility to strengthen the core businesses, Pharma and Diagnostics. Chart 79, based mainly on the strong operating results the net cash position of the group was further strengthened.</p>
          <p>Chart 80, in the last 21 years Roche has continuously increased its dividend based on the excellent results the Board purposes the &#x2013; to the annual share of the meeting of March 4th, 2008 that we increase the dividend by 35% to CHF4.60 and you have also seen that we are committed over the next three years to even further increase our payout ratio.</p>
          <p>And this brings me to our objectives for 2008. Let me close with this outlook. Barring unforeseen developments we expect high single-digit local currency sales increase for the group excluding government and corporate stockpiling orders of Tamiflu for pandemic use. Above market sales growth in both divisions Pharma excluding Tamiflu pandemic sales. Core earning per share at least at record 2007 levels despite significant increase in R&amp;D investments and considerably lower Tamiflu pandemic sales and a continuous increase &#x2013; and a clear commitment to a continuous increase in dividend payout over the next three years.</p>
          <p>And with this, ladies and gentlemen, we have a full fifty minutes more or less for your questions. And we're ready for your question. Who wants to start it up?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I've three questions. Firstly, Bill I'm a bit disappointed about your top-line outlook for the Pharma division because if I understand correctly you are stripping 1.8 billion pandemic sales out of the base and then at staff base you only grow single digit and that is if I look &#x2013; that seems a bit underwhelming. If I look at your current growth strength, the oncology is over 50% of your business now growing at 20% and you have a couple of other fast growing franchises. So I'm not really &#x2013; can you give us some &#x2013; can you run us, by us the headwinds your are facing in Pharma aside from Tamiflu, which we've already stripped out to explain why you cannot reach double-digit sales growth of the reduced base that we're aware of <mark type="inaudible" /> effect that should be offset by Mircera?</p>
          <p>The other two questions are just quick clarification questions, firstly, on the DPP-IV inhibitor. I wasn't sure whether you'd actually seen weight loss in the Phase II or whether that's just part of your target profile. And the third question is given for diagnostics, given that the top line guidance includes the acquisition effect. The question is, without the acquisition effect would you still be able to grow above market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Alexandra. Good morning to you. Top line outlook so &#x2013; you're right, we take out about 1.7 million (sic) [billion] of Tamiflu pandemic sales. We have in place about 100 to 200, so it's 150 something of that order. And what you're seeing and I think most people have been modeling fairly correctly is a continuing growth trend on the rest of business. The signal is high single-digit growth. So, it's &#x2013; and the baseline gets bigger and bigger. It's &#x2013; I think it's, well from what I see as probably the consensus, it's not &#x2013; this is not a surprise to the world. For DPP-IV, weight loss is in the target product profile Alexandra, we haven't yet seen it.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the diagnostic side, the outlook excludes the acquisition effect. I am sorry that that was not clear, but this excludes the acquisition effect. So, certainly Ventana will be on top of it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Two questions, please. Firstly, Bill, on the GLP-1, just wondering what you're waiting for to move it into Phase III? Or are you stating actually it's &#x2013; the plan is to go ahead with it now given the profile you talk about and given the profiles of the other two products in the market currently. The second one, I guess Erich is for you and you made a comment towards the end when getting us to focus on the current year earnings and stressed how strong they were. And you know, it's interesting looking back at the last three years, the growth you provided, in contrast to the outlook comments that you've given, I guess the one thing that probably will be disappointing many today is your outlook statement for 2008.</p>
          <p>So, I am just really trying to understand, how essentially, I guess at the R&amp;D side you can ramp up your R&amp;D so much. I mean do you have an organization? Do you have the infrastructure in place where you can actually ramp up the R&amp;D spend so significantly that potentially your earnings growth could be roughly flat on last year which would obviously imply a very, very major contraction of the Pharma margin. And that also of course in the context of the significant improvements that you outlined in your cost of goods sold, for example and also your G&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>William, do you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on GLP-1 John, we've seen a lot of good encouraging data. We've a bit more to go, but intellectually, if you like, we were planning for Phase III. What we usually announce historically has been when first patient is in on a given phase of the development. That's the only hesitancy in the voices. So, we've &#x2013; we've intellectually made the decision. We need to see a little bit more data and then we will be there recruiting patients second half year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now I'll try from my side. I mean it's obvious, if you take Tamiflu, it is just 1.7 billion in sales, which we plan will not be here from 2007 to 2008. I leave it to you to model what kind of impact this has on the profitability. The good news as Bill has pointed out and I've high respect for Bill and his team, that he's built up an extremely flexible cost structure. You haven't heard over the last three years, this was 5 billion in sales, just more or less building out from nowhere and the whole infrastructure has been actually brought down without any impairment charge hitting the result. And Bill still has the flexibility that should this major danger, which is not a way, come back &#x2013; that we relatively quickly could come back and support mankind. But we also have pointed out to all governments if they don't take the provisions now with actually safeguarding their populations, we can also not shut from one day to the other supply everybody. We will need a certain time to react, but many governments have been very prudent and have taken Tamiflu stocks. So this effect is quite major.</p>
          <p>And internally I compare this to a major generic situation of a major product. This is the impact you have. With regards to are you able to spend so much and we're talking really of many hundred millions of additional R&amp;D expenses we planned this year. The good news is, John, we are not talking only oncology and in oncology nothing is falling away. All these major oncology programs as this chart from Bill has shown, they are going on and the number of patients on the studies are even increasing. And the good news now comes that we dare, based on the excellent scientific data from the early phases of clinical development, we dare to go into major field like metabolic disorders and diabetes and in this field. I mean, it's not so much internal cost structure which we need to build up. I think we have with the new Pharma 2015 organization along these business segments that you could say are disease biology areas. We have the infrastructure in place to actually now contract major capacities all around the world. And you have heard Bill mentioning, just the DPP-I study with 15,000 patients targeted. And these costs are in most cases actually third party expenses.</p>
          <p>I am sorry to say, I see no risk that we will not be able to spend it. But important thing is actually that we, as Bill has shown you, we have built in certain hurdles that we do not commit on a 4, 5 years, blind flight, but that we actually will have after certain time periods of 12 months have a clear feedback where we stand and that we can be very prudent. So, of course, you have and I accept it, you have with the reference on the results of our track records in the four years. You have also mentioned that actually, usually, we tend to be a little bit conservative at the beginning of the year. But I can tell you we have &#x2013; this is what we have on our radar screen today. It's not playing around with anything, it's not tactics. This is a clear commitment at the moment where we as a management team can go do. And of course, we always try to do better, but I think it would be unwise at the beginning of the year based on all the facts we have in our hands to try and to give a better outlook than what we can see in a challenging budget.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on royalty income and also expense. On the royalty income line it strikes me that for the full year you have shown for Roche Pharma an increase from 391 to 900 million. I appreciate that in the first half we have seen a couple of one-time items, 130 million from Glaxo, 80 million from Abbott, 60 million another disposal gain. But royalty income continues to be very strong in the second half as well, at least 150 maybe 200 million more than that expected. And could you tell us to what extent that is sustainable? Also on the royalty expense line although we track obviously the royalties that you pay to third parties very well based on third party disclosure. Royalty expense as well was on the low end, so you paid less royalties than expected and we're obviously perfectly aware of Tamiflu swings. Yeah. Could you comment on those two items please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Marcel. Ian would you like to answer the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sure, let me get my numbers for you. On the royalty result if you have a look in the financial review for both Pharma and Diagnostics, you'll see a breakdown of the major move that's there. I think in the second half there was a significant transaction with Actavis with some products that we were selling and the amount you've seen there for 2007, that's just the first part of that transaction. There is a second part of that that will close in 2008. If you take that out into the royalty line you do see, that's obviously regular sustainable income. I think, based on what we're currently seeing, we'll carry to model that going forward for Pharma. If you put approximately 3% of sales into Diagnostics about 1% you will be in the right range there. And on the Pharma side for the product disposals, as we said, there is a second half of this transaction with Actavis that comes in 2008. So there will be something in the first half of 2008 there as well. And there will doubtless be other transactions. Bill's team is actively looking at...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the important thing Marcel is, this is &#x2013; there is nothing unusual. We've not sold extra crown jewels or something. We haven't pulled any white rabbits out of a hat, but the normal management of the business and normal sell off of some of the old tail products. We also had during the year some one-off hits which we haven't forecast for like Viracept which cost us about 135 million. We've got significant projects like Project Forward and the computerization in Europe. So, some of these are non-repeatable costs, but there is nothing unusual in the background here. And the other thing maybe to point out is that &#x2013; out of some of the income that we've generated from this, we actually been putting a lot of it back into some of the investments for the future. If you took the summation of THP, Alnylam and some of the product licensing in that also had an outflow of about 700 million although it doesn't show up in the P&amp;L. So there is a fair amount of churn that's there, but nothing unusual.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of product questions and one financial. Firstly on Tamiflu, clearly taking a slowdown for this year, just wonder if you could &#x2013; if you are willing Bill to give us any thought process on '09 and beyond in terms of how we think about reorder rates, perhaps the shelf life and product ends et cetera? Secondly on the GLP-1, if effectively you are not looking at dosing beyond the once a week now, I just wanted to check on that. On Rituxan, just wonder if you could comment on the headline dates we've seen from SERENE in terms of the dose effect being the same at the higher marketed dose and the lower dose, <mark type="inaudible" /> what you thought the impact that may be? And then the final financial question, just on the Pharma underlying COGS line before all the royalty <mark type="inaudible" /> and classic profit share, you've seen an increase in second half versus first half of  around 100 basis points. Just wondered whether there was anything behind that. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sachin, I'll take the product questions and just let Ian try and collect thoughts about how your question raises on the royalty revenues. Tamiflu, difficult to predict, what you have is the planet is no more prepared probably than it was a few years ago. It's got a few hundred million treatment courses around the world and that's about it. WHO still recommend that this needs further work. Member governments are probably at the moment not feeling the heat of the kitchen. They don't feel the changes of government in France, change of Prime Minister in the United Kingdom, election year in United States. A lot of this depends upon the political heat and how people feel they really need to move forward. So what we are trying to give you is a line of sight that says what do we know that we've got in the system as goods to be delivered. We are also mindful that this is a bit like selling an insurance policy and that some governments, probably some of the first to come up might be an Australia, one or two others that were early movers in this area. Where we assign shelf life could come up for renewal.</p>
          <p>We have already seen the United States do a computer simulation, and wish to extend the shelf life which they can do. They would be overruling our official shelf life but they can do that. Fascinating that they are prepared to do it on Tamiflu, but on every other product we have to do real time stability, but that's where they are. For some governments, we are proposing some form of rework where we would take back the bulk and revalidate and re-date and have a service fee for that. But this is a business model that we've no experience of yet, no orders and therefore when we get closer to 2009 I'll be happy to give you an answer of what we do see into 2009.</p>
          <p>But for now we've just, and in the last few years we've really just been taking it on a year-by-year basis. For GLP-1, yes, we are really focusing at the moment on once per week with the formulation we've got. For Rituxan the SERENE result, here this is the first of a series of clinical trials to read out and indeed some of these studies are viewed that we will aggregate the data before we come to conclusions either on efficacy or on safety. So it's a bit premature to make any predictions on the role of the two dosages. And any forward royalties Ian, sorry to do this to you.</p>

          <p>Yes, Sachin, was it royalty income or royalty expense you are looking at?</p>

        <plist>

          <p>Yeah, we do have the impact of the Viracept recall in 2007 and that's mostly in the first half. So that is something that's in 2007 that's not in 2006, obviously if you are looking at an underlying one that's something we hope will be in 2008. I think on the whole manufacturing, there is a constant effort to look at cost efficiencies and so on and rationalize that.</p>

          <p>Hello. Firstly &#x2013; first question regarding tax. You've explained that the ongoing tax rate should be a little bit lower. What I'm trying to understand is how much of the '07 tax benefit was the benefits you got from places like Germany and France? Secondly, on Herceptin on the HERA two year's study, any kind of handle as to when we might be getting data on I think the potential benefit of two years of Herceptin over one. And lastly just on rituximab, how are you going to position rituximab with Actemra because with <mark type="inaudible" /> very good data on Rituxan and sort of Actemra seems to be competing in the same place. How you are going to position those two molecules in the market in the same place? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Actually with regards to the tax rate for Roche <mark type="inaudible" /> from now on that we keep the tax rate in the 15 to 16% on an ongoing basis. Now, of course, you have to respect that Genentech is <mark type="inaudible" /> share of the profits of the whole group and at the moment also they did a nice job with tax credits this year or last year or into '07. So they have a considerably higher tax rate overall. So, the mix will actually drive the group tax rate out, up even if Roche core stays at a highly competitive and reasonable level of 15 to 16%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now just on the two product questions, Herceptin the follow on in the HERA study, which as you rightly point out, we're looking to see is there an incremental benefit out of a second year of therapy. This as a continuation is still under the mandate of the Drug Safety Monitoring Advisory Board, it's event driven and therefore the best we can predict at the moment is that sometime this year, next year there will be an interim analysis and we will hear has it reached an end point or not. So, it's really event driven and difficult to predict.</p>
          <p>In terms of rheumatoid arthritis, maybe we can touch on this again this afternoon, if you're with us. But, the short version would be, if you look at the ACR70, in other words people that get a 70% improvement in their symptomology with rheumatoid arthritis. This is principally about one in five. So, that's a rather dissatisfied area of medicine. What we are bringing to play here are two unique and different mechanisms of action. We know that, for example, giving MabThera after a first round of anti-TNF, we are seeing an incremental benefit for people that is greater than going on to a second round of an anti-TNF.</p>
          <p>There will be different profiles that will develop between the products both in terms of some of their efficacy signals and of some of their side effects. This may make it more or less suitable for certain subgroups. For example in today's world with essentially only the three anti-TNFs and yet a black-box warning for tuberculosis. I would put it to you if there was an alternative that didn't have a problem in the lungs then people with a lung problem, bronchitis or emphysema, you would put on to something else rather than an anti-TNF.</p>
          <p>So, I think it will be more on that basis, right now. Mid-term, the dream ticket here is to try and find some form of array that can signal responder, non-responder. At the moment there is no compelling hypothesis, but as we, for example, with Actemra we took samples from essentially all 4,000 patients &#x2013; tissue, serum. We are looking a responder, non-responder to see either hypothesis that could develop and that this could lead to some further segmentation policy working with our colleagues in Roche Diagnostics. Now this may be another five years, I think until then in a dissatisfied area of medicine it will be on the label and efficacy and side effects, what are the more appropriate segments to look for. That's the short version.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a question about longer term margins. You've talked about higher R&amp;D, and that's gone up by about a percentage point of sales. And you are pretty much at the top of the industry now. Can you give us a sense of where you think that will go, is there an increase this year &#x2013; you've got a number of drugs going into Phase III, but those programs will feasibly last a few years. Is this rising element of R&amp;D as a percentage of sales something we should expect for the next couple of years? And an allied question to that is more about additional infrastructure. Are there are other things that you need to start to get ready as you move much more towards primary care-type drugs than wholly specialist oncology drugs. And could that start to impact your margin as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jo. I'll get out my crystal ball. You are absolutely right, there is an element here that is needs driven. What are the size and the complexity of the studies and we do what we need to do. We are also as you rightly pointed out in a phase where there is a much stronger preoccupation in specialty care than there is in primary care. As we see these products develop and as many of you've heard me before, we will look at, what we need to do to be successful. If that's GLP-1, which is a once weekly injection, it is more likely to be initiated by the endocrinologist with the follow-on treatment administrated by a primary care physician. What is the size that we need, that will depend upon the size of the competitors that we are up against at that time and the noisiness of the market. We know that with a lot of hungry companies around at the moment, short-term co-promotion deals are also a possibility. That's a noisy share of voice market. But I don't fear so much on the SG&amp;A side of life, that we are in good shape as we move forward and in fact rather in impeccable proportion now that we're looking at in our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>In terms of mid-term R&amp;D, this is a much more difficult one to forecast. We go by the assets that we've got in our hands. We know it's an industry, knowledge is rising exponentially. But, it's still looking for the same needle in the haystack. It's just a bigger haystack. So, the mid-term perspective for R&amp;D expenditures, I think it would be prudent to expect Roche to continue to be at the high end of the investment of the industry. We &#x2013; this is at the heart of what we do. And &#x2013; what does that do falling down to the market and this will really depend year-by-year. It's &#x2013; I can't give you just a guidance outlook as such. I think at your start of the comments, we have got ourselves to the top tier of the industry. And I think you should expect us to play in the top tier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean to you we were very careful in analyzing any single result into '07. And the good news is all our successes also in oncology are data driven. It's really the data set which matters and therefore you have been to ASCO. You know that oncology, where we actually at the moment have 50% more or less of our Pharma sales and profits, turned into an extremely competitive environment. The good new is actually that we are still not suffering to a significant extent by direct competition. But this is also due to the excellent dataset on all our key oncology products and we would be stupid not to push the expansion of this data know-how aggressively ahead also to keep our lead in this field. And as I've mentioned before at the same time the results in autoimmune diseases are so encouraging that we are broadening our studies there and in addition nothing has failed in the metabolic areas. I am saying probability wise we are at the moment in a territory where the models with Monte Carlo simulations have not told us that we would be because the probability would have been that some of these assays should have failed due to just statistics. But the good news is they happened and I consider this much better news than if we would have short term margin gains because we have nothing to invest into in R&amp;D.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking my question. A quick one, Actemra, there are no new indications in the R&amp;D budget going forward. Can you explain your thinking and whether we will see any new indications for Actemra?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent question Kevin. Yes, from first principle this interesting anti-IL-6 mechanism has a multiplicity of possibilities in medicine. What we did unashamedly was to really focus first of all on the main event of rheumatoid arthritis, but the team is now due to come back within the coming weeks actually to our Life Cycle Committee and to discuss how we prioritize and which indications we should look at next. There is everything from multiple myeloma to anemia correction to it's role in transplantation. There is a whole plethora of areas that we could take it and we will &#x2013; once we've had those discussions and we've mapped out a plan, we will be happy to share that with you as to where we plan to take Actemra next.</p>
