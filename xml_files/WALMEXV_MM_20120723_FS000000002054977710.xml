          <p>Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us today for Walmart de M&#xE9;xico Centroam&#xE9;rica earnings call to review the second quarter of the year 2012.</p>
          <p>Here with me is Scot Rank, our Chief Executive Officer for Walmart de M&#xE9;xico Centroam&#xE9;rica. I'm glad to report an overall good quarter driven by stability improvement in Mexico. I will turn it over to Scot to go over the results.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Rafael and good afternoon to everyone. In the second quarter, Mexico delivered solid profitability with improvements in gross margin and a strong discipline in expenses. Let's take a closer look at some of the key performance metrics for the quarter in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Total sales for Mexico grew 10.3% while comparable store sales increased 3%. Comparable store sales were below our expectations, so we are reinforcing the four key strategies to drive same store sales that we established at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>These strategies are: one, price leadership, we're investing in prices and overall price gaps are in line with our objectives. Two, win in traffic departments, we had mixed performance, so we are reinforcing the departments that are not performing according to our expectation. Three, modular execution, modulars need to be a greater source in growing sales. And four, supply, we need to improve inventory management and maximize product availability on the shelf.</p>
          <p>We had stock outs in May that we corrected in June, but we ended the month with high levels of inventories based on a higher sales expectation. Our merchandising team is working with our replenishment and logistics teams to ensure we have a consistent efficient flow of merchandise.</p>
          <p>Gross profit in Mexico increased 12%, improving margins by 40 basis points compared to last year. Improvement was mainly driven by lower shrink and better negotiations with suppliers. Our company leveraged operating expenses this quarter. Last year, we had challenging second quarter in terms of expenses as a result of anticipated investments. While this quarter, we not only reverted that trend, but we are delivering on our productivity initiatives and reducing cost per average square meter by 2.3%.</p>
          <p>We had good performance in key items such as associate productivity. The bank continues to show significant progress, supplier and consumer loans doubled, and we reached 419,000 credit card, 1.7 times what we had a year ago. Deposits amounted to MX$3.8 billion, 2.4 times the amount that we had at the end of the second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>As a result of gross margin improvement and good expense control on our retail business in Mexico, EBITDA increased by 14.8%, which nicely compares with the 10.3% increase in sale.</p>
          <p>Banco Walmart also delivered improvements at EBITDA level, so EBITDA for Mexico including retail and bank increased by 16.3%.</p>
          <p>Overall, we are pleased with Mexico's profitability with operating income and EBITDA growing faster than sales. Total income for Mexico increased 10.4% or MX$7.9 billion to MX$84.3 billion for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Gross margin grew 12.4% higher than sales growth and expenses grew 9%. I believe we have set the groundwork for the rest of the year, and our ability to continually find ways to reduce operating expenses and improve productivity means we can continue to invest in price leadership. Second quarter EBITDA grew 16.3% to MX$8.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, let's review highlights for our operation in Central America. There are 606 stores converted into Walmart Systems and 20 stores in El Salvador that remain to be converted. With regards to distribution centers, we have converted Costa Rica and Nicaragua. We will finish integrating distribution systems by mid-2013.</p>
          <p>We are also in the process of implementing supporting systems. These are key tools that provide visibility and that together with the training programs we're putting into practice for our merchants, will allow us to start taking advantage of the level of information that Walmart Systems provide.</p>
          <p>Without effective inventory management, we missed sales and added costs that showed up in markdowns. The leadership team in Central America is taking the strategic steps to strengthen the consistency of our execution to reach our long-term goals.</p>
          <p>In Central America, overall sales increased 7.5% and comp sales were up 0.4% on a constant currency basis. We remain committed to growth in Central America. EDLP and item merchandising drive comp sales growth and new stores drive total sales growth.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we reduced inventory levels in Central America by 12%. This was achieved via aggressive markdowns that impacted gross margin. We continue to work on the underlying processes required to deliver sustainable, solid inventory management in Central America. The level of inventory that we need to markdown remains high and so we expect this negative trend in gross margin to continue during the third quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>Central America's second quarter total income was MX$14.2 billion, MX$2.6 billion more than last year. This represents a 22.9% increase in peso terms or a 7.5% increase on a constant currency basis. Gross margin was down 110 basis points as a result of pricing investments and markdowns to lower inventory levels.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter, expenses grew at a slower rate than sales, resulting in 30 basis points of leverage. EBITDA was down 18.7% on a constant currency basis, as a result of the decline in gross margin. We recognize that Central America will take time to improve, but we feel confident about our business strategies and our ability to drive better results from the business.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll ask Rafael to provide consolidated results and more of the financial details. Rafael?</p>

          <p>Our consolidated total income for the quarter increased 12%. As you know, one of our key financial metrics is to grow EBITDA faster than sales growth. EBITDA for the second quarter of this year grew 14.7%, which exceeded our sales growth of 12%. We achieved this objective by increasing gross margin more than sales in Mexico and a disciplined expense management in both Mexico and Central America. Our company will remain very focused on expense leverage.</p>
          <p>Our financial position remains very strong. As of the second quarter of the year 2012, our cash position amounted to approximately MX$20 billion, 25% more than last year. Year-to-date, we have invested MX$5 billion in fixed assets, and returned MX$9.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>Inventories increased 26% versus last year as a result of 361 new stores opened during the last 12 months, while accounts payable to suppliers increased 24%. Accounts receivable from the Banco Walmart are fully funded by deposits from customers.</p>
          <p>Our earnings performance continues to translate into strong cash generation. Over the last 12 months to June, we generated <mark type="indiscernible" /> (9:13) from our operations, plus MX$581 million from negative working capital requirements. Our priority for cash remain growth and return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We invested MX$16.3 billion in fixed assets, paid dividends in cash for MX$9.6 billion, repurchased company shares for MX$3.3 billion and paid taxes for MX$8.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date, we have added a total of 1.5 million square feet through 111 units, 104 of them in Mexico and 7 in Central America. We opened 70 discount stores, 26 Bodegas, 3 Walmarts, 6 Sam's, 2 Supermarkets, 2 Suburbias and 2 restaurants.</p>
          <p>Now, I will turn it back to Scot to make some additional comments.</p>
