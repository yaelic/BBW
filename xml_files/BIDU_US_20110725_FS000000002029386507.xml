          <p>Hello, and thank you for standing by for Baidu's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to your host for today's conference, Victor Tseng, Baidu's Investor Relations Director.</p>

          <p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to Baidu's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. We distributed Baidu's second quarter 2011 earnings release earlier today. You can find a copy of the press release on the company's website, as well as on Newswire services.</p>
          <p>Today, you will hear from Robin Li, Baidu's Chief Executive Officer and Jennifer Li, Baidu's Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, Robin and Jennifer will answer your questions.</p>
          <p>Before we proceed, please note that the discussion today will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in our public filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 20-F.

          <p>I will now turn the call over to Baidu's CEO, Robin Li.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to today's call. I'm pleased to tell you that our top and bottom-line results as well as margins were all extremely strong in the second quarter. This performance was largely driven by increases in overall traffic and ARPU. Our customers continued to spend more of their marketing budget with us.</p>
          <p>Baidu is at the center of China's increasingly sophisticated Internet market, and our efforts to foster an ecosystem around that are paying off. The results can be seen in many areas, like e-commerce, where we have been a major beneficiary of the recent group-buys spending trend.</p>
          <p>At a heart of this ecosystem strategy is box computing, which constantly improves user experience by incorporating dynamic data, content and applications directly into search results. Specifically, our open applications platform is progressing well. I'm proud to record that there's many developers taking advantage of these offerings. We now generate about 20 million clicks per day in less than one year of the platform's launch.</p>
          <p>Social search features also remain a big part of Baidu's user experience. Baidu Post-Bar and Baidu Knows maintained healthy growth rates. We have added a lot of new features to make Post-Bar easier to use and sleeker, while increasing social interaction between users.</p>
          <p>Our large and expanding social search user base provides us a solid foundation for socially flavored products moving forward. Recently, we've added Baidu ting!, our social product for music. Baidu ting! allows users to find, listen to, and manage their music.</p>
          <p>We are embedding features for users to share and personalize music files to enable social interactions. I'm proud to report that Baidu ting! has gained support from virtually all major music labels, including EMI, Universal Music, Warner Brothers, and Sony Music. We expect this service to connect users through a large database of both international and Chinese songs.</p>
          <p>Complementing these internal initiatives, we've made a number of strategic investments and partnerships. Earlier this month, we announced a new partnership with Microsoft Bing for English language search. And last week we began displaying Bing's top organic results on our pages for most of the English queries we get.</p>
          <p>We have bolstered our landing page strategy with strategic partners and investments in premium virtual players. Our objective is to ensure our users the same great experience after they click through our search results to the most popular virtual websites. As part of this strategy, we have a partnership with CRIC to drive the real estate vertical, and have invested in QiYi to gain a foothold in the online video space. I'm happy to report that QiYi now has more than 160 million monthly unique visitors.</p>
          <p>We have more recently expanded to travel search through our investment in Qunar. This will provide users with an even better experience in the sector that has long been one of our most popular query verticals. For example, shortly, we will launch enhanced hotel related content with Qunar. When users search for hotels, we will serve Qunar information at the top of our result page if it is relevant.</p>
          <p>After clicking through to Qunar they will be met with the same high quality information on the landing page. Each vertical partner in our landing page strategy shares the characteristics of having developed a premium database of content. This high quality partnerships enable us to monetize related traffic more efficiently. We are enabling searching and accessing rich information and making the decision to transact a similar process with the landing page strategy.</p>
          <p>In terms of monetization in the second quarter, we continued to see increases in customer spending. Our customers benefited from improvements in our web search monetization platform relating to key word coverage, clickthrough rates, quantity of paid clicks, and a growing understanding of search engine marketing.</p>
          <p>I also want to highlight that our revenue growth is driven more by growth in paid clicks than by click price appreciation.</p>
          <p>We also benefited from strong momentum in e-commerce. First, the online retail sector continued to see triple-digit growth. Second, spending by group buying sites increased rapidly in the past quarter. This was a main driver for our outperforming guidance this past quarter. Having said that, we are seeing broad-based healthy revenue contributions across all industry verticals.</p>
          <p>We have also recently upgraded our front-end customer interface. This streamlines the purchasing process from more than 15 steps down to a simple 5 steps. The easier navigation benefits all customers, and is particularly important for SMEs, who typically do not have sophisticated in-house marketing teams.</p>
          <p>As mentioned during the last earnings conference call, we continue to develop our back-end CRM system to improve the sales process for our customers. Also, we are making improvements in the structure and quality of our customer acquisition and service teams to provide our customers with the most efficient experience possible.</p>
          <p>On the customer acquisition side, we had a successful 157-city search engine marketing tour and will continue this effort to develop as a market.</p>
          <p>Encouragingly, our box computing initiative is beginning to demonstrate its revenue potential. Our partnership with BitAuto, China's leading auto-related information website, is an example of how we can monetize the open data platform within the box computing context. When the user searches for Chevrolet Proof, for example, our open data platform will retrieve and display dynamic information in BitAuto's database.</p>
          <p>Another example of box computing monetization is in the travel vertical. For a specific flight search, we offer users information provided by four different content providers under separate tabs. Some of these tabs can be sold at a set price to only the highest of quality and most relevant websites.</p>
          <p>While box computing monetization remains at its very early stage of iteration, we see potential for revenue growth. We will remain highly selective in choosing content partners so that we can provide users the best possible experience.</p>
          <p>Over the past 10 years, Baidu has achieved tremendous success by developing the right strategies and executing.</p>
          <p>Looking to our second decade, our organization is far larger and more complex than ever. In response, we have designed a new corporate structure. Our four new functions consolidate reporting lines. This will create greater efficiencies and drive more innovation. This structure will spur new technologies and products that will foster our growth in the years ahead. We will continue to invest happily in all functions for our management to succeed.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'm excited to tell you about our Sixth Annual Baidu World Forum, which will be held on September 2 in Beijing. It is an opportunity for Baidu to bring together some of the best <mark type="ph" /> and diverse (11:41) industry experts in Baidu's loyal user base together and share our strategic initiatives and discuss China Internet trends. I look forward to seeing many of you there.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jennifer for financial highlights.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robin. Hello, everyone. As Robin mentioned, we achieved excellent results in the second quarter with ARPU and customer growth driving overall growth. The investment in R&amp;D, our talent pool and network infrastructure will continue to be priorities. We plan to invest even more aggressively in these areas in the second half of the year. These investments will drive growth and innovation and ultimately deliver long-term returns.</p>
          <p>On strategic investments, we closed the Qunar investment last week. Qunar is growing healthily. With the transaction, we will consolidate its financials starting Q3. Given its current size, we do not expect material impact on our fundamental P&amp;L structure.</p>
          <p>QiYi is ramping up nicely. As Robin mentioned, we and our investment partners will continue to support the company. Capital contribution will be made in the near-term. From Baidu's standpoint, the investment will continue to be recognized through equity accounting method. As QiYi is loss making, any cash contribution we provide will go through our P&amp;L in the income or loss from equity method investment line, which is below the operating profit line.</p>
          <p>We do not expect the investment to materially affect our results of operations for the third quarter or full year of 2011. We will evaluate from time to time what is the optimal strategy to pursue in our support for QiYi.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at the financial highlights for the quarter. All amounts mentioned are in RMB, unless otherwise noted.</p>
          <p>Online marketing revenues for the second quarter of 2011 were RMB3.4 billion, a 78% increase year-over-year. Baidu had around 298,000 active online marketing customers in the second quarter of 2011, a 17% increase from the corresponding period in 2010 and a 9% increase from the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Revenue per online marketing customer in the second quarter reached approximately RMB11,500, a 53% increase from the corresponding period in 2010 and 29% increase from the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Traffic acquisition cost as a component of cost of revenue was RMB269 million, a 7.9% of total revenues, as compared to 9.7% in the corresponding period in 2010 and 8.2% in the first quarter of 2011. This decrease reflects traffic mix driven by stronger organic traffic growth.</p>
          <p>Contextual ads business is an important initiative for us and requires higher payout to Baidu Union partners. As we gain more traction in this business, we expect traffic acquisition cost as a percent of revenues to increase.</p>
          <p>Bandwidth cost as a component of cost of revenue were RMB147 million, representing 4.3% of total revenue, compared to 3.5% in the corresponding period in 2010. This increase mainly reflects increase in server capacity to accommodate traffic growth, new product services and higher computing requirements. Depreciation cost, as a component of cost of revenue, were RMB143 million, representing 4.2% of total revenues, compared to 4.4% in the corresponding period in 2010.</p>
          <p>Selling, general and administrative expenses in Q2 was RMB378 million, an increase of 42% year-on-year. This increase primarily reflects increase to personnel cost and marketing expense. Research and development expense were RMB299 million, an 88% increase from the year ago period. This increase primarily reflects increase to head count.</p>
          <p>Share based compensation expenses, which were allocated to related operating cost and expense line items increased in aggregate to RMB35 million in the second quarter of 2011 from RMB22 million in the corresponding period in 2010.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was RMB1.9 billion, a 91% increase year-on-year. Total head count as of June 31, 2011 was about 12,800, roughly 1,100 more than the previous quarter. Income tax expense was RMB286 million for the second quarter. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 14.9%, compared to 14.4% in the corresponding period in 2010.</p>
          <p>Net income was over RMB1.6 billion, a 95% increase from the corresponding period in 2010. Basic and diluted earnings per ADS for the second quarter of 2011 amounted to RMB4.68 and RMB4.67, respectively. Net income, excluding share-based compensation expenses, a non-GAAP measure, was about RMB1.7 billion, a 94% increase from the corresponding period in 2010. Basic and diluted earnings per ADS, excluding share-based compensation expenses, both non-GAAP measures, were RMB 4.78 and RMB 4.77, respectively.</p>
          <p>As of June 30, 2011, the company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of RMB10.3 billion. Net operating cash inflow and capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2011 were RMB2.08 billion and RMB387 million, respectively.</p>
          <p>Now, let me provide you with our top-line guidance for the third quarter 2011. We currently expect total revenue for the third quarter of 2011 to be between RMB3.95 billion and RMB4.05 billion, which would represent a 75.1% to 79.5% year-over-year growth. This forecast reflects Baidu's current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.</p>
          <p>I will now open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, morning. Congratulations on the strong quarter, and thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on the tax-revenue ratio. What was the reason for the slight decline in Q2, and what should be the trend going forward because Jennifer mentioned it could increase? Just trying to understand the magnitude of the changes. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Dick. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the decrease reflects basically the traffic mix driven by especially strong organic traffic growth. It's a very healthy trend, and we're happy to see this is a normal fluctuation as typically the traffic comes in the picture.</p>
          <p>I did mention the contextual ad business is an important initiative for us, and we are making a lot of efforts on that front and developing union partners to be part of the whole business. The business, contextual ad business itself, does require higher payout. So, to the extent the business tracks very well, you should expect a traffic acquisition cost to increase as a percent of total revenue.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, everyone. You mentioned that you're going to make some capital expenditures or capital investments in QiYi. Can you talk about what kind of &#x2013; what monetary amount that you're talking about in terms of &#x2013; and when that capital expenditure or investment will start? And second of all, you also mentioned that Qunar will be consolidated starting in Q3, and you said it's not that material. Can you identify what kind of revenue we should expect for the run rate for Qunar as well. And I have a follow-up. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the QiYi investment ,as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, is an important landing page strategy for us. QiYi offers high quality content, and within a short time of period it's tracking very well. Between Baidu and our investment partners, we plan to continue to support the company, and a cash contribution will be made in the near-term.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, the cash contribution will flow through our P&amp;L line item because we continue to account the investment in equity accounting methods and for because it's still loss-making given the competitive video landscape. Any investment we make in the loss that the venture generates, we will take our share of the loss to the P&amp;L line after the cash amount that we contribute. As I've indicated in the prepared remarks, we do not expect the there will be material impact on the P&amp;L side as a result of the contribution to the QiYi venture either in the third quarter or for the full year of 2011.</p>
          <p>For your Qunar question, in our guidance provided for Q3 we did incorporate the consolidated picture view as we provided the guidance. The vast majority of the strong Q3 guidance that we're providing is driven by the strong fundamentals of Baidu's core business. Qunar accounts for a very small amount, so it's very immaterial in the overall revenue guidance as well as in the overall P&amp;L structure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Can you comment on whether box computing is creating any site benefits that are helping monetization indirectly, which has better traffic retention or advertisers spending more to be more visible on the search results page, understanding that you're not aggressively monetizing that directly at this stage? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Catherine. I think you are very right. Box computing is generating benefits both in terms of user experience or traffic retention, and so has some certain kind of revenue potential. You can basically view the box computing infrastructure as a better way of displaying when thinking about revenue.</p>
          <p>It's a better way of displaying ads &#x2013; all kinds of different ways of displaying box computing results. In most cases, it's purely just to benefit the users. In some of the cases, it will benefit the advertisers or customers, too. So, we will do this kind of partnerships where we see fit going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I have a couple of questions. The first one is regarding your agreement with the major music labeled companies. Could you share with us if there will be any cost for music rights going forward; and if so, where will cost item appear? Will it be in the cost of services or sales and marketing? And then, could you also give us the top advertiser segments for the second quarter? Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hi, Eddie. It's Jennifer. As we have said in our press release, yes, we will be paying the record label companies some fee to incorporate their assets in our services. The amount itself is not significantly going to affect the cost picture. And for any fee that we're paying them, will go through the operational cost line item as part of the cost of revenue. So, it's in the gross margin picture.</p>
          <p>And in terms of your other question related to the top sectors for Q2 these mainly continues to be the typical ones namely medical, machinery equipment, education, travel and business service. And all these five top sectors, they account to a little over 50% of the total picture &#x2013; total revenue picture.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering on the &#x2013; you mentioned the e-commerce and also a group-buys advertising increasing. You didn't mention those in the top five. Did these two categories together represent over &#x2013; what percentage of revenues would these two groups together represent? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a &#x2013; established a way of looking at our business and define the industry sectors. Because the e-commerce business is emerging and growing very fast, it is just really take another angle and approach to look at our overall business. And when we look at e-commerce businesses, obviously, that includes online purchases, whether it's cyclical goods or services, things like travel for example. If you look at Ctrip, they are part of the travel vertical, and they're also part of the e-commerce platform that provides online services.</p>
          <p>So, we have separately tracked the e-commerce contribution in the overall growth rate to give us a better understanding of the trends as we are in the fast developing Internet space. We have not separately &#x2013; not to misguide you, we have not separately disclosed the percentage per se because it is just another angle to look at our industry sectors.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we have mentioned quarter-after-quarter that we're seeing triple digit growth in the e-commerce sector that continues to be very strong, but it's not a separate industry vertical that we will separately disclose.</p>

It looks like you did extremely well across the board for your margin profile this past quarter. You showed a significant reduction in terms of percentage of revenue for SG&amp;A, R&amp;D, et cetera. Just look forward in sort of intermediate term, how should we look at your margin progression going forward in terms of the further expansion from here?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Right. We delivered very strong Q2 performance and record high margins. It is a very strong quarter for us. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, aggressive investments will continue to be our priorities, particularly in the areas of R&amp;D, talent, network infrastructure and, frankly, office space as we need to accommodate more people.</p>
          <p>We're also investing very aggressively in the strategic partnership side. If you look at our historical margin patterns, second year &#x2013; second half of the year is typically expense heavy. R&amp;D expenses will be more heavily concentrated in the second half of the year. And if you look at near-term, in Q3 we'll have marketing events such as Baidu World. We'll also redouble our efforts in campus brand building efforts as coming to the recruiting season.</p>
          <p>So, expense will be particularly heavy in the second half of the year. In addition to that, some of the strategic investments that we mentioned, these ventures do not generally very high margins. So in total, if you look at the Q2 and Q3 margin relationships of last year that probably serves as a good reference.</p>

My first question is given that Baidu has done 150-city tour, and I remember that is bigger than last year's 100-city tour, do you see a fast pick-up of customer growth in the third quarter or towards the end of second quarter?

          <p>Hi, Eric. Yes, we continued our market education efforts this year. We have increased the coverage this year and ran a very successful marketing campaign. As the industry leader it's our responsibility to really develop the market and educate the customers the benefit of search engine marketing.</p>
          <p>From what we see, the campaigns are better run because we have a lot to learn over our first trial last year. And we are very pleased with the results in terms of customer acceptance and their understanding of our services and using search engine marketing as a very effective tool for them. So, on that front, I think we're very happy marketing campaign that we conducted this year. And that really helped our customer acquisition as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. And first let me congratulate on the strong quarter, and thanks for taking my questions. I have two brief questions, and one question is related to our third quarter guidance. It seems that in the industry and also in the country, we have very strong debate on the second half macro economy, and we see more and more SME are feel a lot of challenge in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:38) region like <mark type="ph" /> Guangzhou and Shenzhen (32:30); it seems there is a impact on Baidu's operations in the third quarter. So, I want to know what the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:48) is behind &#x2013; are we see brand advertisers are contributing more significantly to Baidu's operation than before? Yeah, that's my first question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I think Baidu's <mark type="ph" /> fenced (32:55) nature is relatively isolated from the manufacturer oriented economy in provinces like Zhejiang. You can probably tell that larger customers contribute more and more of our revenue mix, and those customers typically reside in the Tier 1 cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.</p>
          <p>Service oriented industries, especially group-buy and other things among our top five industries, education, medical or healthcare, those are very different from what you would see in the manufacturer oriented industries in the provinces you mentioned. So, I would say that our business is relatively isolated from that part of the macro economy. And I think, more importantly, that the paid search business is just too young. There are lots of growth opportunities for us. As long as we can execute well, we should be able to generate very good growth.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. You mentioned in your prepared remark that &#x2013; about the strong trending from large customers. And would you give us some more color about the ARPU differences between large and normal customers? Also, it would be very helpful if you could comment on the revenue contribution from large customers. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our customers, we really cover a very diverse pool of customers. And the customers' spending level can vary a lot. When we look at our large businesses, some of these customers spend tens of millions a year, and some of the SMEs can be very &#x2013; offer very long tail services, and they buy key words and spend maybe only a few hundred, a few thousand of RMB per year. So, we do have a very wide spectrum in terms of customer spending.</p>
          <p>But having said that, what we have said over the past few quarters is we continue to see strong spending from the large customers. They are particularly good at using the search engine marketing tools, and they see the kind of ROIs that can be generated from the Baidu platform. And therefore, they're spending more and more with us. And the contribution from large businesses continued to grow very strongly over the past quarter. It exceeded the SME business.</p>
          <p>But having said that, the SME continues to be the pretty vast majority of the revenue contribution. But we're particularly happy with the large customer adoption of our business platform and their contribution to our overall revenue picture.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you for taking my question. Another question just on the growth in advertisers. I guess I was a little surprised that the growth in advertisers in terms of year-over-year percentage and year-over-year absolute percentage of new advertisers was already slowing down. Can you talk about maybe where your priorities are as a company in terms of targeting larger advertisers versus building out more mass within the SMEs and the different initiatives there so to help us frame how we should be thinking about growth over the next few quarters or into the next year? And then, can we also just get the head count for the quarter in number of sales people?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the year-over-year growth in terms of number of customers, I think it does reflect the nature of our business. When we transformed from the <mark type="ph" /> legendary (37:28) system to Phoenix Nest, the system became much more complicated. And it did enable large advertisers or customers to do more, and coupled with the maturity of the market or large companies increasingly realized that they can benefit from search marketing. So, we were very busy serving lots of large customers.</p>
          <p>The vast majority of SMEs, it just take them longer to get used to this new system and fully take advantage of all the functions and features of our system.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we will continue to improve the customer experience online and do more handholding for our smaller customers. But at the end of the day, we will focus on what will benefit the company most in terms of revenue generation and profit, all that kind of things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Steve, to continue to add to Robin's point, we are doing a lot more to help the customers better use our platform. The customer base grew at a healthy rate of 17% year-on-year, and we're enhancing our sales and customer services and the educational process to help SMEs to master the features on our online marketing platform.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we upgraded our front-end interface. That's making it easier for the customers, particularly the SMEs, and to make the whole process for decision making and maneuvering down from &#x2013; down to 5 steps instead of the original 15. So, we are doing all kinds of things to try to make the sophisticated system more user-friendly.</p>
          <p>And the market potential continues to be huge, and we are doing our efforts, as we mentioned, in developing the market; at the same time, we are redoubling our efforts to better service the customers. But as Robin mentioned, it generally takes a few quarters for the customers to really take benefit, take advantage of the better system and more streamlined process that they can see.</p>
          <p>In terms of your second question, the number of sales people for Q2 was &#x2013; at the end of Q2 was 6,300.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you. Thank you for giving me the chance for a question. I have two questions. Number one, Baidu has already introduced a Baidu Browser. Can you share with us the overall strategy regarding client-side software and desktop application on both the PC side and mobile side? And any details regarding future product development roadmap would be very helpful.</p>
          <p>Second question is regarding box computing. We would like to know some more details with respect to the coverage, the percent of queries that are covered by box computing. Management mentioned some time ago it was 50% before. We would like to know what is the percentage right now. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Cynthia. On the client-side software, we do think Browser is a very important distribution channel for our business. In China, the browser market is relatively fragmented. People have developed a habit of installing their preferred browser on the desktops. So, we are trying to meet that part of the user needs. Once a user installs a browser controlled by us, they will be able to generate more search traffic. This is true both on the PC side and also on the mobile side. On the mobile side we also have a mobile browser serving our users.</p>
          <p>In general, we just view the client-side software as a way of distributing Baidu services. Most people are still used to go to Baidu website and do their things, but there are a certain percentage of users, maybe 10% or less, they have developed a habit of using client-side software to do all kind of things. And we just view that as a distribution. And sometimes we'll do it by ourselves developing our own client-side software. Sometimes we'll just partner with those client-side software developers and share revenue with them.</p>
          <p>On the box computing coverage, right now it's roughly 70%. 70% of the search result pages contains box computing results.</p>

          <p>Hello, everybody. Congratulations on a great quarter, and thanks for taking my questions. Could you talk about revenue contribution this quarter from your initiatives other than core search, like contextual, online video, e-commerce and so on?

They are albeit &#x2013; are, as I mentioned, an important area for us to grow future revenue possibilities. They're growing at a faster speed, although it's a smaller base. But they are growing at a faster speed and is tracking, it's taking good tractions in terms of growth projection, the speed of growth.</p>
          <p>The overall contribution from this line is very small of the total picture. But as I mentioned, they are growing faster, and over time they'll become meaningful.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. And I'll add my congratulations at the impressive revenue growth. And I guess on that note, in terms of the overall search, can you continue to drive the ARPU higher? And if so, I guess what changes in the future do you see to the platform &#x2013; I guess you don't call it Phoenix Nest anymore, but to the platform that you can make in the next year to continue this high double-digit growth? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Gene. From what we have seen or heard from our customers, especially the larger ones, they still allocate the majority of their ad budget to offline advertising, while the ROI &#x2013; or the performance for online advertising, especially search, is much better. So, we do expect this kind of trend will continue, so the ARPU should continue to grow.</p>
          <p>Internally, we do see a lot of room for improvement, both in terms of the bidding mechanism as well as tools to help advertisers to better manage their advertising campaign. There are a lot of, lot of things we can do. And, again, the marketing is in its early stage. We do expect significant growth going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Number one, it seems that every Q2 your ARPU enjoys very strong growth. Is it partly driven by the seasonality, and should we apply this to the future years as well?</p>
          <p>And secondly, apart from the online video, travel and recruitment, those verticals that you have already made significant investments and progress, what will be the next vertical that are you eyeing &#x2013; or you change the mix investment needs? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The strong Q2 ARPU performance, there is a strong element of seasonality. Typically Q1 is a slower season because of Chinese New Year, and you will see a big sequential increase in the second quarter from a total revenue standpoint. And total revenue contribution typically, of course, comes from both the ARPU growth as well as number of customers growth. Both metrics will continue to have a lot of potential going forward. So, seasonal pattern will tell us that we should continue to see strong ARPU, as well as some step up in terms of customer growth in the future.</p>
          <p>In terms of the strong verticals, yes those verticals that you mentioned, we have established either a partnership or investment in those areas. We have, as we mentioned, also in the real estate area, formed a partnership to help us deliver a better user experience, overall user experience. The important &#x2013; these are important vertical areas. Things like auto will continue to develop. Financial services will continue to develop.</p>
          <p>So, there are &#x2013; our landing pages strategy helps to cover the strong and important verticals, and our objective is to form a strong partnership working with others in different form and deliver a high quality user service experience.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We do see value in the vertical search areas. That's why we make partnerships and investments in a number of companies in this sector. The value of this <mark type="ph" /> now (54:20) is particularly the customized a lot of data. For example, for CRIC, they have a lot of realtor data in the second-hand homes or those kind of information that's more structured in the database.</p>
          <p>For in the case of Qunar, we have very large database of hotels that we work with that can provide up-to-date information such as per room night &#x2013; price per room night, those kind of information. We would like to integrate, tightly integrate this kind of information in our search results so that our users are better served. And on the other hand, because of the enhancement or the value those vertical search players can add to this kind of data, they deserve to make money from this.</p>
          <p>For very important verticals that we'd like to have certain kind of positioning in those leading companies to ensure that we do not lose the good user experience if they decide not to work with us in the future. So, these kind of investments or partnerships are win-win, and each party brings in their value. And at the end of day, it's better for our users.</p>

          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. The first one is just now, Jennifer, you mentioned that there's about 1,000 large customers in the country or so. So, could you comment a little bit what kind of roughly the coverage ratio that Baidu has already established relationship with?</p>
          <p>And my second question is related to what Robin just now mentioned about Baidu's interest in the social related businesses. So, in your view, do you think that this social networks, i.e. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:52) and Facebook-like type of SMS, today in China are the long-term mode of social networks, or Baidu is thinking about some other really innovative and completely landscape-shaking SMS mode in the future?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Gary. I'll take your first part of the question. The &#x2013; about 1,000 large customers, these, as I mentioned, are the branded advertisers. And they typically &#x2013; these are the large customers that basically all the advertising media platform will approach, and they will take advantage of those marketing platforms. So, we are probably not much different from a customer per say as compared to other media platforms.</p>
          <p>This &#x2013; it's more a matter of budget allocation. So, historically, these players will spend a lot more on the traditional media side. And with the Internet and particularly search engines, we offer target performance &#x2013; targeted performance based marketing platform. And we offer a full bundle set of services to these, and they are increasingly allocating more at budgets to our platform.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the social front, our take is basically embrace and expand. We have added a lot of social features in our existing products such as the apps feature, the share feature. We also have feed in some of our products like Post-Bar. We think in the future there are a lot of things we can do starting from our core offering web search or search related.</p>
          <p>We'd like to perfectly combine the people relationship with content relationship. In some cases, users are looking for content. In some other cases, users looking for relationship. We'd like to perfectly combine the two and give user at home that they depend on. So, we are indeed working on some new products that will better satisfy users' needs. In China, there is no dominant SMS in this market. That give us a very good opportunity to emanate and lead in markets like this.</p>

          <p>Hello, thanks very much for taking my follow-up question. Robin, my question is how far is Baidu towards monetizing its Map product? And given the strengths of showing group buying companies, how much of those advertising are being integrated with Baidu's Map product? Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Right now, the revenue from Map product is very insignificant. And we do not expect that to change in the near future, but Map is strategically important to Baidu, especially in the age of wireless Internet or mobile Internet. I'm not sure if we generate revenue from the group buying companies on the Map service, but it's not important.</p>
          <p>We're working on a better Map service continuously so that people can find better local information, people can get connected to nearby people who share similar interest or who knows each other. So, Map is not a revenue generator. It's not going to be in the near future, but it's very critical in our overall service landscape.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have a quick question for Robin. I think China e-commerce online advertising spending story has been with us for some time, and when do you think this segment growth will reach peak and start to slow down? Thanks.</p>

          <p>I think China's e-commerce market is still in its early stage. It took off much later than search. That's not in the case in the U.S., as you know. These days, there are a lot of companies get founded, traditional companies, brick and mortar companies starting to increase the e-commerce trend. And more importantly, consumers are developing a habit of buying online. So, we see tremendous momentum going forward, and more and more companies well realize that the best way to do e-commerce is through Baidu. So, we'll continue to benefit from this trend for the years to come.</p>
