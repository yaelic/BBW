          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kent. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2009 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Paris where the Schlumberger Limited board meeting took place yesterday.</p>
          <p>Before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request.</p>
          <p>Joining me for today's call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew's overview of the second quarter and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter's financial results. After the prepared statements, we will welcome your questions.</p>
          <p>And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter income from continuing operations excluding charges was $0.68 per share, down $0.10 sequentially and down $0.48, compared to the same quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>We continue to actively manage our cost base. In this regard, we have continued to reduce our head count which resulted in charges of $0.07 in the quarter, primarily relating to severance. Additionally, as a result of these workforce reductions, we were required to record a non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit curtailment charges in the quarter of $0.10. These head count reductions are expected to be largely completed by the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to the business segments, Oilfield Services second quarter revenue fell by 9% sequentially, while WesternGeco revenue increased 1%. Oilfield Services generated $1 billion in pre-tax operating income, down $233 million sequentially, with margins declining by 245 basis points to 20.6%.</p>
          <p>By area, Oilfield Services sequential pre-tax operating margins highlights were as follows. North America declined to 1% on the heavy pricing pressure across most of the area and the sharp drop is activity, primarily in U.S. Land and in Canada. The sequential margin decline is equally attributable to U.S. Land and Canada.</p>
          <p>Internationally, margins were at 25.1%, a decline of 170 basis points from Q1. Latin America decreased by 206 basis points to 17.6%, primarily due to a less favorable revenue mix, coupled with cost inflation in Brazil, currency revaluation losses and pricing pressure in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador and the impact of the lower activity in Venezuela/Trinidad &amp; Tobago. These decreases were partially offset by the increased IPM activity in Mexico/Central America.</p>
          <p>Europe/CIS/Africa margin was 24.2%, which was 172 basis points lower than last quarter, primarily due to the lower activity levels and less favorable revenue mix, Nigeria and Gulf of Guinea, west, and south Africa, and the North Sea. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Russia as a result of the improved activity levels. Finally, Middle East/Asia slipped 107 basis points to 32.1%, primarily as a result of the lower overall activity in the area.</p>
          <p>At WesternGeco, pre-tax income of $97 million reflected an increase in the pre-tax margins of 739 basis points to 17.3%. The increase was primarily due to higher multiclient sales and improved profitability in Marine, as cost reductions initiatives more than offset the impact of the lower revenue.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate [ETR], excluding charges was 18.2%, and including the charges, it was 19.8%. The rate was lower than last quarter due to the substantially lower proportion of pre-tax earnings in North America. The ETR for the year is expected to be in the lower 20s. As a reminder, the ETR is very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings, and as such, we may experience volatility on a quarterly basis.</p>
          <p>Net debt was $990 million at the end of the quarter, an improvement of $537 million from Q1. This improvement was driven by strong cash flows from operations. We ended the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash and investments on hand. In addition, $2.3 billion of committed debt facilities with commercial banks remained unused, and were available at the end of June.</p>
          <p>This, compared to short-term debt of only $1.6 billion, which includes $321 million of our convertible debentures, which are now classified as short-term. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $503 million of CapEx, $229 million of pension funding, and $186 million of acquisitions. We did not buy back any of our stock during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Oilfield Services CapEx is expected to approach $1.9 billion in 2009, while WesternGeco is now expected to reach $530 million, which includes approximately 225 million relating to the construction of seismic vessels. In summary, our balance sheet remains very strong, and provides us with a significant amount of financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>And now, I turn the conference over to Andrew.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Simon. Good morning, everybody. Schlumberger's second quarter revenue fell 7.8% sequentially to $5.53 billion, compared to the first quarter, the overall sequential rate of revenue decline slowed as a further precipitous drop in North America was offset by slowing rates of decline, and some recovery in other parts of the world, including Russia, where revenue recovered noticeably due to seasonal trends and improving activity.</p>
          <p>In North America, gas drilling in both the U.S. and Canada reached a five-year low, as demand remained weak and storage levels remained way above the seasonal averages. While production has begun to show some decline, and summer demand has been strong, it will still require a further substantial increase in demand, particularly in the industrial and power generation sectors to stimulate and sustain higher levels of drilling.</p>
          <p>Looking at the areas in detail and starting with North America, the U.S. Land GeoMarket recorded a further steep drop in revenues. The rig count declined approximately 27%, and as pricing continued to erode. Revenue in Canada also dropped significantly due to the impact of the seasonal spring break-up, the general reduction in land drilling activity, and the effect of significant pricing pressure.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, however, revenue fell more modestly as lower pricing and further weakening on the shelf drilling activity were partially offset by slightly higher deepwater activity.</p>
          <p>In the Latin American area, the Venezuela/Trinidad &amp; Tobago GeoMarket saw the sharpest sequential revenue decrease, as a result of lower activity and a revenue deferral pending finalization of certain contracts. This decrease, however, was somewhat offset by an increase in the Mexico and Central America GeoMarket, as integrated project management activity and efficiency both increased.</p>
          <p>Within Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue in Russia grew sequentially on the seasonal rebound of offshore activities in the East and on generally improved activity levels in both East and West Siberia. This growth was also supported through higher sales of Artificial Lift and Completions products.</p>
          <p>In North Africa, revenue grew from strong demand for Testing Services and Completions products. These positive factors, however, were more than offset by reduced demand for Drilling &amp; Measurements and Wireline Services in Nigeria and Gulf of Guinea and West, and southern Africa GeoMarkets in addition to lower Drilling &amp; Measurements and Well Services activities in the Caspian and North Sea GeoMarkets.</p>
          <p>Lower Schlumberger Information Solutions software sales, as well as reduced demand for Drilling &amp; Measurements and Wireline and Testing Technologies in Continental Europe also contributed to the overall area sequential revenue decline.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in the Middle East and Asia area, sequential revenue fell primarily due to lower activity in the Gulf GeoMarket, as well as in the East Mediterranean, Arabian, Indonesia, Australia/Papua New Guinea and India GeoMarkets. Pricing pressure also began to impact revenue across the area.</p>
          <p>These decreases, however, are partially offset by an increase in revenue in East Asia on strong exploration-related demand for Testing Services, Wireline and Well Services and a rebound in activity in the China/Japan/Korea GeoMarket following the winter slowdown in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>At WesternGeco, there was some recovery in multiclient sales both in North America and overseas, although, this together with increased activity in Land was offset by weaker Marine revenues. Marine pricing continued to decline due to excess capacity in the market. Several new Marine and Land contracts were booked during the quarter, giving better visibility on the next few months, however, multiclient sales remain difficult to forecast until there is better visibility on year-end oil prices.</p>
          <p>Against this background, we have continued to take action to right size our operations without diminishing our capacity to react to market changes. Overall, our operating cost base declined approximately $300 million, compared to the first quarter as cost reduction programs continued to be implemented.</p>
          <p>Careful management of both working capital and investment led to the liquidity improvement that Simon described. Our outlook for the remainder of 2009 assumes some stability, but no major increase in North American natural gas rig count before 2010 and as a result, service pricing will remain depressed.</p>
          <p>Overseas, further activity declines will occur, but will be limited while the pricing concessions made in the first half of the year will affect revenues in the second half. The current volatility in the oil price makes it unlikely that our customers will sanction any major increases in expenditure.</p>
          <p>We are aware that a number of projects are continuing to be postponed or canceled. We are also concerned that higher finding and development cost of new supply, coupled with lower oil and gas prices and more restricted credit markets are stifling investment flows. This situation if it persists will lead to inadequate supply when demand growth returns. The shape of the economic recovery beyond 2009, and the consequent recovery in oil and gas demand remain the determining factors for future activity increases.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, or good afternoon, in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kurt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, by &#x2013; at the end of the first quarter, you reference that this cycle was progressing very similar to prior cycle periods and that would lead you to reason that the international markets from a volume standpoint could lead lower into 2010. And I noticed in the commentary that you had here today, that your international reference points were really focused on the second half of 2009. So, I was wondering if you can kind of update us on your thoughts as to whether your thoughts have changed and if so how as you kind of look out beyond 2009 from an international volume standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think my thoughts have substantially changed. If there is an element of doubt in predicting beyond the end of the year, it is the fairly rapid recovery that's taken place in the oil price. As I said, in the comment this time, I think that there's too much volatility in the oil price at the moment to sanction much increase in spending. But if at the end of the year it persists at the higher end of the range that we've seen so far this year, then I do think that it might, if you like, not lead to the same reduction in activity next year that I was perhaps originally thinking of. But it is really, really does depend on where the oil price is at the end of the year and not where it is now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. I appreciate that color. Now, my follow-up is you made some explicit reference here to some deferrals of revenues in Venezuela, and we know obviously the mess that country has been, can you give us your updated view on what you see as the prospects of any recovery in Venezuela? And can you update us on the receivable situation there, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, during the quarter, we made very satisfactory progress on the receivables situation. And we also made considerable progress on the renewal of three major contracts but we were not able to book the revenue in the second quarter because the actual inking hasn't been done and therefore, there was a fairly large amount of revenue that was deferred to the third quarter.</p>
          <p>As to the overall levels of activity in Venezuela over the coming months, it's a little early for me to say what I think PDVSA is going to do. But certainly the general situation in terms of receivables and contracts has shown a marked improvement over where we were at the end of Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. We have a question now from the line of Michael LaMotte with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and good afternoon, Andrew, Malcolm and Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Michael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can ask quickly on the OGX contract and maybe talk about the differences between this structure and a typical IPM contract and whether or not there are other offshore opportunities like this out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the difference is that whereas what we are providing in the OGX is very similar to what with we would provide in a classic IPM, obviously, the size of the amount and the risk involved means that we cannot take the same risk as we do in land IPM contracts. So, this is somewhere between IPM and bundled services. So, there is not, perhaps the same scope for incremental due to performance, but the actual rate of remuneration is a lot better than it would be in a basic IPM contract. And we are providing a lot of the technical services around the development as we would do in IPM. And yes, there are other opportunities of this type.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of market size, if I think about IPM opportunities on land versus this type of thing offshore, is this an emergent market, is this a big market that is just &#x2013; you get a little bit of share into? What's the penetration of...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are two. So, firstly, I don't think this is a huge market. It's obviously a very profitable market because it is deepwater. I think that the market falls into two types of market. The first is the OGX type where there is a definite wish to harness the Schlumberger technical expertise. The second type where this occurs is the remote market where a customer doesn't have any infrastructure whatsoever and rather than building a complete infrastructure &#x2013; so this would typically be more in exploration or delineation than development &#x2013; they will ask Schlumberger to manage a lot more of the process than we would in a normal offshore operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Second question, on Russia, I'm intrigued by your comments that the improvement was not just seasonal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Care to elaborate and perhaps talk about how you would characterize Russia today in the recovery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that to be honest, there were two events which are not seasonal. The first is the fact that the ruble exchange rate improved considerably against the dollar. The second is that the Russian oil companies who count in rubbles, obviously their first quarter results were huge, and therefore, there is more cash to invest and perhaps a greater willingness to invest than there was in the fourth quarter of last year. So, I think that it's probably very definitely sustainable through this &#x2013; the rest of this year.</p>
          <p>In addition, I understand there's a probable change in the tax law. So, I think that while it's not going to be gangbusters, there is the scope for considerably more investment in Russia than we originally thought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thanks, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question then comes from the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Andrew, you mentioned that you've &#x2013; it sounds like you are quite concerned about the 2010 plus outlook for oil supply given the current delays in investment trends that you are seeing out there. Do you care to elaborate a little more because we just had the IEA come out and increase their estimates on non-OPEC production and can you talk a little bit about how your views might differ or will you agree on what you see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually, the thing that worries me more than anything else, and that's why when I answered Kurt's question I stressed the level of the oil price so much, is our customers' cash flows. Because even our very largest customers are having to borrow or dip into their war chest to sustain their spending. And they will only go on doing that for a certain period of time. And therefore, if we don't have a fairly substantial improvement in the oil price, by the end of this year, then the risk is that the cash flows will be such that they will not actually increase at all in 2010. So, that's why I am so insistent that it hinges on the level of the oil price at the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of supply, you've seen the easy stuff go away, the heavy oil, the tar sands and all the rest of it, which is a fairly substantial chunk of production that was originally included in the sort of 2012 estimate. And I think what we are seeing now is a very definite caution on the part of our customers which leads them to postpone fairly substantial projects. If they don't see an increase in their cash flow, they are going to go on doing that. And my point is that if that happens, it's just going to accelerate the supply decline. And if that occurs at a moment when demand starts to grow, the crossover could be quite violent. I don't have, I don't comment on the IEA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the oil price continues to drift higher with an economic recovery gaining traction &#x2013; under that scenario, how do you see the outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then I think you know there will be sometime in 2010, and please don't try to tie me down to the exact day, Ole. Sometime in 2010, our customers will gain sufficient confidence to start to rebuild activity. But don't, please don't. I do not think that's in 2009 and I do think that's in function of the oil price and their cash flows as they see them going into 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one follow-up question on WesternGeco, you mentioned for the first time CSEM and the TM sic [MT] integration with Q, could you talk a little bit about the scope to use this as a tool to maybe withstand some of the general margin and pricing pressures that you highlighted in seismic in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the capacity to do the integration is going to lead to a higher value multiclient product, and therefore, a better priced multiclient product. That is the scope I see for it at the moment, Ole.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, getting back to the roadmap, if you will, for non-North American margins recognizing that 2010 is certainly opaque and there is enough uncertainty with regard to the remainder of 2009, but quarter-on-quarter, you're down about 170 basis points internationally. By year-end what do you expect within a range, the margin contraction to be in the non-NAm realm? And to frame it for you, Andrew, just very quickly one of your peers -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>-suggested that international margins would be down 3 to 500 basis points within the next two to four quarters and I'm just curious as to whether you ascribe to that view.</p>

          <p>I don't know whether they will go that far, but they could, that really is going to depend a great deal on what &#x2013; if you say two to four quarters it's really going to depend a great deal on what activity looks like in the back end of that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Because if I recall correctly here, the first quarter, your prophecy for non-North American margins was a typical eastern hemisphere correction if you will, 18 months taking to unfold, margins down basically 50% from the recent peak which would imply margins somewhere in frankly, the high teens and margins to bottom either first or second quarter of next year. And if you are suggesting 3 to 500 basis points from here and you're thinking that that could be on the high end with regard to the rate of margin contraction, it sounds like you're a little bit less &#x2013; what is the right word? I guess pessimistic with regard to where margins are going to bottom.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>However, I would put this big, big rider on whether or not that we have another leg down in 2010 because activity &#x2013; because if our customers cash flow or our customers consolidating or whatever else they do means that there is another leg down in activity in which case, I would become much more pessimistic.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. Second question relates to North American margins. I mean, clearly everybody is sort of enduring a lot of duress for reasons that we all know. You're taking a lot of costs out of the system, the North American &#x2013; at least the U.S. rig count is groping for a bottom, Canada seasonal recovery. It looks like most of the pricing lows are behind us, although, you are going to get some quarter-on-quarter-quarter flow through, should we expect margins &#x2013; assuming that activity basically is not going to take another significant leg down, that margins have essentially bottomed for you in North America?</p>

          <p>I just want to clarify a comment that you made Andrew in your remarks, where you talked about, or I think Simon maybe said that Canada and the U.S. contributed equally to the correction in margins from Q1 to Q2. Is that &#x2013; does that mean they were both down the same amount in dollars or percent or I just &#x2013; it would make a very big decline in Canada if it was the same dollar amount?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it is in the percentage terms, Dan, if you take the drop that we experienced from Q1 to Q2, the major part of it is a split equally between Canada and U.S. Land, yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. That helps. And then, Andrew, last quarter I asked you about whether or not we could make more money in 2010, Schlumberger corporate entity than we did in 2009, and you said it didn't seem logical that you would. As I look at the world today, oil prices are better as you mentioned. North America is maybe a little bit worse, pricing issues, there's a lot of mix issues going on for Schlumberger. I mean, has your view changed? Is it not logical to make more money next year or is it now possible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, an awful lot will depend what happens in North America, because we can hardly make less. And then again it comes back to everything I have said to everybody else: what is the oil price going to do toward the end of this year? I mean, there is one element of this cycle that we don't understand yet, and it is a logical element in every cycle, and that is: what do our customers do when their cash flows really start getting crimped?</p>
          <p>So the hedges run out, they need to go to bank or cut their dividends or whatever else they need to do to fund their projects? Do they do that, or do they cut their projects and that really is going to depend on their perspective of oil prices towards the end of this year. Then the next logical phase in any cycle is that they start to consolidate. And we actually haven't seen very much of that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, several times you have described this sort of huge uncertainty that faces us toward the end of the year as to what customers are going to do based on, in your view, what oil prices are doing at the time. How do you manage Schlumberger with that, sort of, uncertainty? You've got cost cutting efforts going on, you've reduced head count. Do you do more of that and take a chance that you don't have enough if the activity picks up or do you hold on, and take the risk that if it is weaker your profitability suffers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would, I think, in these circumstances having gone where we've gone with the head count hold on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>We do have a volume of skilled people who have been put on leave of absence. So, I am not going to tell you how many, but we could call back a considerable body of people on one month's notice.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. So, you have a kind of an option there?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a second question is, as you referenced the uncertainty about what your customers do in regards to consolidation, how do you look at the Oilfield Service market in terms of current conditions and consolidation or M&amp;A opportunities?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if North America remains sort of bumping along the bottom for the next six months, then you will see some consolidation in the industry. I am not saying it is going be us. I am just saying that I think the bumping along the bottom for the next couple of quarters will tire some &#x2013; wear some people out.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Andrew I would generally agree with your comment that I wouldn't expect your customers to reopen '09 budgets based on where we are today, but I'm a little surprised that you know maybe some projects that had been budgeted, but delayed aren't potentially moving forward or delayed maintenance or deferred maintenance not moving forward because those are pretty short lead time and high impact activities with the oil price where it is. I was wondering if you could comment on that a little bit.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, if you are talking about workover &#x2013; I think, that's quite &#x2013; workover projects, production enhancement, enhanced maintenance, all the rest of it, absolutely. They may loosen up a few more dollars. I was talking about a net increase in the number of projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think you are going to see any major projects sanctioned until there's a much greater confidence &#x2013; degree of confidence over the stability in the oil price.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it's bounced around by a considerable amount already this year. It has been up, down, now it is up again. They are going to want to see some boundaries on it before they commit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But some of the marginal stuff is kind of shaking out -?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Great. And then the follow-up would be, you know, obviously the international markets aren't necessarily monolithic and you've talked about Russia increasing a little bit. But if you are talking about kind of still a net decline on the major project side, what's going to be a little better or a little worse over the balance of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, for example, if the oil price holds up where it is, the North Sea will be a little bit better than we thought. But that's from being way down. Then I think that certain parts of Southeast Asia may be a bit better than we thought. I don't think &#x2013; it maybe a little &#x2013; it may help North Africa a little bit, particularly Algeria. It may help &#x2013; it may help even parts of South America a bit. But, this is &#x2013; yes, it's nice to have, but it's not going to move the needle in the industry if people spend a little more money on workover.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; some of those things &#x2013; and yeah, what's worse if those things are a little better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what is worse is if in some of the very big projects some of the partners say we don't want to do the next phase, and all of the other partners say, if you're not going to do it, we're  not going to do it either. We haven't seen a lot of that yet, but I have heard some of our customers say if X doesn't follow, we won't follow either. So, this is where I talk &#x2013; this is where I start to talk about strain on the cash flow.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. Andrew, when we look at the breakdown of international margin pressure going forward, I would assume that some areas, such as Land may have felt the impact of oil pricing sooner, just because it's shorter cycle whereas price concessions on longer term projects, such as deepwater may have not actually flowed through results yet. As you've pointed out, that's still to come. Can you comment on what you are seeing in here and how that might impact different GeoMarkets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think actually you need to segregate it more by customer than by type of project, because the IOCs have been very quick to react and quick to implement price negotiations, whether it be offshore activity or land activity. So, it's more, if you like, where you have strong concentrations of IOC activity that we &#x2013; that the price concessions have been greatest than by any particular type of activity. That's why, for example, you take somewhere like the U.K. sector of the North Sea or Western and southern Africa, the &#x2013; which is largely dominated by large companies that the pricing pressure is lot greater.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then as an unrelated follow-up, when we look at North America, can you comment on your ability to remove capacity from the market outside of just pressure pumping, and do you see that as an opportunity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, we do relocate assets in the other segments. So, Drilling &amp; Measurements and Wireline, a lot of the assets that are in North America are going to fill CapEx requirements in overseas GeoMarkets and, therefore, reducing the CapEx that we use overseas. It's a lot more difficult with prime movers. So, it's a lot more difficult to move trucks around the world, for example, than it is to move tools, partly for legal &#x2013; partly for regulatory reasons, and partly because it's just lot more expensive. So, you might park it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, could you give your current views on Iraq, how quickly you think that activity could ramp up with both the NOCs and the IOCs? And then do you think this business could be a $1 billion business for you in the next year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think that &#x2013; so firstly, what are we doing in Iraq? We're currently constructing a base in the southern oilfields on speculation. We don't have contracts to justify that base. On the basis that when activity does come back in serious amounts, that's the best physical location to be in. We are, as our competitors have remarked, talking to everybody.</p>
          <p>I &#x2013; the security conditions under which we're operating are still really at the margin of what we can do safely. We probably, on a well site visit, will have as many security people as we do people doing operations. And I think that the likelihood is that the first activity we will see is going to be with the Iraqi national oil companies for the fields. And I think it's likely to really only make a difference next year and I think the chance of it being a $1 billion business in two years is zero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Really? Okay. A follow-up question, Andrew, relates to North American results here in the first quarter, and I guess it struck me that due to your stronger competitive position in deepwater and in Alaska, that breakeven result must be viewed as disappointing to you. And was this then in large part because the pricing deteriorated in some of your core businesses a lot more than what you would have thought?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that &#x2013; so I think that actually the shelf, the Gulf of Mexico was quite disappointing because of the reduction in shelf activity. I think that we were disappointed with U.S. Land. It is largely a matter of pricing and it is across most of the segment. But we are &#x2013; we were badly hurt in Canada, too, by both activity and pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How did pricing trend &#x2013; how was pricing, Andrew, versus your expectations in businesses, such as Wireline and MWD directional?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think &#x2013; I think Wireline everyone was a bit surprised by the amount that Wireline pricing declined, but then the decline in activity in cased-hole was so great that we shouldn't really have been surprised. And in Drilling &amp; Measurements, I don't think there was &#x2013; I don't think that the pressure was nearly as bad as it was in the other segments.</p>

          <p>Morning, Andrew.</p>

          <p>Morning, Bill.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to follow back up and I think you touched on it, but just to be clear you mentioned about the pricing renegotiations that took place in the first half impacting your second half international results. I'm just curious today, are we still &#x2013; we at a point in some market where that has completed abated, as it relates to renegotiating existing term contracts, or is it just moderate in certain areas or are there still areas where it's just as strong today as it was, say, three or six months ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we have &#x2013; unless there's another leg down, we have finished &#x2013; pretty much finished the price renegotiations with all of our major IOC customers. But a lot of those negotiations were only finished during the second quarter, so the pricing effect is going to be seen in the third and fourth quarter. And that I think, you know, largely those renegotiations are done.</p>
          <p>The rest of it, will, I think, be the rollover of tenders, which, as you know, it takes much longer to work through the system, which is why I have always said that I think there's no reason why this cycle would be particularly different from any other cycle and the full effect will take 18 months to work itself through the system. But for the major customers, most of the renegotiations were done in the first half year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess one follow-up, you talked about your thoughts on IPM, I guess, and on the last quarter call, and the balance between owning rigs and not owning rigs and successes you can have in IPM going forward. Any changes there to your thoughts? I know potentially there's another competitor, I guess, on the service side coming in on Chicontepec now, just your thoughts maybe in Mexico incrementally going forward, just kind of your IPM views going forward, in term of owning rigs versus, I guess, using more of a managed services approach here going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think &#x2013; so firstly, I don't think there's one answer to the thing because your &#x2013; as the world develops, particularly in countries where the economies are becoming more sophisticated, the issue of local content is going to become greater and greater. And the capacity to import, particularly a piece of equipment like a rig that's available on the market, is going to become more and more difficult. So, generally we will favor a managed services approach.</p>
          <p>In terms of Chicontepec, we have an exposure which I would not want to increase. I feel quite comfortable where we are for a number of reasons, and therefore, I'm not surprised &#x2013; I'm not at all surprised to see more and more contractors trying to break into that market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, could you comment on the timing of Saudi gas initiatives, when you think they could pick up rigs as they &#x2013; they have laid out some oil rigs but on the gas side they have been talking about it. When do you think that actually could materialize?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there already has been a considerable shift of land rigs to gas exploration. That's taken place. It took place in the first quarter and the end of last year. And offshore there's no doubt that the bulk of the rigs and any increase they do in offshore rigs is going to be focused on gas development, as they have a number of reasonably successful discoveries. I don't think it is &#x2013; I think it is happening, I don't think it's about to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of revenue per rig, how does that compare on a, in Saudi Arabia between a oil well and a gas well, how does the revenue and margins change between the two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, like anywhere else, the gas wells tend to have more revenue per rig, not necessarily the same level of profitability or return on sales. And in terms of Saudi, in terms of oil wells, it depends very much what type of oil well you're talking about, if you're talking about a 6,000-foot development well on Ghawar, the revenue is not very high. If you're talking about a very complex horizontal well on Manifa, it's a very different point of view. So, you can't draw a general rule, but as a general rule, the same ratio of better revenue on a gas well applies in Saudi Arabia, as it does anywhere else.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on unconventional gas and outside of North America, what are you seeing in terms of activity and how do you &#x2013; when do you think it is going to become material business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that there's no one answer. For example, you can see already that a lot of the coalbed methane work in Australia is already being tendered. If you're talking about shale gas, North America type, the cost of development overseas is going to be very different from what it is in North America. And the chief reason is because North America already has the most developed oilfield service infrastructure in the world and therefore, rigs, frac fleets, water carriers, all of the rest and the availability of water for this business is something that's very well understood, whereas that is &#x2013; with perhaps the possible exception of Germany and Austria, that is not at all the case overseas. And therefore, we think it will happen but we don't think it's something that's going to spread everywhere very fast. If it does start reasonably quickly, we think it's probably going to be in Eastern Europe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Could you please speak to the CapEx &#x2013; modestly lowering of CapEx guidance for '09 relative to last quarter? Are we looking at cost savings or are &#x2013; have you made some adjustments to the CapEx program?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're largely looking at back filling with transfers from idle CapEx in other markets. And I don't think you can talk about cost savings yet. I do think actually that it is possible that that continues, and it drifts a bit lower over the balance of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. That, and that certainly, that seems to make sense on the oilfield side. On seismic side at WesternGeco, are you deferring some of the &#x2013; some of the CapEx on the new vessels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We're not hurrying but we are not deferring them. We're completing them as and when it's reasonable to do so without incurring additional costs. So, we haven't, with the exception of certain vessels that we did not take delivery of under leases, we're not deferring any of the CapEx on the owned vessels.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Andrew, I wanted to ask you if you, in the &#x2013; your comment about the postponement of projects or delay or cancellation, does, do deepwater drilling and development projects, are they also in that category?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They actually have been surprisingly resilient. So, yes, we've seen some postponement, but not cancellations. So, for example, we do see a lot of contracts that will actually come into operation in deepwater in the second half of 2010 and in 2011. There's been very little actual cancellation. Where there has been another movement, which I think I talked about last quarter, Robin is a shift from exploration to development on the basis that development produces cash flow.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>Okay. And just staying on that theme then, and your position market share in deepwater prospectively with the rigs that are &#x2013; will be entering service over the next couple of years, how do you feel about your market share in various product lines with regard to the installed equipment and awards that may not have already been made?</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, on the premises that your answer to Dan's earlier question about capacity in North America was excluding pressure pumping, I wanted to get your take on that, on North America pressure pumping capacity. Other players in this market have discussed retirements and would you care to talk about your plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, we do some retirement and then we're doing some mothballing. So &#x2013; and as I think my competitor described, that is a lot to do with the condition of the equipment and the cost of refurbishing it or not refurbishing it and the fact that some of these massive frac jobs chew up equipment, as I think they put it, much faster than traditional frac. So &#x2013; but I &#x2013; today we have a mix of retirement and mothballing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my assumption is that retirement and mothballing then has increased with the current market and the shift towards higher intensity fracing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and it' still going on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my unrelated follow-up actually is to do with the pricing in Marine. And so, I wanted to understand, you have a backlog and I'm assuming you're executing against that backlog -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>-is there active renegotiation on contracts underway, or help me understand the mechanics of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually there has been very, very little attempt on the part of our customers to renegotiate seismic contracts that are being executed. They have of course, pushed them out or tried to shorten &#x2013; where they can do it, shorten the duration, but actually renegotiating price, they have not really been trying to do that, probably because they have a fairly clear optic of how far they're committed. But obviously when they re-tender or when they do tender, and in fact, there is quite a surprisingly a high level of Marine tendering going on, then they expect much lower prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. So, Andrew, I'm going to ask you a very macro question, an opinion, which maybe you'll want to duck. The &#x2013; is that price that you're speaking of in and around $60, so for West Texas or whatever: a light, sweet crude with &#x2013; which would give them a $10 cushion or can it be somewhat lower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In my opinion it's higher, Kevin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Higher than 60.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In my opinion, it's more like 70.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So and if we -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because their costs have gone up. Because they, you know, their borrowing costs have gone up as well. Government tax take has gone up. 60 is okay but it's not going to lead to a rash of new activity whereas I think 70 might be a lot more encouraging.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then unrelated follow-up as well. The uptake of your value added technologies relative to prior down cycles, it seems like you are holding up better, maybe the Petrel platform, a little more integrated into the, you know, decision making process. What would you, and then the same with Q, differential edge and data acquisition. I mean, would you &#x2013; what's your take on...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, so probably a bit better but not much, Kevin, because our customers have become extremely cost sensitive. And therefore, the first thing they do is tell their engineers they're not allowed to buy the bells and whistles but certainly in the domain of software, Petrel &#x2013; the penetration of Petrel in the market continues to be extraordinary because it brings our customers immediate efficiency. It's not &#x2013; it's not price sensitive because it brings them immediate efficiency. On the more traditional services, I would say this is pretty much like any other cycle.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Andrew, I have a question you may not want to answer given the sensitivity but I will ask it anyways. There has been a lot of talk in Washington, the DC area here around potentially increasing regulation on hydraulic fracturing. Still very unknown what the outcome is but can you give us a handicap as to where you see that issue going and the potential effects, i.e. potential even positive or negative, positive potentially for wireline and other analysis tools and negative obviously on pressure pumping?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think obviously, the situation with natural gas in the United States is such that having discovered or unlocked this enormous, huge resource. There is going to have to be a solution to be found. Now, whether the solution will be positive or negative, I don't know because I mean, the one thing you can be sure of is it is going to increase the cost.</p>
          <p>To the extent that, you know, the solution goes through some form of reporting and monitoring and all the rest of it, I am pretty sure that it will get pushed off onto the service industry. But whether or not we'll be able to charge for it, I think is going to depend on market fundamentals but common sense normally prevails and unlocking this resource is a huge positive for the United States' domestic energy balance. And therefore, I am sure that some form of solution will be reached.</p>
