          <p>Thank you, operator and hello everyone, and welcome to our conference call for the first quarter of  &#x2013; second quarter of 2009. With me here in Stockholm is Ericsson's CEO, Carl-Henric Svanberg and Hans Vestberg, the Chief Financial Officer. As you know, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call today and these statements are based on our current expectations and certain planning assumptions. There are risks and uncertainties associated with these planning assumptions and the actual results may be different due to a variety of factors. We encourage you to use caution when considering such forward-looking statements and please read our most recent Annual Report for more details on these risks and uncertainties.</p>
          <p>With that out of the way, I would like to hand over to Carl-Henric for comments about our results and plans going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. If we look at the quarter in summary, this is a quarter of opportunities as well as challenges. We are seeing a general continued strong pickup of mobile Internet services, multimedia services, Internet traffic that is driving traffic in the networks, and 3G is actually up by 60% year-over-year in the technology shift that is going on, which means that GSM is declining. That is a natural technology shift. We have the rollouts particularly of course in Japan, China and U.S., which is just a confirmation of that.</p>
          <p>At the same time we see as we said at Q4, we said we expected our industry to be much less affected than most other parts of society by the economic decline and we still believe so. But as we also said it is unrealistic that we won't have some effects and that is what we started to see in the first quarter where we commented on weaker Ukraine and Russia and some other East European countries. We have a few more such countries also in Africa and Latin America.</p>
          <p>And it is particularly where operators live in countries with sharp declining currencies where their anticipated budgeted CapEx spend translates into fewer dollars or euros, and thereby they can only afford to buy less equipment. But the underlying traffic trends are all the same and their upgrade needs are there. So in that respect, this is more a matter of postponements of investments.</p>
          <p>But at the same time also for the same reasons with the tougher economy, focus on services increases and outsourcing and other ways of finding ways of rationalizing the operators' cost levels. So services for us is very strong. It is now 38% of our total sales versus 33 just a year ago and 20, 23 four or five years ago.</p>
          <p>Services was actually up by 28% in this quarter, so that's a very, very strong performance. And it has also the highest margins in the group so that's encouraging to see.</p>
          <p>It is also encouraging to see the margins. Margins are up 2.4% year-over-year from &#x2013; as effect of the restructuring. The restructuring is on plan. Charges were higher this quarter and we have come a long way of the 8 billion that we announced in the beginning of this year.</p>
          <p>Cash flow finally caught up significantly, which was expected, but still encouraging after the weaker cash flow in Q1, which means that our net cash in the quarter is up 5 billion, despite the fact we have paid 6 billion in dividends. So from our perspective, the long-term fundamentals for our industry is there. We expect to be less affected than most other parts of society, but we have some signs here.</p>
          <p>If we talk a bit more about services, we have done some major advances here that you are all familiar with. But still we in fact at the beginning of the year, we talked about the fact that Africa, North America was our &#x2013; the two regions in the world where we had the least footprint in managed services or outsourcing. And it has gone &#x2013; we have really delivered well on those blank spots because the Sprint deal was of course important. A seven-year contract for up to 5 billion and taken over 6,000 employees, which brings us to over 12,000 employees in North America, a significant strengthened position versus five, six years ago.</p>
          <p>We also did a major deal in Africa with Zain. This is about Nigeria 500 employees, five years, but we expect more to come in that region and from Zain's African operations. We also did a deal in with Telef&#xF3;nica with O2 operations in UK. We are now doing a line of services for all large players in the UK. Our position here is quite impressive when it comes to services. We have better scale and better global presence and skills in this field and that is helping us at this point in time.</p>
          <p>A couple of comments on the regions, start by Europe. Europe saw a decline of 6%, but that is due to the divestiture of EMP and Enterprise, which had most of its sales in Europe. So with that excluded, we are actually up in Europe still of course with some currency effects there. A lot of data traffic here as in other 3G networks, so most of the infrastructure business is driven by mobile data growth and 3G upgrades.</p>
          <p>We had several markets that were stronger, UK, Italy and the Netherlands. The weakest market right now is Spain, which is probably one of the countries that is most hit by the recession here in Europe. We also had another first with our 28 megabits per second MIMO network launch in Italy with Telecom Italia.</p>
          <p>If we look at the CEMEA region, if you flip the page, this is, as you understand, it is a large region because this starts with Russia and all those countries. It covers Middle East, goes down through Africa. So a big region with lots of variation and also a region where the need for telephony and the build out is stronger than the telephony and is more important than most &#x2013; many other parts of the world. But here are also some countries that are affected by the economy. There are also some countries affected by political constraints like Sudan or Iran or &#x2013; well, Bangladesh doesn't belong to this region here.</p>
          <p>Russia actually came back nicely and somewhat that depends on the fact that the last time we were on this call Russia and the ruble was down I think it was 60, 70%. Now it has come back almost halfway up again. So the situation in Russia is a bit improved. Here is also where we had the Zain deal.</p>
          <p>We then go to Asia. Asia was up 10%. China is strong here but so is Japan. Indonesia and Australia also, whereas Bangladesh, Pakistan are down. China is the strongest country in the quarter. It will of course be challenged by the U.S. when Sprint comes in there. India is also still high, doing well. We have had good profit improvements in India actually over the last couple of quarters. Still India can swing a little bit in quarters because it's large projects, and it depends on when those are concluded. Different phases are concluded.</p>
          <p>We will then talk about Latin America had a weaker quarter. It was actually a negative and here we have some effects from the economic decline, but it's also a very strong consumer demand increase across the region here for mobile broadband. So 3G rollout continues. Of course some countries, Central America, Mexico, Brazil was weakened in this quarter, while Chile and Argentina were stronger, and that obviously varies between quarters here.</p>
          <p>And then finally, if we look at North America, that is our strongest region right now. Here we have dollar effect, of course, but still it's a strong region and a lot of activities and this is where the consumer demand for mobile broadband is very obvious. Here is also where we had the Sprint deal, which was significant and hopefully will lead to more managed services deals now that we have the critical mass to leverage on in the U.S.</p>
          <p>But with that said, I'll hand over to Hans to give us more guidance on the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Carl-Henric. Let me go through a little bit more in detail the financial figures and as usual stated I will comment the figures excluding restructuring charges and then when it is included, I will mention that. The quarter we heard about it was 11% growth for comparable units and the units that are coming in and out between the quarters. Of course, the EMP business and the Enterprise business that we had in the second quarter 2008. So the compare is up 11.</p>
          <p>And then we have our model to calculate all the transactions and seeing what that's getting and currency adjusted. Of course, somewhat theoretical, but anyhow we do it, that's negative 3 then in constant currency and comparable units.</p>
          <p>Margins, the gross margin is stable 36.3 equally as Q1 and a little bit down from last year. Then one needs to note the mix shift here with much more services in the one term, one-year time perspective than we had last year in Q2 and of course the main reason that the stable margin is of course the mix shift that we have in our business.</p>
          <p>OpEx continued to go down, even though we encountered some challenges with the currencies, but we can definitely see a clear improvement on the cost level on OpEx as from our previous programs and somewhat from the programs starting this year.</p>
          <p>We have an improvement in the operating margin in all segments in this quarter, which is good. We have in these figures the 6.9 capital gain of 800 million Swedish kronor from the deal that was announced in the quarter over a divestment of TEMS. That leaves us with 6.1 billion Swedish kronor in operating income before joint ventures and an 11.7% this operating margin. Still that's an improvement from one year ago as well as sequentially.</p>
          <p>So then looking into the rest of the P&amp;L, we can see that the biggest swing factor in the result is the joint ventures which of course are having a negative result of 2 billion compared to 0.1 last year in Q1 &#x2013; in Q2. And of course this is mainly Sony Ericsson with 1.5 and the rest ST-Ericsson. Carl-Henric will come back and talk about the joint ventures.</p>
          <p>That leaves us an income off the financial items that is similar between years, but then we understand we have quite big swings in the core areas, some going better and the joint ventures worse.</p>
          <p>Net income then impacted by the 3.6 billion restructuring charge comes down to 0.8. If we talk about the cash flow, the adjusted cash flow and the -- just to remember you from the first quarter, adjusted cash flow from operations excludes any dividends from joint ventures, and it also excludes cash out from restructuring. And the cash out from the restructuring in this quarter was 0.8 billion. So that we have a 9.9 cash flow from operations. That is good.</p>
          <p>It was a good quarter from both a collection point of view, and the working capital came down. Still saying that we see still effects from operators trying to optimize the cash flow as anybody doing in this time, so it is not the easy times. Still we made good cash flow.</p>
          <p>Here I would like to see cash flow being seen over longer time cycles than quarters because Q1 was down. Q down is up. I think if you look at the half-year, it looks quite good. If you look in then to what generated our increase in gross cash with 12 billion Swedish kronor, main contributor is of course our operating cash flow. That is the main contributor. We also made dividends as well as we took up new loans.</p>
          <p>Notable to see is our net cash position went up 5 billion in the quarter and that of course includes the 6 billion in dividends. So it was quite a good jump in the net cash.</p>
          <p>If we then look at our loan structure focusing a little bit on the balance sheet, we have done quite a lot on our balance sheet and especially on our loan structure in the quarter, starting by repaying our debt that fell due in May some $483 million bond. Then we made two new loans, one loan that is for $625 million together with EKM, the Swedish credit agency, that matures 2016, and then we went out in the market and made a euro bond of 600 million euro in the second quarter as well, adding to a payment in 2013.</p>
          <p>And this, of course, is important. We have improved our debt structure. We moved it backward while taking opportunities to borrow to good conditions in this marketplace in the second quarter. And this, together with the cash flow, of course, is important for us to have a very good eye on and work a lot with them, and the focus is definitely there.</p>
          <p>If we think about the cost restructuring in the quarter, we &#x2013; as I said in the first quarter, we started all activities in Q1. And then of course we didn't have that much. Of course, now we have started the main part of our activities. Some more sequential. So you do one thing and then you get to another activity, but quite many are now going in parallel. 3.6 billion restructuring in the quarter main part from networks given that we are all doing efficiency gains on sites, but also looking into quite a lot of improvements in R&amp;D. So that is a large portion.</p>
          <p>But also services has a large restructuring charge because they continue to optimize the service delivery structure. Optimizing means here, they are bringing more centralized resources in order to get more efficiency and scale the business as they want. Notable on this one is of course that now on the balance sheet it remains 4.2 billion Swedish kronor to be paid out from the restructuring programs ongoing. That will of course impact on our cash flow from operations going forward, but as said, we adjust that also, so you can see that underlying cash flow.</p>
          <p>Then if we talk about Networks, going into the segments, Networks had the growth in the quarter of 4%, currency adjusted down and here Carl-Henric has already elaborated about the mix here with the stronger growth in some key markets. And then some markets where the economic climate are impacting the investment, especially in some emerging markets. And you can see it as well going from &#x2013; in the situation in Q4 where we said it was unreasonable not to have an impact, and then in first quarter some impact, and now it's a little bit more. So it's not been a dramatic and it's sort of how we viewed it all the time.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we also see that in WCDMA volumes is now higher than GSM, and you can also see that roll out &#x2013; network roll out has grown in the quarter, much little bit lumpy coming off their deliveries in Q1. All-in-all the operating margins anyhow went up with that mix, which is showing that both the cost adjustment program is starting to get effect, but also that they are doing a great job in Networks.</p>
          <p>Professional Services up 28%, 16 in local currencies, continued to have a strong growth. Bottom line coming up, 16% operating margin improvement sequentially and improvement year-over-year.</p>
          <p>We see continuously efficiency work here getting paid and, of course a lot of new deals coming in the same time. Two things to be noted here. We talk sometimes in Professional Services quite a lot about managed services, and that's important and it grew 34% in the quarter. And we added some six new contracts and two news outside the quarter, which was Sprint and O2. Anyhow that's important. But also our consulting and system integration are growing very nicely and being more and more important for us as to doing the transformations on networks and integrating a lot in the networks.</p>
          <p>We have now 7,000 employees in network in system integration and consulting. And we also emphasized that by acquiring a company in this field in the quarter, Bizitek in Turkey, and this is a typical deal that we are doing in this domain. It's companies with 100 plus employees.</p>
          <p>Going to Multimedia, Multimedia had a good quarter growth of 23% for comparable units. Also, a very strong improvement on bottom line, ending on a 9% operating margin or 17% EBITDA margin. It is quite a significant improvement sequentially and also year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Revenue management with LHS and prepaid continued to be a strong growth generator, as well as our multimedia brokering or somewhat more called IPX are fueling that. We still have areas where we are doing investments, where we have lesser growth or less on sales.</p>
          <p>Margin improvement, two things. The cost adjustment also are impacting here definitely. Secondly, as we have quite a high level of software in the revenue management area, some software licenses will come and go in a quarter, and this quarter had a little bit better on that. However, they should be counted. So, of course, it was a good quarter from that point of view. It still may vary between quarters the margins here because one or two contracts can impact the bottom line. But you can see Multimedia established themselves on another level right now compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Good. And I'll now hand back to Carl-Henric for the joint ventures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you have already seen the reports and listened to management I'm sure in the joint ventures, so I'm not going to repeat that. But it's a challenging device market, and as you all know, Sony Ericsson's stronghold in the market is where the demands are declining the most, Europe and the middle to high-end phones. There are some very extensive cost reductions going on to restore profitability to the reality that the company is living in. And at the same time, of course, a lot of focus on introducing new products that are attractive to the market to defend the position that they have.</p>
          <p>ST-Ericsson &#x2013; and I would say also on Sony Ericsson that the CFO there in Sony Ericsson was out commenting on the fact how they saw the need for additional financing and that they were talking about that they thought they could arrange that themselves in the market, and I think that is the right way to approach it if they need more money. But they should &#x2013; the cost will now start to come down very quickly here.</p>
          <p>ST-Ericsson, at the same time, living in the same device market decline. They have also large cost reductions underway both because of the lower &#x2013; the slower economy, but also because of the opportunities to leverage on the synergies that are between these three or four operations that are being merged.</p>
          <p>The fact that they had an increase in sales in the quarter was primarily because of lesser of destocking than what we saw in the first quarter. And the fact on the margin side they commented on themselves were stable on the gross margin side. The fact that it didn't come through to the bottom line was more actually differences between quarters. A bit more OpEx should have been reported in the first quarter and they commented on that.</p>
          <p>But anyway on both the joint ventures, very satisfying activities going on adjusting to a tougher market and then of course it's a matter of being backed with good products.</p>
          <p>Then in summary for the quarter, as we have said, we have some different trends that are on the one hand some impact from the economic environment, but there are also accelerating demand for mobile Internet. The cost reductions are on plan. We have increased margins in all our segments, and we are doing pretty strong cost restructuring efforts, as you know, to make sure that we are continuing to deliver a good profitable development here, even if the market will deteriorate further, which we don't expect. And finally, Services shows a very encouraging development, fastest growing and highest margins.</p>
          <p>So with that, I will hand back to Gary.</p>

          <p>Certainly. Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As always, please limit yourself to one question at a time, and please keep your questions at a broad level. Detailed information is provided in the report and Ericsson's Investor Relations and Media Relations teams will be happy to take additional questions and discuss further details with you after the call.</p>
          <p>We'll now move to our first question from Edward Snyder of Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Carl-Henric, I just want to check, the push out of GSM into Wideband CDMA, do you see this as more of a short-term economic issue, so demand that's not being fulfilled in GSM now will be pent-up once the recession passes and that you'll a resurgence or do you think this is the beginning of a longer-term transition to Wideband CDMA that we can look forward to being permanent, and how much of this gains in Wideband CDMA do you think is share gains against competitors versus just native demand with your normal clients? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The shift here between GSM and 3G is not really related to the economic situation in the world. This is just a normal technology transfer. And it would never &#x2013; you would never see big pickups of one without having declines of the other one. They are related, because that's how the operators plan for their networks going forward.</p>
          <p>It is still so with that said that China is still a big taker of GSM equipment, and for obvious reasons with so much going on in China, they can't do everything. So they're spending less on GSM, but that's still where the major traffic increase is, in new subscribers. So there will be more GSM supplies around the corner in China also, which means that we could very well have in a quarter or two, we could very well see again that GSM is higher than 3G, that could happen. But the overall trend is very clear and it's technology-driven.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of market share gains, how much of the strength that you saw in Wideband CDMA do you think was market share against competitors versus just native demand from your normal clients?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are &#x2013; we have over a long time taken market share step by step here, but there is also a mathematical increase if you like, because we have a very strong position in Japan, and you know our position in China and you know also our big position in U.S.. So where the biggest roll outs are, we are over that percentage. We have got bigger shares of that than our market share normally calls for. So just by running those we are increasing market share. But besides that we are picking up market shares all the time here in the market.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now move to our next question from Sherief Bakr of Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. My question is really around the level of deterioration in your top line underlying excluding currency, which &#x2013; particularly in the Networks business where you've seen the Networks business now turn negative, somewhere between &#x2013; I calculate somewhere between 5 and 10% negative this quarter. Can you just perhaps talk us through your expectations into the back half of the year, how some of the trends you're seeing you think are a one quarter temporary effect, or whether you really are seeing something more material. And a quick follow-up just on collections for Hans, you're talking about you're not happy with where your DSO is today, and believe that you can do a lot more, yet at the same time, your customers are clearly pushing back. Can you just talk about the balance between trying to get your customers to pay you early versus perhaps having to be a little bit more friendly when it comes to pricing? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say first on your question there that I would be a little cautious on doing too mathematical conclusions on currency differences. We do translate 11% into minus 3, because we will lose track on ourselves if we don't follow the same calculation all the time. But when currencies are going up between quarters and over years, it can make comparisons sometimes a little bit more difficult.</p>
          <p>But anyway, I don't think &#x2013; we are seeing some effects here, but we are not seeing any dramatic deterioration of any market condition or anything here. It's just that in a few more of the probably</p>
          <p>hundred countries in emerging markets we have seen operators having less capacity to spend the amount they maybe want to do. I don't think that anyone sees the America &#x2013; the overall economy in the world going through any further major deterioration, I think we are probably where things are bottoming out, it's more a matter of now how it probably could improve. I will hand over to &#x2013; are you happy with that answer? I'll handover to Hans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe we should remember that &#x2013; also that Q2 last year was a bit strong, so the comparison is maybe also a little bit tough. I think we need to see this over several quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I talk about the DSO and as I said at the press conference, I mean we have a target, which is way below 121 days. When it comes to working with these, we try to do everything that is in our power, of course, optimize our processes, seeing that we are doing collection on everything that's past due, continue with our efficiency gains, seeing that people are incentivized to do it.</p>
          <p>But as you rightfully point out, there are of course things working against us, which are external factors. Operators for obvious reasons are looking &#x2013; or our customers are looking into cash flow as well. And that goes also for competition, how they view the importance on this, because that is also playing into the game. We are focusing quite a lot on this and we really want to improve here and my hope is that we can improve here regardless of the external factors.</p>
          <p>So, early payments as you talk about, I mean we don't have that much early payments. We have, as I mentioned in the Q1 call that on high-risk markets, for example, we do the recognition or sell off our risk without having any recourse. That's we do, that's &#x2013; if you mean by doing early payments and that market can of course open and close. So we do that, but negotiate early payments or any strange discounts on customers, that we don't do.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that, low-hanging fruits have been working for a while. I don't have many left. I guess I would love to have it. I think it's a long tedious work on our terms and conditions with customers. And gradually improving them all the time not expecting it's going to rock the boat and everybody pays immediately or something. We're going to do this in harmony with our customers. So we are going to do that &#x2013; tediously work with all our accounts.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Carl-Henric, how long do you feel is the duration of this downturn? Are some customers still budgeting month to month or has that subsided. And do you now feel European carriers will delay their LTE plans because of what they're seeing now? And then separately, when do you think a new CEO will say enough is enough with Sony Ericsson?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well if we will start off with your first question, and the second half of it, the European operators positioning versus LTE, I don't think it's related at all to the economic decline. That's more of a matter of where they see efficiency of HSPA, where that is and the advantage that it has to go with HSPA, because it can drive the capability in the networks to I would say almost unexpected high levels and there is a huge ecosystem there. But at some point in time they will take the decision to proceed into LTE, but that is &#x2013; I think beyond this whole economic recession, I don't think it's related to it.</p>
          <p>When it comes to emerging market operators, I think you got that, but just to make it clear, if you are an emerging market operator, in your own currency, you have a budget to spend 100. And then suddenly your currency drops by 30%, you're sitting there, you can still spend your 100 but it's not going to give you as much equipment. Obviously with underlying traffic, they will have to upgrade but they're not going to do it &#x2013; probably weaker than they actually have to, because they come under pressure. It's not so logical in these countries because they are all countries where the growth is also a little bit slower than previous years that they go up and increase CapEx spend in their local currency in the same year. So I think we'll have to assume that it at least takes several quarters.</p>
          <p>I think I will hand &#x2013; I will not hand &#x2013; I will hand over to Hans. It's an unfair question to put to Hans, I think he can think about it for one or two more quarters. But all in all, let's remember &#x2013; I'm not trying to defend Sony Ericsson in an unfair way. But I mean they have been a hugely positive investment for us and we have five-fold payback on the money that we once put in. Now, they ended up in this turmoil where the decline in their segment was so strong, so now it's a matter of bringing them back into a profitable operation. Then we have made the comments before on the strategic importance of that and even higher strategic importance of the ST joint venture with the platforms, but at the same time the many opportunities that arises in this Sony relationship with all their electronic devices eventually are going to be connected.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. I'd like to touch upon the Nortel situation, could you please outline the strategic and financial rationale, but especially strategic behind your bid for Nortel assets and how does that tie to your deal with Sprint where Nortel was the key supplier, does it pay well financially for you? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You may recall that we were once moved into CDMA some 12 years ago, because at that time analysts thought and we thought that this will become maybe a third of the world market, it didn't do that. It stopped at 12% or so. And our position with those assets we acquired was far too small to be able to break through and that's why we closed it down.</p>
          <p>This is a totally different story, this is about 10% of Nortel's assets and this is about an ongoing CDMA business in North America that will go on, they will run that for another 10 years and there will be upgrades needed and it's like taking over GSM at this point in time somewhere. And that could certainly improve our position in U.S. strategically, especially since many CDMA operators will migrate first of all into LTE. It has absolutely nothing to do with Sprint, they never discussed the matter with Sprint. But of course, our interests have increased because of Sprint.</p>

          <p>Hello, good morning. A quick question on the improvement on the overall margin. Obviously there is a mix effect, but if you could quantify what would be the share of cost cutting versus currency's effect? Because to me actually cost-cutting is a more high quality exercise than just counting on currencies?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have no specific numbers for there. But of course there is a significant portion of cost adjustment that are impacting, but there are also other factors besides currency. It's the pricing, how &#x2013; what type of products we sell. So it's a little bit more dynamic than only foreign exchange rates and cost-cutting, but definitely cost-cutting is one component that is significant in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And going forward &#x2013; going into H2 this year and H1 next year, is it going to be a &#x2013; what type of curve is it going to be? Is it going to be sequentially up or is it going to be accelerating into H1 2010, how is it going to work on the cost-cutting side?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said in the first quarter, we will have that perhaps &#x2013; you never know exactly, but perhaps we will have is that Q1, we start all activities very low activity on the restructuring, Q2, Q3 and Q4 probably is going to be higher, and then we're going to have less of it coming into the second half of 2010. Remember that the program is to be read or finished in the mid of 2010. But I guess all the activities will be started and much in the works by year-end and so the main part will be taken this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Also on the &#x2013; just to remind us what we've said several times before when it comes to currency. As you all know that currency &#x2013; when contracts are taken we have a &#x2013; we are hedging on it, which means that we will get paid for what the price was at the time we took it. Over time when currencies goes up and down, the price &#x2013; the competition will adjust for the positive and negative effect from currency because we basically have Euro competitors. We don't have U.S. competitors, which means that if the currency &#x2013; if we sell in dollars and the currencies are swinging up and down, that will be translated in different US prices. I think this important, so we don't fall into the trap of doing a too mathematical calculation here on currency effects.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. So, two questions for Hans. First, on the level of receivable securitization this quarter. It sounded at the analysts day like this was really down in the first quarter, and I wonder if it rebounded at all in Q2. It doesn't look like it from the DSOs. And second of all, if you look out a few years and you think about the services business, how big do you think that this could become as portion of revenue? It's more stable, it's got a better margin than the Networks business, and it's growing faster. What does the internal planning look like as we look out three or five years? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first one, the recognition of receivables in the quarter two compared to Q1, was of course somewhat higher because the market was bigger. But we also had higher sales. So, but it was nothing unnormal, it was a very normal quarter from that point of view.</p>
          <p>If we then talk about &#x2013; we don't have any internal target saying how much shares we should have of different businesses, first of all. We want all businesses to prosper so we have no such goal.</p>
          <p>However, if you look at the marketplace for infrastructure and services, there is of course an untapped potential in services which is that two-thirds of the potential market that we are sort of addressing. It's still inside operators, meaning they run their networks themselves, they do installation, integration, training, consulting, themselves. That portion of course can be dropped down and be used by a third party.  So of course, it is therefore higher potential on that market, and that's why we have said that we believe it is a good possibility to grow in services.</p>
          <p>On our internal plans, I'm not prepared to share them, but of course we have internal plans where we want them to be in the long term, but still, that is how we see it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question, which is rather more short term. As the Sprint contract starts to kick in, how should we think about the margin development in Services short term? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We have &#x2013; as we mentioned before, our costs in managed services deals are sort of in the beginning of the contract when we transit all the employees over to us, and we transform them and put them on our tools, method and process. That is an investment for the case. In the quarter three, or back end loaded and in Q4, we will have three contracts coming in here. One is the same, the Sprint will come in and also the <mark type="inaudible" /> which is a rescoping where we also want to work a little bit different.</p>
          <p>So we have some of those coming in and that really impact our margins. However, it's not likely it's going to impact our margin for several years or not even quarters. But initially we're going to have an impact on that. We have not quantified and I only want you to look backwards and see how it has impacted when we take in this deal. Of course a little bit depending on how much people you take over. On the other hand, the guys in Global Services where professionals have improved quite dramatically the time for doing transition and transformation, because the faster you can do it, the cost is lower. So when I was running Services, we probably took 18 months to do a transition and transformation and I think the guys right now they are doing it much, much quicker. So, of course, there are efficiency gains always on these one-time costs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us a feel on how steep the impact on the margin could be, knowing full well that this is just a transitional period, but just to -- so that people are not too surprised?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not going to be any large variation on the operating margin. But of course, it will take some percentage off maybe, but then you also need to think about what other mix will come into the quarter, so that has to be taken into account. But some impact it will be and then we want to see what other type of businesses that comes in at the same time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the questions. I actually have two questions. The first is for Hans. So just &#x2013; you obviously took the 3.6 billion restructuring charge in the quarter and in the notes in the press release, you say that of the additions to provisions, 1.8 related to restructure. Can you say what the remainder of the 3.6 restructure charge you took actually related to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. First of all, we had a portion where we actually do things in the beginning of the quarter that actually cash out in the quarter. So that's clear. Then we also had some product decisions that impacted part of our balance sheet items that go straight to the balance sheet. One, if you remember at the capital market day, we talked quite a lot about how we now have decided and formulated a very strong focus on our IP portfolio based on our Redback business. That, of course, brought with it some decisions that also impacted sites, redundancies, products and assets. And that's part of what we're doing here, but all in all, it comes with a strategic decision and base that we are putting on the Redback technology for portions of our next-generation networks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So a chunk of the difference between 1.8 and 3.6 is effectively writing off IPR in some form, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And an unrelated question, Carl-Henric in your comments, you yourself highlighted the recent commentary from the CFO of Sony Ericsson that they are other ways of raising funds, and you've seen to have focused on that remark, does that therefore suggest that it is now a strategic decision that you will not commit any more capital to that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's logical, like Ericsson for example we would &#x2013; if we were in a need for cash, we would do what we can first in the financial market, and as a last resort, we would come to you as shareholders. I think it's the same thing here, I think it's more a matter of business morale that you do whatever you can first. At the end of the day, it's money as money, but I think it's right that they start off dealing with their situation first.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have a couple of questions, and one of them really is on just the environment. You mentioned how this kind of CapEx cautiousness is spread from Eastern Europe a little bit then to Africa and South America, there's a bunch of carriers in Asia that have also been quite cautious; in Indonesia, I'm thinking in particular. So I guess my question is Carl-Henric what is risk that this gradual deterioration just comes later in this cycle for infrastructure. Now I'm kind of questioning, what visibility you really have for the second half, so any kind of insights you can give there will be very helpful. And then the second question is just in terms of you mentioned this whole issue of affordability and currency rates; how is that coming back to Ericsson? Are those customers that have suffered a 20, 30% change in their currency adversely to buy dollar based base stations, are they now putting more pressure on you from a pricing point of view, and how do you think about that going forward. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think first off, we need to &#x2013; we are not talking so much about an increased cautiousness among those operators, more the fact that with falling currencies they have less to spend in international value. They may spend what they have anticipated. But I mean, we are talking, there are &#x2013; if you talk about Sudan or if you talk about Bangladesh or Pakistan, these are countries where situations have changed, quite dramatically for these countries. But they are maybe specific cases. But I still &#x2013; I think anywhere you meet an operator than will still conclude that how much traffic and consumer spend continues in their networks. So in that sense, it hasn't- it hasn't changed much.</p>
          <p>I think it's &#x2013; I think we have pretty good visibility as such in terms of how they are thinking. I think in an economic decline like this, I guess everybody is focusing on following the markets and the consumers very closely to be prepared if anything changes. But if it does I guess we will see it fairly quickly.</p>

And it's of course continued in the second quarter and that was a full quarter. We got the deal in the middle of the first quarter, so it was high, but it is not any one-time recognition effect or something like that. It's rolling on there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. I just had at couple of questions again on the environment, not wishing to sort of over do it, but when I look at operators in emerging markets, the general trend seems to be slowing subscriber growth and slowing usage growth, in many cases a complete sort of stall in usage growth. And I've always thought of the equipment business as being driven by incremental minutes, and if you've got few new users and either flat or declining usage growth in many markets, not of course every market, that normally means a slowdown in equipment demand, so I just wanted &#x2013; am I thinking about that right? Because you're saying that actually you're seeing healthy traffic and I'm just wondering what I'm missing and then I guess the flip of that again is it feels like the telecom market is lagging GDP pretty significantly, so is it logical to assume that therefore it would lag any recovery? Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>I'll start by answering the first question there. I mean, over time all growth in percentage will be lower as you increase the base. So I guess I need to say yes to that, but on the other hand, we still see continued growth in the networks and add additional subscribers in these regions. And still there's, I mean, if it's now a little bit plus 4 billion mobile subscribers, we envision in a two or three years more it's going to be 1.5 billion more, so still there is a quite substantial growth to come. So I think that has to be. And then of course infrastructure has different waves, first of course rolling out and getting coverage, next step is getting capacity. And of course that all is going to happen also in emerging markets. So I think that one needs to have a little bit more blended view on the market situation than you're saying that now it's less of growth in percentage. So now, infrastructure is totally stopping. I think that wouldn't be our conclusion, you have the look at all the other parameters as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And the point about the lag, do you have any views on that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What exactly do you mean by the lag?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So -- obviously GDP weakened dramatically in Q4, but most operator revenues and as you're saying operator CapEx budgets are only weakening two or three quarters after that. So is this the sort of industry which would just lag a recovery? Or do you think it's a simply matter of economic confidence that will return &#x2013; give the operators the confidence to come back and invest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is -- I mean, as we have said all along that we would be less affected, but it's unrealistic that we won't get affected at all. I mean, we're not immune and what you are seeing now is a weaker market and weaker growth and we are in fact in a slight decline in the quarter in constant currency. So I think that is all related, that is what you're seeing, but overall I think it's a general feeling among the operators that they are surprisingly unaffected considering how other consumer spending in other areas of society is affected.</p>

          <p>We'll take one last question, operator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. Our final question now comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I just have one and that is that we see unemployment growing globally and yet we also continuously hear anecdotal evidence of deals being bid at rates that don't seem economical. I'm talking about network deals. And we haven't heard very much in terms of political reaction to that in Europe and I just wonder if Carl-Henric you and Hans you as well, if you could just comment on your views of what the European Commission and other European governments are thinking about the playing field in telecoms infrastructure and whether there is any movement at all on potentially trying to level that playing field or if you think that they just are turning a blind eye to it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that it's fair to say that while a few years ago when you had more of that and that drove down prices somewhat faster than some of the vendors actually could cope with. That led to this huge consolidation, and it's not unnoticed among political leaders, that North America cannot &#x2013; almost not build it's own telecom networks anymore. It has to be imported equipment to a large extent. I think there is a nervousness that if one don't watch it here, we could end up with an unfortunate situation, and political leaders are aware of that. But so are leaders for the operators among the world also. So I think there is a more hesitance, more question marks on what is going on in that respect, and more hesitance to push those trends too far. I think we feel a much stronger support around what we are doing from almost every part of our networks on partners, or political leaders or operators. I'm not sure if I answered so clearly, here. But I guess in short, yes.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to clarify, so you're seeing an increasing nervousness, an increasing interest in this from the various political leaders that would be involved. Is that a correct way to characterize what you've just said?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Yes. It is correct.</p>
