      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Daniela. Good afternoon and good morning for all of you. Very happy to be with you all again this year and I will try to keep my presentation in 20 minutes, so that we have enough time for questions.</p>
          <p>Okay, starting from page 2 in our &#x2013; for you that are following in Internet session. We had a net income of R$2.29 billion in the last quarter, with a return on net income of R$1.7 billion. This was an increase of 14% compared with last quarter and a rise of ROE of 25%. As an extraordinary item, we had the sale of BM&amp;F and Bovespa shares, which accounted for a positive impact after tax of R$340 million. Also an important highlight of this year was the growth of the credit portfolio, especially, I will emphasize especially the vehicle portfolio, which grew last year 64% compared with 36% of the whole portfolio.</p>
          <p>This year we had many positive non-recurring effects that we show in the next page, page 3, where you can find &#x2013; especially the most important one was the disposal of the shares of Redecard, which accounted for more than R$1 billion in the third quarter, if you remember.</p>
          <p>On page 4, we highlight some other key numbers of last year. The full year number is &#x2013; for net income was R$8.474 billion. Of those, 7 billion was recurrence with a growth over last year or the year before of 15.9%. Shareholders equity grew 22.9% to R$29 billion, so very strong capital base that gives us a BIS ratio of almost 18% at the end of the year. Efficiency ratio also improved to 46%. In non-performing loans, it was a very good year and we have non-performing ratio of 4.4% coming from 5.3, which was a major improvement in the year and gives us a strong confidence on our portfolio quality for the year 2008.</p>
          <p>Going to page 5, we have some important numbers. Also, I highlighted the treasury result of last quarter, which was 313 million coming from a bad quarter, the third quarter, which was negative. This number is pretty much in line with the average number that we have had over the last two years. Probably, you have a number on the average, which is pretty much in line with the last quarter number. So this was an important improvement in our non-recurring &#x2013; our recurring net income that grew 14% over last quarter, especially given this treasury effect.</p>
          <p>For the full year, I think that I would like to highlight again the result of loan losses, which was a very important contributor for our growth and result and numbers overall. And that we have had expenses growing year-over-year of 13%. This was mainly due to the fact that we are strongly growing the bank. We are growing the bank in all the business lines. We have been opening branches. We have been hiring people for many different lines, which are in growth, and this is pretty much in line with the growth of the Brazil. And we are very positive about the coming years on Brazil and the perspective of financial services in Brazil and especially on our potential growth here.</p>
          <p>Going to page number &#x2013; the next page, page 6, we have the loan portfolio breakdown, broke down by segments and by products. I would highlight again the vehicles portfolio, which grew to 64% and accounts paid <mark type="inaudible" /> at the end of the year. It's also important to highlight that corporate business was very strong in the last quarter and we are now putting some more growth on our small and medium-sized corporate portfolio which we believe will go on next year. So we believe that we will be outgrowing the market in that segment.</p>
          <p>Next page shows that we have been growing very strongly the credit portfolio over the years, 30% a year and even more, 43% on the individuals, on the consumers' portfolio.</p>
          <p>One of the portfolios that we believe that will be growing very fast in the coming years is the mortgage portfolio. So we put here &#x2013; although it's a very small portfolio today, very small today but over the years to come, we believe that we will enjoy a very strong growth in the mortgage portfolio. So we open here, the next page, the screen number 8, the volume that we are signing up with clients about mortgage loans. So you can see that's increasing quite fast and this is &#x2013; will have impact on our balance sheet over the years, although again we are coming from a very low level of mortgage activity in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Just to give you an idea, mortgage represents almost 11 &#x2013; 10% of our automobile portfolio. So just to give you the relationship &#x2013; and we believe that the next five, 10 years is &#x2013; we will clearly outgrow all the other portfolios. And given this perspective, we have made a very profitable agreement with Lopes, a real estate broker, for consumers, which is the biggest, number one broker in Brazil. And we have finalized late in 2007 a partnership and they will select Ita&#xFA; as their bank for finance that they use for the clients they have. They are having houses and apartments and we believe that this is a 20-year agreement and it will be very important over the years to make our portfolio grow faster than the market.</p>
          <p>On page number 9, we give you an idea of how well our loan portfolio in terms of quality performance. We came down a lot in terms of NPL ratios and we are very happy about that and we are very positive on our perspective for 2008. The non-performing loans in December were at a level of 5.3, now is 4.4, with very important improvement over the quarter in 2007.</p>
          <p>The funding of the bank, as we can see on page 10, not only funding but also funds that we manage, have been growing quite fast, 29% of growth last year which is very strong growth.</p>
          <p>Going to page number 12, the banking service fees have been growing quite steadily, in a lower speed than the credit portfolio but still growing quite strong and this year it grew almost 12%. And I have to comment with you the current account services that we have reduced in August. The fees for clients have &#x2013; is flowing back here in terms of growth and is doing very well. What happened is that we &#x2013; exactly what we were aiming for. We have been more competitive and more so that we &#x2013; the consequence of all this strategic movement was that we are opening much more accounts in the bank after that. But we are expecting a higher growth in number of clients for 2008 than the ones we have been enjoying over the years with this.</p>
          <p>Expenses. Overall, as you can see the page number 15, is growing on a reasonably high level compared to inflation, but this is mainly due to the fact that, as I mentioned before, we are expanding the banking activities very strongly. Not only opening branches, as I have mentioned, we are going to open this year another 130 branches, but also expanding all business lines of the bank and so this requires some investment and some increase in terms of expense. But we are very aware and very clear that we have to grow revenues more than expenses and this is something that we are keeping track. But revenues are growing on the speed of even higher than this one as we are looking here.</p>
          <p>Another thing that I would like you to take a look with me is on page 14, is our &#x2013; unrealized profits, and getting market value of a lot of financial instruments. I would like to highlight to you that we have not &#x2013; realized profits that we could have realized in December of over R$8 billion. Just to remind you that this represents almost 25% of our equity. So, we have profits that have not been realized as the year goes, that I have mentioned, and you can see on page 14.</p>
          <p>Two numbers came in the last quarter. Basically although we have sold Bovespa and BM&amp;F shares, we have also kept some of those in our investment portfolio, so we still have unrealized gains giving a quotation that those shares are at the end of the year. So this shows how strong Ita&#xFA; is in terms of capitalization, not only because of our very high level of BIS ratio but also the level of unrealized gains. So this can give us a strong growth potential and we can also be open to acquisitions in the future.</p>
          <p>Going to our three segments, performance of our three segments in the quarter on page 16, we can see that Banco Ita&#xFA;, which is related to our retail operations in our branches, have had a very strong performance in last quarter, as did well also the Itaucred, which accounts for our non-banking clients, the finance clients, basically automobile and Tai&#xED; division, also had a very strong quarter.</p>
          <p>If we go to page 17, we can see that both have enjoyed very strong performances and compared to last year, the same level of performance. And in the case of Ita&#xFA; BBA, although it's a very strong number, RAROC of over 20% for our corporate investment banking. Business is great performance. It has decreased from last year. So all together, numbers are still very strong on our RAROC, so 27% RAROC only for recurrent results, still very strong for our business and with strong perspectives.</p>
          <p>In last year when we had our &#x2013; we announced our guidance, we put a lot of numbers, very detailed numbers. And as we can see in page 18 and 19, we performed in almost everything that we put as growth for 2007. We're very happy with the numbers that we had shown in 2007, and we're looking forward a strong 2008.</p>
          <p>As you can see on page 20, we have some guidance for 2008 and we believe that given the very strong market economic situation of Brazil, we don't believe that Brazil will be mainly affected by the crisis in the USA and Europe. Brazil is enjoying a strong market economic situation. And probably, although the growth will not be as high as 2007, which was above the level 5%, we are forecasting a 4.5% growth for Brazil this year. So we believe that credit will keep very strong growth. We're forecasting a 30% growth over the 43% that we had last year, so still very strong growth year-after-year and we believe that this is mainly due to the perspectives of Brazil and the Brazilian economy is very strong.</p>
          <p>For small companies and medium-sized company, we are forecasting 25% growth. Revenues coming from service will grow a little bit less than last year, especially because some restrictions that we have on charging fees on current account. As you know, the Bank of Central announced some restrictions and we have &#x2013; we will lose some revenue in the coming year.</p>
          <p>Efficiency ratio remained &#x2013; we believe that we can keep the efficiency ratio at the same level that we are today, so we're keeping the expansion of the bank and we are believing that we will keep the efficiency ratio at current levels, even considering the expansion that we are doing.</p>
          <p>Delinquency ratio, probably remain in the same level that we have seen now, we are not looking for additional improvement but because we believe that the optimal level of risk that we can take would be the current level, may be a little bit even higher than the current level. So this is our forecast, our guidance for 2008.</p>
          <p>And in the last page, you can see which I believe is very important, how our recurring net income has been very &#x2013; growing very steadily and give us a very good perspective of the sustainability growth of our business in Brazil, especially giving the good perspective, macroeconomic perspectives.</p>
          <p>I will end up here and opening &#x2013; and I will be opening the session for questions. I have here with me Henri, Silvio and Candido, as you know.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Saul Martinez of Bear Stearns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everybody. I have two questions. First, can you talk a little bit about your capital strategy? You have an 18% BIS ratio, a 30% dividend payout ratio, which obviously contributes to the ROE compression that we have been seeing. Can you talk a little bit about the philosophy behind what seems to be a very conservative capital strategy? And then I have a follow-up to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, we are living in a high growth moment and we believe that this capital is important. As you have seen the growth of our portfolio, we are forecasting more than 25, 30% growth for next year. It can be even higher than that as it was this year compared to our forecast. This will depend on how well the economy will perform. But clearly this is a growth ratio that is a capital consuming growth ratio because we do not generate and we do not keep after the distribution of dividends the same level of growth in our capital base. So for this last year, we grew at 36%, the loan portfolio, and 22 our equity, so we have perspectives of higher growth than capital generation. So this will consume some of the capital that we have in excess today.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, we believe that it's very important to keep some margin of excess capital. We have been in the market &#x2013; that rules have been changing sometimes with high impact in terms of capital. For last year, we have some movements in the regulation that was impacting the &#x2013; impacted our ratio in more than 1%. This occurred in the middle of last year, then again this &#x2013; again in September. So we have been under &#x2013; so we believe that it's important to keep some margin in order to account for this growth and also for the changes that we might see in regulation. Especially, I mean the perspective in regulation we are not sure exactly how Central Bank will regulate BIS too in Brazil and other things. So, we still have some uncertainty on that, in addition to the growth. And we also have been acquiring companies that you know. Over the year Ita&#xFA; has been a buyer, a strong buyer in the market and is the first buyer of unit capital available and so this is something that we also like to keep in order to be able to move fast.</p>
          <p>An additional thing is buy-back shares. We have for long time being buying back shares on Ita&#xFA;. We have traditionally bought shares in many moments as we did now in January. We bought back shares. We bought more than 5 million shares, as we disclosed last week. So we will look the opportunities of using the capital the best way for the shareholder, trying to balance the growth that we are looking, for the opportunities that we might see in terms of acquisitions, buying back shares, and also keeping some additional margin for changes in regulation. We will, for the time being, keep the same level of distribution that we have had in the last years. This has been around 30% liquid for the shareholder, after-tax 30% of our profits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you for that, very thorough answer, Roberto. Just one additional question, if you can just give us your thoughts, toward the regulatory and political environment and specifically whether you see any risk that the Central Bank is going to take any further actions to reduce lending growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This have to do more with monetary policy and not with bank policy, let's put it this way. Central Bank is clearly analyzing these worries about inflation pressures, so for the time being there is no perspective of rate &#x2013; interest rate reduction. I believe that some of the measures that they have taken in the beginning of the year, this will include the reserve requirement of the leasing companies and also the increase on the tax of financial movements operations. It's also in line with the monetary policy. So I don't believe that there will be any drastic change in the market, but Central Bank will be very close with the market in order to have low pressures on inflation. And I think they have been very successful doing that.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the good news is that after the last session, we call it <mark type="inaudible" /> in Brazil, the session that they establish the rate for the markets. Like the <mark type="inaudible" /> in the U.S., we have the <mark type="inaudible" /> in Brazil. The last meeting they had they finalized the minutes that they were awarded about the pressures, but after that the number that came out in terms of inflation and prices overall and economic conditions overall, I believe are better than the ones that they based their comments on that market. So I don't believe &#x2013; I mean for the time being, we don't see any further movement on Central Bank.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Martinez. Our next question comes from Juan Partida of Morgan Stanley, or JP Morgan, excuse me. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I have two questions as well. The first one is related to the loans sold this quarter; they amounted to around 1.2 billion. My question is if you have calculated what your NPL ratio would have looked like without the sale and also over what period of time if you had kept these loans on balance sheet, over what period of time you would have charged them off to try to calculate a normalization of that ratio? The second question is if you could elaborate a little more on your Lopes venture, particularly the conditions for the additional 220 million to be paid and particularly how will loans be booked?  Are you going to book the 100% of the loans or just 50% of the loans, if you could help us understand that better? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I will make some comments on the venture with Lopes. Then I will make some comments on the credit question &#x2013; issue that you have raised. And I will pass over to Henri that he would make some additional comments on that as well. The Lopes venture, we believe that's a very important venture for the perspective of the business of mortgages. First thing that I would like to mention is that Lopes deal is a venture for 20 years, so it's not something that, for the next quarter, it's something for the next years, and many years ahead. Lopes is the number one broker in Brazil, very high prestige in the market. They have been around for more than 40 years. They are well-known, very reliable broker and high regard all over Brazil. Number one by far over the second. And we believe that mortgage increase is something about Lopes, just to give you an idea.</p>
          <p>On the mortgage business which Brazil has now a very low position &#x2013; the banks, very small portfolios of mortgages, but this we believe will change over the next coming years. The level is very low and the growth will be very high. Level portfolio low, volume low, now it's about 2% of our loan portfolio, just to give you an idea how small is that portfolio. So we believe that it will enjoy high growth and it will be a great partner portfolio, probably, maybe if everything goes okay in Brazil in terms of market conditions. It will be the number one portfolio maybe in five or 10 years. Today it's a small portfolio, 2% only but we will enjoy high growth. We believe that this is going to be a very important way to have a relationship, stable relationship with clients, and so that you will sum up some relationship when you do a mortgage for 8, 10 years on average and we believe that this is a stable relationship. Will give us the opportunity to sell other products to those clients.</p>
          <p>So the market strategy is in addition to the branch network strategy for mortgages and we believe that we can sell mortgages through branches but not only branches. We are not going to support our business only on the branches. We believe that we need other sources of origination of clients for that business and Lopes is the strategy that we have &#x2013; by doing this partnership we believe that we will have a lot of origination coming from Lopes. It will be a very important channel for us to originate loans, mortgage loans.</p>
          <p>On the credit...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...sales that we book. One thing that I would like to &#x2013; two things I would like to make very clear before I turn over to Henri, is, number one, this does not affect our results, okay. Our results are not at all affected by those accounting procedures. Number two, these procedures have been very constant over time &#x2013; consistent over time. This is very important to understand. And they are basically based on the idea that we do not like to keep on our balance sheet loans that we don't believe that have perspectives of recovery. So all that we have been doing over the years and we tried to be very consistent to invest is keep our loan portfolio as clean as possible and so that we have a clear number for our balance sheet. And Henri will make some additional comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Juan, now after the position of Roberto, it's very few things to say, but what's important is that the number that you have now is very consistent with the past. Because until two years ago, we were writing off all the loans that in the judgment of the Board of the banks, the probability of recovery was small and is exactly that amount that now we are selling without any effect in the P&amp;L statement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, what &#x2013; I mean just to complete, I would like to emphasize that the improvement in NPL ratio that we have enjoyed last year is a real improvement of the quality of the portfolio. And it has kept this policy that we have covered here stable. So the improvement would have had &#x2013; even if you had kept these numbers, these loans on our portfolio, would be a different number but also the trend would be the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. So the &#x2013; what you are saying is that you would have charged off this 1.2 billion, for instance, in this quarter, if you hadn't sold it you would have charged it off this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is what we used to do, but Central Bank, in order to keep more comparability among the banks they defined clearly and in a very rigid way to write off. So, we cannot write off today, so, but they allow us to sell it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just going back to Lopes, how will the loans be booked? Say Lopes generates 100 reais in loans, in mortgage loans for you, would that be booked 100% as a loan for you or is it...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it will be booked as 100% loans for us. We will have a capital allocation for that 100% loans and we have a profit sharing that accounts for cost of capital that we have and we share the additional over the cost of capital with Lopes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect, thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your question Mr. Partida. Our next question comes from Daniel Abut of Citi. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Roberto, a follow-up question to a prior one you addressed and also to your guidance. I wanted to know, as much as you say that you're assuming 4.5% EBIT growth, when you were talking about your guidance for loan growth and the like. What is your best guess for interest rates? Are you assuming stable interest rates, some minor hikes? As a complement to that and depending on what your answer to that is, what are you assuming for getting this margin evolution this year after the big decline that we saw in recent years because the rate was falling very rapidly?</p>

          <p>Hello Daniel, good question. I think that when we first announced this guidance for 2008, we thought that interest rates would decrease &#x2013; Central Bank would decrease interest rates in 2008. At this moment exactly I don't think that our basic scenario is that they would keep interest rates stable for the full year, okay, so it's a more, I would say a more difficult scenario. Although it's a more difficult scenario, we kept the same guidance for NPLs because probably this would have more consequences for 2009 than 2008. We believe that we still have a chance of Central Bank reduced rates at the end of the year and second semester, but on the other hand, there is also a possibility that Central Bank increases rates this year, especially given the inflation pressures that we have seen in Brazil given the heating of the economy at this moment. I think that this is possible but not probable. I think that the pressures are pretty much under control. The level of pressure &#x2013; I mean we've seen some food prices increasing like everywhere in the world, but this &#x2013; the first sign that we have this year is that these pressures are reducing. So I still believe that there is no &#x2013; that we are not going to have interest rate increase although I recognize that this is possible. If they increase the interest rates, we will see some impact in NPLs this year and more of that in 2009.</p>

          <p>Just to make sure I understand Roberto, you are still thinking that there is a possibility that they may start &#x2013; they may restart the increase cycle later in the year, but having said that there is also the probability of some rate hikes in the short-term. As a follow-up to that how would you record, in terms of your treasury position, if that short-term increases were to occur?  And I am asking this question because, as you know, not so long ago we had some surprises on the treasury side, how are you positioned treasury-wise for the scenario, given that it's so uncertain?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, yes, that's correct. We had a bad quarter in the third quarter but as you could see on page 5, we had recovered our performance on treasury to regular results in the last quarter. At this moment, we have a very small position on the market. So this is only what I can tell you.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have two questions also. First is on your guidance for expense growth, you guided that you expect your delinquency ratio to remain at current levels but you didn't give any specific guidance in terms of expense growth. Should we assume that with the continued expansion of your branch network that we should see expenses grow above 10% as it did in 2007? Also, I wanted to hear your expectations for an increase in the number of employees. I think you mentioned that you expect number of branches to increase by 130. And what does that translate in number of employees? My second question has to do with your loan growth. Clearly you have been gaining market share this previous quarter. Your loans grew 11% while the market grew 8%. Who do you think you are gaining market share from? Could we &#x2013; could this be impact,  could this reflect that the international banks have been tightening their credit standards in Brazil following the crisis that they are seeing or do you think you are gaining market share from someone else? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting with this last question about the growth, I am not sure who we are gaining market share from but it's hard to tell you only looking at this big number. We have a different mix than the market has and we have strong positions where the market is growing quite fast like the vehicles, for instance. So the fact that we are gaining market share overall, not necessarily this gain is coming from the same competitors, because in different segments we have different competitors, and this would be very difficult to say who is the loser. I'm not sure exactly about the foreign banks. Usually you were right, foreign banks on crisis, they reduce their exposure in Brazil. They reduce their exposure locally. And I'm not sure but what's going on, but clearly we had a very good year, I mean a very good quarter on corporate loans in the last quarter. I'm not sure, but maybe your explanation might be correct. The other question was about...</p>

          <p>...employees. Expenses, yes, you can assume that our expense growth will be about 10%. We &#x2013; but you can also assume that our efficiency ratio will be stable as we give this guidance, which means that we expect to have our top line growing at least as flat as our expense line. We believe that we will &#x2013; and this expansion, we'll be hiring employees and probably we'll have a growth of something around 5 to 10% in number of employees for the next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to follow-up quickly on the change in the reserve requirements in bank deposits for leasing companies. It's suggested by the Central Bank that there is about R$160 billion of that sort of deposit in the system, which would apply an extra 40 billion that would need to go into reserves by the end of next year. Do you anticipate any sort of indirect fallout from sort of banks looking to fund that gap? Whether there might be any pressure on funding costs as a result?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first, I have to say &#x2013; yes, you are right. The numbers you mentioned are correct. And they have to be understood as &#x2013; I have to remind you that this reserves requirement will have to be deposited in Central Bank over more than one year I think. So, it will be something very smooth on the market, not a big number for now. I mean the number that we would &#x2013; the impact of that will be seen over the next few years. So, it's very hard to say exactly what will happen. But I don't think this is a big number in the market. I think Central Bank did that much more to align this. There were some distortions on the market and the market started using the leasing companies to fund other operations than leasing and the Central Bank put the leasing company under this &#x2013; the funding of leasing company under the same kind of funding procedures as other funding. So it basically equalized everything so that no distortion anymore in the market. And the impact of these additional reserves that will be deposited on Central Bank, I think it's hard to say the impact, especially because it will be so slowly that there will be hard to see what exactly, what would be the impact, but it's a small number on the total financial ethic on Brazil, very small number.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. I would like to follow-up with a question on the fees, the fee. You are expecting 8% growth in 2008, but I saw some comments on the press that perhaps given the new regulation on fees and competition, fees on current accounts are probably not going to grow that much or perhaps decline? Also a big contributor, particularly in the fourth quarter but throughout the year, to fees were brokerage fees, which, the expectation would be that they also decelerate substantially. So what would be the key drivers for &#x2013; to generate this 8% expansion in fees in 2008? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fees &#x2013; and our commissions and fees performance for 2007 and '06 you can see on page 12. And looking in those numbers you see that a very broad source of revenues that we have on services. Although we have, as I mentioned, some restrictions to charge current account services, which will make some reduction probably in the current year, we still believe that the other revenue that we have like asset management, credit cards, loans and collection services and others, we will look at the difference. So at the end of the day and especially giving this perspective of growth of the economy, I mean we are in an economy that's growing like 4.5%, this is our number for 2008. When you have the economy growing at this level, financial activity is also very intense. So we believe that the 4.8% that we are giving guidance will come from other than current account services, other certain current accounts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. In the particular case of mutual fund fees, the growth in 2007 was just 1%, do you anticipate &#x2013; what's the strategy there? Is it the launch of more equity-driven funds that could revive that segment of the market, or what was it that caused the deceleration there and that should change in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the asset management business is not enjoying a growth as big as other products in the bank, especially because banks are looking forward funding alternatives to account for this loan growth and they are not putting in priority the growth of asset management. In addition to that, asset management is &#x2013; funds like money market funds and others are being moved into deposits for the banks in order to account for this loan growth. Both, the asset management will not be growing as it did in the past, especially in the traditional fixed income type of funds. But you are right. On the other hand we have some opportunities on stock, shares, funds that are being more popular now as they are in Brazil. But in Brazil, seems we still have relatively high interest rates, stocks and all those types of funds are not that much popular and most of the funds that we have are still fixed income, money market funds, which as I mentioned, will be suffering a little bit given the fact that banks are looking forward funds alternatives and not as much selling funds for clients, fund products for clients.</p>

          <p>Yes, hi. I just had a very quick question, if you could help us understand what the trends are in your net interest margin and what your outlook is for the coming year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I cannot give you a number, but overall I would say that trends are of some pressure on spreads, clearly, stable rates, interest rates and more volume. In addition to when you think of the loan portfolio you have to think two ways. One is the mix and the other is the pressure on spreads. At the end of the day, I think the balance is not easy. I don't have a number to give you. I don't have a clear trend. But I would say overall that the trend is a little bit pressure on the net interest margin.</p>
