          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Petrobras conference call to discuss the third quarter 2008 results. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Today, with us we have Mr. Almir Guilherme Barbassa, CFO and IR Officer and his staff. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Theodore Helms, Investor Relations Executive Manager of Petrobras, who has some additional comments. Please go ahead, Mr. Helms.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference call to discuss third quarter 2008 results. We have a simultaneous webcast on the Internet that could be accessed at the site, www.petrobras.com.br/ri/english.</p>
          <p>Before proceeding, I'd like to draw your attention to slide two. We may make forward-looking statements which are identified by the use of the words will, expect and similar that are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Petrobras's management and on information currently available to the company.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me mention that this conference call will discuss Petrobras' results prepared in accordance with Brazilian GAAP. At this moment, we are unable to discuss any issues related to U.S. GAAP results.</p>
          <p>The conference call will be conducted by our CFO and Investor Relations Officer, Mr. Almir Guilherme Barbassa. He will comment on the company's operating and financial highlights and the main events during this quarter, and he will be available to answer any questions you may have.</p>
          <p>Mr. Barbassa, you may begin.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for joining us on this webcast to discuss third quarter results and to update you on recent development. During the quarter, net income was a record of 10.9 billion reais. Higher production and higher price contributed to the record as we realized special gains from exchange rate effects.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, for the first time in a long time, international oil price declined and the dollar strengthened against the real. This weakness affected our results, as I will discuss later.</p>
          <p>But, with decline in the international prices, our internal cash generation remains strong as we continue with our investment plan. While we have entered a challenging new phase, our long-term outlook remains intact. We are confident that we can adjust to those new realities without especially modifying our plan.</p>
          <p>Look at the slide 3. Oil and gas production in Brazil grew by 2% during the quarter, mainly from the continued hand back of P-52 and P-54, which more than offset natural declines from existing units. Year-over-year, oil and gas production rose by 7%. P-52, we reached peak production of 108,000 barrels a day <mark type="inaudible" /> while P-54 will reach a peak production of 150,000 barrels per day during the first quarter of next year. Our average daily production of oil in Brazil, year-to-date has been 1,851,000 barrels per day. Of the full-year, we set a target of 1.95 million barrels per day with a range of plus or minus 2.5%. We now expect to fall slightly short of this goal. We had assumed that P-51 and P-53 would contribute to our production goals, but it now appears they will only begin to make marginal &#x2013; meaningful contribution next year.</p>
          <p>This brings us to our next slide, which details the status of major new production systems coming online. P-53 is already on location with first oil expected in November. P-51 will be soon leaving the shipyard, with first oil expected January. FPSO Cidade de Niter&#xF3;i is en route to Brazil and should also begin production in January.</p>
          <p>No conference call would be complete without a brief update on the Pre Salt that is slide 5. As we have now <mark type="inaudible" /> with the completion of the Guara, and Jupter wells, we have completed a minimal exploratory program of the exploration phase for all the COGS we operate in <mark type="inaudible" />. The only exploration well remaining will be <mark type="inaudible" /> BM-S-22, operated by Exxon. That well has been restored and it should contribute to the specialty of our understanding of the basin.</p>
          <p>We continue preparation for the expanded well capacity to peak in the first part of next year. <mark type="inaudible" /> we can also report that we have begun production from well 1 BM-S-1038 in the pre-salt of Espirito de Santos. We found the carbonate reserves are capable of producing 18,000 barrels per day, and we were able to produce without experiencing any reduction in pressure, indicating a sizable reservoir. We are currently building two additional exploration wells in the Pre Salt Horizon of the Northern Campos basin in the valle azul and valle campaign fields.</p>
          <p>We are now operating where additional wells <mark type="inaudible" /> will be installed in the Santos Catalina. We also continue to make long-term plans for installing full-production system by 2016.</p>
          <p>The turmoil in the world's financial markets and the falling price of oil have no impact on our thinking with respect to the timing or feasibility of development of <mark type="inaudible" />. We and our partners remain confident about our prospects, and we continue to believe these results are economical and even at full-value price well below those of today.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, lifting costs rose by $0.33 per barrel, even as oil declined by $6 during the quarter compared with the previous quarter. There is a strong correlation between the price of oil and the cost of hoisters, but at these stages it is still too early to give any guidance on future costs in a lower-priced environment. Any decline next year could be offset by the three new production units coming on next year. Until these new units ramp up production, they will have higher per unit lifting costs. <mark type="inaudible" /> production tax, it rose by R$2 per barrel, as additional production from Huncador shifted income from the built into a higher tax bracket when calculating special participation.</p>
          <p>Refining -refinery operating performance remains strong. Utilization factor during the quarter was 93% as we maintained ongoing progress, improved reliability. The percentage of <mark type="inaudible" /> declined slightly as we processed more imported light oil to maximize diesel production and minimize fuel oil as the spread widened between those two products during the quarter. We are making a concerted effort to increase diesel output from our refinery and have grown production by 37,000 barrels per day since we initiated these efforts.</p>
          <p>Volumes of oil products sold increased approximately by 3% during the first nine months of the year. Diesel and jet fuel were likely responsible for this increase, growing by 8%. Gasoline sales have been declining by 3% on the face of low real in Brazil and capacity in producing ethanol. These increases were partially offset by declining of fuel oil and petrochemical mass.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. Net import into the field was slightly negative for the third quarter as consumption of imported products, primarily diesel, increased expanding inventory of diesel <mark type="inaudible" /> and the refinery maintenance also contributed to the impaired during the quarter.</p>
          <p>While the devaluation of the real has reduced the price at which we sell <mark type="inaudible" /> to the dollar, the devaluation has not been nearly as severe as the decline of oil and oil products price.</p>
          <p>Our revenue in reais have been constant while costs have declined, thereby improving margins and cash flow on imported products. This impact will become apparent in future results if today's price and exchange rate levels remain constant.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. As I mentioned at the beginning of this call, we have experienced a dramatic shifting direction for both the exchange rate and the price of oil and oil products. Since 2003 oil price gradually increased and the real strengthened against the dollar. This year oil rose sharply, followed by an even steeper decline. During the sharp increase in the oil price, the real did not strengthen to the same degree.</p>
          <p>Also we did not raise our price to match this spike on approximately 6% of our sales. Our earnings and cash flow through September 2008 never fully captured this decline. The spread peaked at $146 per barrel on July 3; it declined by 56% as of October 31, while the real had devaluated 34% during the same period, despite the downward movement in price and the exchange rate in early &#x2013; in the third quarter we have continued to generate cash flow and earnings in excess of last year as oil and the exchange rate effect compensate each other.</p>
          <p>More substantially, we continue to be confident about our future results even in this lower price environment.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. We disclose each quarter the effect of the movement of the exchange rate and the international and domestic price on our average realization price. We compare our average realization price with U.S. based post price, using Brazilian consumption basket expressed in both U.S. dollars and in reais. As a result of declining crude oil price, <mark type="inaudible" /> late in the quarter. Additionally, the gap between U.S. and Brazilian price when expressed in dollars was substantially reduced. When expressed in reais, our price has been flat and now higher than the rate in 2007.</p>
          <p>This illustrates why the impact of the fall in international price and our early and cash flow have been improving.</p>
          <p>E&amp;P operating income, next slide please. Moving now to segment results. Operating income from our Brazilian E&amp;P segment decreased by 7.8%. The net operating income from increasing volumes not fully offset price decline. As mentioned earlier, we've seen cost also increase slightly as the <mark type="inaudible" />. Operating expense also increased as a result of the collective bargain agreement reached during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. The downstream operating. While the downstream segment benefited during this full quarter from price increase in May, prices for each product, particularly imported products were on average higher than during the previous quarter. This led to a loss for the period.</p>
          <p>High operating costs relating to the greater complexity in the refineries, higher energy costs and provisioning for reduced market value of inventory.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. As I mentioned in our call, last quarter results, our gas and energy segment is experiencing a positive turnaround. Higher gas price from the new contracts with the distribution companies, higher volume of the natural gas available for sale, an infrastructure that is reaching completion and growing reliance <mark type="inaudible" /> power are all positive in long-term. Quarter by quarter results, however, will vary until we have a reached a supply of <mark type="inaudible" /> infrastructure is completed.</p>
          <p>This quarter the gas and energy segment reported a loss primarily as a result of higher cost for acquired gas, lower energy sales and a higher PLD, which caused a reduction in margin and led to penalties. High operating and maintenance costs for the thermoelectric plant also added to the loss, as seen in net income.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. <mark type="inaudible" /> was slightly lower as higher sales volume and price were offset by higher costs of acquiring and producing gross volumes. A substantial portion increased in sales and cost of goods sold is the result of the devaluation of the real. The 20% devaluation of the real quarter over quarter caused a net financial income to increase by R$4.4 billion (sic) [R$4.6 billion] .</p>
          <p>Income tax expense was higher, not only because of high operating income, including foreign exchange gain, but also because of the excess of the declaration of interest on capital during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. Given the impact of the exchange rate variation on results, an explanation is in order. <mark type="inaudible" /> and other oil production assets used in the field are owned through offshore subsidiaries. In our internal accounts, we have both on our assets and to the extended <mark type="inaudible" /> our liability.</p>
          <p>Both assets and liabilities are recorded in dollar. While preparing the P&amp;L graph statement, the assets and liabilities are always clarified in quarter and exchange rate. The net change in value is recorded as a gain or loss. If assets exceeds liability, a weaker Brazilian real leads to a monetize gain. During the quarter, assets also grew considerably as a result of investment in <mark type="inaudible" />. But the gain was bullish as a result of the valuation and the growth in net asset.</p>
          <p>Let's see cash flow in the next slide. We are on pace to substantially exceed our cash flow from operation as compared to last year. Year-to-date we have generated R$34.6 billion, while investing 35.2 billion. Internal cash generation is adequate from our capital expense even as we increase spending our gross. Slightly less than half of our CapEx is for development E&amp;P; the other half is invested to meet our long-term vision of expanding on an integrated basis. The lower price has led us to re-evaluate our capital budgets for 2009.</p>
          <p>We are currently reviewing investments for next year. And I'm not yet prepared to announce the amount of spend. I expect we will not do so before we announce our 2009 &#x2013; 2013 plan. This does not mean we haven't cut our spending until we announce our new long-term plan. The new plan we will be focused largely on investment that is incremental, and farther into the future than our existing plan.</p>
          <p>Our review for CapEx spending for 2009 will make some adjustment as we focus on project with more immediate returns. Using the <mark type="inaudible" /> of upstream and downstream projects in our portfolio, we can adjust <mark type="inaudible" /> without materially affecting our long-term goals.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. Debt profile; much has been made of the lack of market access capital in emerging market companies and other resource-based companies. We do not foresee any problem in raising funds. Unlike other major oil companies Petrobras has regularly experienced market interruption during the last ten years even as we were doubling our production in a lower oil price environment. Most importantly, we have the ability to sit firm on a non-commercial source; more than 40% of our liability is structured, is owed to government related entity. Much has been done in banks and export <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>We maintain excellent relationship with these entities. But a Japanese bank for international cooperation. Chinese development bank and the Brazilian BMBS is also one of our principal shareholders.</p>
          <p>We have an ongoing dialogue with them, and they consider Petrobras a valuable and strategic relationship. They do not have funding or capital adequacy issues, and they remain committed to lending to Petrobras. We will state our available option; this year, we have over contracted or are in the process of finalizing 9.2 billion of financing, of which 1.1 billion is from the capital markets and four in commercial works. Net debt contract this year is 5.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Thank you. At this time, I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Marcus Sequeira of Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everyone. I have two questions. One is regarding imports. What kind of trends have you seen already into the fourth quarter regarding imports of refined products? And second question more general. We saw that overall margins showed a very steep decline in the quarter and now given the changes from the Matos, since the end of the quarter, how do you see margins going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the import of the refined product, we expect to reduce during the first quarter as we import the net volume to make inventory to face our efforts and fulfill refinery in Brazil. Though we expect to import more because of this &#x2013; import less &#x2013; because of &#x2013; we can't also because we are producing more diesel in Brazil due to adjustments in our refining process. Regarding the margins --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see margins going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. When we reduced our imported products where we were losing some margins like diesel, we have reasons here to believe that margin may improve in this area. The other area is the reduction of special <mark type="inaudible" /> that can cause us to have a larger &#x2013; mainly the EBITDA increase. Any other point that we have?</p>
          <p>Yes. Any other point we have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one last quick question, do you see any change in the dividend policy going forward, or should we continue to assume around 28% of adjusted net income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You may assume the 28%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank McGann of Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good afternoon everyone. Just to follow-up a little bit more on costs. Costs obviously have been a key focus, I think, for people looking at the current quarter and largely that's just responsible for the point of the cycle we appear to be in. But I was just wondering if you could perhaps discuss a little bit more, in terms of the costs that we saw in the quarter, how many &#x2013; how much of the special items that you mentioned in the release, such as the labor agreement and the inventory adjustment, how much of that do you think is recurring or not recurring?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, in terms of the recent labor agreement, what do you &#x2013; how much did we see in the current quarter that will not be in future quarters, that was specifically a one-time item? And then finally, along the same lines, general and administrative costs, I believe, rose by about 386 million versus the second quarter and I was wondering if there was any special item in that, or is that likely to be a recurring increase that we will see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Some of these costs are not recurring. For example, we don't expect to have another inventory adjustment. When the &#x2013; and even if it happens, it's going to be a much lower volume because of the dilution of the oil price. Regarding the labor agreement, a good portion &#x2013; maybe more than 50% of it is not recurring, because we passed through a bonus that we are pleased, it happens only once &#x2013; at the third quarter. And of course, there is a labor gain, it gives roughly 10% increase in salary and this is going to be recurring.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A &#x2013; the G&amp;A we expect to have a reduction. We have implemented, we have &#x2013; the Board has oriented the company to cut costs on these areas, just recently, and we expect we are going to see reduction on these area and in the operational expense, as well in the short breadth. We expect to have expense reductions on these areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could you maybe go into little bit more detail about what type of cost-cutting program perhaps you're doing? And secondly, in terms of the gas and energy sector, you mentioned that until gas supply increases, you're likely to see continued charges there. Do you know how big those will continue to be, and when you expect to get to a situation where the gas supply is sufficient to avoid those extra charges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a moment, please. Let me have Miguel to help us in regards to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About the charge &#x2013; we're talking about two power plants, third-party power plants that have supply agreements, based on the PPG contract. So now we had <mark type="inaudible" /> supply from the end, but this situation is going to so good with the G&amp;L. Although the balances maybe exist, because it will be an economic to supply chain and depend upon the price. So what you are going to put is a solution from the supply, but it doesn't mean that you are not going to have a penalty because supplying can be worse scenario than paying the penalty. What you have is an option to supply, but cannot be considered if it's not economical. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, great thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding the cost optimization. We just launched in the company. It covers the smallest kind of costs, like avoiding trips and using tele videoconference instead the company; we have these activity inside the company, and &#x2013; but the most important, I believe, is to review our projects. Our CapEx projects, in that sense that we are going to use more standard products in our projects across that cost less, that are for small projects, small, but big improvement. And working on the areas that cost us more in the operational areas. For example using very small ships instead of rigs that cost a lot of money. And all these kind, it's open for every other opportunity, and we open a site, internal site in the company to receive from all the company, all the employees of the company suggestions where costs can be cut, and we have received in ten days about 600 suggestions, from smallest to the biggest ones.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Emerson Leite of Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, hello. Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon, Almir. I have two questions. Number one is in relation to the investment program and your ability to finance the program. You mentioned earlier in the Portuguese call that we should expect for 2009 the same amount or somewhat a little higher CapEx, around 50 billion reais for the company. So I was wondering how do you plan to finance this much of an investment, considering that your operating cash flow will be &#x2013; will likely be substantially lower, given where oil prices are at the moment? If you look at this year, the Company had almost breakeven cash flow, all the cash flow that was generated was spent to cover the CapEx, and I guess the dividend needs during the year, even adding some indebtedness. And that was with an oil price above $100 per barrel. So, my concern is how much funding would you need to make sure that this spending will indeed be possible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have yet the final edition of the business plan that includes the next year investment, what we are going to include as a new project, what we may reduce the pace of the structure of our investments. This is under concern right now. Though, I don't &#x2013; I cannot tell you how much we are going to need. And we don't have yet a price to work with for the next year. This is going to be important, the diminish of our cash flow. What I said is what I am expecting: that we are not going to reduce our speed, our pace, and I don't see, if we need to raise 5, 10 billion, you can look on the previous years. We have done this level, and we have very good relationship with many important suppliers upfront, where we can fund what we are going to need. But of course, we are going to take into consideration all deals are valuable to establish our next year program that we hope we have it before the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But do you expect the spending, the CapEx to be around the same levels that we had this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is a more personal feeling. I expect to be in the level of this year and also, or even larger than the current year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A second question, Almir, has to do with these talks that we had in the market on a potential capital increase on Petrobras to allow a higher participation from the Federal Government. Do you think this idea can still progress in this environment and with this level of a stock price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well this, I would say not comment on that, because it's a decision of the government. It's the right that they share with the controller of the Company, as to increase the capital, just like there is the same opportunity for every other shareholder. Of course the current situation causes the <mark type="inaudible" /> the division of everyone, and probably it's going to take so much time to decide on this point as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Just one final question on the &#x2013; if I may. You mentioned that you don't expect the inventory adjustment to be recurring or even if it happens, it will be a much lower amount. Don't you think that in the fourth quarter we will likely have an important inventory impact as well as we had inventory being formed during the third quarter at the much higher level for refined product process and oil prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is not adjustment on the cost of inventory. It is, yes, it may happen what you've said is &#x2013; it happened because we have in this year the inventory is a higher price, and you'll just wait and see the system in the next &#x2013; in the current quarter that oil price are lower. So they give new value for it, and it costs less than the oil used in the system. So we will be transferring some outside cost inventory to feed the system. Having higher costs at this moment &#x2013; why would we do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, can you clarify which inventory adjustment you were referring to, then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was referring to the adjustment on the international area. Our subsidiaries and our own inventories, that are held outside Brazil, that is held by subsidiaries and they were projecting our costs higher than the price. So according to the accounting rule, we have to adjust to the lower of the two.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. Good afternoon. Actually my question is a follow-up on the guidance for 2009. Almir, let's assume your feeling of higher CapEx in 2009 is right. I was wondering only what's the reason behind this increase? Is it just the pressure on costs, or because of the inclusion of pre-salt by then development cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The pre-salt to be more directly depreciated is not changing. We expect not to change anything in the pre-salt. Because next year, pre-salt is going to take a very small amount of money. We think we will be drilling a few wells and having the long well tests, but we may be drilling, for example, as we are drilling two wells in the pre-salt of Espirito de Santos <mark type="inaudible" />. And these may become producers earlier than we were expecting just by connecting the <mark type="inaudible" />. It's not, at this point, we don't feel possibility of cost increase during the &#x2013; because of the pressure on the oil industry suppliers. On the contrary, it may happen that we have some lower costs than we were expecting previously, but this is still depending on the work we are going to see, so it's too early to say anything now.</p>

          <p>Hey, hi guys. I've got two quick questions on the accounting issue, but I wanted to know if Marie Angel is there. But I just wanted to refer back to the inventory adjustment here. If I understood correctly the whole situation, under current accounting practices the Company needs to adjust or convert inventory levels set in dollar terms. Based on year of &#x2013; end of the tiered of the FX rate reaching the third quarter was around 1.9 instead of the average. As the Company migrates into IFRS new accounting rule, would we expect in the fourth quarter this, let's say, excess in terms of the accounting adjustment to be reverted back in the fourth quarter, as the company will likely be using the average FX rates?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Paul Roberto speaking. As Marie Angel said in the conference call during the presentation in the morning, we expect a change in terms of accounting in the ways that we convert <mark type="inaudible" /> we expect a change because nowadays, before the actual rules, we convert the dollars in terms of <mark type="inaudible" /> a final rate. And then, before we <mark type="inaudible" /> is that new rule considering the amortization that is our policy. We still convert, we had to convert it into dollars by this average extended rate slightest time we produced in the course of the day, financial statements will produce an impact. We can't just make <mark type="inaudible" /> it will depend on the volume <mark type="inaudible" /> in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's clear, and also following up on this same issue. Just wanted to make it clear, the reason why you're converting, you had -- let's say an accounting for a loss &#x2013; or let's put it: the reason why you an adjustment in inventories is related to the fact that your diesel or your refined products are in foreign subsidiaries, and that's the reason why once you sold into the internal market you had to convert it using the final exchange rate? Is that the case?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just quickly, you guys have the effect of this FX rate into the operating expenses. We know that the effect on the gross margin line on the gross profit. Do we know the same effect on the operating expenses line?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I got two quick questions. One on financing capability and the other on the two-part tea pre-salt long duration test well. On financing, I guess I'm most curious as to &#x2013; I recognize you're still in the process of working through the long-term strategic plan, but is there some sort of parameter you could provide on the absolute funding thresholds, I mean at the high point on say net debt to capital or totals, billions of dollars of debt outstanding, for example just to give us some limit on how far you might be willing to stretch the balance sheet? And then on the pre-salt well I just, did I hear correctly that the 103A well did in fact reach your 18,000-barrel per day target? And is there any way to extrapolate that well to the pre-salt in general? What are your expectations at this point for initial rates of production for a typical development well in the pre-salt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding the finance, stretching of ownership, our target is to be between 25 and 35% in terms of leverage. And we are in the lower area of this range where we have <mark type="inaudible" />. And the company is growing, we are investing heavily, so <mark type="inaudible" /> more strength of production the balance sheet becomes healthier. With pre-salt, we are, at this point, <mark type="inaudible" /> activity. It can be extended to the pre-salt well, but as far I understand it <mark type="inaudible" /> important information, but too early to extend to all is sure. Of course, that region where the well is in production, it can give <mark type="inaudible" /> extrapolate to surface that is about 800 kilometers away, is difficult but <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well what we are going to do is to extend our debt until March of 2009. And this will be very important to see the productivity of each well. We are testing two wells, one at a time in <mark type="inaudible" /> for six months each, one is already drilled, <mark type="inaudible" /> And the other one will be drilled. So, we are doing this standard well depth, <mark type="inaudible" /> the ocean, which is already on process. It has a capacity of 50,000 barrels per day. So, these questions we will be able to answer with these extended well tests.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon everybody. Well, I have two questions. The first one is related to prices over the past, well few years, our prices have gone up and the real has appreciated well allowing the company not to worry price significantly and keeping track with international values. Now we have a situation where oil prices have come down well beyond what the company has -- the currency has depreciated. And my question is at current levels of gasoline and diesel prices, could at some point you be forced to reduce these prices that could be the case? Second question is while given the extraordinary set of conditions that the world economy is going to, if you think that there is any possibility or do you have any flexibility to renegotiate day rates or any prices with oil service providers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the second question is you have to be faster to be in the market. Of course the contracts we have <mark type="inaudible" /> probably is going to have new rates but I don't see much opportunity for the long-term contracts we have signed. We have adjusted, but a lot can happen. But I don't see this happen. Regarding the prices, we keep our <mark type="inaudible" /> not on the short. We view that spike where &#x2013; it's going to be after &#x2013; being perfect this year. But at this moment, we saw very high volatility, in a very risky activity. Because in one week, you can have a completely different scenario. I believe neither us nor any player is going to take this kind of risk.</p>
          <p>We are not going to adjust before we are convinced that we are in a long-term level of price and bringing oil depends on the view of different players, oil products. But we are going to keep our price policy.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon guys. Just sorry to go back to the inventory question. But just really trying to understand the underlying profitability in the downstream segment absent any one-time inventory liquidation or currency adjustments. Can you provide what the magnitude of those -- of that one-time liquidation and currency adjustments were in the supply segment? Just the number?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned that in the press release, the liquidation of inventories acquired at a higher cost in the previous quarter accounted for some of the decline in supply segment earnings. I'm just wondering, I'm trying to separate the one-time impact of the inventory adjustment versus just how you account for cost of goods sold. So how much of the decline was really because you wrote down the inventory levels as opposed to just the accounting of the cost of good sold during the quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify I think there is two things. One is that there was the -- the write-down of inventory related to &#x2013; as I understand, inventory held in international subsidiaries, is that correct?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This is Paul Roberto speaking again. We had this in the previous quarter R$1 billion for the whole company as an effect, in terms of losses, increasing of price, and repayment in our inventories sale. When we sold the inventories store, in this quarter, we have the effect in the third quarter. On the other hand, until that price, shouldn't <mark type="inaudible" /> middle of this quarter, mainly in July and consider that we had extra expelled appreciation of dollar in relation reais. We had an increase in terms of our <mark type="inaudible" /> during this third quarter. In September 30, we have another expense that probably will be realized in the next quarter, it's almost 800 reais in September 30. Okay? Again, in this quarter, third quarter we realized R$1 billion which was repayment in the inventory in June 30. Yes, we expect at another expense next quarter about 800 reais, continually, as we continue to have increasing in terms cost during the third quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon guys. I have two quick questions here. The first relating to CapEx, and basically the decision of announcing strategic plan probably around the end of the year. Almir, I just wanted to have say a guidance from you not in the sense of how big it will be, but some of the driving forces. What I wanted to understand was first is Petrobras today -- I'd say in a situation that you would consider comfortable enough to simply go out and say that in your CapEx plan you will need a certain amount of additional leverage or is that something that you would prefer to avoid some of the point of you trying to make old credit better for both you and your potential suppliers? That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me see if I understand your question. You're asking if we'll feel comfortable in funding part of our suppliers and by doing that we will be landing, leveraging the company -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was actually thinking more reason I ask is &#x2013; a lot of the suppliers that you are starting to deal with are pretty new to what they are doing; apparently they're not that capitalized depending on who we talk too. And I would assume that your credit ratings are incredibly important for them, to be able to get financing. What I was trying to get at was, do you feel given market conditions that it would be good for Petrobras and for all that you really want to do, to come out and announce a CapEx that is big enough so that you have to admit you are going to be taking a significant amount of debt in your books?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gustavo, are you saying, would we let's say change the terms under which we are planning to contract now, because they don't have enough capital, so that it would in some way bring those -- let's say we sign long-term contracts on the basis of those long-term contracts, these operators obtain funding, build a rig and then we bring it back and we pay the day rate. Are you suggesting that -- are you asking whether we would do something that would &#x2013; to help them if you will because they are having difficulties so that in a way that this debt would come back on our books. Is that what you're asking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, it's much simpler than that. If I look at your historical CapEx plans they have always included a provision that a certain amount of the cash flow would be raised as debt, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What I just wanted to understand is the world has changed massively. And historically, saying something like that was very believable and very easy to do. What I was wondering is, is Petrobras going to be more conservative as far as how they think about funding in the next five years or should we just expect that this CapEx plan is being done under the light of -- things are going to be okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How much data are we going to -- what is our philosophy with respect to assumptions made about debt when we -- as we go about putting together our plan?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they've <mark type="inaudible" /> in place for some time, it's to have a leverage between 25 and 35% and what has happened, these latest years was that we were below the 25. We maybe looking as these markets will be there, we can reach the 35, that will be not optimal situation for the company. We can cap our programs as far as finance is available and optimize our results. But we have no decision to go beyond that level in any circumstances.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question I had regards potential product imports into Brazil to capture let's say future spreads that may be favorable. Since so much has happened over the course of last five years with you guys buying Iteranga, basically Mangane is not operational any more. I just wanted to understand in your point of view, how easy is it for an independent non-Petrobras to actually bring a diesel tanker and be able offload into Brazil without having to use one of your pieces of infrastructure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, can you give your opinion on that &#x2013; really don't have these experience. I never leave the country, so <mark type="inaudible" /> it's not that difficult, since there is another access in Brazil. So bringing products without using the infrastructure of Petrobras is much more difficult. But there is rules here that establish the organize. It seems it's not that difficult.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So someone would have to use your infrastructure to offload?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Barbassa, just to clarify two points. First, on that other item which amounted to 2.3 billion. Just want to clarify what was the biggest element that caused that number to be so much higher quarter-over-quarter? Was it the labor related adjustment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Christian. I did not properly hear you. Could you repeat it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On the income statement, the operating expenses, you have that other expenses item which amounted to 2.3 billion for the quarter, which was a big increase on a sequential basis. I'm trying to understand what drove that number to be so much bigger? What was the main element of that bigger increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean the item &#x2013; order on the operating expenses?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What is the composition breakdown of this other expense. We can get. Just a moment, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The best to do now is to provide later on our site the breakdown of these items, so everyone can access. We don't have all the details now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you at least tell me what was the main driver for that increase? Was there one single element that was the main cause for the increase or was it a combination of several smaller elements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are several. But there is one important item at least I can tell now is the labor agreement done in the third quarter where &#x2013; that I have already earlier we paid a bonuses to all the employees equal to 8% of the salaries. And this is once only one-off time paid and of course there are other expense, like geothermal plant and the <mark type="inaudible" /> in this area. And yes we are going to give, obviously -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then, second question, this is not a question, clarification on the answer that you gave about, when we look at the main costs that drove at the lower margin. You've touched on the inventory costs, import costs and these labor costs. And you are explaining which ones are recurring and which ones are not. Can you just go through that again because it wasn't clear for me in terms of inventory costs? We had this inventory costs related to foreign subs and then the inventory adjustment in Brazil. Which ones of those do you see is being recurring, which ones are not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Import inventory and these labor cost issues. Can you just, without going into too much detail, as simply as you can, talk about what parts of it you think are recurring and non-recurring looking out for the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, inventory costs, there are two kinds. The inventory costs due to the adjustment of costs to price that were done in our international subsidiaries. And there is this possible inventory as extra cost from inventory that will flow as we lose inventory that is restructuring more in this year, during this fourth quarter. And with the second one the usage of inventories in Brazil will be some extra costs in the fourth quarter. The international subsidiary, I don't expect it to repeat, or if it repeats, it's not going to be as high as in the third quarter. And labor costs, labor cost is recurring as the labor cost is the <mark type="inaudible" /> increase we gave &#x2013; that is about 10%. All the other costs regarding labors are not recurring and <mark type="inaudible" /> most of what we expect of the quarter costs from that area, relating to the labor is not going to be recurring.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Paula Kovarsky of Ita&#xFA;.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon everyone. I have two questions. First question relating to the comments you made in the previous call Barbassa saying that Petrobras' investments are more or less split half and half between upstream and downstream. Should we expect the same kind of clip in the strategic plan? And if so, I'm assuming <mark type="inaudible" /> stuff would be very much part of the upstream, which means you will still have a big portion of your CapEx coming into down stream and additional refineries. So could you talk a little bit about that? Is that the idea to keep on, keep with, keep up with this idea of matching refining capacity with upstream production capacity? So, that's first question. Second question relates to the rise in lifting costs which reached more than $10 per barrel this quarter.</p>
          <p>So, I would like to understand how much of this increase do you think is recurrent, and whether there &#x2013; in this increase there is already the impact of the new, the three new platforms that are due to come on stream within the next three months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your last question, could you repeat it please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It has to do with lifting cost increase and how recurring this increase is or how much -- how can -- how far we expect lifting cost to go down in the next quarters? And then, I would like to understand how much of the rise has to do with the fixed cost associated within the three new platforms that you mentioned are due to come on stream within the next three months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A moment please. Actually, regarding CapEx your first question, I believe I was not clear enough. If you understood that we were replacing 50% of CapEx in the upstream and another 50% in the downstream. No, is the right indication is that upstream will take the 50% as it used to be. I was explaining the 2008 CapEx. I'm not anticipating what is going to come as the next business plan, but usually we have more than 50% or more of our CapEx dedicated to the upstream area and one-fourth of uplift dedicated to downstream area. And the remaining fourth to the other activities. Of course we intend to remain an integrated company as we grow our production, we plan to increase our refining capacity as well.  But the future will depend on the pace and the timing of each one is going to increase depends on many other variables.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just trying to tack on numbers that were floating around, talking about 30 to 40 billion worth of investments in refineries coming in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The business plan that we have announced last year contemplates 30 billion for five years in the downstream area including transportation and quality products, petrochemical and we are more -- our presence today in the petrochemical for example, is still a small business for us. But we don't have at this point indication on whether it's going to be our future plan. As far as now, we have a very good set of project in all areas, mainly in the upstream area where we may keep our share of the CapEx. This has been the lifting cost and new the platform and how it's going to perform. I cannot say much on that, it depends on the <mark type="inaudible" /> platforms that are coming is a sizeable amount of our capacity. As it happened at the end of last year when had even more capacity installed. At the beginning, it always happens, but don't forget that today, we have arranged a team that is going to work on the platform. They have led there in and getting prepared and getting trained and get their knowledge of how it operates. So the costs are there. This I don't believe is going to be the change that will increase our leasing cost for the next quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is actually Vladimir Pinto from Unibanco. I have two questions, the first one is, if could you please explain why the minority interest line reported at such large variation in the 3Q in relation to the previous quarters? And the second question would be, what is the fair discount -- or which discount would you believe that could be viable to import derivatives let's say in the northeast of Brazil. We believe that Petrobras owning a large logistics on the fuel distribution et cetera, could match international competitors but I believe there will be a number, a discount number that would you see which is coming to Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The minority just a minute. Let me try &#x2013; let me try to explain this case of minorities. In the minorities we have many FTDs that raise money in dollars that had <mark type="inaudible" />. So it was a consolidate on the Petrobras balance sheet as a loss. And the minority line, we are divesting the situation, that's why it increase. It is one of the effects of the exchange rate. Regarding discounts to necessary to accumulate or import oil products into Brazil by other players, it depends on each to run, and the cost of the capital. Really, I have no figures to help you here.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for the follow-up opportunity. Almir, I would like to talk a little bit about exploration. I know you guys have for now pro forma that the meaning exploratory program required in the <mark type="inaudible" /> area, do you plan to drill further appraisal wells in the cluster during 2009 and if you could anticipate a schedule, drilling schedule or which well is going to be the first -- I'm not referring to BMS 22, but within your blocks in the cluster, which is going to be the next well and when should we hear from Petrobras again on new estimates of potential volumes in the cluster?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me have <mark type="inaudible" /> to help us in this question. Please, <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In 2009, we expect to have three more drilling rigs that are able to drill up to 2400 meters <mark type="inaudible" />; they should arrive in September. They are the <mark type="inaudible" /> the last two are contracted from <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>And today we have only three drilling rigs that are able to drill in such conditions, <mark type="inaudible" />. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you the wells that we are building, we are preparing the drilling program that we are going to drill, that is for next year. But we don't publish this drilling programs. We are drilling right now outside the cluster of <mark type="inaudible" /> in Espirito de Santos state and north of the <mark type="inaudible" /> basin. That is all I can tell at this moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Still on this topic, we had earlier this week or actually last Friday, we had ANP, I know they had a regulator here commenting on a number between 50 and 80 billion barrels for reserves in the <mark type="inaudible" /> cluster area and apparently this time they were basing the numbers in, you know, technical information, and I'd assume the technical information can only come from Petrobras. Do you have any comments on that estimate? How does that fit with your own assessment of the potential of the area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I cannot comment on their &#x2013; what they said. They have also date, and the blocks?  And what are Petrobras' thoughts? Should we start &#x2013; we may have from eight to 12 competitors before we bid on it.  And we are all together. And that is what I can tell right now.</p>
