          <p>Good day and welcome to the Novo Nordisk Full year 2011 Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over Lars Rebien Sorensen. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And welcome ladies and gentlemen to this conference call regarding our performance in 2011 and our outlook for 2012.</p>
          <p>I am Lars Rebien Sorensen, the CEO of Novo Nordisk. With us, we have our Chief Financial Officer, Jesper Brandgaard; Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, our Chief Science Officer; and present are also our Investor Relations officers.</p>
          <p>Today's earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our web page novonordisk.com. The conference is scheduled to last as usual, approximately one hour.</p>
          <p>Let's start with the presentation as outlined on slide number two. The Q&amp;A session will begin in about 25 minutes.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide number three. As always, I need to advise you that this call will contain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations. For further information on the risk factors, please see the earnings release and the slides prepared for this presentation.</p>
          <p>Also note that this conference is being webcast live and a replay will be made available on Nova-Nordisk website after the call.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number four. 2011 has been a good year for Nova Nordisk. Sales increased 11% in local currencies and the key sales drivers were Victoza and modern insulins. The solid sales performance has been realized in a challenging economic environment where healthcare reforms impacted sales growth negatively by approximately 2 percentage points.</p>
          <p>A very significant milestone in 2011 was the filing for approval of a new ultra long-acting insulin, Degludec and DegludecPlus in major markets including Europe United States. The regulatory review of Degludec and DegludecPlus are on track. In the U.S., a PDUFA action date of 29 of July this year has been issued by FDA. Further, Novo-Nordisk has completed two extension trials of this phase 3a development program for Degludec, providing two year data on efficacy and safety of insulin Degludec in subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes respectively. The data from the extension trials are very encouraging and confirm the safety profile of Degludec compared to insulin glargine and Mads will elaborate on this during his R&amp;D presentation.</p>
          <p>Finally, Novo-Nordisk has successfully completed the Phase 3a program for Turoctocog alfa, a recombinant factor VIII for the treatment of hemophilia A and currently expects to file the marketing authorization in major markets including United States and Europe in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the financials, the reported operating profit grew 18% and diluted earnings per share grew 22% in this year &#x2013; in 2011. For 2012, we expect sales growth between 7% to 11% in local currencies, and operating profit growth of around 10% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Go to slide number five. Victoza continues the steady growth performance and Modern insulins continue to exhibit double-digit growth rates. In 2011, diabetes care franchise grew 13% while the biopharmaceutical franchise grew 8%, both measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Diabetes care now represents 76% of overall sales. Victoza was the prime growth driver, accounting for 55% of growth in local currencies followed by Modern insulins accounting for 41% of growth.</p>
          <p>Sales of NovoSeven increased 7% local currencies, all regions contributed to growth with international operations being the primary contributor. Sales of Norditropin increased 5% in local currencies. Sales growth was driven by international operations, North America, Japan, Korea, partly offset by a decline in Europe.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number six, 2011 North America accounted for 61% of growth followed by international operations with 21% of growth, both measured in local currencies. Sales growth in North America was 18% in local currencies reflecting a strong performance of Victoza and continued market penetration of the modern insulins.</p>
          <p>The sales growth in North America, 2011 was negatively impacted by approximately three percentage point due to the U.S. healthcare reform enacted in March of 2010. European sales grew 2% in local currencies supported by the continued solid performance of Victoza, and progress for the portfolio of modern insulins. Sales growth is negatively impacted by declining sales of human insulin and NovoNorm and by healthcare reforms implemented during 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p>Sales within International Operations grew 17% in local currencies, driven by continued penetration of Modern insulins, higher NovoSeven sales and Victoza sales. Sales in region China increased 12% in local currencies in 2011, the main contributor of growth sales of modern insulins especially NovoMix.</p>
          <p>Sales growth in region China has in 2011 been negatively impacted by price reform on human insulins and NovoNorm enacted in September of 2011. Sales in Japan and Korea increased 5% in local currencies, mainly driven by Victoza and Norditropin.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number seven. In the last decade, the global diabetes care market has grown more than 8% in value with injectables growing close to 14% annually. Novo Nordisk continues to expand the leadership position within diabetes care and currently holds more than 24% value share of the global diabetes medication market.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for an update on Victoza. Sales of Victoza reached DKK2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, making total sales in 2011 nearly DKK6 billion. The performance reflects steady penetration across key markets including United States, U.K., Germany, France, Japan, and certain countries in our international operations.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number nine, in the U.S. Victoza sale continues to be encouraging. We estimate that more than 270,000 people with type 2 diabetes are treated with Victoza in the United States today. We hold a market share of close to 55% of the total GLP-1 prescriptions in the U.S. and we are capturing around 62% of new GLP-1 patients. Since the Victoza launch in February 2010, the GLP-1 class has grown more than 60% and now constitutes 5.5% of the U.S. diabetes care market measured in value.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number 10, in Europe, we continue to see strong uptick of Victoza in several key markets. The GLP-1 class has more than doubled since the launch of Victoza. Victoza is the leading GLP-1 product in all three key markets in Europe, mainly Germany, U.K. and France. We now estimate that close to 160,000 people with type 2 diabetes are treated with Victoza in these markets.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to hand over to Mads, who will give you an update on research and development.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Please turn to slide 11. Let me start with an update on the regulatory process with Degludec and DegludecPlus. As mentioned by Lars, both of the ultra-long acting insulin, Degludec and DegludecPlus have over a three month period been submitted for regulatory review in Europe and the U.S. plus Japan in the case of Degludec. Furthermore, we've now submitted Degludec and DegludecPlus dossiers for regulatory review in Switzerland and Canada.</p>
          <p>In the United States, the PDUFA action date has been set to July 29 this year and the regulatory process is proceeding as expected. In EU, the Day 80 draft assessment reports have been received and the European agency process follows the expected schedule. In parallel with the ongoing dialogue with the triad market agencies, Novo-Nordisk will continue to submit new drug applications for both products in a number of territories during 2012. We will continuously provide updates on the regulatory progress towards approval of these new Degludec products as part of the quarterly announcements.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for other news from the clinical pipeline. As also mentioned by Lars, Novo-Nordisk has now completed both two year HbA Degludec extension studies in subjects with type 2 and type 1 diabetes respectively. In the type 2 diabetes extension trial, around 1,000 patients were initially randomized 3 to 1 to try the once daily insulin Degludec in the FlexTouch Pen or glargine, both in addition to metformin plus/minus a DPP-4 inhibitor therapy.</p>
          <p>The HbA1c after two years was similar between the groups, being maintained around 7% in both treatment arms with a pre-randomization baseline of around 8.2%. For Degludec, the fasting plasma glucose levels stayed close to normal at approximately 6 millimolar after the two years of study, which was statistically significantly lower than in the comparative group. Furthermore, Degludec also maintained a very low risk of hypoglycemia. Thus, the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemic events was 43% lower with Degludec compared to insulin glargine and the rate of severe hypoglycemia was likewise statistically significantly lower for Degludec.</p>
          <p>In the type I diabetes phase of BOOST trial more than 600 patients were originally randomized three to one to either insulin Degludec or glargine, both given once daily in patients <mark type="ph" /> via titration asphart (10:18) . HbAlc at study completion was around 7.4% in both treatment arms. At the end of this extension trial Degludec also maintained a lower risk of confirmed nocturnal hypoglycemia compared to glargine with a significant 25% risk reduction. In both studies Degludec demonstrated a good safety and tolerability profile and there were no apparent differences between the treatment groups with respect to adverse events and standard safety parameters.</p>
          <p>Turning to progress on the rest of the diabetes portfolio, the European Commission has now approved the use of Levemir during pregnancy following a review of results from the Novo-Nordisk Phase 3b study in 265 pregnant women with type I diabetes. As regards the early clinical pipeline Novo-Nordisk has completed a single dose Phase 1 trial with a novel oral long acting insulin NN1953.</p>
          <p>We've also completed single and multiple dose Phase 1 trials with a novel oral long acting GLP-1 analog NN9924. For the oral GLP-1 insulin clinical project the overall goal for the comprehensive Phase 1 program is to identify the ideal combination of novel analog and formulation to allow for one or more one stage tablet preparations to be selected for full development. So far we're witnessing encouraging progress in both programs.</p>
          <p>Furthermore the injectable GLP-1 portfolio is on track with <mark type="ph" /> reclicide obesity (11:41) project has completed recruitment in October last year while <mark type="ph" /> the beta (11:45) and the IDegLira combo trials are nearing completion of patient recruitment.</p>
          <p>Finally, once-weekly semaglutide is ready for Phase 3 start-go decision, once its profile can be compared up against the clinical <mark type="ph" /> early reclicide devo data (12:04) emerging later this half prior to the selection of which once weekly GLP-1 compound to develop through Phase 3.</p>
          <p>Moving now on to biopharmaceuticals, four important events took place during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In hemophilia, we finalized the largest registration trial conducted for a factor VIII product. Thus Turoctocog alfa was dosed to 150 hemophilia A patients with 75 exposures each and the safety profile was positive with no patients developing inhibitors and only a very low level of adverse events being reported. The high success rate of 85% was observed in on-demand treatment of bleeds and a low level of new bleeds occurred.</p>
          <p>Turoctocog alfa furthermore demonstrated a 100% success rate implementing surgical bleeds. Equally positive results were found in a pediatric study of 63 patients. Based on these results, Nova-Nordisk will work towards submission of the regulatory dossier to agencies during the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Recently, we have received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding recombinant factor XIII application for congenital deficiency. The U.S. agency asks for additional information prior to considering the factor XIII product for approval and we will work closely with FDA to provide such additional data.</p>
          <p>Turning to growth hormone Novo-Nordisk has initiated a Phase 1 trial with a once-weekly human growth hormone compound with a protraction mechanism that is novel to this field. The aim of the trial is to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and dynamics of the compound in healthy male subjects.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in inflammation, Nova-Nordisk has completed a Phase 2a trial of Anti-IL-20 in 67 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We filed mets primary endpoint of a statistically significant effect on the efficacy measure, test 28-CRP after 12 weeks of treatment with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile.</p>
          <p>Based on these positive date, Novo-Nordisk expects to progress Anti-IL-20 into phase 2b later this year. The phase 2b trial will investigate the following principle elements of relevance to a potential future phase 3 program. Selection of final dose and patient population, identification of significant clinical differentiators to allow for commercial success and validation of clinical response biomarkers.</p>
          <p>With that over to Jesper for an update on the financial results for 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mads. Please turn to the next slide. In 2011, sales increased by 9% measured in Danish krone to DDK66.3 billion and by 11% in local currencies compared to 2010. The underlying production economy improved by 40 basis points in 2011, the improvement is mainly due to a positive product mix impact driven the conversion from human to modern insulins.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of the negative currency impact of 20 basis points, the reported gross margin improved by 20 basis points to DKK81.0 million in 2011. Total non-production related costs increased by 5% in local currencies and by 3% reported in Danish currencies.</p>
          <p>S&amp;D costs increased by 4% primarily reflecting increased sales promotion in the U.S. and China and the sales force expansion in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2010. Moreover, selling and distribution costs in 2011 include costs related to the manufacturers' fee part of the U.S. healthcare reform.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D cost in 2011 remained at an absolute level similar to that in 2010 whereas the cost level in 2010 reflects the execution of the phase 3a programs for both Degludec and DegludecPlus. The cost level in 2011 reflects the initiation of pivotal trial activities within diabetes care, obesity, and hemophilia.</p>
          <p>Operating profit increased by 18% to DKK22.4 billion. In local currency, the growth was 22%. Net financials showed an expense of DKK449 million in 2011 compared to an expense of DKK605 million in 2010. For 2011, the foreign exchange result was an expense of DKK322 million compared to an expense of DKK1.341 billion in 2010.</p>
          <p>The foreign exchange loss in 2011 reflect losses on foreign exchange hedging contracts primarily related to the Japanese yen due to the appreciation versus Danish kroner in 2011 compared to the exchange level &#x2013; exchange rate level prevailing in 2010 and also in the last quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate for 2011 was 22%, which is slightly lower than the latest guidance of a tax rate of around 23% for the full year of 2011. The lower than expected tax rate primarily relates to a reassessment of tax provisions in the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. The two graphs illustrate the development of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus the Danish kroner. The tables on the right show the expected annual impact on operating profit of a 5% movement in each of our key invoicing currencies and the current extent of hedging for the same currencies.</p>
          <p>During 2011, the average exchange rate for the U.S. dollar versus the Danish kroner was approximately 5% lower than in 2010. However, at present, the value of the U.S. dollar is approximately 6% above the average level of 2011.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. At the Annual General Meeting on 21 of March, 2012, the Board of Directors will propose a 40% increase in dividend to DKK14 per share of DKK1 corresponding to a payout ratio of 45.3 percentage point. For 2010, the payout ratio was 39.6% adjusted for the impact from the divestment of shares in ZymoGenetics, the payout ratio was 42.8% for 2010. In addition the Board of Directors has approved a new 12 billion share repurchase program to be executed during the coming 12 month. Novo-Nordisk will initiate this program in accordance with the Safe Harbor regulation. JPMorgan will act as the lead manager of the program and will in this capacity repurchase shares on behalf of Novo-Nordisk for an amount of up to DKK2.5 billion, during the trading period starting today and ending on the 25 of April, 2012.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an update on the financial outlook for 2012. Novo-Nordisk expects sales growth in 2012 of 7% to 11% measured in local currencies. This is based on expectations of continued market penetration for Novo Nordisk key products as well as expectations of continued intense competition, generic competition to all antidiabetic products, and the continued impact from the implementation of healthcare reforms primarily in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
          <p>Given the current level of exchange rate versus Danish kroner, the reported sales growth is expected to be around 4 percentage points higher than the growth measured in local currencies. For 2012 growth in operating profit is expected to be around 10% measured in local currencies, the outlook for growth in operating profit reflects significant costs related to the expected launch of the ultra-long-acting insulin, Degludec. Given the current level of exchange rate versus the Danish kroner, the reported operating profit growth is expected to be 7 percentage point higher than the growth measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>For 2012, Novo-Nordisk expect a net financial expense of around DKK1 billion. The current expectation primarily reflects a net loss on the foreign exchange hedging &#x2013; foreign exchange contracts hedging Novo-Nordisk's exposure in U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan.</p>
          <p>The accounting effect of the foreign exchange hedging contracts has in line with Novo-Nordisk's accounting policies been deferred for loss recognition in 2012 when the hedged operating cash flows will be realized. The effective tax rate for 2012 is expected to be in the range from 22% to 23%.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure is expected to be around DKK3.5 billion, primarily related to investments in filling capacity for biopharmaceuticals in Denmark, filling capacity for insulin <mark type="ph" /> at Luga (20:43), Russia, and new refill device production capacity in both Denmark and the U.S.</p>
          <p>Expectations for depreciation, amortization and impairment losses are around DKK2.9 billion and free cash flow is expected to be around DKK18 billion. Novo-Nordisk operates with overall term financial targets to balance short and long-term considerations, thereby ensuring a focus on shareholder value creation.</p>
          <p>The target Return on Invested Capital, or ROIC, has been changed to operating profit after-tax to net operating assets to more accurately describe the financial elements included in the ratio. Further, the target has been increased from &#x2013; to 90% from previously 70%.</p>
          <p>The previous target level assumed that proposed accounting rules regarding treatment of operating leases, the draft International Financial Reporting Standard leases, would have been implemented in the near future. However, the implementation has now been postponed and the actual content is currently unclear and as such this assumption no longer applies.</p>
          <p>All of the above expectations and our outlook are based on the assumption that the global economic environment will not significantly change business conditions for Novo-Nordisk during the remaining part of 2012 and that currency exchange rate, especially the U.S. dollar will remain at the current level versus the Danish kroner during the remaining part of 2012.</p>
          <p>This concludes the financial update, now back to you Lars.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Jesper. Now ladies and gentlemen we are moving into the Q&amp;A part. We are ready to take the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen today's question and answer session will be conducted electronically. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We'll take our first question today from Luisa Hector of Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Could we start with the situations &#x2013; the marketing situation following the termination of the Lilly, Amylin partnership. May be just update us on the situation in the GLP market and also on the insulin side whether as a consequence you're seeing increased effort from Lilly, that's the first question. And then maybe a couple of others, would you expect an FDA panel for Degludec and just a quick check on the, there was a non-recurring adjustment of provisions in the admin line in the fourth quarter, just a quick check on that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, the CEO. So, we have a non-recurring, which Jesper will take care of at the end. We have a question for the panel FDA potential and FDA panel on Degludec which Mads Krogsgaard will take care then I'll start with the first questions, which is in a way we're linked, as I understood it.</p>
          <p>So, the first comment is in relationship to the Lilly Amylin breakup, this was not entirely surprising to us in that we saw very early on that Lilly had their own ambitions within the GLP-1 area, so clearly this has created some disruption between the two parties, which caused a distraction. With the approval of Bydureon in the United States, which is the key opportunity for such a product, we are anticipating that it will have a couple of effects on us.</p>
          <p>First of all, it's our anticipation that by adding a significant sales force behind Bydureon in the U.S., the whole GLP-1 market segment is getting increased share voice in the diabetes market, hence it is going to support an expansion of the GLP-1 market, which is in everybody's interest, it's in the patient's interest, it is in Nova-Nordisk's interest.</p>
          <p>Then when we compare the two products, we have long stated that we believe we have a very competitive product on the market with Victoza against Bydureon. This has been shown by Amylin themselves in a head-to-head to trial with Victoza where we showed that we had better glucose control, we had better weight profile and better antibody profile and the only advantage that has been claimed, as we can see it, is the once-weekly injection by Bydureon up against the once daily very flexible injection with a very modern convenient device that Victoza is administered in.</p>
          <p>So, in our assessment, we have a strong competitive position against Bydureon, but they're going to help us build the market. So, we would anticipate that we will continue to be able to hold on to a capture rate north of 50%, thereby remain the leaders in the GLP-1 segment in the United States, even after the Bydureon entry.</p>
          <p>With regards to Lilly, Lilly has become very focused on their insulin business. I believe their insulin product are now the second most important in terms of their top line franchises, and they have been quite aggressive, as you've noted, we've been speaking about since the last year, year and a half basically. Gaining business early in 2011 in the United States, gaining business in Europe, in the UK in particular, but also gaining business in overseas markets in China, due to reimbursement status of their modern insulins, but also very aggressive pricing on their human insulins in China.</p>
          <p>So, it doesn't really change the matters that much for us. We are seeing Lilly as the short-term most active competitor in the insulin field, but they are active primarily in the area of human insulins. You could say, it will be a little facetious that they're buying short-term revenues in a segment, which are likely to disappear, at least as far as the developed markets are concerned, but of course we anticipate that human insulins will be available in China for quite many years into the future.</p>
          <p>So, those were the comments on Lilly, Amylin, Bydureon, and insulin and then on to Mads, to have or not to have a panel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is indeed the question and at this point I can say Luisa that we have received no information from the FDA in this regard, i.e. as to scheduling an advisory committee. That being said obviously Novo-Nordisk is preparing as if one were to come for the sheer reason that one needs to be prepared for every single situation. So we are continuously preparing for everything and when that is said we have a path towards the PDUFA action date on July 29 laid forward by the agency in terms of when, which kind of inspections, etcetera, etcetera are taking place so we're already a very busy bunch of people in regard to Decludec both vis-&#xE0;-vis the FDA, Europe and even now also other counties.</p>

          <p>We have increased the provision for employee EBIT in cost <mark type="ph" /> like UB Lease (28:45), etcetera, which was related to the lower &#x2013; the permanent lower level of interest we have and hence the discounting of those future obligations. And that is increasing our provisions in the tune of DKK50 million and if you look at the admin costs on a full-year basis, there are I'd say included this year in the growth cost in total those DKK50 million and additional DKK50 million, which you could relate to one-time relocation costs at the headquarter site, which I wouldn't expect to reoccur next year. So, overall probably to the tune of DKK100 million in non-recurring cost in 2011, DKK50 million of them in Q4 related to employee provisions.</p>

          <p>We'll take our next question today from Martin Parkh&#xF8;i of Danske Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's Martin Parkh&#xF8;i. I will stick to the two-question rule. First, with respect to China, Lars you are quoted on some newswire as stating that one of the reasons for the growth in locals in China is also due to some increased competition from local manufacturers. If local manufacturers are starting to be a big competitor, how do you draw a parallel to the risk that you're seeing from &#x2013; for bio similar in all other regions, because you've always stressed that you were still holding on in China despite a lot of local producers.</p>
          <p>And then second question, with respect to Victoza, I guess that in the guidance you have given to the market, you at least have been wrong, since it's now already a clear blockbuster in 2011. We're seeing more than DKK500 million in quarter-on-quarter growth from Q3 to Q4. So, it's a no-brainer that if that will continue then it will explode also in 2012. Can you give some kind of guidance on where we should expect quarter-on-quarter growth because this has just increased from Q2 to Q3 and then from Q3 to Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Martin. Thanks for reminding us, keeping us honest. With regards to China, what I've mentioned is that we have seen some market share erosion in human insulins. I would say, most of its probably Eli Lilly, but I do believe we've also lost some to some of the local manufacturers. Price levels are getting very low, they can only compete in the local markets. And they have to have some revenues. So, I don't see that necessarily translating into a big risk on the international scene, I don't believe these companies have significant capacity wherewithals to compete at us globally.</p>
          <p>But it is a factor. We're somewhat disappointed about the fact that the Chinese market did not rebound in the fourth quarter. And what I stated I think also to some of the wires today is that it's our anticipation that when we look at 2012 we should have consumed the upheaval in the marketplace due to the healthcare reform, but also due to the fact that we've gotten the human insulin on these local essential drug lists and tenders in the provincial governments. And therefore we're getting into a situation where we have a more stable market situation and straight bidding. And our anticipation is that we will see growth rates of our business in China of around 15% going forward.</p>
          <p>We see as you saw also in 2011 30% growth of our modern insulins and flat human insulin business. When you look at the IMS market, the IMS market predicts a growth &#x2013; volume growth at the moment of around 18% in China. Now they are biased in the sense that they are taking their measurements at the hospital level. And the government in China is pushing the patients to visit the community clinics. And so this is not really representing the volume and that growth is actually slower than what has been seen at the hospital level due to simple lack of healthcare capacity to diagnose and to treat diabetics.</p>
          <p>So, we think with 15% we should be able to hold our own in terms of market share in China, long-term can we remain at 60% that's probably a stretch. We have in our vision to stay above 50%, so in all our plans we have calculated with some erosion of market share going forward. But that's the nature of things in terms of insulin and China.</p>
          <p>With regards to blockbuster, and that's an interesting one. I think, I have been more right than most people on this, of course I have been a little bit ahead of ourselves in terms of predicting that there would be a blockbuster in 2012 and we did manage to achieve that status in 2011 and that is correct.</p>
          <p>Now, of course, anybody's guess, we can make further projections. We now have competition and of course that means that there will be some of the new patients coming in rather than going to Byetta, they will be going to Bydureon. So, we're anticipating that we will keep a capture rate of 50% plus. So, therefore it may not increase our market share in the GLP-1 segment. The key question for us is market growth, and that is a little bit uncertain.</p>
          <p>When you look at some of the early markets where we've introduced the product, they have confirmed our original notion which was that we should see a potential of the GLP-1 segment to be at 10% of the overall value of the diabetes market. This has been arrived at in Denmark, which is the furthest advanced. Other markets are trying to put volume restrictions on the introduction. But &#x2013; so, that's the long-term guidance we can give you &#x2013; use 10%, but that will be arrived at a different point in time in different countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, just a little follow up on that because as you have seen in the &#x2013; from the second to the third quarter, you almost saw an increase of DKK300 million. Then, in the &#x2013; from the third to the fourth quarter, you saw almost DKK550 million increase. If I just add DKK250 million to each quarter in 2011, then it'll be a double blockbuster or &#x2013; I'm sorry in 2012 of course, then it will be a blockbuster already in 2012, is that realistic?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't believe that, but we are not giving guidance as you know Martin on individual products, I think &#x2013; we hope that you're right. But I don't &#x2013; I don't think it's realistic. Let's move on to the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Richard Vosser of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my questions &#x2013; two please. Just on the U.S. insulin market share &#x2013; just from the script trends, it appears you started off the year with a couple of percentage points share gain for the modern insulins and <mark type="ph" /> glargine mix (36:10) completely different picture to the beginning of 2011. Is this just the KMR contract, could you talk us through the dynamics involved in taking the share there?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just on Degludec and just in light of the extension data which looks good and reiterates the hypoglycemia benefit for the product. But also in light of the of the austerity conditions that we see across Europe at least. Could you share your current thinking in terms of the ability to achieve premium pricing for the product, where you're thinking about it in terms of that? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, certainly. Well, you're pointing exactly to some of the, a couple of very interesting issues, the dynamics we see in the marketplace. If we take the &#x2013; and I think we mentioned this last year, when Lilly became extraordinarily aggressive in the pricing that we were not seeing a long-term future in the human insulin market. But then on the other hand, of course we don't want to surrender all the patients to our competitors. So that meant that we actually &#x2013; we actually did sharpen our pen, so to speak, and became more competitive. And you saw a result of this with the KMR contract, and yes it is correct that we have seen a pickup of our two main modern insulins, Levemir and NovoLog in the U.S. in the beginning of the year as opposed to the drop that we saw in the beginning of 2011.</p>
          <p>So, there's also different conditions on the KMR contract and the contracts we lost because the KMR contract is a future contract and &#x2013; so there is more switching and for switching taking place. So we should stand to gain from that, so a better situation medium-to-short term in the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>With regards to Degludec, a very interesting point that you are right that the economic conditions in Europe doesn't seem very favorable for significant premiums, but when we look at pricing, we look at global pricing. And so, what you should expect to see is, you should expect to see us, based on a comparison to Lantus, require a modest premium.</p>
          <p>And this would of course for some economies in Europe be a challenge. There is no doubt about this, southern European countries are finding it difficult and that means that reimbursement and introduction in perhaps Southern European countries are going to be slower and longer in coming and perhaps in some markets, we'll not be able to launch, because we have some considerations for the rub-off, the spill off effect of the price in the whole market towards markets in the emerging economies. So, it'll be an interesting situation that we'll actually end up with having access issues in Europe, which is a new thing &#x2013; a relatively new thing on these new and modern medicines. Jesper, do you have anything to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the capture rate for new scripts in North America, there may also for Novo-Nordisk be some impact in recent months from the shortage that we've seen in the markets from Glulisine. It's a little bit uncertain how big effect it can have and it seems that, that situation have now more normalized, but I think there is an element in the pickup in our empirics which may be related to a shortage of Glulisine in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Mads, you just had a comment on hypos and Degludec?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's just a notion that &#x2013; that of course our health economics that have worked on this ever since Phase 2. They are walking down three roads to make sure that we create the best possible platform. And of course they are, as you correctly mentioned Richard, really supported by the data. So, on safety it's about the value of reducing hypoglycemia as we've discussed often before. On efficacy, it's about the potential for in a real life situation, actually improving glucodynamic measures because of the enhanced safety, which we're not able to do in a Phase 3 treat-to-target trial, but you can come back to the agencies at later points with the real world evidence. And then finally because of the both flexibility and also because of the consistency of the molecule, that's also something about the cost of glucose scripts and so on. So, overall what Lars alluded to as a modest premium is something that is really justifiable from a health economic perspective, but of course there are these regional differences as described by Lars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, and you have probably read the recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine, where they have investigated medicines that cause hospitalization due to side effects and insulin is actually the second most commonly causing hospitalization due to hypoglycemia, which is of course a side effect or an unwanted effect from the insulin. So, it is indeed not a trivial problem. And of course, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:27) had been here today, he would have likened the occurrence of severe hypos, even though they are relatively rare in type 2 diabetes to the situation of airbags in cars. I would imagine that it is a very small proportion of the airbags that have been installed in cars around the world that are ever used for this intention, but they are there because when the event occurs, it can be traumatic and it can be damaging.</p>
          <p>And so, I think, it's the same notion that we like in a way to describe hypos. These are not trivial. These render the patients unable to fend for themselves. If it's during the night, it can have serious cerebral effects; if it happens during day, it can cause accidents and other unpleasant things. So, we think we've got a good case story building up here. Thank you. Next question please?</p>

          <p>And our next question today comes from Carsten Madsen of Carnegie Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you very much. Just two questions here to start off with one for &#x2013; first one for Mads, say, on your long-acting Victoza or Semaglutide, why you're not starting the Phase 1 trial with LA Victoza. Does this mean that you're closer to making a decision about which one of these molecules you will work on going forward? And also in that relation, will you skip Phase 2 and go directly into Phase 3 when you have completed Phase 1 trials?</p>
          <p>Second question is for Jesper, on CapEx, you've guided for DKK3.5 billion in CapEx for 2012. That is actually the same level as you've been spending for last three years despite the fact that your franchise has expanded significantly. When will you ever need to spend more money on CapEx? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I know that Jesper will be delighted to talk about this but why don't we start with Mads.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. As regards the new molecule namely Semaglutide, first of all we will be announcing the long awaited Phase 2 data at conferences this year. That being said of course we've also kind of shaped up the molecule in preparation of this decision as to whether this one goes into Phase 3 or the Liraglutide Depot formulation goes into further development. Semaglutide will be ready for entering Phase 3 with a highly competitive profile while the Liraglutide Depot, we simply don't know yet. And that's the whole dilemma that we are getting clinical data later in this first half of the year and then they will enable management come summer time to make a decision of which one to enter into final development.</p>
          <p>Can we skip Phase 2 for the Liraglutide Depot? In principle, yes, as we've seen for other depot preparations such as Bydureon. But Bydureon actually did one phase 2 trial. So it is an open ended question and I think I'd like to wait until summer time and you will get very insightful on exactly what we are doing with which of these molecules, but it's a nice position to be in to have the selection process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And then Jesper, CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've guided to the level of DKK3.5 billion and I think the guidance I'd give for the range 2012 to 2014 would be an investment level in the ballpark of 5% of sales. I think we will spend resources and invest in facilities enable us to rollout the new device that you will see us use with Degludec, DegludecPlus, and longer term replacing the FlexPen device and there will be investment going in that direction. You've seen that included expanding our facilities in Denmark and U.S. in the first wave, but of course as we are selling more than 300 million of FlexPens per year, it is significant investment there's longer term involved in this area.</p>
          <p>So, that would be a key area of investment and then also longer term &#x2013; if there is one thing that can make a change to the level of bulk production facilities we need for API production, that would be the success that Mads would be able to demonstrate with the portfolio of all protein projects we have under development, both in terms of GLP-1's and also the insulin projects. However, it's still early stage, so I think it'll probably be beyond 2014 for those significant investments to materialize if we are successful in that area. So, I think you are comfortable in using a 5% guidance for 2012 to 2014 and that will be probably suffice for now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on the factor VIII. Can you please explain us again what is the differentiation for this drug versus the existing and what is the biggest competitors in order for you to grab material market share, medium term and long term? And also I have two questions with regards to margins. First, R&amp;D in 2012, is it fair to expect stabilization around DKK9.6 billion in absolute terms and regarding the gross margin, is it also possible to assume an improvement to the same magnitude as what we saw over 2010 to 2011. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I'll start with the first, then Mads can pitch in, then Jesper can take some of the questions on the margins. Factor VIII is a bio-similar factor VIII basically to the leading VIII products in the market. The trial that we have conducted has demonstrated a very very stable process and no antibody reactions on the trial participants even though it's the largest trial that has been conducted both in adults and in children. So, it's an effective and very safe and so far no antibody eliciting factor VIII. See, we've developed this because we want to develop a long-acting factor VIII and this is the backbone on which we will be doing a long-acting factor VIII and so our ideal situation is that we will have this product as a bio-similar factor VIII and an improved factor VIII in terms of a long-acting factor VIII which will give us a wonderful situation when going to market where we can &#x2013; especially in the emerging markets where there are in a way as you always know two segments.</p>
          <p>There is one segment which can afford high-end product such as a potential new long-acting VIII and then there are price-sensitive segments which are public health segments where a bio-similar factor VIII might be well suited. So, that's the whole idea. Of course, the proof of the pudding is in the eating and whether we can differentiate the long-acting factor VIII and Mads can perhaps say a few things about this before we go to the margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Lars, and I think you've covered it nicely, so I'll do very briefly. It is indeed a <mark type="ph" /> b-domain triumphant (48:50). So of course it's a different molecule from the others in the industry, but essentially it is a bio-similar approach in terms of having a more realistic profile. And many people are asking me why didn't you see a single inhibitor patient even though you had 150 in the trial? And the short answer is we cannot know and nobody knows which epitope or which folding structure which contaminant or which immunological phenomena in the individual boys or men that precipitates inhibitors, nobody knows the underlying mechanisms in that regard.</p>
          <p>All we can relate to is the fact that we have neither in kids or boys nor in adults seen any inhibitors at this point. So if you combine a very high efficacy virtual safety profile with the formulation into a very decent device that we will take the opportunity to also rapid into, then I think that we are in a situation to grab market share as Lars alluded to. Of course there are also different markets and more and more tenders going on, even in the Western markets nowadays and of course Novo-Nordisk now will have a very nice offering in that regard and also serving as a backbone for any GPs. So I think it's a good position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jesper, then on R&amp;D and other improvements, productivity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank God, Mads didn't take the long version. In terms of &#x2013; in terms of gross margin we have guided to &#x2013; this year we believe we can make an improvement in our gross margin between 50 to 100 basis points where we last year have realized 40 basis point improvement. We've had an expected bigger impact from healthcare reform last year and we also see a value in the rollout of Victoza that will have a recurring effect on our gross margins, so 50 to 100 basis points in local currency improvement and on top of that it's our anticipation with the current currencies that you probably should anticipate some 40 basis point currency impact in the positive direction. So 2012 at present looks like it will be quite positive on the development in gross margin.</p>
          <p>In terms of the other cost ratio we're expecting a selling and distribution ratio in the same ballpark as where we were in 2011, so let say around 29% and the actual amount is going to be very dependent on the precise approval of Degludec, it's basically in the U.S. In terms of R&amp;D a ratio of between 14% to 15% to sales which of course will then imply that we will see a significant growth in absolute terms compared to last year. So I saw the stable absolute level of R&amp;D investment in 2011 as an abnormal situation. Nova-Nordisk are continuing to expand our R&amp;D activities and we also expect to do that.</p>
          <p>We have initiated a portfolio of pivotal trials in the second half of 2011 and those costs will impact us on a full year basis in 2012. So, R&amp;D ratio of 14% to 15%. In terms of admin ratio, we are moving towards the 4.5 percentage point to sales in admin ratio. So admin should continue to grow significantly less than the top line. So, that would be some guidance of the individual cost ratios.</p>

In terms of GLP-1s, can you help us understand what proportion of global value share could be ex U.S. become in the future. Just trying to understand some of the dynamics between the sort of 1.2 and 1.8 mix split? How budget is doing outside the U.S. and in markets, it's launched, it wasn't in your charts it was just the Victoza and exenatide comparison. And how successful do you think these volume caps could be. So, first question, ex U.S. GLP-1 and how large this could be as a proportion of the market in Victoza?</p>
          <p>And then the second question you just mentioned that there are going to be some countries going forward, that are a little bit more price sensitive when it comes to their insulin choice. And I just wondered if you could hazard a guess in terms of what proportion of the market you believe could stomach, a 10%, 20%, 30% premium for Degludec over Levemir. And what proportion of the market would be much more attracted to bio-similar glargine formulations from Wockhardt and Lilly, I guess, which should be entering the market in 2015.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Mark. This is Lars Rebien here. In terms of overseas GLP-1 markets, whether we can use the model that we described for developed markets of a 10% value. I think, it's a stretch because you know the nature of these markets are that there is a large public sector, which is very, very low priced and in fact generic and generic insulins are also used in those markets. So, I find it a stretch to see in the next five to seven years that markets like China, markets like India, markets outside of the developed markets will arrive at 10% of the total value of the diabetes market being GLP-1's.</p>
          <p>In regards to Bydureon. Bydureon has had a reasonable decent launch in Germany, more modest success in the UK. The real proof of the pudding is the United States as you can see also from our numbers, that 65% of the business is coming from the U.S. So, it is whether or not they'll make it or break it in the U.S., which is important. And so, we could say, so far focusing from our perspective, it has been modestly successful and following very much the trajection that we had anticipated.</p>
          <p>In terms of how one should think about, for instance, European markets in terms of which are going to be price sensitive going forward, that's a tough call, but I mean, if we just look at assuming that markets such as France, Germany, UK, Scandinavian markets, and also some of the Northern, Eastern European markets are reasonable to get through with innovation. You could probably take 60-40 as a split whereas the 60% of the market in Europe might be amenable to a premium whereas 40% would be more long winded discussions and more perhaps accepting a bio-similar approach. And so, that would be my rough guess, but it's completely guesswork right now.</p>

          <p>And Mark, in terms of distribution of usage of GLP-1 outside the U.S., it's our assessment that in the reimbursed markets you're looking at something like 90% of the patients using the 1.2 microgram version of the product; so that's the most predominant form used. Also the general weight in some of the IO markets is slower, so you probably should anticipate the lower dose version used and then bear in mind that the approved version in Japan is an 0.9 microgram, so that's some guidance on the amount of drug used.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry and in terms of &#x2013; sorry, sorry guys and in terms of the cap how do you think that's going to work out, because it's obviously it's pretty difficult to get anything paid for here in the UK but as a proportion of the diabetes market with the kind of the grading you are showing slide 10, you're getting a close to 9% GLP-1 as a proportion of the value the diabetes market in UK and France is already at 10%, so I'm just wondering when and if these caps are actually are going to come in, how effective they're going to be, because in some of these markets in Europe, you're already hitting your kind of long-term target as it were?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and then but I do think the whole issue for us is that we get the product into the market place and we get an ability to present the clinical benefits from the product. So, yes I do think it's going to be difficult for the authorities to make those caps effective, because the medical profession and patient associations, they really see these as a very very beneficial treatments, that effectively deals with their diabetes in a very low risk way, and then they have all of the other virtues of weight lowering and blood pressure lowering. So it is going to be difficult, but it's going to be temporary measures that will be put in place in many markets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And you can see Mark that the 10% in patient level we gave for GLP-1 out of the total diabetes care segment was given on a global basis. We think that's a realistic level. We've seen individual markets reaching above that, and I think that the key deciding factor here is really how long time can we make patients saying good control on a product like Victoza, and if the stay time can go beyond 2-3 years of course then the number of patients on the product will gradually grow.</p>
          <p>We've seen a steady growth in the number of patients on Victoza and we estimate currently that we have more than half a million patients on Victoza. As long as we continue to see a steady increase in that, I don't think &#x2013; I think it's going to be hard for healthcare regulators to take patients off a drug that keeps them in good control with limited hassle for the decision and limited risk of hypoglycemia.</p>

          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen. Unfortunately I wanted to take a last question, but we've already run over time and we have an investor call in the city that we have run off to. We thank you all for participating this afternoon. Thank you for interest in Novo Nordisk and we will be continuing to come back, hopefully with good results. Thanks.</p>
