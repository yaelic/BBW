          <p>All participants please stand by. Your meeting is ready to begin. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Suncor First Quarter Conference Call and web cast. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Rogers, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Rogers, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ruth, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter Conference Call. I have in the room with me, Rick George, our President and CEO; Steve Williams, our Chief Operating Officer; Bart Demosky, the CFO; Maureen Cormier, Vice President Controller; and Joleen Gilamo from the Controller's department ; and Helen Kelly, of course, is with us also.</p>
          <p>Now Rick's going to kick us off with his comments on the quarter and a bit about the business and then we'll go from there. So Rick, I'll turn it over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>John, thanks a lot, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>We've got a little bit of ground to cover today, so I thought the best part of these calls is usually trying to give you a real good feel for how we think things are going here at Suncor. And obviously, we would have preferred to speak to you about things that we're delivering on rather than our hopes and dreams and we do have a lot going on in this company.</p>
          <p>So specifically today what I'd like to cover is operational reliability. We'll give you an update on the merger. We'll give you an update on future growth and our thinking about when we'll be able to talk about that in more detail. And then an update on re: when we think we'll be through this and the path forward so. And also Bart will give you some comments on the quarter itself and then we'll open up for questions and answers. I am going to ask both Steve Williams and Bart Demosky to help on certain parts of this this morning so you'll have 3 speakers.</p>
          <p>So anyway, let's get started with operational reliability and listen, like many of you on the call, we are very disappointed with our performance in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. What I can assure you is that we have taken this very seriously, that all of our management and, by the way, all of our employees are not happy with the 2 incidents we had at our Oil Sands upgrader in the fourth quarter of last year, the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>We have made a lot of progress over these last several years at Oil Sands and are really a bit shocked to have 2 incidents like this back to back. We have &#x2013; what I would say is that we have brought in experts. Steve will talk about that more in a minute and are taking actions to try to minimize the possibility of this happening again.</p>
          <p>Now if you think about us compared to our competitors in the Oil Sands space, I think we're no better, no worse, but of course that's not the goal. We are very uncomfortable because we've always been a leader and it's our intent to stay in that leadership position.</p>
          <p>If you think about the company overall, I just want to step back, our International and East Coast assets are working well. Our Natural Gas downstream assets are operating at very safe, reliable fashion. We've monitored both safety and operational statistics on all those assets and, if anything, they're exceeding our guidance and the things that we've put out to you. It is just these two issues around the upgrader that have delayed us coming out of the gate here.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to do now is ask Steve to jump in. Steve Williams, who is our Chief Operating Officer, talk about what he and his team at Oil Sands are doing to reestablish that leadership position. Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. First let me just reiterate what Rick has already said there. We're tremendously disappointed with the 2 incidents, the one we had in December and February. And when I say we I do mean from senior management right the way down to the operators. It did put, if you cast your mind back, it put a tremendous damper on what was an outstanding year. Last year we set daily, weekly, monthly and annual records on the mine, on in-situ, extraction and upgrading. So to have such a disappointing entry here was tough for us.</p>
          <p>We are absolutely determined that we will resolve the issues at Oil Sands. I do want to reinforce a couple of things, though. In this business, often when we have issues it's to do with the resource. That's not the case for us. It comes down to equipment and processes that we deploy. So the good news from that is it's within our control to fix it.</p>
          <p>To get to the bottom of what are the issues are here, as Rick said, we did bring in the best the world has to offer in terms of independent advisors. So we had A.T. Kearney, DuPont and PilCo in here and we charged the group with 2 activities, quite different ways of looking at the problem.</p>
          <p>The first one was a rigorous fact-based review of every event we've had on those plants over the last 5 years. That piece was &#x2013; the consultant who helped us do that was A.T. Kearney. And they were able to use their worldwide benchmarking system which compared and brought best practice from 50 other facilities around the world.</p>
          <p>The second piece of work we did in parallel was what we called a qualitative review, which really was interviews with 51 of our people from the most senior level right the way through to the maintenance technician and the operator technician. And that was just to make sure for all of the assets and practices and processes we thought we had in place that these things were actually having effect where the rubber hits the road. So we checked everything through that practice and culture study at the same time.</p>
          <p>So at the very highest level, in summary, we found a few things and none of them are complete surprise when you hear them. First one, obviously, we've been in a decade of very fast change in Oil Sands, a significant change in people, significant changes in processes. And process, by processes, I mean the way we get things done and significant changes, mainly additions, to the assets through this period of high growth. And of course, for the base plant we're at the end of that period of high growth, so it's a period of consolidation.</p>
          <p>The study is complete in terms of its analysis. It's just entering its final recommendations phases and we'll conclude that work over the next couple of weeks. Both Rick and myself sit on the Steering Committee. We took our board through the phases of it yesterday.</p>
          <p>If I had to summarize in just one phrase where the improvement plans are going to be focused, it's about back to basics. Amongst all that level of activity, we need to get back to some of the good practices we know how to do. So as part of our operation's Excellence initiative, you've heard me speak in the past about how we've been implementing a process safety management approach, which is the industry's best approach for these types of operation. So I don't want you to think for one second that that means we're complacent, but it does mean that we've got a head start on doing some of this work.</p>
          <p>Now in some cases, we've taken immediate action and right now we have a double-check on every critical operation that's going on, on the plant and we'll continue that until we displace it with a better practice. So that means some of the things we're doing are taking longer. Overall, the investigation has helped to sharpen our focus and we will be increasing the pace of our archway to operational excellence. But it has confirmed we're on the right track.</p>
          <p>We have a lot of other measurements we take underneath the headline Production and Cost Numbers and almost without exception, all of those key indicators are moving in the right direction. So some great progress has been made. As I say, we just need to increase the pace and stay the course with operational excellence.</p>
          <p>So if I look at the current operations, you'll see we had an excellent startup on Unit 1. We did take the opportunity during the maintenance to do work on the mine and extraction. And you'll see that so far, the program is working. Very early days but we did post record production in April of just over 330,000 barrels a day. So a good start but we need to, as I say, we need to stay the course.</p>
          <p>Other businesses, just a brief comment, in general are doing very well, particularly pleased with safety, the reliability we're seeing across the businesses. The operating costs and the divestments in the Gas business are going very well.</p>
          <p>Rick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Steve. Now let's move on to the merger. The merger is one of the key things I think we wanted to talk about today. And as I've traveled around a bit or around Calgary here, people used to talk to me about the weather. They used to talk to me about oil prices, talk to me about gas prices. Now all I hear as I walk down the street is "How is the merger going?" So I know it is, I know it is top and center on peoples' minds.</p>
          <p>Let's just frame this up. So 2009 was really around the announcement, the initial positioning of the merger, and you'll remember, we just closed it in August. So we're only about 9 months into this. 2010 is really about driving efficiencies, and really getting this organization around to get the, as I call it, the base foundation of this organization straight and solid so that we can then build on it from there.</p>
          <p>And you'll see us in 2011, we'll come back to the centered on growth, on Oil Sands growth and other areas of growth as the new company moves forward on a very solid basis. So the short answer to the question about, Rick, how's the merger going is &#x2013; I actually feel really good about where we are. I think if you look back a year from today, and you think about what all we've accomplished in the last 12 months, I feel really great about it. I think the merger was done at the right time. The bottom of the market's always a good time to do a transaction. And we did it right, pretty close to the bottom of the market.</p>
          <p>I think it's going to drive unbelievably good value on a go forward basis. And we have had some consultants in that really have helped us through trying to measure how the merger is going, so that we actually make sure we're on the right track. And what we get out of them is that the progress we've made in the last 9 months since August 1, would rank us to top quartiles in terms of how mergers go. Now that doesn't mean it's perfect. It doesn't mean we're done. But it does mean that I think we feel really good about the track we're on. And if you &#x2013; if I can take you back to the synergies, at the time of the merger we announced $300 million of expense savings, and $1 billion on cost savings. And I'm not &#x2013; we've upped that number to 400 million on expenses, the expense number only here a quarter ago. I can just tell you that our expectation is that the number is going to be considerably higher than that.</p>
          <p>I won't give you the new number because I don't want to declare where we are until we're absolutely certain, certain of delivery. But what I would expect to do is come back to you in the third or fourth quarter, give you what we think the final number is, and then put that to bed. We are very solid on the $1 billion of capital synergies. In fact, we think it's a lot higher than that. But we will actually &#x2013; now just put a nail in the coffin on the $1 billion of capital savings synergies. It's going to actually be more of a struggle to measure it than it is to move forward. So feel really good about that, and again we'll be back to you on the expense side of that.</p>
          <p>If you then move on to the asset divestitures, both here and North America, and on International, we're, first of all, the pricing that we've gotten for assets that we've sold has been above our expectations. We are very much on schedule.</p>
          <p>So to date, we have agreements. We don't have the cash in, but we have agreements on about $1.5 billion in asset sales. And I expect this divestment program on the assets to be totally adopted and be done before the end of the year. So we'll have this behind us.</p>
          <p>And again, the pricing has been very good on this. We actually expect that our total proceeds from these asset divestments is going to be over $3 billion. There's been a lot of interest on the assets that we haven't announced. I will tell you that we do have multiple bidders and the process is going very well.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are in the process of closing our London, England office. We are going &#x2013; we here in Calgary are going into one building. So the Suncor Energy Centre building is being renovated. It hasn't been renovated since the '80s and we're on track to have everyone into that building by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>We are currently located in the Sun Life building here in Calgary, and I can tell you, two-thirds of the space that we have here is already sub-leased and we're working hard on the other third. So this shows you things are moving along and we are making real progress.</p>
          <p>The one other thing we did hear about 5, 6 months ago is we did an ultra survey with our employees. So this is relatively close after the close. And not so surprising, people are going through a tough adjustment to the new company. And so, there are certainly some challenges, some things we need to improve on. But it does also show that people are very proud to work for Canada's largest oil and gas company, understand our value systems and really believe in the strategy on a go-forward basis, which is very important. So I feel pretty good about where we are on that, not that there isn't plenty of room for improvement.</p>
          <p>So I think &#x2013; the other thing we're working hard on, this is probably the toughest, one of the toughest pieces of work and that is our whole systems and process integrations. So about 4 years ago, Suncor implemented a broad SAP program so that your finance system, HR systems, your payroll, your accounts payable, your supply chain systems, all talk to one another. We had really driven that so that we've gotten more efficient. Now with the merger, it's going to take us awhile to get back to that.</p>
          <p>And so we are actually moving all of the assets over to an SAP system and then we're going to upgrade that system as well. So this is going to be implemented in about 4 waves. The first of these releases, as we call them, will actually happen August 1 of this year and the last one will happen in the second quarter of 2011. And that will be the foundation on which we're able to drive efficiency and it will help us also to reduce costs, and then also, we will certainly have fewer head count, particularly consultants and other people as we do that. So it is very tough work, but what I would say very proud of the work that's being done and very much looking forward to getting that done overall.</p>
          <p>So many of you have asked for more specifics around how we're going to grow this operation. We've talked a lot about &#x2013; we feel very confident that, that our Oil Sands operation can grow by 10 to 12% per year on a go-forward basis. We still remain very confident of that.</p>
          <p>We are working full steam ahead on Firebag 3. We have over 2,000 construction workers on site there now. That, that &#x2013; Firebag 3 will be complete by the second quarter of 2011. And we're also working on Firebag 4. It should come on the second half of 2012. And as you know, we have some 26 billion barrels of resources to support that growth, that kind of growth for a decade or more. And so we're working hard on the engineering, but also on the strategy of lying out which projects go next and the exact order of timing of that. We will be back out to you later this fall with that.</p>
          <p>And one reasons, I'm not trying to rush that, is we just want to make sure that we do all of our homework around getting costs down in these projects, get the engineering far enough along and making sure that we proceed with the right projects after Firebag 4. So we'll have a chance to talk about that either at the end of the third or the end of the fourth quarter. So &#x2013; and I think from then on, the transparency of this growth will be, will be very clear to you.</p>
          <p>One of the reasons we're doing that as well is it's very important that this company get our foundation of processes and systems correct before I &#x2013; we refocus this organization on growth. Without that solid foundation, then driving these synergistic value would extend for a much longer period of time. So I just feel very strongly that there's this sequence to this, that's very important.</p>
          <p>And looking forward, we expect to exit this year with very good, strong production, in Oil Sands, but also across the entire company. We expect to have our cash costs in Oil Sands in the low $30's. The East Coast International assets will be producing full out. Our National Gas business, the divestments complete and that will be moving forward. And then we also expect to have an organization that the processes that are improving and an organization that's in one building that fully aligns. So really looking forward to getting to that position and again, lifting off from there. So that's where we are.</p>
          <p>And now, I'll turn it over to Bart, who will say a few things about the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Rick and good morning, everyone. As I'm sure you've probably all seen in our press release this morning, our operating earnings in the first quarter were 287 million, and cash from ops, 1.124 billion. I just want to touch on a couple of key factors that influenced the results this quarter, the first being higher benchmark prices and the results certainly reflect stronger crude oil prices. We've been the beneficiaries of that, partially offset by the strong Canadian dollar, and weak natural gas prices as well. WTI was 78.70 a barrel during the quarter, and natural gas for us averaged at 5.35 an Mcf at AECO.</p>
          <p>Now the light heavy differentials at Hardesty were constructive as well. In fact they were quite tight, at U.S. 895 a barrel. Refining margins recovered from seasonal lows of Q4, and are slightly ahead of Q1, '09. So all of those factors were working in our favor, and had an impact on the results. As both Rick and Steve have touched on, though, the other factor that impacted us in the quarter certainly was lower volumes. They were lower than expected, mainly as a result of the operational upsets at the, at the Oil Sands upgraders. And we had an impact there of about 98,000 barrels per day lower than our previous guidance of 300 a day for the year.</p>
          <p>It also had a negative impact on our downstream results as they had to supplement proprietary feed with third party purchases to meet our contractual requirements. And also had some additional refined product purchases that we had to make to meet demand. I'd estimate that the total impact of those fires on operating earnings was just about 600 million and the impact on cash flow about 800 million in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Also impacting volumes was International, they were slightly below guidance of 138 at 133,000 barrels per day. And really the story there was restrictions, production restrictions in Libya, and some unplanned maintenance at Buzzard during the quarter. But that was fairly minor.</p>
          <p>On the flip side of that, positively impacting volumes was our East Coast operations where production averaged 75,000 barrels per day, exceeding our current guidance of 60,000 a day, and previous guidance of 55 a day, so tremendous results there. And higher production at Hibernia, driven off of better reliability and stronger reservoir performance was the story there. Natural gas averaged 733 million cubic feet a day. And that was a fair amount above our guidance of 680 a day as well. And our Syncrude operations added 32,000 barrels per day of volumes, and contributed about $14 million to net earnings.</p>
          <p>Our Refining and Marketing operation also had a very strong quarter, and delivered 196 million to net earnings. And that's really a reflection, I think, of additional throughput volumes that came to the table through the merger, as well as continuing strong retail margins for that business. It's been a very positive situation for that part of the business for a while. And we did add some more stations that were producing results over the quarter as well.</p>
          <p>Now with our lower Oil Sands production we did see higher costs and it's really a matter of the math when you're spreading a large amount of fixed costs over a lower volume, it just leads to higher prices. And our cash costs per barrel in the quarter ended up at just under $55 compared to our guidance of 35 to 39.</p>
          <p>Now those costs also included $40 million from Mackay River, but also reflect higher production from our Firebag operations. Slightly offsetting that, those Oil Sands costs, were royalties which were significantly lower than last quarter as a result of the lower volumes. And on the in situ side, we did see a decline in operating costs there, continuing to move in a very positive direction, down to 19.35 a barrel from $20.30 in Q4, and that's despite higher natural gas prices quarter-over-quarter, so this was really driven by improved production volumes from that business.</p>
          <p>Just to turn to the balance sheet for a moment, as we drive towards our goal of lowering our net debt to about 10 billion, we're closely watching two things, first being cash flow from ops, and the second being, of course, where we're at on our divestment proceeds.</p>
          <p>And although our cash flow in the quarter from operations was not as strong as it will be going forward, we still came out of the quarter in respectable shape with our net debt down to about 13.1 billion. And as Rick said, we already have agreements in place on about 1.5 billion of divestitures and to date have received just under 900 million of that. So we're targeting 3 to 4 billion now in total divestitures. So bringing our debt down towards that 10 billion mark by year end does still look quite achievable.</p>
          <p>So looking forward, we have a heavy slate of turnarounds in our upstream assets in 2010, particularly in Q2, although the third quarter has much less of an impact, so we should start to see a clear picture of the results from the operations. These turnarounds, of course, will impact financial results, but by the fourth quarter there is minimal production impact from turnarounds in the schedule.</p>
          <p>So all that adding up, we do expect to continue building on operational efficiencies and financial momentum throughout the year and that's something I'm feeling very good about.</p>
          <p>So that concludes my comment, so I'll turn it back to John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks Rick and Steve and Bart. As you saw in the outlook, there were some minor adjustments to production numbers, particularly around Oil Sands, where we are now predicting production volumes of 280,000 barrels a day. And that has more to do with what happened in the first quarter, versus what we are expecting in the future. Cash costs, 38 to 42, again more of what happened in the first quarter versus what we're, versus what we're &#x2013; a change in our view of the future. And Bart did mention the &#x2013; particularly the East Coast had a very good quarter, and we did take the opportunity to up their guidance from 55,000 barrels a day to 60,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>For those of you who &#x2013; I'll give you a couple of modeling things. And hopefully this is all the modeling things we talk about on the call. LIFO, FIFO adjustment was 47 million. So our earnings would have been lower by 47 million if we followed LIFO. And we have been asked for the split of that $400 million in operating synergies. And this is just a, an approximation of where we think it will reside, but about 30% will be in Oil Sands, about 15 in Nat Gas, about 10 in I&amp;O, about 20 in R&amp;M, and about 25 in corporate.</p>
          <p>So that's I think all of the prepared comments we had for you. Ruth, if I can turn it over to you to poll the callers for questions, but again, if we can keep the questions for Rick and Steve and Bart to a strategic level. After the call, of course, Helen and myself and Maureen and Joleen will be happy to answer your detailed modeling questions.</p>
          <p>So Ruth, if you'll take it away?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. So we'll now take questions from the telephone lines. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First question is from Robert Kessler from Simmons &amp; Company. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Rick, and everyone. Your Oil Sands unit cash costs have been running high. And I know that that's expected given the lower volumes and higher costs associated with the fires. And I definitely appreciate your candid remarks about and review of best practices for asset reliability going forward. And in the long term I would think that that improved reliability brings down those unit cash costs. But at the same time that reliability initiative in its own right probably carries a few costs of its own.</p>
          <p>So I'm curious how you're thinking about the net effect of that higher integrity spend, and higher utilization rate? And what your net expectation for cash costs per barrel in the Oil Sands might be for the next, call it 3 years? I think, I think you referenced low 30s for the exit rate this year. Is it too hopeful to think we might get down into the 20s in the next 2 years, particularly with crude prices in the 80s?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you very eloquently almost answered the question there, Robert. I think you're right. There are lots of puts and takes as we go through this program. Bart talked about the very high percentage of sector costs which have had the impact this year. I think what we've &#x2013; what we've guided on is we do anticipate getting into the low 30s again by the end of this year, and that's actually start to see volumes come up.</p>
          <p>We have aggressive programs, which are working real costs in terms of swapping the detail of the cost. We also have a focused reliability program, which was really paying off for 11 and a half months last year. So I think we're comfortable to talk about the low 30s. And we target further than that, but wouldn't claim when would we get there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, all. I had 2 questions for you. Rick, I wanted to get your view on share repurchases longer term out in time. With debt coming down and asset sale proceeds potentially coming in even higher, how do you think about that in terms of shareholder returns? And then the second is just I wondered if you had some additional color on what areas you're finding better than expected cost synergies coming through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So okay. Bart will take the first part of the question on share repurchases. You might want to talk just a bit about dividends as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because there's always a mixture of that. And then I'll take the second one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Great question, Andrew. I think the way to think about our progress forward is to first look at the slate of opportunities that we have in front of us. As Rick mentioned and Steve touched on as well, we do have a tremendous portfolio of growth opportunities in front of us. We are on a path, I think, to get our debt down to around 10 billion. But that's the structural level where we'd like to see ourselves get to. If we were to continue to see high oil prices and tremendous cash flow over time, obviously that'll afford us some opportunity to start returning more of that cash to shareholders. But we'd want to see that environment first. And of course we need to fund our operations and those growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>So it'll be out a ways in the future. What I would say is, depending on the timing obviously as we continue to grow production and our cash flows grow, that's when we'd look to target returning more of that to shareholders. The earliest I'd see that is probably some time in 2011 when we bring the next phase of Firebag 3 on and that production starts to produce cash for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then the second part of that question, Andrew, really deals with the areas of synergies.</p>
          <p>I think &#x2013; we mentioned International. So as we are going through the divestments of that International portfolio, then we find ourselves with, I think, a good set of base assets that we're very proud to own long term but didn't feel like we needed the large overhead of a London office.</p>
          <p>So at the end of all of this, we're going to have about 70 people here in Calgary who will look over those International assets, and if you think about it, that's almost 200,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent. And so there's been a huge cost savings in that on a go-forward basis.</p>
          <p>And the other thing is an area I would largely term as corporate overheads. So if you think about a synergy, a merger like this, you think about the synergies, and you think about that platform I talked about and the need for a solid foundation, then there is cost savings because you don't need the same size of HR group or finance group or other overhead areas as the 2 companies had separately.</p>
          <p>I would single out a couple of things. I mean, we're seeing huge value in the supply chain management of this and the expectation is quite high for that. And if you think about who in this country of Canada has one of the largest capital spending programs &#x2013; and by the way, one of the largest spending programs on an expense basis annually &#x2013; it's us. And so although we felt good going into the merger where our supply chain management group were, there is still lots of room for improvement. Very proud of the work they've done. And as they get processes and systems to back them up, you're going to see huge savings versus where the 2 companies were before.</p>
          <p>The other area I'd point to is IT as well, because we will, through this year or into the first part of next year, be shutting down something like 3,000 computer applications as we bring this ERP system up and running. And to just take that down a little bit more practical application, when we get down to one payroll system, one accounts payable system, one e-mail system, all of those basics, it's just amazing how much money you can save by doing that.</p>
          <p>And again, getting all of us into one office will also be a huge plus for us, if not just from a financial position, from a team position as well.</p>
          <p>So those are the kind of areas that I would point to in terms of the real chance to make a huge impact.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. A couple of things, the April production numbers, could you give us a little insight into those? I mean, they're really big numbers.</p>
          <p>And I guess that as well, how are you feeling right now about your exit rate of 340, 350,000 barrels a day?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Greg. Yeah, I mean April was a tremendous number and particularly pleasing because we'd had such a disappointing preceding few months.</p>
          <p>I think in a sense it reiterates a couple of things for us. We did talk towards the end of last year &#x2013; and you heard me mention that the programs we've been working on have been delivering. We've been able to take existing assets up to controlled high levels of throughput. We've taken them up to, as I say, daily, weekly, monthly, and annually, even accounting for the problems we had last year &#x2013; operating levels. So it was pleasing to be able to come straight out the gate and get up to 333.</p>
          <p>We did have &#x2013; you know that the limit on the operation has largely been the bitumen supply, so the ability of the mines and the in situ assets to produce. One of the things we were able to do &#x2013; and we took full advantage of during the shutdown was to make sure we got ourselves in an excellent inventory position, so that once we had the upgrading facilities back, we were able to move the full volumes through, both to upgrade it and to have the dilly ent available so that we could make full use of our bitumen export capability.</p>
          <p>So it was very re-assuring to see it, and we feel very comfortable at those levels. In fact, we have taken it, on a daily basis, much higher.</p>
          <p>The exit rates, I would say &#x2013; first of all, you've often heard us say we don't want to talk too much about the future in the sense that we want to lead by our performance, and then talk about what we've actually done. So now you know what the plant is capable of, and we've been able to post a good score. We've guided it back to 80 level, which is giving you a view of how we tightened the plan. And I would say we'll see how it goes for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Individual months do depend on &#x2013; if we're able to get in a good inventory position for April &#x2013; sometimes you can do that, sometimes you can't, depending on other circumstances. But you can see what the plant's capable of now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, no. Thanks for that. And then just without re-hashing the fire, Rick, I know when you and I talked, you were saying you still haven't quite got the determination. Does it look as though it was operator error or was it something else? Have you been able to identify it at this stage or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes. The investigation on that is largely complete. And yeah, we do have the cause. It really dealt with the fact that we have blockage and then we had a freeze-up and a pipe break.</p>
          <p>So we think we're &#x2013; you're never 100% certain in these things. So it was an equipment failure. But because we had a dead leg that actually froze. So I don't know if you'd call that an operator error or not. It is kind of a combination. And what you usually find in these events &#x2013; it's not one thing. It's about two or three things that go wrong in sequence.</p>
          <p>So, yeah, I think we're pretty comfortable that we have what actually caused the second issue, and then obviously are talking steps to make sure that that does not re-occur.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Stephen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Quick question just, Rick, on the Gas business. Going forward, how should we really think about the sizing of that business, and the potential for growth there? Is this really a 350 to 400 million a day go-forward business with just sustaining capital? And can you give us any thoughts on how the thinking may be changing on that side, in regards to divestitures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Stephen, and thanks for that question. And you know what? Listen, I think once we get this Natural Gas business down to the right size, the real focus around it is going to be around return on capital in that business. And so what I think is very important here is that we not be held to the old business model that either company, prior to this, had around natural gas.</p>
          <p>I do want to see a business that is growing. I mean in this business if you're not growing, there is only one other direction. But what I would say is we've got to get ourselves to a low-cost position where we're able to make money when gas is in the 4 to $5 range.</p>
          <p>My own belief longer term, Steve, is that we will see 6 to $8 gas. It won't be this year, maybe not next, but we will be moving back into what I would call a more normalized &#x2013; we're not going to see 10 or $12 gas either. But what I would say is you've just got to prepare yourself to be on the low part of the cost curve.</p>
          <p>And so I still see that as a very important part of Suncor, but one that won't be growing at the same rates that our Oil Sands business is. I mean we're still going to be an Oil Sands-centric growing company, but that does not diminish the way that I see Natural Gas or, by the way, R&amp;M or International offshore as being key parts of the company. I think a company this size, you do need some of that breadth and width to fulfill the strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just as a follow-up, do you see the assets within the portfolio today to deliver on those goals, or do you need to make some either swaps or asset changes in that portfolio to meet those return thresholds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's a good question. I think the answer is yeah, probably.</p>
          <p>But I think the base part of the divestments out of that business will be done this year. Then it will be around &#x2013; okay, and the charge to Neil is really, okay, Neil, now we've got the divestments done &#x2013; now, you find a way to profitably grow this business. And that's what I don't think we're quite in a position to get overly discussed about.</p>
          <p>But that may include the ability to may swap some assets, may move in some positions, move out of some, not at the size and the scale that we're doing today. But it's really around how do you prepare that business to go for the long haul.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, it's John. We don't. We had the question earlier about the exit rate on Oil Sands, and I think we answered that one. And we haven't actually put out exit rates for the rest of the assets. And until we go through all the divestitures and what not, it's probably best that we don't.</p>
          <p>I think you have an idea in terms of what we are going to do in terms of divestitures. So you'll look at where we think our base will be. But if you give us a little bit of time, as we put in place the strategy, that will all become a lot clearer.</p>

          <p>Carrie, I think it's a great question. And I get asked that quite a bit, as you might well guess.</p>
          <p>So what I would say is &#x2013; listen, Oil Sands is a key part of our business. Our intent here is that we would stay in Syncrude because of its strategic value that it is in our heartland business. But what I would quickly say is you never want to say forever, okay? In terms of, I guess everything's for sale at the right price.</p>

          <p>Guys, good morning. Rick, I wondered if you could talk just a little bit about the &#x2013; your thinking on the module sizes of 65,000 a day that you've chosen to go with at Firebag, which is frankly a bit larger and different than we've seen across the industry.</p>
          <p>And in that regard, give some comment, if you could, on what you believe a full cycle capital cost is, on a per daily flowing barrel basis. We've seen various numbers being quoted, and they seem to mean different kinds of things, depending upon who you're talking to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Mark, I think it's a great question. And I would guess &#x2013; what I think the market misses some is every SAG-D development is different. And it's different in terms of reservoir thickness, in terms of how water wet or not wet it is, around reservoir quality, around location, around depth of reservoir.</p>
          <p>And so I think the market tends to blend all of these into one. So it isn't like one development scenario fits all. So I think that's one of the things I would say to it.</p>
          <p>For us, you've got to remember, Firebag has 9 billion barrels recoverable. It's a huge, huge resource. And we believe that stepping it up into 65, which is what 3, 4, 5 &#x2013; given our experience on Stages 1 and 2 &#x2013; makes the right kind of size and scale sense to us.</p>
          <p>We already have a lot of the infrastructure in for those future stages, which includes a lot of the power lines, the roads going in, the air strip, the pipeline. So we're putting in a couple more pipelines this coming winter.</p>
          <p>But what I'd say is for that development, that size and scale, that makes sense. If you have a smaller plot of land with a different reservoir, you might be in a completely different scenario. And I would give you the Mackay River, which I can talk about, because that's ours. 65,000 on that would make no sense.</p>
          <p>So I think you've got to take each circumstance and take a look at it. It's not one size fits all.</p>
          <p>Now around the cost thing, I mean what we'd like to think about in the SAG-D is it's kind of 40 to $50,000 of daily flow and barrel for SAG-D. Now again, reservoir amounts to a lot.</p>
          <p>Let's just take Firebag for example. Our well productivities are double what the industry average is. So this is a very good reservoir. Again, every reservoir, and even Firebag, you'll find some of the well pads will be very different than other well pads. So you just got to take &#x2013; you got to take what Mother Nature gives you and then work with that.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, when you talk 40 to 50, are you talking about the well pads that will fully support 30 years worth of production?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>One of the things it's important to remember, Mark, is we have not actually as an industry, that I know of, produced one of these to full life. So that's why you see us and other players starting to do infield drilling. We're starting to find ways to keep reservoir pressure up other than using natural gas. You're starting to see people use light solvents. So this is an industry that's still very much in its very young years. There's a lot of growing, a lot of technology that'll come along to really improve this business overall. I'd say stay tuned. This is actually going to be fun before it's over. And the fact that we have so many players trying and pursuing different technologies is a real plus for the industry.</p>

          <p>Hi. I was wondering how &#x2013; if you have an idea about how the April increase in tolls on the Enbridge system will affect the company going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; you're talking about the specific change in the tolls potentially? We're still discussing that. I'll be happy to actually answer those kind of detailed questions offline if I can.</p>

          <p>Well, thank you, Ruth. And thanks, everyone, for listening in. And again, Helen and I and Maureen and Joleen will be happy to take your detailed calls. You have my telephone number. So please give us a call. Other than that, we are having our ECM in Calgary today, so if you'd like to come down to the Telus Convention Centre at about 11:00, we'd be happy to do that. And the presentation is on the new IR presentation is on the web site. Okay. So thanks, everyone. Have a good day and we'll talk to you soon. Bye.</p>
