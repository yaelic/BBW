          <p>Thank you, Dawn, and welcome everyone to the National Oilwell Varco fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings conference call. With me today is Pete Miller, Chairman and CEO of National Oilwell Varco; Clay Williams, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jeremy Thigpen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecasts, projections and estimates including, but not limited to, comments about our outlook for the business &#x2013; the company's business. These are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws based on limited information as of today, which is subject to change. They are subject to risk and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially.</p>
          <p>No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year. I refer you to the latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q National Oilwell Varco has on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business.</p>
          <p>Further information regarding these, as well as supplemental financial and operating information, may be found within our press release, on our website at www.nov.com or in our filings with the SEC. Later on in this call, we will answer your questions, which we ask you to limit to two in order to permit more participation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Loren. And welcome, everyone, to our year-end 2012 earnings conference call. Earlier today, we announced fourth quarter earnings of $1.56 per share on revenues of $5.7 billion. After excluding a $51 million in transaction charges and a $69 million tax benefit, earnings were $1.49 per share.</p>
          <p>For the year, we earned $5.91 per share excluding transaction charges and the tax benefit on revenues of $20 billion. Our earnings per share in 2012 increased 24% from 2011. We are very pleased with these record revenues and profits and believe they are the direct result of our outstanding employees delivering great products with exemplary execution. Jeremy and Clay will expand on these results in a moment.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we announced new capital equipment orders for the quarter of $2.42 billion or a 1.1:1 book-to-bill ratio. This equates to a quarter-ending backlog of $11.9 billion, a record for us. This exceeds our prior record that we achieved in the third quarter of 2008. We will provide more color on this backlog later in the call.</p>
          <p>I would like to thank all of the wonderful employees of National Oilwell Varco for producing these record-breaking results by all measures. Thanks for all you do.</p>
          <p>Now, I will turn the call over to Clay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pete. As Pete mentioned, we did generate record earnings $5.91 per share for 2012, up 24% year-over-year and up 17% from our prior peak back in 2008, very strong results. We also generated record EBITDA of $4.3 billion in the year and record operating profit of $3.7 billion in the year. And as Pete mentioned, we finished the year with a Rig Technology backlog of a record level of $11.9 billion after having added $9.4 billion in orders through the year. These results are a credit to the hard work and dedication of our 60,000 terrific employees and I'm grateful for the work that they do and congratulate them on a terrific year.</p>
          <p>As we enter 2013, we see crosscurrents in the markets we serve. Demand for offshore floating rigs and equipment is strong and constructive, but markets for land equipment and services across North America remain hesitant. Underpinned by newbuild floating rig demand, Rig Technology's book-to-bill order ratio remained above one every quarter this year, successfully surpassing rising revenue out of backlog that totaled a record $7.7 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>Offshore drilling contractors steadily committed capital through 2012 to expand their deepwater fleets and we believe that this will continue through 2013. Our outlook for continued strong deepwater orders is a view that appears to be out of step with Wall Street's conventional wisdom, which seems lately to have convinced itself that deepwater rig ordering will slow.</p>
          <p>Candidly, we don't understand why. Why, when unlevered after-tax returns are in the high-teens for new rig construction projects? Why when delivery times have shrunk by a year or more, bringing the first dollar of project revenue closer and enhancing IRRs? Why when recent payment terms offered by shipyards, particularly Chinese yards entering the fray, are extraordinarily attractive like 10% down and 90% upon delivery? Why when the risk of cost overruns and late deliveries for established suppliers like NOV have diminished to near zero?</p>
          <p>Why when oilfield entrepreneurs are now pursuing newbuild rig opportunities? Why when Brazil has been steadily demonstrating its commitment to order and build rigs in-country? Why when 2012 saw a record number of deepwater field discoveries announced and a successful application of subsalt exploration techniques to West Africa? Why when the utilization and day rates were scarce, deepwater rig assets remain high and with many IOCs and NOCs gradually migrating to development drilling following very successful exploration efforts over the past decade?</p>
          <p>A world view that foresees deepwater orders going down against this backdrop apparently employs some calculus that I just don't get. We believe $100-plus Brent and 50% success rates are sufficient to lure the industry into deepwaters to discover and capture billions of dollars of petroleum wealth. We also believe this will take a lot of deepwater rigs.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, our above-consensus deepwater rig order view does not mean our Rig Technology segment is without its challenges. Specifically, despite strong demand, new drilling equipment package pricing has been stubbornly stuck 8% to 10% below the levels of 2007/2008 as new competitors have joined the mix and as constructors proceed with less urgency than before.</p>
          <p>Faster hull construction times out of half-full Asian shipyards have tightened delivery schedules around NOV components, diminishing manufacturing efficiency somewhat, as deliveries of many major components like drawworks, mud pumps and pipe-handling equipment jumped 50% from 2011 levels. Additionally, we're incurring start-up costs associated with strategic expansions.</p>
          <p>Outside of deepwater, we also see softer demand. Jack-up orders have slowed, and most recent interest arises from lower-tier contractors. Our competition seems determined to offset NOV's considerable technical and operational advantages with price, sometimes partnering with Chinese shipyards to offer rigs at 10% to 20% discounts to established yards.</p>
          <p>On the land front, demand for rigs and pressure-pumping equipment in North America is very weak, as major drilling contractors and pressure pumpers have signaled substantial year-over-year reductions in CapEx. Demand will ultimately return. High-pressure around-the-clock frac jobs are very, very tough on pressure-pumping equipment. And E&amp;P operators continue to push drillers to retool their rig fleets. But we expect 2013 to continue to be slow as we face significant pricing pressure.</p>
          <p>International land markets are far more promising. Numerous tenders are at work for IPM projects throughout Latin America, the Middle East and the Far East, which will require new modern rigs and frac spreads.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, we see many international land markets finally burning through their rig overhang from the 1970s and beginning to retool much like their North American counterparts did several years ago, with horizontal, well-capable, high-technology drilling assets.</p>
          <p>Orders for FPSOs and other subsea development projects totaled over $150 million in the fourth quarter, heavily weighted towards flexible pipe. But as orders for turret mooring systems for FPSOs have remained a little sluggish. However, lately, we have seen significant increases in bidding activity for turret mooring systems, which are complementary to the flexible pipe we sell. In fact, we have a couple of signed contracts awaiting only down payments.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we are conducting an extraordinarily high number of FEED studies on potential subsea FPSO developments while we migrate our business from a project organization to a product organization.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies group. A strong start to 2012 gave way to sliding North American market conditions over the summer that have persisted through today. Slowing orders for Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies consumables have led to pricing pressure across several product lines that resulted in lower sequential margins, and a general reluctance by drilling and pressure-pumping contractors to spend either CapEx or OpEx.</p>
          <p>Differentiated products and technologies like certain specialized downhole drilling tools have fared better in land markets while offshore markets have generally done well helped by, for example, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico recovery.</p>
          <p>Several product lines within PS&amp;S enjoyed strong year-end shipments but have seen slowing orders through the back half of 2012. And are, therefore, braced for a more challenging 2013. For example, in our drill pipe business, we benefited from strong year-end shipments and orders from newbuild rigs while simultaneously watching demand for high-volume shale strings for North America slow sharply.</p>
          <p>Although we have heard others cite Canadian seasonal upturns in Q1 or E&amp;P budget replenishment entering the new year or potential uplifts in North America gas prices and various other causes for hope in 2013 that rig activity will rebound, we don't yet see a rebound happening and certainly don't see it soon. And we're taking measures to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in the meantime.</p>
          <p>As our segment is most heavily weighted to North America, our Distribution and Transmission Group faced a similarly challenging year. But our recent acquisitions of Wilson, CE Franklin and Engco permit us more latitude to aggressively tackle costs and improve margins.</p>
          <p>The group is performing very well and sees many of the same market trends as the other two; namely, strong international prospects and soft North American demand in traditional upstream areas. Wilson brought more midstream and downstream exposure. Strength in these is partly offsetting sluggish drilling and production demand.</p>
          <p>Although we face a difficult market in North America in the short run, we remain absolutely committed to enhancing National Oilwell Varco for the long run. We have expanded our aftermarket footprint, our manufacturing capabilities for numerous products, and our new plant and machinery.</p>
          <p>Likewise, we continue to invest in new technologies and products. As market leader we recognize our commitment to the industry to continually push the bar higher, to strive, to grow and improve.</p>
          <p>2012 was an extraordinarily busy year for acquisitions. We spent $2.9 billion on 17 transactions, and we expect to close our previously announced acquisition of Robbins &amp; Myers in just a few weeks. As a group, these acquisitions bring us opportunities to effect efficiency gains in our operations, to add new geographic coverage to complete product offerings; all good things for our customers, our employees and our shareholders as they help build and grow our business for the long haul.</p>
          <p>Despite near-term headwinds, I could not be more excited about the future that lay before us. NOV is an unequaled organization made up of wonderful, dedicated professionals of whom I could not be more proud. Jeremy?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Clay. As Clay and Pete just mentioned, it was a record-breaking quarter and year. For the quarter, National Oilwell Varco earned $668 million or $1.56 per fully diluted shared on $5.7 billion in revenue. Excluding the impact from $51 million in pre-tax transaction charges and a net $69 million tax benefit related to certain foreign tax credits, we earned net income of $638 million or $1.49 per fully diluted share.</p>
          <p>Operating profit for the quarter was $903 million, up $14 million from the third quarter and up $55 million from the fourth quarter of last year on a GAAP basis. Excluding transaction charges from all periods, Q4 operating profit was $954 million, up 1% from the third quarter and up 11% from the fourth quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Operating margins on this basis were 16.8% in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 17.8% in the third quarter and 20.2% in the fourth quarter last year. And sequential operating <mark type="ph" /> flow-through leverage (13:16) was 2% on the 7% increase in sales, which is lower than we typically see for three reasons.</p>
          <p>The first and probably most important, was product mix in our Rig Tech business. The second factor, which we referenced in Q3 conference call and Clay reinforced in his opening comments, was the degradation of pricing in a number of our PS&amp;S businesses in the U.S. And the final factor was the incremental expense associated with various growth initiatives that are underway throughout the organization, including the costs associated with integrating numerous acquisitions.</p>
          <p>I'll provide more color on each of these areas as I recap the quarter and the year for each of the segments. Despite this lower-than-typical flow-through, Q4 marked a record finish to a record year for NOV. 2012 saw National Oilwell Varco generate record net income of $2.5 billion on record revenues of $20 billion, which, excluding transaction charges from both years, represented a 37% increase in year-over-year revenue at 13% operating leverage.</p>
          <p>Turning to operations. NOV's Rig Technology segment generated record revenues of $2.896 billion in the fourth quarter, up 14% sequentially, and up 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Operating profit, which was also a record, was $648 million, yielding operating margins for the group of 22.4%, a decline of 150 basis points from the third quarter and 360 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2011. Incremental operating leverage was 11% of the sequential sales improvement of $349 million. And incremental leverage was 8% from the fourth quarter of 2011 on the $580 million revenue improvement.</p>
          <p>As previously referenced, the sequential flow-through was less than we typically expect due to product mix and incremental expense to support several strategic growth initiatives. In the fourth quarter, we posted strong revenue growth in coiled tubing units, wireline units and land rigs. Unfortunately, the growth in all three product lines was primarily driven by large, end-of-year international projects that were secured at below-average margins.</p>
          <p>Additionally, Q4 brought a double-digit percentage increase in our FPSO-related revenues, which, as we communicated on previous calls, is currently dilutive to overall Rig Tech margins. In addition to the unfavorable shift in mix, we also incurred considerable start-up costs associated with the NOV Flexibles plant in Brazil and the opening of a new technical college in Korea. These long-term investment, while detrimental to current operating margins, are expected to benefit future operating results for many years to come.</p>
          <p>And finally, since in 2013, we are scheduled to deliver twice as many offshore projects to the market than we delivered in 2012, we heightened our efforts to hire and train the additional installation and commissioning personnel required to manage this incremental work load.</p>
          <p>The combination of these factors negatively impacted our flow-through, however, this segment still posted exceptional results. Revenue out of backlog increased 16% sequentially to $2.211 billion. This marked yet another record for our Rig Tech business and validated all those investments that we have made in facilities, training and continuous process improvements.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter orders for Rig Technology were $2.417 billion and included three semis and four drill ships. And before you ask, of those new seven new floaters, we secured the BOP stacks and riser on six of those vessels. We also sold three spare BOP stacks in the quarter as offshore drillers continue to recognize the benefits in both safety and operational efficiency of owning and maintaining a backup stack.</p>
          <p>On land, we continued to see demand for new rigs in the international arena, however, demand in North American land market was limited to individual pieces of equipment such as iron roughnecks and top drives as some of our larger contractors are ordering to enhance the performance and value of their existing rigs.</p>
          <p>For the year, orders totaled almost $9.350 billion giving us a year-end backlog of $11.862 billion which is up 2% from September 30, 2012. Of that total, we expect about $7.4 billion to flow out as revenue during 2013 and the remaining $4.5 billion to flow out in 2014 and beyond. As a final note on the backlog, at the end of the quarter, the composition of our backlog was 91% offshore with 94% of that being destined for international markets.</p>
          <p>As we look at potential order flow for 2013, we are hoping for a recovery in North America that will drive demand for new land rigs, coiled-tubing units, pressure-pumping units and other frac-related equipment. However, as Clay said, we have yet to see it. Therefore, demand for such new equipment will likely be limited to the international markets with only select upgrade opportunities in North America. Still we believe demand for pressure-pumping equipment will ultimately return, land drillers will continue with their programs to retool and upgrade their fleets, and the industry will continue to upgrade an aging jack-up fleet while simultaneously building out its worldwide deepwater and shale infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Non-backlog revenue for the group improved 8% sequentially to $685 million, driven by across-the-board increases in spare parts, service and repair. For the year, non-backlog revenue increased 17% to almost $2.455 billion. And as we move into next year, we expect that our aftermarket revenues will continue to improve for three reasons: an ever growing installed base, some of which is due for mandatory five-year survey; a heightened focus around drilling safety and product lifecycle analysis; and capacity additions such as the acquisition that we made in Q4 of Algoa to provide improved aftermarket support to our customers in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
          <p>For the full year, Rig Tech generated $10.107 billion in revenues and $2.380 billion in operating profit or 23.5% compared to $7.788 billion in revenues and $2.070 billion in operating profit at 26.6% in 2011. While year-over-year operating margins were down due to product mix and the investments associated with various growth initiatives, the segment continued to produce exceptional results, posting returns on capital of greater than 25%. And with a record backlog, strong and growing aftermarket sales and a positive outlook for future offshore orders, we believe that Rig Technology is well positioned for the future.</p>
          <p>As we look to the first quarter of 2013, we expect Rig Technology revenues to be down in the 10% range, following flush year-end shipments and virtually nonexistent demand for pressure-pumping equipment. And we expect that margins could tick up slightly from Q4 2012, however, pricing pressures in North America coupled with a continuing shift in product mix that includes a growing percentage of Brazil and FPSO-related revenue, remain challenges.</p>
          <p>The Petroleum Services and Supplies segment generated total sales of $1.77 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012, up 3% from the third quarter and up 13% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was $355 million or 20.1% of sales. As expected, margins fell from the 22.3% level that the segment recognized in the third quarter as pricing pressures across a number of products in the North American land market, coupled with a shift in product mix, led to lower margins.</p>
          <p>Most notably, the continued reduction of North American land activities, with the pricing pressures and an overall reduction of volume for our Downhole Tools, our fiberglass pipe, our coiled-tubing, and our fluid and expendables businesses. While revenue declines in these products were offset by sequential growth in our drill pipe, XL Systems and Tuboscope businesses, overall margins still declined.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2012, PS&amp;S generated a record $6.967 billion in revenue, up 23% from 2011. The segment generated $1.519 billion in operating profit, representing 32% leverage on the year-over-year sales growth. Operating margins at 21.8% for the year were up from 19.4% in 2011.</p>
          <p>Looking into the first quarter of 2013, we expect PS&amp;S segment sales to decline in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range, as several of our businesses have entered the year with diminished backlogs and U.S.-based drilling contractors and well service firms have been hesitant to release new orders. Due to the expected reduction in volumes and the continued pressures on pricing, we believe that operating margins could tick down into the high teens in Q1.</p>
          <p>Turning to Distribution &amp; Transmission, for the quarter, the group generated $1.268 billion in sales and $78 million in operating profit or 6.2% of sales. Compared to the third quarter, sales declined 4%, with both the legacy Distribution business and the Transmission business contributing equally to the $47 million decline.</p>
          <p>For Distribution, gains associated with the start of the winter drilling season in Canada were not enough to compensate for the significant declines in the U.S. And in the Transmission business, the Mono artificial lift and industrial pump business remained fairly strong. However, the decline in tubular demand in the U.S., coupled with the shutdown of our wind towers business in Q4, led to a sequential decline. Despite the overall 4% reduction in D&amp;T revenue, operating profit for the segment was essentially flat with Q3, as the group continued to recognize cost savings across several acquisitions.</p>
          <p>These fourth quarter results cap another strong year for the segment overall with a record $3.927 billion in sales and a record $253 million in operating profit and 6.4% operating margins. Year-over-year, revenues were up 110% due primarily to the mid-year acquisitions of Wilson and CE Franklin and flow-through was 6% for the year. For the first quarter of 2013, we expect Distribution &amp; Transmission revenues to be up in the low-single-digit percentage range at slightly lower margins.</p>
          <p>So, overall, as you think about Q1 and the full year for 2013, we entered the year with a record backlog in Rig Tech with an estimated $7.4 billion expected to flow out over 2013. The outlook for new offshore rigs, floaters and even jack-ups is encouraging as is the demand for FPSOs. However, we're facing some near-term headwinds in the North American land market that will significantly limit opportunities for land rigs, as well as pressure-pumping, coiled-tubing and other frac-related equipment. Rig Tech margins, while still best in class, will continue to be challenged by compressed delivery times at the shipyards, a shifting mix that includes a higher percentage of Brazil and FPSO-related revenues and pricing pressures in North American land.</p>
          <p>Our PS&amp;S businesses are excited about growth opportunities in international markets, but we entered the year with depleted backlogs, declining demand in North America which represented 63% of the segment's revenue in the first half of 2012 and pricing pressures across a number of products. And our D&amp;T business will certainly benefit from a full year of Wilson and CE Franklin and the consolidation benefits that will continue to be realized throughout 2013. But it's important to remember that 84% of this segment's revenues are derived from the U.S. and Canada.</p>
          <p>In short, we're excited about our backlog, the prospect for new orders, growth in international markets and the considerable benefits already recognized by the integration of Wilson and CE Franklin, but we need activity in North America to pick up in order to meaningfully expand margins.</p>
          <p>Going to the income statement, National Oilwell Varco's consolidated fourth quarter income statement saw SG&amp;A decrease $9 million sequentially as an increase in our incentive compensation accrual, coupled with the addition of four new acquisitions in the quarter, were more than offset by the reclassification of a portion of Wilson's SG&amp;A expense to cost of goods sold, to be more consistent with NOV's past practices. SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales was 8% in the fourth quarter, down from 8.7% in the third quarter and 10% from the fourth quarter of last year. Transaction costs for the quarter were $51 million, driven primarily by integration efforts to consolidate facilities from recently acquired companies.</p>
          <p>Equity income in our voestalpine JV was $15 million, up considerably from the third quarter as there was a two-week shutdown in Q3 for mill maintenance that resulted in much lower Q3 volumes. We expect profitability from the JV to be down slightly in the first quarter of 2013 as demand for drill pipe in the U.S. continues to wane and therefore demand for green tube continues to wane. Interest expense essentially doubled from Q3 to Q4 to $21 million as we issued $3 billion of senior notes in November. Other expense increased $14 million from the third quarter primarily due to unfavorable FX mix.</p>
          <p>As you undoubtedly noticed, our fourth quarter tax rate was 23.3% giving us an effective tax rate on the year of 29.2% which is far lower than our historic rate of 32%, 33%. During the fourth quarter, the company recorded a net $69 million tax benefit resulting from a strategic work reorganization of certain foreign operations to more fully integrate recently acquired business groups. Excluding this impact, the effective tax rate for the quarter would have been 31.3% and the tax rate for the year would have been 31.6%. We expect the effective tax rate for 2013 to be at or near historic levels.</p>
          <p>Unallocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental segment schedule was $127 million in the fourth quarter, up $2 million from the third quarter. Depreciation and amortization was up $9 million from Q3 to $166 million. And for the fourth consecutive quarter, EBITDA, excluding other costs, was a record at $1.109 billion for the quarter and $4.332 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>To the balance sheet, National Oilwell Varco's December 31, 2012 balance sheet employed working capital, excluding cash and debt, of $6.7 billion or 29.5% of annualized sales, up $73 million from the third quarter, with higher accounts receivable, which were tied to revenue growth, being substantially offset by reductions in inventory and accrued taxes and liabilities &#x2013; and higher accrued taxes and liabilities.</p>
          <p>Total customer financing on projects in the form of prepayments and billings in excess of costs, less costs in excess of billings was $569 million at December 31, 2012 down only $8 million from September 30, 2012. Cash flow from operations was an impressive $800 million for the fourth quarter. CapEx increased $72 million sequentially in the quarter to $201 million, bringing full-year capital expenditures to $583 million versus $483 million in 2011. We expect CapEx in 2013 to move up into the $600 million range as we pursue a number of expansion opportunities that we launched last year, including the completion of our new Flexibles plant in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Cash spent on four acquisitions in the quarter totaled $575 million. For the year, cash spent on 17 acquisitions totaled $2.880 billion. And for the year, NOV paid $209 million in dividends to our shareholders, leaving us with a cash balance of $3.319 billion at December 31, 2012. Of that balance, approximately 40% of the cash resides in the U.S. and will be used to help fund the acquisition of Robbins &amp; Myers.</p>
          <p>Our total debt at the end of 2012 was $3.149 billion, with $3 billion of that related to the successful bond offering that I previously referenced. We're very proud that our effective yield on the $3 billion of bonds issued was 2.92%, with $500 million due in five years, $1.4 billion due in 10 years and $1.1 billion due in 30 years, a truly outstanding job by our Treasury department in getting this done. Net of current and long-term debt, cash at the end of the year was $170 million.</p>
          <p>And now, let me turn it back to Pete.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Jeremy. And I'd like to talk a little bit about some of the themes that we've discussed in the past because they all seem to remain intact right now. And basically, that's the shales, deepwater, the best-in-class technology that we offer and our international presence.</p>
          <p>I think all of these things continue to dictate the strategy of the company. I think the shales, in particular, when you see the oily shales, whether it's up in the Bakken or down in the Eagle Ford, I think they'll continue to give us a great presence. And especially, with our PS&amp;S-type businesses that go in there, our distribution businesses that really can parlay good things in there.</p>
          <p>More interestingly, I really do think you're going to see an escalation of shale drilling internationally. It's gone slow. I think a lot of people are of the opinion that maybe it's not going to ramp up as rapidly as you think. But I think that'll change. Just to give you an example, I was in China this &#x2013; earlier this week, visiting with some shipyards that have just committed on some semis and jack-ups to us. And at the same time, the pollution in Beijing was just unbelievable. I mean, people couldn't even go to work. It was so bad.</p>
          <p>China, as we all know, will move very rapidly in fixing things. And the quick fix on pollution like that is pretty simple, and it's called natural gas, and their natural gas they have in the shales in China. And I think you'll start to see a real escalation of things like that in the international arena. The reality is that natural gas is very clean burning. And I think you're going to see more demand of that around the world. And we're prepared to be able to help in that. And I think that's going to really be an advantageous situation for us.</p>
          <p>And as I talk about the international arena, we've referenced on this call things like Russia. We're expanding very dramatically in Russia. We think that's going to be a great market over the next 5 years or 10 years, and we're also building a new facility there that'll be able to build both rigs and our downhole tools. That's something that I'm excited about. I think Russia really needs the technology that we have. And this plays into a couple of things, plays into international shales, and it also plays into the best-in-class technology.</p>
          <p>In China, I mentioned that earlier. I was there this past week to kind of take a look at things. I think the Chinese shipyards are going to be much more active. I think they're going to really kind of jump into this situation on deepwater. And we're situated very, very well with them to be able to take advantage of the products that we service. And it's really interesting because, when you look at a Chinese shipyard, we're producing equipment all over the world and shipping it to China to be able to put it on the semi-submersibles that those guys are doing.</p>
          <p>Brazil, yes, we've mentioned it. This quarter, we did not have &#x2013; on the floaters that we got, none of them were Brazil. We expect that to occur in the first quarter. We're excited about that. There's some real opportunity down there, and I think Brazil will continue to be quite a nice place for us.</p>
          <p>In the Middle East right now, it is improving for us on land rigs. We talk about the lack of land rig demand in North America, but in other parts of the world it's picking up. I think you'll see it pick up. I'll come back to Russia and also you'll see it pick up in the Middle East, and we're situated very well to be able to take advantage of it right there.</p>
          <p>Our backlog is off to a good start in first quarter. We've had a lot of things come into it already. We're excited about the prospects of what we're going to see when it comes to the more deepwater and more demand for our technologically advanced equipment.</p>
          <p>And then, finally, I'd like to talk a little bit about technology. That really is going to be the differentiation between us and many of the people that we work with. To give you a good example, I'd look at our 20,000 psi BOP that we're going be coming out with very quickly. The neat thing, though, is that not only do we have a 20,000 psi BOP, but we also &#x2013; because of everything else that we manufacture, we're able to size the rig appropriately. We're able to do things to the derrick. We're able to do things to the piping system. We're able to do things to the top drive to be able to handle the bigger and heavier BOPs that are associated with that.</p>
          <p>So, when you get &#x2013; when you buy from NOV and get our technology, you get the fully integrated product, and that's going to really dictate well into the future of what the business is that we're going be getting. So, we feel very good about where we are. We're going to continue to invest heavily in training. We're going to continue to grow organically. We think while there's some near-term costs, there's going to be some great longer-term returns based upon this type of thing and I'm really excited about it.</p>
          <p>And finally, I'd just like to give kind of a shout-out to our Distribution folks. They've done a phenomenal job this year on being able to integrate both Wilson and CE Franklin. You saw the margins here, above 6% after less than about six months of those companies being together. And I'm very excited about everything that those folks are doing.</p>
          <p>So, that's just some brief comments on what we're trying to do strategically and some things that we're seeing. And, Dawn, at this point, I'd like to turn it over for any questions that our listeners might have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to start off with something that's material here to your comments on the RBN and your confidence in closing that acquisition in the next several weeks because the arb spread is definitely wide. And I was curious, are there going to be any stipulations to that closing of that deal that would require you to sell any portions of RBN? Or what gives you that confidence that it's going to close in a couple of weeks? Because clearly it looks like the market thinks otherwise right now.</p>

          <p>Well, Brian, we continue to provide answers to any questions that the government might have. And we continue to push to a close here in about two or three weeks.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Beautiful. Thank you. And as my follow-up, completely unrelated, you say that Rig Tech margins might tick up in Q1. I was curious maybe the progression as you go through the year and the statement might. Does that have more to do with a mix issue or more to do with closing out these start-ups and getting everything done like you said in Brazil, and Korea? Are there some costs still waiting on that and what makes that a might to it will and how does that progress as we get through 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think &#x2013; this is Jeremy -- I think the might is really related to all those things that we talked about in the call. There's going to be significant impact to all of our pressure-pumping equipment, the coiled-tubing unit, land rig in North America, that's going to weigh heavily on margins. And then we do have a lot of start-up costs associated with the Flexibles plant Brazil, again, the product mix with more FPSO-related revenues flowing in &#x2013; more Brazil related revenues flowing in. We just think all of those are going to present some challenges for us, and how those work through the system throughout the year kind of remains to be seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the positive side, Brian, aftermarket in that space is doing terrific, particularly wrapped around offshore rigs coming in for their five-year surveys. So, there's &#x2013; and then we kind of covered this in our opening comments. There's lots of puts and takes here. But as Jeremy mentioned, lots of negatives, and we're hopeful, though, that the offset will be the aftermarket side of that business, which is very accretive to the margins.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Crandell from Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Pete, I know you like to look at your sort of order picture on a more-than-one-quarter basis. And looking forward, let's say, 12 months out, by the end of 2013, do you think there is an excellent chance that your backlog could be higher than it is today? And also, could you address in a little bit more detail what you're seeing with some granularity in the FPSO market that makes you optimistic today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, we're very optimistic that 2013 is going to see a good order year. And I think that, obviously, the way we do backlog, as I've told you many times, we kind of cut it off on a date-specific. But I would expect 2013 to really be an excellent year, and I would certainly expect over a one-to-one book-to-bill on it.</p>
          <p>And I think as we take a look at the FPSO market, we're getting pretty excited about it. It's not dissimilar to when you look at a lot of the people that are in subsea production, and they kind of keep moving out to the right. And then in many of the same ways, the FPSO business is moving a little bit to the right, but it's still something that is pretty exciting. We're starting to see &#x2013; as Clay mentioned in his comments earlier, we've done a lot of FEED studies, but we're also starting to kind of see a lot of this stuff develop in orders. We have received some orders on some products in the first quarter that are not included in the backlog currently.</p>
          <p>But the fact of the matter is if you kind of take a look at it, it's almost inescapable. You look at all these deepwater rigs that we're putting out there, and they're drilling. And they're not drilling for practice. They're drilling to discover oil and gas. And the approved solution when they discover that oil and gas, in most cases, is going to be the FPSOs. And we think with what we have with NKT and what we have with our APL business that we're going to be positioned to be able to take advantage of that. So we're still pretty bullish on it, and we think as you go more into this year, you'll see a lot more materialization of orders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Pete. And my follow-up is, I guess, Clay, to address some of your comments about the ultra deepwater market, I think one of the things that would maybe limit the ordering from large U.S. or formerly U.S.-based contractors is the pressure at least they feel to return cash to shareholders, either making large dividend payments, MLPs and the like, and that's sort of slowing down their process. Do you see actually a difference at this point, Pete or Clay, in the likelihood of the U.S. companies ordering more ultra deepwater rigs versus some of your European companies like Seadrill, Pacific, Ocean Rig, Odfjell and those kinds of companies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, it really varies by company. I know that many of them are wrestling with the decision of allocating capital into new growth prospects versus returning to shareholders, and they're all taking that question very, very seriously. And I would also add, a lot of them have a lot of projects underway currently that they're very busy with. But I got to tell you, as a group, the U.S.-based publicly traded companies are in as good a mood as I have ever seen them. They see a lot of prospects out there in the marketplace, lots of opportunities to grow their businesses.</p>
          <p>And, candidly, I think you go back five, six years ago, the market demonstrated this: if they don't act on those opportunities, somebody will. And you've recently seen a lot of entrepreneurs now getting back in this space as well. So, there are big returns to be had out there, something like 300 deepwater fields that have been announced but haven't been developed. 2012 was a record year in terms of announcement of discoveries in the deepwater. As Pete said, there's a lot of drilling and FPSO development to come. And that takes a lot of deepwater rigs.</p>
          <p>So, I think whether or not it's the U.S.-based organizations or their European counterparts or others around the globe getting into the fray, I think somebody is going to continue to build a lot of deepwater rigs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Pete, just as a clarification, were you saying that based on your trip to China, you think now that the &#x2013; will major contract drillers order ultra deepwater drill ships from Chinese yards now going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think they're going to be in the mix, Jim. But I think that a lot of them will be some of the Chinese drillers. You're starting to see people like COSL and some of the bigger Chinese folks try to be major players. I think you'll see some of the Norwegian-type companies that will be looking at the Chinese shipyards. But I think the Chinese shipyards are clearly going to be a player. They're going to &#x2013; they're getting in the mix and I think they're getting better at what they do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you think your customer mix in new ultra deepwater rig orders could change a fair amount going forward from what it is &#x2013; what it's been over the last couple years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Jim, it's been a cyclical deal. If you go back to 2006 and 2007, you have a lot of what were called kind of speculators. And we said at the time they weren't speculators but they were people that were really going to develop into quite good operations. And you see people like Seadrill and the Ocean Rig and Odfjell and Pacific today. Then we kind of went into the more traditional folks, the Transoceans and the Nobles and the Atwoods and the Rowans. And then I think you start to have some other people coming back into the marketplace today. So, it's really kind of a shifting customer base but it's one that we're positioned with very well. And we like where we are.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons &amp; Company. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Good morning, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. Continuing with the mix question, Pete and Clay, with regard to the type of floaters that you're seeing from an increase standpoint, is it still mostly drill ships? Or are you getting more semisubmersibles in the mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, we're starting to see a few more semis come in the mix. I think as you take a look, that a lot of the drill ships are really exploratory. And when you start going into exploitation of fields, the semisubmersibles offer a few advantages there. But we're still seeing a lot of drill ships as well. But we're starting to pick up a lot on the semisubmersible. And of course, we're in a great position either way. I mean, our DEP, our drilling equipment package, fits quite well on either way. And so, we kind of like where we are in that. But it's a little bit of a shifting mix in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you talk about a book-to-bill meeting or exceeding one times this year, what's going to be the mix of the inbound on a year-over-year basis in terms of relative to 2012? Do you expect your deepwater DEPs to match the numbers in 2012, call it 24 to 25 packages, or is it a significant ramp in FPSOs? It sounds like North American capital equipment is going to be lower; international possibly higher in terms of onshore. How does that mix configure with regard to reaching the book-to-bill of one times?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, you described it pretty well actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you've covered all the bases. Pressure in North American land, obviously, year-over-year, continued interest in the deepwater, as Pete said, more &#x2013; we've got high expectations for Brazil to contribute to more deepwater orders, as well as broad ordering around the globe in deepwater. So kind of a, broadly speaking, a shift away from land towards more deepwater.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, last one from me. Jeremy, with regard to the road map for Rig Tech margins for the balance of the year, sounds like flat to up in the first quarter. So, let's call that, whatever, 23%. But how does that evolve over the course of 2013? Do we exit at a higher rate or do we kind of average sort of a sub-25% margin for the year and it's pretty flat for the balance of 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think pretty flat for the balance of 2013.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Muztafago from Societ&#xE9; Gen&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about the FPSO dilution side in Rig Tech. And I guess, what I'm trying to understand there; is that just an issue of restructuring those businesses to get them up to the core of Rig Tech margin? Or is that business just somewhat price-challenged right now given the activity levels that are going on in ordering?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, actually, Ed, it's not actually price-challenged. It's more volume-challenged at this point. We had a big downturn in surf equipment, 2010, 2011. And we've kind of been gradually trying to creep out of that. And I would say, the volume's been an issue, number one.</p>
          <p>Number two, Jeremy spoke to this quite a bit in his comments about the fact that we're building a big plant for flexible pipe in Brazil. And so, that's a specific project-driven drag with start-up costs in Brazil. And those are going to continue for some time, getting that going in our flexible pipe business.</p>
          <p>But I think the main thing we need there are volumes to pick up. Because the pricing we've been getting, particularly for flexible pipe lately, is really pretty good. The incremental margins on it project-by-project are pretty good. So, it's much more of kind of we're, I think, well positioned for when the market really comes on strong. And as Pete said a moment ago, we believe the market is going to come on strong. It's just a matter of when.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so &#x2013; I mean, it sounds to me that absent any further pricing improvements, you can probably get there if volume picks up, which you're sort of, I guess, predicting this year. But if we get a pretty good surge in ordering what do you think can happen there on pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the outlook for pricing improvement obviously rises with demand, and as volumes rise, those two things kind of go hand in hand. And so, we always try to be thoughtful about pricing and try to make sure we're getting paid for the good value that we deliver. So, certainly, as those opportunities present themselves, we're going to act on them. But at this point, it's really more of a &#x2013; right now, we need more loading in our infrastructure, in our plants, and that would help.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, I guess, just as a second question. And on the M&amp;A side of the business, can you guys talk to what you're seeing in terms of the potential for more large-scale M&amp;A and really how that might dovetail into what your use of cash might be post-closing the RBN acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you take a look at M&amp;A, we've always been very opportunistic, Ed, and &#x2013; especially when you're talking about larger deals, it really is a question of just time and patience. And we talk about this a lot. I mean, when you're doing those deals, the moon and the stars kind of have to align appropriately, you have to make sure that the stock prices are there, both ours and theirs, if you're talking some of the larger deals. So, we'll continue to be opportunistic and take a look at whatever's out there. There's a lot of things that strategically we still want to do, and so we're going to continue to be active in the market.</p>
          <p>On the other side, though, and especially on some of the smaller deals, it's always been our experience that it really is advantageous to be able to take advantage of that in down markets. There's a lot of folks that, when things are good, they think they're never going to get bad. And when they're bad, they think they're never going to get good. And so, we like to kind of pounce and be able to do some things when we need to, when things are a little softer.</p>
          <p>So, we will continue to be very aggressive in the M&amp;A area, and we'll continue to look at a lot of different things that fit with our strategic plan that we've got and to fit into the things that we want to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sure. I mean, $500 million in Q4 is not exactly a small amount. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. I really appreciate it.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. Hi. Good morning. How's everybody?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. Excellent. So, you guys did a great job outlining the prospects and I know you guys are &#x2013; no one's better in tune to the market than you guys are. I just want to dig a little bit further on the outlook here, as you guys indicated for Rig Tech and Rig Tech orders, and you identified some opportunity sets. And, Clay, you mentioned a number of entrepreneurs coming into the market. Last time the entrepreneurs were basically headquartered out of Norway. Where do you see this next throng of entrepreneurs emerging from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some are Norwegian. But, Kurt, we have inquiry &#x2013; inbound inquiries from lots of places around the globe. And so we're happy to work with whoever we find creditworthy and willing to &#x2013; and understands the value that NOV can provide to their new business opportunities. But suffice to say, the strong returns that are possible in deepwater rig building haven't gone unnoticed by lots of entrepreneurs around the globe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I wanted to follow up, too. And Pete, you mentioned you were in China, I guess, earlier in the week, and you mentioned a number of Chinese yards getting very aggressive in trying to fill their business backlog. And I'm sure you're finding every way possible to help them in that process, mutually beneficial operation, I'm sure. But I know that there's been a number of questions over the years about the quality and the timeliness of what comes out of the Chinese yards. So, what &#x2013; in your mind, Pete, what do you think is changing, what has changed, and what gives you the kind of confidence that you have that China is going to be able to improve on their quality and delivery times?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Kurt, that's a great question and I think I can answer it pretty simply, and it's called the learning curve. As you take look, even if you go back to the Korean yards, it took the Korean yards a period of time to learn and figure out just what's going on. I mean, if you go back to the mid-90s, there were some issues in all yards about getting this stuff done appropriately.</p>
          <p>I think in China, there's a couple of things that give me a little bit more confidence. I think some of the yards have changed management. They've brought different people in. They've brought people in from Korea. They've brought people in from Singapore. They've brought folks in that kind of understand the way to do things. I like the professionalism that I'm seeing out of these yards.</p>
          <p>In particular, I met with the Chairman of a couple of yards while I was there this past weekend and I like what I'm seeing. I'm seeing a lot more very much of a western-style management, a very good understanding of safety, a very good understanding of quality, and they also know that they need NOV to help them. And that's what I like the most about them. And the fact to the matter is that they know that having us there, we can help them scale some of those challenges that they have.</p>
          <p>So, I feel pretty good. And I think, again, from what I started with, it comes back to really the learning curve. And I think they've gotten on that learning curve and they're going to do better in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now I don't want to leave Jeremy out of the mix. So, I'm going to bend the rules here a little bit. So, Jeremy, you were kind enough to answer the question on the prospect for Rig Technology margins throughout the course of the year. So, I'm going to ask you about PS&amp;S. How do you see PS&amp;S margin evolving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the start of the year, we'll probably see a slight dip as we referenced earlier in the comments. And then, really, it's going to be dependent on return of activity in North America. All those businesses in PS&amp;S are heavily tied to North America land. And as that market goes, so goes the PS&amp;S group in terms of margin. There are companies out there who have speculated on their calls that rig counts will increase in Q1 and into Q2. We are not yet seeing that, but we're definitely looking for it. And as you see those rig counts start to tick up, and drilling contractors and well service firms start to work again, they'll start buying products and services from us, and so go our margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our last question comes from Marshall Adkins from Raymond James. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Marshall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>After Clay's diatribe, I feel like I really need to start my question with the word why. So, why are those PS&amp;S margins holding up, I guess, better than most of us thought? I mean, you've seen a lot of the North American names really take a hit with the low rig count last quarter, but you guys seemed to be remarkably resilient. Is it the offshore side? Is it international &#x2013; help me understand what's going on there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Offshore and international certainly help. But the real issue is a lot of people don't understand that we do have backlog in the PS&amp;S businesses. It's not backlog that we recognize when we report to you guys. But it's backlog that's, kind of, two, three, four months out. And when you see rig activity decline and you see the drilling contractors and well service firms start to slow down, we still have backlog that we're working off over the next three to four months. And so, you won't see it really impact us until three or four months after you see activity decline. And that's kind of where we're hitting right now in Q1. And so, we've worked off those backlogs in Q4. We're now back kind of in that day-to-day business, and now is when you can kind of start to expect revenue to decline a little bit and margins to erode a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. Helpful. On the Rig Tech side, again, very helpful guidance there. The pricing in the backlog, though --is that &#x2013; it seems like some of the other guys are starting to see the backlog price or expect the pricing to move up over the course of the year. And the flat margin you foresee for Rig Tech -- are we seeing better pricing in that and that being offset by other things out there or is it just flat pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, bear in mind, our Rig Tech backlog is heavily dominated by long-term projects, and so the margins move slowly. But, Marshall, I'll &#x2013; and I kind of touched on this in my comments -- the pricing we're seeing out there selling rig equipment continues to bump up against ceilings and competitive forces and so forth and has never gotten back to where it was in 2007 and 2008.</p>
          <p>So, I'd say pricing is &#x2013; it's good. This is &#x2013; I don't want to give you the wrong impression. These were good pieces of work and good projects and we're excited about them, but they &#x2013; I don't think they're going to lead to the kind of margins that we saw a couple of years ago and that's the constraint that we're facing out there.</p>
          <p>So, I would say here in the near &#x2013; in the recent near term, pricing has been pretty stable across most products in rig offshore. Lands is definitely under pressure, frac fleets, well service rigs, those sorts of things, land rigs, definitely under pressure with the downturn in North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I'll also add, too, Marshall, that when you buy NOV, you're not buying necessarily on price either. We're selling quality, and we're not going to equal the low bidder ever. And then we tell all of our customers, if it's about the lowest bid, then don't worry about us because we're not going to be there. We're here to make money, but we're also here to provide outstanding products, and that's what we do.</p>
          <p>And so, I think that's why we continue to have, even though sometimes we have margin erosion, we continue to still have pretty darn solid margins for manufactured products. So, we're going to continue to price aggressively. We have to keep our eye on the competition but we think we provide value and that value's got some margin behind it, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned the long lead times in that backlog. If you get more out of Brazil, does that stretch out the lead times even longer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably will. I mean, I think as you're taking a look at some of the Brazilian shipyards that comes back to what I was just mentioning earlier on the Chinese. There's a learning curve there and our guess is the first couple of drill ships that some of these yards do will take longer than what traditionally we've seen out of Korean shipyards.</p>
