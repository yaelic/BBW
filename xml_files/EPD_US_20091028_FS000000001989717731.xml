          <p>Thank you, Molly . Good morning and welcome to the Enterprise Products and Duncan Energy Partners conference call to discuss third quarter earnings. Mike Creel, President and CEO of Enterprise's General Partner, will begin the call followed by Randy Fowler, Executive Vice President and CFO, and Hank Bachmann, President and CEO of Duncan Energy Partners' general partner who will discuss third quarter results for Duncan Energy Partners. Also in attendance for the call today are Dan Duncan, our Chairman and Founder; Jim Teague, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, and other members of our senior management team. Afterward we will open the call up for your questions.</p>
          <p>During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise's management. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, they can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call. And with that I'll turn the call over to Mike.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong results from all of our businesses, supported by increased volumes across the board. We had record NGL, crude oil and petrochemical pipeline volumes of 2.5 million barrels per day this quarter. Natural gas pipeline volumes were 9.6 trillion BTUs per day, 9% higher than the third quarter of 2008 and NGL fractionation volumes were a record 453,000 barrels per day, 10% higher than last year. Butane isomerization volumes were also a record at 104,000 barrels per day, an increase of 46% over the prior year.</p>
          <p>As a result, we reported record gross operating margin of $561 million this quarter, which if adjusted for the TOPS charges would have been $594 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $514 million for the quarter and without TOPS and the merger-related costs, adjusted EBITDA would have been $557 million compared with $453 million for the third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Based on Enterprise's strong cash flows, our Board approved our 21st consecutive quarterly increase in the cash distribution to $0.5525 per unit, a 5.7% increase over the rate paid with respect to the third quarter of 2008. Enterprise generated distributable cash flow of $402 million for the quarter, including $43 million of distributable cash flow attributable to TEPPCO, which includes about $40 million of TOPS and merger-related charges.</p>
          <p>Since Enterprise will pay quarterly cash distributions on November 5 on the Enterprise common units issued to complete the merger with TEPPCO, we include TEPPCO's distributable cash flow in calculating our total distributable cash flow for the quarter. Distributable cash flow provided 1.03 times coverage of our quarterly cash distribution declared with respect to the third quarter and enabled us to retain $10 million of excess cash flow. Year-to-date, we've retained approximately $100 million of distributable cash flow. Without the TOPS and merger-related costs at Enterprise and TEPPCO, total distributable cash flow for the third quarter would have been $484 million and would have provided 1.3 times coverage of the cash distribution.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to take a few minutes to review the business environment and the performance of our business segments for the quarter. Generally we continue to see strong volumes coming into our system from producers, particularly from the Piceance Basin in Louisiana, where some offshore production was restored after service was resumed on pipelines that were impacted by last year's hurricanes. Despite lower rig counts in most of the areas where we operate, volumes held up well due to a backlog of well connects, new gathering systems being connected to fire up facilities and shallow declines curves in the San Juan Basin.</p>
          <p>We also saw strong demand from our hydrocarbon-consuming customers. NGLs continue to benefit from the high relative cost of crude oil to natural gas. NGLs were the preferred feed stock for the petrochemical industry and additives for motor gasoline due to its cost advantage over the more expensive crude oil derivatives.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter ethylene steam crackers operated at an annual production rate of about 50.5 billion pounds, essentially flat with the operating rate for the second quarter. Ethane demand was approximately 812,000 barrels per day for the third quarter and this compares with a five-year average rate of 52.6 billion pounds of ethylene production and ethane consumption of 745,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Looking at the forward curve for the next 12 months, ethane continues to be the only feed stock that is consistently profitable. As a result of ethane profit margins and the petrochemical industry's long-term expectation that crude oil will be more costly relative to natural gas, ethylene producers have completed or are in the process of making modifications to their facilities to enable them to consume more ethane, or ethane-propane mix. These modifications could result in over 100,000 barrels per day of incremental demand for ethane and EP mix. We began to see the impacts of these modifications this month. Currently we estimate that industry is operating at an annual rate of approximately 50 billion pounds and consuming 850,000 barrels per day of ethane, including ethane contained in EP mix.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter of 2009, gross operating margin for the NGL Pipelines &amp; Services segment increased $56 million or 17% to $392 million, with all three of the underlying businesses reporting improved performance versus the third quarter of last year. The NGL Pipelines &amp; Storage business accounted for 50 million of this increase on a 223,000-barrel per day increase in volume. While the Mid-America and Seminole pipeline systems and our NGL export facility accounted for the majority of this increase, most of our NGL pipelines reported increases in gross operating margin and volume for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our natural gas processing business recorded another good quarter, with gross operating margin of $239 million. Equity NGL production increased 6% to 116,000 barrels per day due to higher volumes from our Meeker, Pioneer processing facilities in the Rockies and from our Louisiana plants. We currently have about 74% of our Rockies equity NGL production for the remainder of 2009 hedged at a margin of approximately $0.66 per gallon, with the margin being the price at which we sold our NGLs forward, less the natural gas cost of the shrink.</p>
          <p>We've also hedged about 52% of our equity NGL production from percent of proceeds contracts. We've not executed any natural gas processing hedges for 2010, but we're continuing to evaluate opportunities. Current processing margins for ethane in the Rockies have remained attractive at approximately $0.32 per gallon before transportation and fractionation, supported by strong demand by the petrochemical industry.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin from our NGL Fractionation business increased 21% to $31 million for the third quarter based on record fractionation volumes and lower fuel costs. Our NGL fractionators continue to run at near capacity. Our onshore Natural Gas Pipelines and Services segment reported gross operating margin of $62 million this quarter compared to $88 million for the third quarter of last year. This decrease was due to a $27 million decline from the San Juan gathering system, which had lower transportation fees, which are indexed to natural gas prices and also from lower revenues from condensate sales.</p>
          <p>San Juan natural gas prices averaged $2.88 per MMBTU this quarter compared to an $8.48 for the third quarter of 2008.  And while lower gas prices reduced profits for this segment, Enterprise as a whole benefited from these lower prices through a decrease in fuel costs at our NGL pipelines and fractionators, butane isomerization facilities and propylene fractionators.</p>
          <p>Total onshore natural gas transportation volumes increased 9% to 8.2 trillion BTUs per day in the third quarter of 2009. This month, the Kobrand Valley pipeline in the Piceance Basin began service, flowing an incremental 30 million cubic feet a day of natural gas into our Piceance gathering pipeline. Volumes are expected to increase to about 80 million a day by year-end. The Piceance gathering pipeline is currently moving over 900 million cubic feet a day of natural gas into our Meeker gas processing complex.  Our Sherman Extension expansion of the Texas Intrastate System begins service at the beginning of August, earning approximately $5 million per month in demand revenues, irrespective of actual throughput. The Sherman Extension is currently flowing about 700 million cubic feet a day.</p>
          <p>Last month, we announced a long-term agreement to provide natural gas transportation and processing services on dedicated acreage owned by one of the largest and most active producers in developing Eagleford Shale play in South Texas. This agreement covers more than 150,000 acres in the heart of the Eagleford Shale region. We are strategically positioned to benefit from this emerging gas play with processing capacity of more than 1.5 billion cubic feet a day, over 8,000 miles of natural gas gathering and transportation pipelines and a direct link to the largest NGL hub in the world at Mont Belvieu. Because of the close proximity of our facilities to the Eagleford Shale, only modest capital expenditures will be needed for us to provide additional midstream services for producers in this important region.</p>
          <p>Yesterday we announced our plans to extend our Acadian pipeline system into the Haynesville region in Northwest Louisiana. Our Haynesville extension will provide producers in the rapidly expanding Haynesville Shale play access to attractive markets through connections with Acadian's existing 1,000 mile pipeline system in south Louisiana, which has over 150 end-use markets, rapid cycle salt dome storage capacity and an ability to make physical deliveries into the Henry Hub. The Haynesville extension will also connect with nine major interstate pipelines.</p>
          <p>Based on current estimates, the Haynesville Shale play covers almost two million acres and current production is more than one Bcf a day from over 200 wells. This shale play is estimated to have the lowest finding and development costs per Mcf compared to other shale plays except for the Barnett. I'll stop there, since Hank will discuss more about this pipeline project a little bit later. I'll just say that we're excited about the prospect of having a foothold in yet another major shale play in the United States.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin for the Offshore Pipelines and Services segment increased to $56 million from $18 million last year. Gross operating margin for the third quarter of this year included a charge of $33 million for litigation settlement and $18 million for recoveries under business interruption insurance related to the 2008 hurricanes. The third quarter of 2008 includes 35 million of hurricane repair expenses.</p>
          <p>After adjusting for these non-recurring items, the comparable gross operating margin numbers were $71 million for the third quarter of this year compared with $53 million for the third quarter of last year, an increase of 34%. This increase was primarily attributable to the Shenzi, Poseidon and Cameron crude oil pipelines, as well as the Independence Hub and Trail.</p>
          <p>Our Petrochemical Services segment reported a 35% increase in gross operating margin to $50 million for the third quarter. The partnership's octane enhancement business reported $18 million improvement in gross operating margin this quarter due to higher volumes and lower operating expenses and our butane isomerization business reported a $4 million increase in gross operating margin due to record volumes this quarter.</p>
          <p>On Monday of this week, we completed the TEPPCO merger, creating the largest publicly traded partnership with a current Enterprise value of more than $30 billion. With approximately 71% of the outstanding units voted and 97% of those units voting in favor of the merger, there was overwhelming support of the merger by the TEPPCO unit holders. The addition of the TEPPCO assets will diversify our portfolio of midstream assets and with the addition of the refined products and onshore crude oil businesses, our gross operating margin from fee-based assets will increase. We expect a seamless transition, since the partnerships have been under common control since 2005 and we look forward to serving our customers and investors with a stronger and more diverse partnership.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn it over to Randy Fowler to discuss other financial items.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike. I'd like to briefly discuss the income items below gross operating margin.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization expense in operating costs and expenses for the third quarter of 2009 increased to $161 million from $138 million for the third quarter of 2008, primarily due to increased property plant and equipment from the additions in the first half of 2009, and $7 million attributable to accelerated depreciation and the retirement of certain assets.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A expense increased to $34 million this quarter from $22 million in the third quarter last year, primarily due to $10 million of merger-related expenses. We reported $128 million of interest expense this quarter compared to $103 million for the third quarter last year. Average debt outstanding increased to 9.4 billion this quarter from 8.1 billion in the third quarter of 2008, primarily due to debt incurred to fund growth capital investment and working capital needs. About $11 million of this increase is attributable to a lower amount of capitalized interest due to a decline in the amount of construction work in progress.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital expenditures, we invested approximately $167 million in growth capital projects and $44 million in sustaining capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2009. In terms of capitalization, at September 30, 2009, Enterprise had $9.1 billion of debt including the 100% of our 1.23 billion of hybrid securities and $463 million of debt at Duncan Energy Partners.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2009, which is defined as EBITDA less equity earnings, plus actual cash distribution to receive from unconsolidated affiliates was $2.1 billion. Our consolidated leverage ratio of debt adjusted for 50% equity content in the hybrids to the last 12 months of adjusted EBITDA was 4.1 times at September 30, 2009. Last 12 months adjusted EBITDA and leverage were negatively affected by approximately $33 million for the top settlement and $14 million of merger-related expenses that were incurred in the second quarter and third quarter of this year. Excluding these costs, the debt to adjusted EBITDA would have been closer to four times. Leverage is elevated at September 30, due to the higher level of working capital that we have. We expect leverage to be less than four times at year-end.</p>
          <p>In September, we priced a public offering of $500 million of 10-year senior notes at a yield of 5.33% and $600 million of 30-year senior notes at 6.17%. We also raised $380 million in the equity markets in September comprised of $230 million from a public offering of 8.3 million units, which included the full over-allotment option exercised by the underwriters, and $150 million from a private placement of 5.9 million units sold to EPCO Holdings, a private company controlled by Dan Duncan.</p>
          <p>At the end of September, including the proceeds from the $1.1 billion offering of senior notes which closed on October 2nd, Enterprise had liquidity of approximately $2.3 billion. Adjusting for the repayment of a $500 million note maturity on October 15th and the repayment and termination of the TEPPCO credit facility on October 26 for approximately $819 million, Enterprise had liquidity of approximately $1 billion.</p>
          <p>Enterprise completed the exchange of approximately 1.66 billion of TEPPCO's senior notes and $286 million of TEPPCO junior notes for new Enterprise notes with the same ranking maturity and interest rate. Enterprise's now $12 billion debt portfolio pro forma for the TEPPCO merger is now approximately 17% floating rate exposure, with an average interest rate of approximately 5.8% and a weighted average maturity, assuming the first call date for the hybrids of 9.1 years.</p>
          <p>Later today we expect to file on 8-K tabular financial and operating data for TEPPCO for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2009. This tabular data will be consistent with the data TEPPCO has historically provided in their press releases. Enterprise is scheduled to file its 10-Q for the third quarter on November 9. TEPPCO will not file a 10-Q for the third quarter. However, we will file interim financial statements for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2009 for TEPPCO on an 8-K on November 9th.</p>
          <p>The merger will be accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control, which is similar to a pooling of interest. By December 1, we expect to file a recast of Enterprise's 2008 Form 10-K, which includes the financial statements for Enterprise for the years ending 2006, 2007 and 2008. In addition we will also file a recast of the Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2009 and we also plan to provide recast quarterly data for the first and second quarters of 2009 as well. This information will also include the reorganization of our business segments in light of the merger with TEPPCO, which will be described in the recast of our 2008 Form 10-K. With that, I'll turn the call over to Hank Bachmann to discuss Duncan Energy Partners.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Randy. We are pleased to report another strong quarter for Duncan Energy Partners, supported not only by a 134% increase in net income but also by a significant increase in distributable cash flow. In both cases primarily attributable to the midstream businesses that we acquired from Enterprise in December 2008, which we call the DEP II midstream businesses.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter of 2009 we reported net income attributable to Duncan Energy of $24.8 million, or $0.43 per common unit on a fully diluted basis, compared to $10.6 million, or $0.18 per common unit on a fully diluted basis for the third quarter of 2008. Distributable cash flow increased to $34.6 million for the third quarter of 2009, from $7.6 million for the third quarter last year, not only as a result of $21.6 million of cash distribution received to the midstream businesses acquired from Enterprise in December 2008, but also because of a $6 million increase in cash distributions we received from the businesses we acquired in connection with our IPO. We continue to benefit from the cash flow generated by the DEP II midstream businesses and based on the partnership's preferred return on its investments in these businesses, we expect to receive in the future at least $22 million each quarter.</p>
          <p>On October 15, 2009 the Board of Directors of our General Partner declared a quarterly cash distribution rate of $0.44 per common unit, which represents a 4.8% increase from the $0.42 per common unit paid for the third quarter of 2008. This latest increase in our quarterly distribution is our fourth consecutive increase and will be paid on November 5, 2009. Distributable cash flow for the quarter provided a solid 1.4 times coverage of this increased cash distribution.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to briefly discuss the performance of our segments for the third quarter. This quarter our onshore natural gas pipeline business segment reported gross operating margin of $40.5 million, compared to $41 million for the third quarter of last year. Natural gas throughput volumes for the segment averaged 4.69 trillion BTUs per day in the third quarter of 2009 compared to 4.7 trillion BTUs per day in the third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin from the Texas Intrastate System decreased $3.1 million this quarter compared to the third quarter of last year, primarily due to lower transportation volumes, a decreased condensate sales and higher operating expenses. Partially offsetting this decrease in gross operating margin was approximately $9 million of gross operating margin as a result of firm capacity fees from the Sherman Extension pipeline that commenced commercial service on October 1 of this year.</p>
          <p>The Acadian pipeline system and Wilson natural gas storage facility together generated a $2.6 million quarter-to-quarter increase in gross operating margin due to increased transportation volumes and lower pipeline integrity expenses on Acadian and higher firm storage reservation fees from the Wilson facility.</p>
          <p>Mike mentioned the new extension of our Acadian pipeline system, called the Haynesville Extension, to the Haynesville Shale in Northwestern Louisiana. This pipeline was initially designed to transport up to 1.4 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from the Haynesville Shale through our Acadian pipeline system and additionally, nine major interstate pipelines. By leveraging our existing Acadian and Cypress systems, we will be able to provide Haynesville producers additional take-away capacity and market access to their production and better equalize natural gas supply and demand on our Acadian and Cypress pipeline systems.</p>
          <p>The pipeline will connect Haynesville producers to markets other than Perryville and will keep significant quantities of gas in Louisiana, as opposed to exporting all the production into interstate markets. If additional long-term commitments are received before pipe orders are placed within the next week or so, the capacity of the Haynesville pipeline could be increased up to 2.2 billion cubic feet per day. We expect the new extension pipeline to be in service in September of 2011.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our NGL Pipelines and Services business segment, gross operating margin for this segment increased to $28.3 million for the third quarter of 2009, up from $20.2 million for the third quarter of 2008. After adjusting for measurement gains associated with the partnership's Mont Belvieu storage facility recorded in both quarters, gross operating margin this quarter increased 44% over the third quarter of last year. This increase is attributable primarily to higher storage fees and volumes and lower operating expenses at our Mont Belvieu storage facilities. As a reminder, operational measurement gains and losses at our Mont Belvieu Texas storage facility are allocated to Enterprise and reflected on our financial statements as an adjustment to non-controlling interest.</p>
          <p>NGL transportation volumes decreased to 105,000 barrels per day in the third quarter of 2009 from 115,000 barrels per day in the third quarter of 2008. NGL Fractionation volumes averaged 74,000 barrels per day this quarter versus 78,000 barrels per day in the same quarter of last year. Our Petrochemical Services business report increased gross operating margin of $2.8 million this quarter and $2.5 million for the third quarter of last year, due to higher transportation volumes and lower operating expenses on the Lou-Tex Propylene Pipeline.</p>
          <p>Total petrochemical transportation volumes averaged 35,000 barrels per day this quarter versus 33,000 barrels per day recorded in the third quarter of 2008. Sustaining capital expenditures were $13.8 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $13.5 million spent in the third quarter of 2008. Approximately $11 million of this $13.8 million spent this quarter was for the midstream businesses acquired in December 2008. Through nine months, we have spent $37 million in sustaining capital expenditures and we expect to spend approximately $55 million for the entire year. This compares to $54 million spent in 2008.</p>
          <p>Interest expense increased to $3.4 million for the third quarter of 2009, from $2.8 million recorded in the third quarter of last year due to higher average debt outstanding as a result of our borrowing $282 million to fund the cash portion of our acquisition of the DEP II midstream businesses. Total debt principle outstanding at the end of September 2009 increased to $463 million from the $212 million at the end of September of last year, primarily as a result of our December 2008 borrowings. We had total liquidity of approximately $147 million at September 30, 2009, which includes availability under our $300 million revolving credit facility as well as unrestricted cash.</p>
          <p>In closing, we're excited about both the Haynesville extension pipeline project and the completion of the Sherman extension. And as I've said the last few quarters, we're pleased to report another quarter of solid results and strong coverage of the cash distributions paid to our partners.</p>
          <p>Randy, we're now ready to take questions on Enterprise or Duncan Energy.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You guys talked about your presence in the Eagleford Shale earlier and said that CapEx is going to be modest. Can you elaborate a bit more on that and is there much there that needs to be built? Or are you just going to benefit from your assets already there? And what are you hearing and seeing from the producers in that region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of capital, our guess is over the next year it's maybe 50 or $60 million. We've got pipeline assets in the Eagleford Shale. We've got seven gas processing plants in South Texas. We've got NGL pipeline's coming out of there, so really it's some de-bottlenecking extending into some of the producing areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And also now that you have TEPPCO, what opportunities do you see with crude storage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I recognize we've only owned it for 48 hours, but we are looking at what we might be able to do with the TEPPCO assets that may be a little different from what TEPPCO had historically done. Certainly interested in some of the assets they have near the Marcellus Basin, so we're looking at opportunities there. We're looking at ways to further expand their crude business and really just apply some of the approaches that we used on the marketing side for our businesses to increase throughput through existing assets and really just organic growth around their existing assets.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you're breaking up just a little bit, but suffice to say that the pipeline that we're planning comes out of Northwest Louisiana, down into our Acadian System and there it crosses a number of interstate pipelines. So there are multiple opportunities for production to move from the Haynesville into the interstate markets.</p>

        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Brian let me go back to your question on the Haynesville. One of the things that we think gives us an advantage over other pipelines at the interstate is that because we're an intrastate, we have a much shorter timeline. It's about a year less time to construct because of the regulatory process required for an interstate pipeline. So we think we've got a distinct advantage there as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>First question, Mike, for you on the NGL side of the business, specifically the NGL export facility, with the cheaper relative price in the U.S. dollar certainly here in the past few weeks and obviously cheap feed stock costs, it looks like your export dock's probably going to be running full at about 250,000 through the end of this year. But can you give us a little bit more color into how you think the export dock could run into the first half of 2010 with the existing price curve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to let Jim take that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're already &#x2013; we're already selling space on that export dock through, in some cases through all of 2010 we're getting inquiries. So we're quite bullish on what we'll be doing across the terminal at a minimum through the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Jim, as you see the conversion of more of the heavies over to the light-end crackers, how has that helped your ability to capitalize on the propylene market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess Jerry's not here, is he? We are finding our sales of propylene to be very strong and we're not &#x2013; we understand that as these guys crack lighter, we get a kind of a double benefit. We sell more ethane and there's more of a pool for the propylene we produce. So we're running pretty strong on our propylene plants. I think all but one small train, Dan, and we're getting a lot of interest not only for current sales, but a lot of interest for more term business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Randy, a quick balance sheet question for you, you talked about your leverage getting down to under four times at the end of the year. Now I know as of the end of the second quarter, you had about 640 million of NGLs that you had taken ownership of and were storing in your tanks and had sold forward. Can you give us a sense for how much of that came back to you in the third quarter? And more importantly, how much you think's going to come back to you in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Darren, I think actually in the third quarter we probably utilized, probably at the margin, more working capital in the third quarter for some of these opportunities. At the end of the third quarter we estimated having about $740 million worth of capital tied up in inventories tied to forward sales and we think that balance will be reduced by $500 million going into year-end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one big-picture question, if I could, and it's really more centered around cost of capital and the competitive landscape for acquisitions, but when you look at your recent term debt issuances and your current equity yield and consensus estimates for your distribution growth, is it fair to say your cost of capital is about seven to 8%? And taking that a step further, when you look to lever off that financial platform and you're looking at what's probably north of 100 billion in qualifying assets owned by the majors, where do you see the best return of potential cash invested?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the &#x2013; looking at the snapshot cost of capital, it's kind of right there. In terms of opportunities to acquire assets, we look at all kinds of opportunities &#x2013; whether they're from companies that are just trying to shed parts of their business, whether they're companies that are in play, &#x2013; certainly waiting on majors to decide that it makes more sense for them to shed some of their midstream assets and frankly, weighing the benefits of those types of transactions against organic growth. And one of the advantages that we've talked about in terms of our organic growth is that we're better able to control the outlay of capital and many times, those have higher returns because we plan those projects to take advantage of our downstream assets. So sitting here today I can't tell you exactly what we might be looking at over the next 12 to 24 months in terms of acquisitions. But suffice it to say that we look at a lot of things and you've got to kiss a lot of frogs. It's a -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as long as you're kissing the frogs and you're putting up the type of rates of return on your organic projects, it's all that counts. So I appreciate the color. Keep up the good work.</p>

          <p>Couple questions. One, Jim, can you go back to the Propylene discussion? I guess if I read it correctly in your press release, it's &#x2013; you talked about seeing lower margins for propylene fractionation in the quarter. Can you talk about what's going on there?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Michael, what we saw. We saw, again, remember this goes back to &#x2013; compared to third quarter of last year I guess, unit margins we were seeing as being lower but we did see an increase in volume, propylene fractionation volume overall.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Michael, and one more thing, on those unit margins one thing you could be also picking up in there is the value of some of the co-products in the third quarter of last year, which just had a higher value than what they had in the third quarter this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got it. Just going back to the working capital and the NGL and Contango inventory you've got, is there any way to quantify I guess what kind of return you're going to see from that trade you made in that 500 million that's going to come out of working capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well there is for us. We typically don't advertise &#x2013; give forward-looking information, but those transactions generally have returns in the  anywhere from 18 to 30%. I mean in some cases it's as low as 15. That's kind of unusual and some cases it's darn near 100%. But 20, 25% on average is probably a ballpark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and do you view this as an &#x2013; sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's an annualized number, so don't take $700 million times 25%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got it. Just two more quick ones from me, one, I didn't see, unless I missed it, what you think you'll spend on this new Haynesville project that you announced and how you would allocate capital between Enterprise and Duncan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You didn't miss it. Good eye. When we presented that to the Enterprise Board and it was also presented to the Duncan Energy Partners Board, what we both agreed was that, as we develop the projects that we'll agree upon a way to finance it and allocate those costs. But we have not announced the cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last question, can you just talk a little bit about what you saw in the third quarter in your Texas Intrastate Pipeline system? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Chris, you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Texas Intrastate, the pipeline itself, the volumes were down slightly just a lot of it due to weather, a lot of it due to the stress west-east across the pipe. But when you throw in the increase on the Sherman offsetting last year our throughput and Sherman not in service, we were hauling gas out of the Barnett back west of Waha. This year that gas just went straight out the Sherman lateral out to the eastern pipes, so the volumes on Enterprise Texas were down slightly. Remember we have a lot of our Enterprise, Texas system sold out on a firm basis, so revenues weren't off as much as the volume throughput and we still get our reservation fees irregardless of the throughput.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. I'll add one more question. Chris, how do you see basis differentials, particularly across Texas kind of shaking out over the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We see a fundamental shift in the spread across the pipe. Last year at third quarter I think the Waha to ship channel spread was in excess of a dollar. This year it was in more to the $0.20 range when you look at the three-month average. If you look at the last 30 days, it was more flat. Due to the Haynesville coming on and due to the Sherman Extension being able to displace the Barnett out to the eastern board not having to haul that gas back to the west, we see the demand out at Waha staying flat, supply decreasing. So that basis is coming in tighter. With the Haynesville gas showing up over on the East Texas, North Louisiana corridor, we see congestion over on that side of the world, so the demand &#x2013; more supply less demand over in that part of the world bringing the spread back into a more normal historical spread in the 15 to $0.20 range across Texas.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ross. The way that this project is being developed by Acadian, which is owned 34% by Enterprise, 66% by Duncan Energy Partners, again as we develop the project a little further and think about how we're going to fund it, as between Enterprise and Duncan Energy Partners, ownership of Acadian could shift. There's a lot of things that could happen. It may be that the ownership remains exactly the same. We just really hadn't gotten to that point yet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine. Second of all, in the press release I noticed that I guess South Texas volumes might have been down a little bit if you can just talk about that. I guess that's just laying down of rigs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The South Texas, it was just more or less laying down of rigs, but what you're seeing on the throughput side as far as the NGL's concerned, what's coming out on the Eagleford's coming out in richer content of the NGL value. So you're not seeing a proportionate on the NGL side, just your volume throughput's lower, but you're getting higher GPM gas coming out of the Eagleford what we're seeing thus far.</p>

          <p>Okay. The other thing was on the petrochemical business, it looked like the volumes improved pretty substantially. And just was wondering, are we back at a run rate for that now in your opinion?</p>

          <p>Just a couple of follow-up questions for DEP also. For the Texas Intrastate for DEP, is the variance primarily attributable to I guess the lower transportation volume similar to EPD?</p>

          <p>Yeah. The answer's yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and for the NGL transport and frac volumes for DEP, I was surprised that the numbers were down year-over-year given the variable fundamentals.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think a lot of it has to do with the South Texas gas production.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have seen throughputs fall. That's one area in our whole system that we have seen some reduction in gas throughputs here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And finally a question about the Haynesville extension, can you just give more color on who the anchor shippers might be and maybe the length of the contract?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sharon, this is Chris. We won't give the names of any of the individual parties, but I will tell you we have signed up seven different parties. So we don't really have a anchor shipper, which is very unique about a project of this type. We have seven different parties, the lowest one being 100 million cubic feet a day. I won't give you to the high end of the range, what the high ends were. As you saw in the press release, we're tying to nine different producer locations, so what we feel very comfortable with is the diversity of the producer base, the diversity of credit risk. And we don't have that one 900-pound gorilla driving this project that &#x2013; this is a nice project that the producers really wanted to drive home.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All the agreements are ten-year agreements and some have options to extend beyond ten years, all firm demand, very little commodity. It's 99% demand, 1% commodity, so they're all firm reservation fees.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>It's risk added. It just really depends on how many other producers sign up. Jim?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, probably. We've had reservoir people look at this thing and I mean, it's all over the map, but I think a conservative one is what, one and a half Bcf a day that we could &#x2013; you could see out of, kind of the sweet spot of the Eagleford. I think we've &#x2013; that's about the best I can do right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The thing we're excited about is we're just all over Eagleford with pipe and plant, so more and more we're hearing people talk a lot more positively about it. We've &#x2013; I think you saw a press release where we have one producer that we've gotten a rather large acreage dedication from. We're talking constantly to everybody that's down there, sending maps of our system to virtually all of them and I think we'll &#x2013; now it's basically let's see how it develops. It's really rich &#x2013; six, eight GPM in some cases down there?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay so the &#x2013; and the 1.5 BCF sweet spot, that's where you're expecting to operate at or is that how much more you're expecting to capture?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, John, this is Dan. Let me add a little bit more color to it on the natural gas liquid side. I think we're the only company that has natural gas liquid pipeline that flows from the South Texas into the Mont Belvieu, Beaumont, Louisiana grid up here for the petrochemical and the refineries and everything. So we're the main one for the NGL take-away. There was other people down there would be after the gas take-away. You've got Camden Morgan, they're heavy down there. You've got Energy Transfer that's heavy on take-away. Then you got some smaller people down there. But the NGL side, we're the only one as of today I think, is the only take-away of natural gas liquid from South Texas into the Houston, Beaumont refinery petrochemical world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the real advantage that gives us is that market down there's fully served today, so anything that's extracted from that gas down there in terms of liquids has got to move out because the market is already being served. And in many cases &#x2013; and you can almost say the same thing, Chris, about natural gas. So we know exactly what we want to look like coming out of the Eagleford whenever this thing fully develops and it will require the liquids to move out and in large part, the gas to move out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so you'll be able to capture quite a bit of basis spread on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll be able to collect a lot of fees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay and then on the &#x2013; in your NGL segment this quarter, the fee-based processing, I noticed it was down from the prior quarter about 500 a day or so. What was driving that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's primarily based on just reduced volumes for the quarter compared to last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean quarter-over-quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the same story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But what was driving the decrease in volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You had production laying down and rig activities less moving into this quarter from prior quarters, so a continuing trend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Primarily probably &#x2013; and I'll look at it. This is Jim. Where we've seen &#x2013; the only place we've seen a real significant decrease, and it's not really significant, but a decrease is in South Texas. And that's where we do have a lot of our fee-based business, but I need to double check on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I'm not sure what you're calling fee-based, but also we have a lot of shut-in that happened in the Piceance Basin and then Jonah and Pinedale. To some extent, it's fee based, to some extent it gets over into the processing side. But these are wells shut in because of price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It wasn't because the wells wasn't out there. They just shut the wells in effective, I think I'm right on this, November 1. All the shut in wells that we are familiar with I think is back on full stream starting November 1 and that includes Jonah, Pinedale, some South Texas deals and other places we feel that they are coming back on stream effective November 1, because of price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Because I noticed that you were at 27.14 last quarter, you came in at 22.47 this quarter. So you're expecting that to come back up November 1? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All the shut-in gas that we know of right now, all the people that shut in their gas, they have come back on November 1, I think 100%, because of the price of natural gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then any chance you could break out how much was provided by marketing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well marketing only takes product when &#x2013; they only take product that goes through our facilities. So I don't know that we actually break down what's provided by our own marketing people versus what's breaking down because the producers themselves bring it on. Then from there, we &#x2013; all we're doing is they may market, but they'll put it in one end of our facility and take it out the other, the same as anyone else in the system. They all have the same choices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I was thinking more along the line &#x2013; just looked like the margins per gallon that you're able to earn were pretty strong. And you indicated in the press release there was some marketing contribution there that contributed to that 239 million figure. But the marketing number was not broken out. I was just wondering if you could give us an idea of what contribution was coming from that if you have it. I don't know if you have it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't break out marketing separately because we really view marketing as part of the assets. It's really there to fill up the assets. Now clearly, since we've got these Contango plays then that's a little different, but it's just additive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I was just curious on the fractionation margins, that those were down Q over Q when you had mentioned you were going to do a 75,000 barrel a day expansion. So I was curious, I think last quarter you were around $0.021. This quarter, looks like about 1.8. And I was just curious given the shortage, why the margins came down a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think part of that is just gas prices being lower. We &#x2013; when gas prices go up, we usually collect a little more on fuel than we do when gas prices are down. We collect a little bit of margin on that fuel. And also I think we've shipped more barrels to Louisiana through the joint venture fractionator at Promix this quarter than we did in third quarter of last year. So the markets aren't quite as good in Louisiana.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just because we're full at Mont Belvieu.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, do you have what the equity in earnings from the unconsolidated affiliates contribution was from onshore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, we do not have that information broke out &#x2013; not in front of us for this session, but we should be able to come in &#x2013; Rena should be able to follow you up with you for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we talk later, I'll get that for you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then how much gas storage capacity do you have on line now? I think you were supposed to &#x2013; you were scheduled to bring something on line this quarter. But I didn't &#x2013; you're working &#x2013; something was coming on in Mont Belvieu so for more gas storage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing on the gas side. It's December of next year we're supposed to come on with five Bcf of additional Wilson's capacity and we're constantly looking at Pedal for alternatives, but nothing was planned that I can think of unless on the NGL side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I'm wrong on that. What is the working gas storage capacity now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About 27 Bcfs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>27 Bcfs. Okay. And then five is scheduled from Wilson for next year?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Then in the press release you mention that Shenzi, Cameron and Poseidon, combined, they increased by 20 million. What's &#x2013; do you have the breakdown on that?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a little over 700 million for the quarter. It was about 712.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember that the volumes were down a bit in the third quarter because we had work being done on the separators.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then what &#x2013; are you running back up around 900?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're at seven, 750, somewhere in that range.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're running about 750 now, with the anticipation that it may increase a little, but it will stay down in that range.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then, finally, maintenance CapEx for the full year, what are you expecting now?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, it is &#x2013; I think we're still what we were talking about last quarter. I think it's about $186 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So there's quite a bit coming in the fourth quarter. Okay, great. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I wondered if you could go over what drove the decline in cash from operations for the quarter and year-to-date?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably the largest one item, I'm looking back here on Exhibit C of the EPD Earnings Announcement, second line from the bottom. The net effects of changes in operating account was $245 million for the third quarter of 2009 and that's probably the most significant part of it. And that's, again, utilizing some capital for the Contango opportunities, the forward-sales opportunities. John, coming back to you, you had asked about the maintenance CapEx, probably closer to about $170 million for the full year. Sorry about that, Phyllis, just wanted to get that corrected out there.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Pareck .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. It might be too soon to tell, but how can you better utilize TEPPCO's barge business? Is there a significant opportunity on the marketing side for you guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're right. It may be too soon to tell, but with 48 hours I know that Jim's probably got a better answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff , the one thing there is the barge business at TEPPCO has been operating at rates of 92% plus. So they've had a pretty good history of high utilization rates to begin with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jeff , they do have some LPG barges that have recently gone into service. And so certainly with our business, there may be a way to utilize those a little differently. With our NGL production in South Louisiana, there may be a fit but, things that we will be looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Dan Duncan. I was &#x2013; by being the position I was, I sit in on a lot of the TEPPCO &#x2013; well I sit in on all of the TEPPCO-type meetings. But basically, I think the trans-Pontaine deal that we bought, TEPPCO bought, back in July, I think for us, that is ramping up and it's doing a lot better on the bulking side. I think the overall barges, and I'm going by memory now, I think most of the prices have leveled out. There's no more downside on pricing and they're actually picking up a little bit.</p>
          <p>So we feel that the potential in that business will be greater from &#x2013; in the fourth quarter and from going on. Where I think we're operating right now, probably 85, 87% of the capacity of all the barges, which with their operating problems and everything, I think that's probably operating basically with full barges all the time. We are expanding, as Mike mentioned. We have four big barges of natural gas liquid coming on, but they all been leased out for the next few years with one of the international oil companies that's was going to use them for propylene and other types of products.</p>
          <p>So we think the barge business will benefit to Enterprise under the things that Enterprise is thinking about doing and it would be a &#x2013; it would greatly benefit from where probably TEPPCO was coming from, because of the marketing facilities around the assets of our crude oil. We have marketing facilities around natural gas and natural gas liquids.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good morning, just one quick question if I may. In the quarter you recognized $18 million in insurance recoveries and I guess what could we expect to come in Q4?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think total recoveries were about 19 million. Michael, we may have about another $6 million?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe five or six. Fortunately, we're kind of winding it up.</p>
