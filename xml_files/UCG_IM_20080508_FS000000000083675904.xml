        <plist>
          <p>So, good morning, everyone.  Many thanks for being connected with us. We have enrollment just before our AGM and we have the conference broadcasted and in teleconference for our first quarter results.</p>
          <p>As usual, I am here with the three deputy CEOs. So shall we go directly the presentation so we will have room for question-and-answer. The usual executive summary.</p>
          <p>The first quarter net profit is just above 1 billion, 1.007 million. The commercial banking had a very good performance, so the net profit in this area has been higher than the previous year by 15%, with the revenue growth of 8.4%, coming from Central/Eastern Europe, which is a growth provider for the group, but also from retail Italy, which continue to perform quite well.</p>
          <p>Corporate also, private banking is quite resilient in this type of the actual market conditions. Market investment banking shows a resilient revenue base.  You will see the number later on split by the ABS portfolio and the other revenue lines.</p>
          <p>In the revenue base in market, actually market credit related activities has been 700 million in the first quarter and you will see the comparisons, not only due to the first quarter of '07, which has been an exceptional quarter for all the industry as well as for us, but mainly with the fourth quarter last year and you will see the growth.  And we had 1 billion negative revenue impact in market-related activities, mainly coming from the ABS portfolio in line with the sensitivity we have provided to you.</p>
          <p>The cost control is quite solid. In the first quarter year-on-year we had a growth of 1.2%. If we wouldn't consider Central/Eastern Europe, we would have a decreased by 3.6%. The decrease is even higher at constant ForEx and perimeter, but this is the stated number. So we would say that without Central/Eastern Europe the strategy we have put in place also with Capitalia is paying significantly, because this cost reduction is mainly coming from the restructuring we are realizing.</p>
          <p>In Italy we had a significant reduction of staff, close to 1500 people less in the first quarter vis-&#xE0;-vis the year-end coming from Capitalia integration. The Asset Quality trend is confirmed, both gross and net impaired loans are down quarter-on-quarter and the coverage ratio is up.</p>
          <p>The Core Tier 1 ratio is 5.5% under Basel I, including the payment we made in the first quarter of this year of Ukrotsbank, this acquisition do have an impact of 22 basis points. So we continue to confirm our target in terms of Core Tier 1 of 6%.  By the year-end you will see the path for achieving this number.</p>
          <p>Talking of the first quarter results, then I will go through some divisional highlights and some conclusions. Here we have the numbers line by line. Total revenues are down year-on-year by 16.5%, quarter-on-quarter 9.3%. Driven, you will see, by MIB. As you the mark-to-market do have a negative impact on revenue. Thirdly, costs are at 1.2% year-on-year and flat on quarterly base. The operating profit currently is down by 36.5% year-on-year, 22.4% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>Net write-downs are higher than the previous year by 21.8% and 31.8 quarter-on-quarter. You will see the explanations of these numbers, we are exactly in line with our plan. And the non-operating items are down significantly, the integration costs as well. So, at the end the net income for the group pre-PPA is 1.90 billion, 47% lower than the previous year and 15.8 on the last quarter.</p>
          <p>I already talked of the net income; the cost income ratio is at 64.2% related to this negative revenue base. The cost of risk is at 56 basis points. We have 180,000 employees. Coming, you will see the growth in the last quarter is at 10,800 people, 10,700 of these people are Ukrsotsbankers, so is the consolidation of a new entity.</p>
          <p>In terms of branches, we are at 850 more than the previous year &#x2013; it's a large bank, and 587 on the last quarter.  You will see again the number is partly related to the acquisition of all Ukrsotsbank and at the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter Ukrsotsbank, but is also partly related to the 101 opening of new branches in Central/Eastern Europe as well as 41 branches in Italy.  You will see it later on. So, it's related to this plan that we have in Central/Eastern Europe, the Italian opening branches is a tale of the last -- of the plan that we had in retail for covering better and longer in those countries. And so, it was quite important for us to have a full coverage of the area we won there.</p>
          <p>Talking of the revenue base splitting, again, commercial banking from investment banking. You see that retail is up year on year by 4.3%. We think It's pretty good, is related to Italy and you will see the breakdown on Germany and Austria.  In Germany and Austria, the first quarter last year was quite good on the commission base. We had a reduction in the first quarter of this year vis-&#xE0;-vis the first quarter of '07. But again, Italy is still performing particularly well. Central and Eastern Europe is up by 24.8%. Without Ukrsotsbank at the -- the growth would be above 11%.</p>
          <p>Corporate is up by 3.2% and again, in corporate, we are doing quite well across all the geographies. Private banking despite of the market condition is up by 1.3%. So overall, the commercial banking is growing despite of the market conditions that are clearly not exceptional is -- are up by 8.4%. So, we think that is quite good.</p>
          <p>Asset management is affected by the market condition and the redemption. So market condition, in the sense that there are also performance fees that have not been collected in the first quarter of this year, so we are down by 17%.  And maybe you will see the number, well, a negative revenue base due to this market turmoil on the IBX.  We had negative revenues, close to 1 billion euro that considering the 700 million we had in the other business line goes down to the 300 million negative you are seeing there.</p>
          <p>Talking of the different revenue lines, the net interest income is doing quite well, 13.5% year-on-year.  We have to consider that partly the net commission you will see in retail, the outflows we had in asset management where is gone -- is gone partially to deposits and partially to assets under custody. So when we are seeing the two revenue lines, net interest income and the commission, we have to consider also partially one with the other.  But again, in net interest income we had an exceptional result at 13.5% growth year-on-year, 2.1% quarter-on-quarter, which is a quite good and net commissions are down, mainly driven by commission from investment services.  We will give you a detail later on.  Trading income is negative by 683 million due to what I was talking before so is not really under comparison with the previous year.</p>
          <p>We are doing quite well both in terms of growth in customer loan and deposits.  We have a different divisions and in terms of performance year-on-year on both the lines.  Customer loans in Central/Eastern Europe is up by close to 40% year-on-year, would be 23.8% at constant ForEx and perimeter again.  The difference in terms of perimeter is related to at the Ukrsotsbank.</p>
          <p>The retail is up by 5.6% is 11.7% in Italy. We have &#x2013; we continue the reduction of the less profitable assets in Germany, so in Germany we have a negative trend. This is related to a choice, strategic choice we made in 2005 after the acquisition of HVB. Corporate is doing quite well. We have growth of 8.4%, is 9.9% in Italy and very solid growth both in Germany and Austria.</p>
          <p>The customer deposits are also <mark type="inaudible" /> banking is not relevant.  Quite clearly, this is mainly a service we are providing to the large private banking customers. So it's not relevant, the trend in terms of overall is, I think, quite significant on the contrary because we have in the deposit base and in private banking because again this is related to the fact that our customers are shifting assets from assets under management to liquidity and is a sort of parking place.  We are sure that these assets will go back to more profitable asset base for the bank.</p>
          <p>But as you can see we have also a very good growth in corporate Central/Eastern Europe as well as in retail. The deposit spread &#x2013; spread is widening and the re-pricing actions on the loan side in order to offset the higher cost we are offending is ongoing, I have to say quite well, mainly in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Net commissions.  I think that this is pretty relevant with breakdown, because do an explanation -- given explanation on what is going on. We had a decrease by 16% in net commissions coming from investment services, partially due also to a mix of bond, which has been placed where we have sold more our own bonds than bond of third party. This is, more or less, 90 million of this difference.</p>
          <p>Then we have, clearly, lower asset management fees for convenient of outsourcing in the first quarter.  Over 19% of this outflow is captive. And I'll give you later on when I talk of retail with you on -- where these assets are going. So at the end, this is related to this two effects.  On the other side, the other net commissions in reality are flat, because if we don't consider 40 million of fees that were coming from the Custodian bank in Germany. The number is perfectly flat.</p>
          <p>We have in retail a reduction in terms of fees on the current account, because we have sold a significant number.  More than 20, 50,000 in the first quarter of the current account was &#x20AC;1 fee per month in order to be able &#x2013; our Genus One &#x2013; in order to be able to reduce significantly the cost base is a current account where we had a very low fee, related to the fact that our customer have to use non-physical channels, so it is quite important.</p>
          <p>The other lines are moving pretty well.  Quite clearly, we had a reduction in Corporate and MIB of fees on the structured finance activity. This fee base was year-on-year. The delta is close to &#x20AC;90 million and is related to the actual market condition. So I would say that the other lines are moving pretty well because as I said before in reality it is flat.</p>
          <p>Cost.  The great number is at constant ForEx and perimeter. The white one in the circle is the stated number. As you can see, staff expenses are down by 1.8% year-on-year. At constant ForEx and perimeter, they would be lower by 3.4%. So is quite a significant reduction. Clearly, we have lower variable compensation in MIB and asset management as well as a significant head count rationalization across the Group. Italy is, as I said quite importantly, we will see a detail in the next pages.</p>
          <p>We have a negative impact from labor contract renewals in Italy and Germany, which is more or less 30 million. We have a significant growth in Central/Eastern Europe, 12.4% at constant ForEx and perimeter, mainly due to network expansion as well as partially, contract renewal.</p>
          <p>Other administrative expenses are up by 2.4% year-on-year, 6.5 state and quarter-on-quarter we are down by 0.7 and 3.6 if we consider stated, and the constant ForEx and perimeter, despite of the fact that in Central/Eastern Europe we have a 16.2% year-on-year growth due to the branch opening.</p>
          <p>I want to clarify this branch opening plan and with the plan presentation you will see also detailed numbers on that. It is quite important for us because the breakeven in Central/Eastern Europe is achieved in the best case in 12 months, in the worst case in 18 months. So the payback of these investments is fantastically good and it's quite important for us to continue to grow in order to create a significant NPV from this investment process.</p>
          <p>Depreciation is down quarter-on-quarter, is slightly up year-on-year. As you can see if we consider constant ForEx and perimeter we are almost flat. So we think that overall the cost control is quite good and again is coming mainly from the integration of Capitalia, but also the HVB and Bank Austria rationalization continue to pay off.</p>
          <p>Talking of full time equivalent. This is again a demonstration of the fact that we must be -- as I am used to say little bit <mark type="inaudible" />, because on one side we have to continue to reduce the cost and to increase efficiency in the ongoing activity. And on the other side we have to invest for continuing to create value in terms of growth. So on one side, we have a significant reduction, 2400 people in one quarter.  On the ... we can talk of planning activities. 600 people coming from outsourcing and disposal, 1600 Italy decreased. 200 people coming from other efficiency we are achieving mainly in Germany. Then we have 1200 people hired in countries where we are opening branches in Central/Eastern Europe. We have 600 people coming from so-called other Central/Eastern European countries, 444 people; Italy 143 and also 25, mainly in the leasing business.  Then we have a new consolidation. 11,444 people is mainly Ukrotsbank, leasing in HVB and Infotech in GBS Austria are all companies we are bringing in the perimeter in order to be able to increase the rationalization of the process.</p>
          <p>In terms of branch opening, you see the detail.  Turkey is close to one half of the opening we have in Central/Eastern Europe; is slightly more than the plan in the sense that we are accelerating when we see opportunities to have a good location and to reduce the number of months in which we can achieve the break-even point.  So, in the first quarter we have opened 100 branches, out of it, 512 branches we are planning to open in Central/Eastern Europe in this year. As I said, the 41 Italian, but Roberto can give more details. It is the tail of the program we had for all covering better Lombardi and Tuscany; that also with the Capitalia remain two regions where we want to be stronger than before.</p>
          <p>Talking of asset quality, as we said, the net impaired loans is improving significantly. The percentage on total net loans as well is continuing to improve quite well. The coverage ratio is improved again so we are quite satisfied with the continuous risking that we have in our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>And talking of provisions, I think that this page is quite important and the assets well under 755 million can create some confusion or worry in an understandable way.  This 755 million would be 682 without Ukrsotsbank and net the change of perimeter and the 20 million we had already provision in corporate banking as a recent revision that has been moved from other recent provision to credit provision. So we have this change from what we are. Then in the 682, there are 47 million of high-yield provisions on the bank at Roma and Capitalia. So, Capitalia -- would in the comparison of the first quarter '07 where the provisions were relatively low to the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>So if you don't consider also this 47, in reality we are comparing 620 with 635. That if we consider the gross we had in the long base in the previous UniCredit Group is quite a good result and is related to the quality control we have on our risk portfolio. The cost of risk is aligned with our budget so, we are perfect in line with our expectations over 56 basis points.</p>
          <p>Talking of the results from the operating profit to the net income, you see that we had 51 million of provisions for risks and charges, 24 million integration cost -- 755 million I've just talk about. We had a 200 million of net income from investments, disposal of custodian business of former Capitalia, mainly.  The tax rate is 25.7%, is lower 5 percentage wise, and if you see here -- if you remember that in the last quarter of '07 we had an exceptional one-off cost related to the change in the fiscal system in Germany and Italy and this is a result of that. Then we have the minorities, the PPA for Capitalia and we go down to the 1 billion net profit.</p>
          <p>Talking of our capital position, in terms of quarter one, we are at 5.5, again inline with the Basel. We have built at the beginning of the year, a 22 basis point of this absorption come from the acquisition of Ukrsotsbank. Then we have the risk- weighted asset growth of 80 million.  This is coming partially from the usual business, partially from the fact that the higher volatility increased the VaR and so increased the risk-weighted asset related to market activity.  And, partially, 3 billion, is not very well and I'm not even indicated 3 billion of effects we have, and one of the some coverage we had on same position because we are efficient in Basel I, are not efficient, will not be efficient in Basel II since we've been authorized to use Basel II, we had this change in coverage.</p>
          <p>We continue to have the target and we can confirm after the first quarter over 6% by the year-end, partially coming from the disposal of -- and it is the next stage -- of activities that already in the plan:  former Capitalia branches, BPH as we know, the exercise of the generally convertible bond and so on.  We have risk-weighted asset optimization project undergoing. On the other side, we know that during this year, we have -- we think that now there's another process is still ongoing. But we had an important step in Germany. Let's put it out of HVB and back out, so overall, considering the consumption and the capital generation we have, we confirm the target of 6% by the year-end.</p>
          <p>On the concept of the capital position, is clear also to us as we have defined the target some years ago, 6.8% in terms of 41. So, we know perfectly that we would like to be at 6.8. This is continued to be the long-term target, it has not changed at all. And this gives us a clearer view on the fact that we are in a world that our portfolio of activities is calling for an higher core Tier I.</p>
          <p>Having said so &#x2013; so the process is in this data exchange. Having said so, we had decided to do some acquisition, mainly Ukrsotsbank and that yes, and this squeeze out.  So in a moment in which the market situation were different. So, we were thinking that through this kind of asset optimization mainly via securitization we could achieve the 6.8, despite of this capital use.</p>
          <p>Now we know that the securitization market is almost blocked. We think that we can make because we are starting to see some signal. But again, we are not considering in this plan and we consider ourself also in a stress scenario in the case of a stress -- stress scenario. With the capital base that can consent to us to manage properly our group. We don't have significant internal cushion unless we will decide to liquidate or to sell some business, which is something that we are not foreseeing as a necessity today.</p>
          <p>So, we are aware of this situation and because again there are lot of talks on our capital position. We are confident with this capital position, continue to think that we want to go to 6.8. We think that with the 6% of Core Tier I Basel I. In Basel II, we do expect to have benefits. So again, we are confident that the capital base is allowing us to continue to grow and to continue to manage properly our business.  If there will be a dramatic recession in Western Asia, today we are not foreseeing this case, clearly, the increase in PD and consequently in risk-rated asset, there would stretch our capital base. But again, we are confident that with this capital position, we can continue to manage quite well the growth.</p>
          <p>So in order to expand and to clarify that we are aware of the fact that we are not in high end of our target because 6% is below 6.8, which has been defined three years ago as a target, so we know perfectly that.  We are continuing to manage very strictly our risk-rated asset growth and the capital base. I think we have been very current in terms also disposal of non-core assets, and again, we are capable to manage properly the growth of the Group.</p>
          <p>We have also to say that in the 550 billion of risk-weighted assets, we have a portion of risk-weighted assets with negative EVA or with low EVA and we have significant room for improving risk-weighted asset value.</p>
          <p>Division's highlights.  We have a significant EVA creation from the commercial banking activities, which is quite important. Then MIB had a negative EVA. I confirm that MIB is a business that in a usual normal market condition, not exceptional, but in a normal market condition will provide to the Group more or less 1.5 billion of pre-tax profit.  So it's a business which is very relevant for us in order to be able to increase the value of the customer base we have, both corporate and retail. And we continue to provide without direction of market risk, 1.5 billion of pre-tax profit in a normalized market. So I think that this result of this period of time must be considered really as total one-off.</p>
          <p>Having said so retail, retail is doing quite well, because continue to grow in terms of revenues, 4.3%, as I said coming from Italy, more than Germany and Austria. The revenue base in Germany and Austria is negative year-on-year, but the cost reduction is quite significant. The operating cost, as you're seeing are down by 0.8% year-on-year. So the operating profit is up by 14%. The net write-downs are slightly higher coming mainly from the growth we had in the volumes. So at the end the profit before tax do have a solid double-digit growth and we are quite satisfied with that.</p>
          <p>The cost income ratio is decreasing a little bit. We are at 62.2%. So overall the EVA is growing by 40.4% year-on-year. We have to say that the Capitalia, where the growth is quite fantastic in terms of revenues. We are up close to, Roberto, in the Capitalia were the double-digit, so is quite significant and this is very important.</p>
          <p>Talking of the flows of total financial assets of households, I think it's quite important. We had a negative outflow from the asset management produced by 3.8 billion.  Clearly this is related to the market condition partially to meet the -- where things there start to be also some investment opportunities. So we are with Pioneer launching a series of new products in order to be able to partially offset this outflow. Obvious, then what is happening in the other two main voices of total financial assets -- assets under cost capacity went up by 2.3 billion and direct deposits went up by 3.2 billion. So, overall we had in the first quarter a positive growth of total financial asset by 1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>It is very important because it is to review an AuM the fact these assets are moving from assets under management to asset under capital and direct deposit, and then we have a growth. The growth is coming also from the acquisition of new customers.</p>
          <p>As I was saying when I was talking of the fee and commission line, one of the key elements for us has been the selling of the Genius One, which is very important for us, in order to be able to continue to reduce the cost structure of the group. So, it is very important, this factor. We have sold 150,000 of these accounts.</p>
          <p>New activity coming from the Capitalia Group &#x2013; world, I think it's a very important. We started to move pretty well in terms of net new current accounts. Capitalia was losing new current accounts. Now we're gaining new current accounts. We have an annualized growth of 3.5%. We are still slightly below what UniCredit Banca is capable to do, but the trend is very positive 3.5% vis-&#xE0;-vis 4% of annualized growth, 25,000 new current accounts.</p>
          <p>The gross margin from sales of investment products is growing quite well, catching up the gap that was and there is with UniCredit Banca World. And also there is more business, short term loan stock is growing quite significantly. We have a year-on-year growth of 35% vis-&#xE0;-vis the 16% we had in UniCredit Banca.  So overall and again the up-closing and the contribution coming from Capitalia to <mark type="inaudible" /> is quite important. As we said we had 93% growth of the overall retail, we have double digit growth for the Capitalia World, is single digit growth for UniCredit Banca. The weighted average is 9.3%.</p>
          <p>The cost is going down mainly thanks to the reduction of staff expenses, where we continue to increase efficiency. You can consider that we have reduced of 900 people, the staff in the first quarter is even more year-on-year. Despite the effect in this period of time, in one year from March '07 to March '08, we have opened 113 new branches in retail in Italy and again this is to call the 80% of these branches are in Lombardi and Tuscany.  So we have been able to finance this growth and in the meanwhile to reduce the staff expenses. And again this is a very significant activity. We are realizing because we are moving transaction from the desk to other channels in order to become more efficient in terms of transaction there -- capital. So it's a very long process.</p>
          <p>On the other hand administrative expenses, we are also almost flat. We are slightly down year-on-year. We have a very significant improvement in Austria and Germany. In Austria the cost reduction is 11.5%, in Germany is 4.4%. Again it's important because when we consider ourselves, a restructuring story on one side and the growth story on the other side you see it's demonstrated by these two factors.  This is very, very important, because if we don't consider the group as different elements also the cost side can be misleading, because again when we are financing the opening of new branches in Central and Eastern Europe quite clearly, we are making a choices to have good will or to have cost.</p>
          <p>The good will are not depreciated, unless if there is an impairment, but in any case are non-tangible equity, while the costs are on the profit and loss. We are always working in terms of NTB. So if there is an opportunity for an acquisition where we have a good repayment, it's the right way to grow through the acquisition. You are by far faster because you are acquiring immediately market share, restructuring potentiality and so on. But on the other side we know that the cost per branch is significantly higher than one we have when we open branch.</p>
          <p>Also in the acquisition we are talking about run of Central/Eastern Europe. If we talk of, for instance, Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan, if we consider the budget that we will realize this year, in terms of net profit, is cash accretive in the first year. This is very, very important because the cost of funding of the acquisition of Kazakhstan is lower than the net profit that we will have at the group level in the first year. So at the end we have to consider all this settlements.</p>
          <p>We had an increase on the cost side and we're taking Italy due to the branch opening and growth project. Also financing internationalization which is booked in Italy because UniCredit financing is based in Italy, as you know, we are opening this connection in Germany, Bulgaria, Romania and Poland. So, we are financing this growth. But again this is very, very important because we will go across our captive cost on our base.</p>
          <p>MIB, we had this negative number coming from the evaluation of the ABS portfolio, plus a portfolio of floating rate notes of banks that is a portfolio we have for liquidity reason. So where MIB spread has moved significantly in the first quarter due mainly to the Delspan event.  So at the end you will see, I think, it's more relevant to go to the four following pages, the numbers considering this activities out of the revenue base.</p>
          <p>So talking of our first quarter results we have the ABS portfolio which has been identified as a ring fence position to be managed as a discontinued activity, so we are managing it outside of the usual business in order to give always a number in a separate way where we had 642 negative mark-to-market, 600 million are realized losses. This loss is exactly in line with the sensitivity we gave you on the contrary. We had a small reduction of this sensitivity, because you remember we have 6 million, today we are at 5.5 million, so it's bit in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Clearly the market today is likely more relaxed, but in the first quarter the spread enlarged quite significantly. Then we have exact 336 negative mark-to-market with 80 million of realized losses due to current market condition, other credit related activities which remain core business. Because this is business line we had and we continue to have with mainly the credit-related activities, where we have a source of business by ourself and with other financial institutions, with customers. The remaining businesses are showing solid results with stronger plan driven activities, almost 700 million of revenues in the other business lines.</p>
          <p>So, if we can see there, now if we see investment banking then we will see the fact that we see and market activity. In investment banking the -- we are very happy with the fact that in the first quarter we had planned there &#x20AC;73 million of revenue base, coming from origination and financing. We are gaining markets share. We are taking care because now as we know it's not easy to know how the market is moving, but the feeling we have is that we are gaining market share in these activities. The overall industry is down. We have from the first numbers -- but we've seen some competitors, feeling that the franchise of our customer base, on which these revenues are based, is paying.</p>
          <p>Principle investment is slightly negative in the first quarter. We continue to foresee a revenue base in the range of between 100 and 150 million per year, this year, next year in this revenue, in this business line. As we remember, '07 has been rather exceptional, with slightly more than 300 million.  This business line is quite important for us.</p>
          <p>Again, this is a very, very fragmented portfolio of small investments. We are doing with our financial sponsor, our customers when we do other way the credit story. So, we are financing a fund and we have a right for co-investment and we do a co-investment with them in various amount and this is a quite important for us.</p>
          <p>The most relevant rebound we had, I think is in the market business line, where you can see that if we compare the first quarter this year with the last quarter last year we have growth of 18% in the overall business line. If we consider ex credit related activities, which is we think quite good is 19% in fixed income currency and commodities and 25% in equities cash and dividends.</p>
          <p>The Global ABS portfolio is down by close to 3 billion in the first quarter. In April, we had further reduction of 400 million, the amortization at par and sales without any loss.  You can see the expected ABS volume during the date, whether there is life based on model assumptions is four years. You can see that we have 34% of amortization and repayment in '08, another 17% in '09, another 14% in '010, so 65% of the portfolio is expected to expire in '08, '09, '010, so it is quite important. In '08 we do expect to have a further action, we have amortization of 2 billion and we then will have other sales of said portfolio as soon as we have any opportunity.</p>
          <p>Private banking.  Private banking in terms of revenues is slightly higher than the previous year. Quite clearly is under pressure for market effects, because it's quite important, the assets under management activity. We had a decline in commission due to negative industry trend as it meets a significant impact which has been offset by the growth in net interest income.  Now we have seen that we had a significant growth in the deposit base. The costs are quite vital and under control. Profit before tax are higher than the previous year, due to the fact that we have sold the Monte Carlo branch of Capitalia, that again is important for us, the fact that the operating profit despite of the market conditions is flat.</p>
          <p>Asset management, we had a reduction in the revenue base which has been quite significant. We had also a significant reduction on the cost side due to the fact that we have a lower variable compensation. There is also a stock option plan which is ready to be valued of the company, so the shadow value of the company quite clearly as we know by and near is not listed and there has been a positive impact on this number.</p>
          <p>So the operating profit is down. The profit before tax is slightly higher and the figures here are due to the disposal of the Capitalia and Custodian banking business and lower restructuring cost. So, at the end, the performance of the asset management business has been quite good. We have to say that also the operating profit for us is really good considering the market conditions.</p>
          <p>We had negative sales coming from mainly Italy, 10 billion of negative sales in Italy. The third party distribution is slightly growing in the Italy because the captive Germany and Austria are also negative. So, at the end, we are slightly improving our position in third party distribution. We have a negative trend in the captive distribution activity. As we have seen for a more conservative position of our customers that are switching their assets in assets and their captive end deposits. We think that during the time they will come back to assets and their management.</p>
          <p>Corporate, we have a growth in the corporate revenue by 3.2%, also net -- we will concede there the trend in hedging problems, the growth would be 6%, with a rising contribution timing from global transaction banking where we have a growth by 7% year-on-year. Net interest are up by 7.6% year-on-year and non-net interest income would be flat if we wouldn't consider the derivative and businesses. So, at the end, we are, again, quite positive on that.</p>
          <p>The operating costs are up 3.2%, mainly coming from global leasing expansion in Central/Eastern Europe. As you know, we have 13 countries where we have a local company which is also very important for us and the Capitalia integration. Net write-downs on loans are up mainly due to 20 million of reclassification and higher provisions due to the rise of landing volumes. So at the end, profit before taxes are slightly down, but we do see a positive trend if we would consider the trend without this one-off.</p>
          <p>Central/Eastern Europe is growing quite significantly as we have seen the total revenues would be 24% up at constant ForEx are 11.2%, 24% considering Ukrsotsbank and ATF. The operating costs are up by 13.1%, without the branch openings would be 9.5%. So the operating profit is up 9.3%. Net write-down on loans are higher year-on-year, but without the change of parameter would be down by 11.5%. So, profit before tax would be 17.4% higher at cost under ForEx parameter, and net income 11%.</p>
          <p>If we consider the growth rate we're having in terms of branch opening, we think that also the cost income ratio is quite good, because it's a 49.7 with the thought we are heading for this opening branch plan is quite a good cost income ratio.</p>
          <p>Talking of the split of the revenue base, you see that the Poland clearly is leading player, 38% in the first quarter. In '07 year-on-year it was 41%. So, Poland is slightly decreasing, as of '08 the countries are growing more.  Despite, '08's slowdown we had in Poland in the asset management business the revenue basis is upper one by 1.2% year-on-year. As you remember, the asset management business in first quarter last year was quite exceptional. So, we are also very happy with the performance of Poland.</p>
          <p>The other countries are growing very significantly. In Turkey we are close to 31% ratio, 18%, Russia 25%, Czech Republic 1.3% year-on-year, it would be 10% net of trading. Also in Hungary, we have a negative growth, 2.3% would be 15.3% net of trading. In both countries the banks being long in terms of deposits vis-&#xE0;-vis loan to have local government bonds where the increase of this trade reached over to a negative mark-to-market. But again, the commercial performance is quite good in all this countries.</p>
          <p>Then we have the number on Poland.  I think it's relevant to say that the net interest income is up 12.2% year-on-year in Poland driven by loan growth and spread on deposits while the net commission are down by 17% due to the mutual funds, which I was talking before.</p>
          <p>The operating costs are up by 6.1% with an impact by the salary alignment of BPH and Pekao. And also the branch expansion, we have in Ukraine. As you know in Ukraine, we have the Polish subsidiary and Ukrsotsbank that will be merged. So the cost income ratio is quite good, 48.5% and so we think that the Polish operations are quite satisfying.  The EVA is up by 15%</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we have a very strong commercial banking resilience with a solid growth of loan and deposits which highlights our ability to give a result in challenging environment. The integration of Capitalia is in line with the plan. The first results that we are having in both in terms of cost and revenues are very, very good. MIB results in market credit related activities is reflecting difficult but manageable market conditions with other areas that are providing a very positive revenue contribution.</p>
          <p>Asset management is also affected by the current market condition, but still very good in terms of EVA contribution. We confirmed the 6% quarter one target in '08, thanks to disposal of non-strategic assets, organic and manageable actions on risk-weighed asset, and the positive contribution coming from return earnings. Fees continue to be a significant growth engine for the Group. So, overall, we -- today we can provide again in terms of earnings per share for '08 in a range of 52-56 cents that we will continue to update during the year, in relation to the market performance and the company performance.</p>
          <p>Many thanks. Sorry if I've been slightly long. But I think it was necessary to provide this -- all this information to you. Now with the colleagues we are ready to answer to all your questions. Thanks a lot.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question is from Mr. Marcello Zanardo of KBW. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning Mr. Profumo and to you colleagues. The first question is actually on growth for the Group. If I look at the divisional level, obviously excluding investment banking and acknowledging the unique market conditions, but I really see that your growth engines, the significant ones, are coming from the Central/Eastern European, 37% up year-on-year, and retail with corporate being down 5%, asset management flat, and might be clearly down, fallen down by 7%. So the first question is, clearly, many banks are not going to achieve the target, we've seen a lot of capital raising, the environment is different. What do you plan to do in changing the drivers in terms of cost? And if you could give us some details for instance, you're going to delay the open of certain branches, you're going to cut more expenses in certain divisions. Just to have a flavor of what we should expect in the different divisions in terms of changes of direction to improve the growth rate considering the difficult environment. So this is the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May I interrupt you. Are we talking of our revenue growth, are we talking of earnings per share growth?  Because I suppose that if you are talking of costs, we are talking of earnings per share growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean it's -- apologies, a bit of a round question, so there's nobody in terms -- I just want to have an idea, if possible, to see how you are going to improve the operating performance of this division, so it's mainly EPS if you want, of divisionally. The second question is on the investment banking division. I mean, some of your slides starting from page 24, 25 points to increases on a quarter-on-quarter basis, I am talking excluded the write-downs. I'm a bit confused so if you can help me here, because by putting your divisional, I see that the net interest income is up by 8% from Q4, but fees are down by 56% from Q4 to 76 million and the average of last year was 161 million. So, to me, it looks like activities actually slowing down significantly from Q4.  Maybe I don't understand or I'm missing something, but if you could help me to reconcile the slide with the divisional you are giving me. And if you could give an outlook and I come to the third question, because your write-downs on the investment banking division, future respective write-downs with the credit markets now clearly improving, but I think, are quite correlated to fees on your capital position. You're being quite clear confirming the target 6% and long-term 6.8%, but I think that it would be very helpful for us if an outlook could be given on both investment banking activities and the write-downs because I think that's where the market is going on concentrate your capital level. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting from the cost management activity we are working on. As you know, the 26th of June, we will have a three year plan that will be presented to the market so I don't want to talk all that, a longer-term perspective. For this year, quite clearly, considering what is going in the market, the earnings per share and guidance we have given is considering a significant cost cutting vis-&#xE0;-vis the budget. So we are working with the cost cutting plan which is compared with the budgets in the range of more than &#x20AC;700 million, which is a pretty significant plan.</p>
          <p>What we are continuing to consider as a key project for us where we don't have any cut is the opening of the branches in Central/Eastern Europe. Because we think that there is a market situation where we can readily create a very significant value. So this is the project that has not been affected by the actual market conditions. In all the other areas we are working quite significantly as we know we have also -- there are also internal projects on which we continue to work, because the migration for Germany and Austria in the IT platform is key for -- and the migration of Capitalia on the IT platform is key.  And as usual we have investments related to that. As you know this month we will have the migration of <mark type="inaudible" /> this weekend than -- the next weekend, sorry. Then in August Banco de Roma, and in October Banco di Sicilia. We expect to have in June, July next year, Germany, and if we are capable to manage the organizational process maybe before the year-end next year also Austria, which is very relevant. So these are the key projects on which we continue to invest. We are working in terms of cost cutting in all the other areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, the earnings per share guidance we have given where a significant cost cutting vis-&#xE0;-vis the bank. Clearly, in terms of profitability, the lower RARORAC we had in the corporate division, as we know. It is important to say the RARORAC we have today in the corporate division is also affected by the previous Capitalia corporate, that was a negative RARORAC -- marginal RARORAC. So, below the cost of capital, because without Capitalia, the RARORAC in corporate would be close to 8%.  With Capitalia, it is slightly below 5%. So we have this very important area in terms of improvement in order to align the Capitalia RARORAC -- marginal RARORAC to the other one and to move to a most profitable area.</p>
          <p>So overall, as you are quite correctly pointing out -- the contribution in terms of net profit and growth is coming and so the highest contribution in terms of delta is coming from Central/Eastern Europe. And retail Italy, we have to say that with the cost cutting, also Italy, and Germany and Austria are performing very well. But again that is not the area which is providing a significant delta. In terms of ADA, it is to expect that also corporate, you have a significant potential improvement. On the MID, I will leave the floor to Ranieri and Sergio for reconciling the numbers.  But again I think it's important to say that if we don't consider the ABS portfolio, the revenue base is proceeding in quite a positive way and now we'll provide the reconciliation. I think it's very important to stress this element.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the revenue base, clearly as we are talking about an investment bank, we need to consider that the write-downs on the portfolio are mostly related to mark-to-markets. So, these are not impairments on the portfolio per se. So that portfolio in terms of the trading profit obviously goes down, although at the same time the entire portfolio does continue to generate interim margin as <mark type="inaudible" /> the regular business of SMIB, which clearly is showing growth in net interest.</p>
          <p>With regard to the commissions, I will like to point out that there is one item that is affecting the commission reduction in MIB, which is the sale of the security business in Germany, which you know that happened at the end of the fourth quarter last year. So as we sold our business from a commission standpoint, obviously we do lose in a comparison point both in the first quarter and the fourth quarter some commissioning rate, some commissioning.  So in that sense the commissioning line is affected by that. In addition to that, the first quarter of this year has also saw less structuring activity which generates commissions for MIB in particular for retail business, which MIB is a center of excellence particularly in Germany, which, therefore, obviously sees some commissioning pressure. I would say that this is the major highlight in terms of a big one-off.</p>

          <p>Guglielmo, we cannot, because unless we would give the budget line-by-line.  And as you can imagine nobody is there is providing that, so with the best opening is something that -- we have seen that many players are not providing even a guidance in terms of net profit or earnings per share. So, again, it's impossible to go line-by-line.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Last question, strategic role of Pioneer, can you elaborate a bit on this considering that the asset management issue that <mark type="inaudible" />, seems to be experiencing considering the potential interest for Asian distribution power or US strengthening distribution power?  Can you just guide us through what is your thinking process regarding the production side on the asset management please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Asset management, as we have seen, is a business with a very positive contribution in terms of EVA. It's a business which is strategic for us in terms of contribution for product development and asset allocation of our customers. I think it's proper to consider ourself vis-&#xE0;-vis other competitors in terms of dimension on one side, relative dimension, being a single platform player. So, we are not a multi- <mark type="inaudible" /> as others. So we have to consider if we can have economy, higher economy of scale in some distribution area or in some -- again, business lines. So we have to consider strategically if there are options for keeping the strategic value which I was talking before in terms of contribution to the overall capital allocation of the group.  And in terms of contribution to the distribution channels we have if we can have some option in order to increase our distribution capability in other countries or other business lines. I think this is a strategic reasoning that is undergoing in many different players.  And again is something on which being responsible of the group we have to -- all of us, with value everywhere, we have to think about.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Can I ask you just a very broad question on C?  When you look at the drivers in terms of growth, in terms of economy, in terms of what's happening in US and even now in continental Europe; so you gave a lot of numbers, but I just want more of a feeling you have. Are you seeing any sort of, lets say deceleration in the area?  We've seen the cost of credit has gone up a bit. But in reality, last year you always said it was abnormally low. If you look at the growth in the region, do you see any sign of contagious slowdown or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not at all. As we have seen, we continue to see a significant growth both in terms of loan and deposits. The GDP continue to perform. There is some slowdown, but it was expected and we have been always very transparent in all our presentation. But we are not seeing any further deceleration vis-&#xE0;-vis what we have presented with the year-end results. Also overall the asset quality is completely in line with expectations. So we continue to see quite positively the area. Clearly there are accounts that are performing better.  For instance, Russia is performing fantastically well. Also Poland is not bad. As a country, Italy, Turkey do have some -- overall some concern back at the bank and the real economy continue to perform pretty well, as I was talking of the country before. So, overall we are quite satisfied. We have seen an improvement as a country in the overall economic position in Hungary, which was on one of the countries of worry. We have made just a few days ago a full revision of the sovereign risk. And again the only country in which there could be some more concern is Turkey, we have seen a good improvement in all the others.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Just a few quick questions on &#x2013; sorry if I touch again on some of the points that you've discussed. First of all, on the MIB division, I was wondering if you are planning any structural action on costs in line with what the other investment banks are doing? Or is it just some general cost savings? Secondly, on the leveraged finance book, if I understand well, this is all within the banking book and therefore there is no need for adjustments even for securities which have a market value if you could just confirm that. And financing, you gave some additional details on slide 15 on capital, and I was wondering, maybe I missed something, but if you could give some more quantitative information? Thank you.</p>

          <p>So, looking at our actions that we are taking in terms of managing the current market conditions, clearly, we took some actions in terms of streamlining fixed cost and non-personnel derivative cost, as it would have been the case in any case, but we are accelerating and curbing in a more selective way all lines of expenses we can. There is no dramatic change in terms of personnel restructuring envisaged other than a normal process of reviewing the talent base in the organization and also taking advantage of current market conditions to on a selective basis to hire people that are available in the marketplace. For sure, we are fully committed to deliver the synergies that were in our plans for 2008.</p>
          <p>In terms of mark-to-market on our LBO portfolios, as we stated several times, we are continuing to as to these activities monitor in terms of valuations on a monthly basis, and we are going through line-by-line impairment processes. At this point in time, there is absolutely no need for us to take -- make a change in this policy. I want to highlight again that's the vast majority of our -- 99% of our positions are Europe-related. We have a concentration in a couple of positions that we are very comfortable about it, mainly the Valentino and Alliance Food positions. Alliance Food, specifically, we have no doubt that the track record of -- historical track record of the management in managing the company and the leveraging they are doing through their balance sheet and the cash flow they're generating will probably prove that this is a good asset rather than something that should disposed or marked well below par. In any case for hold this position again, and in the Valentino case we basically own them, considering the fact that we also sold some positions and we got repayments. In any case all the mezza are at 96%. And in the Alliance Food case we are only exposed to the senior tranche, all the mezzanine exposure has been sold already in '07.</p>

          <p>Well, talking about the capital, as I said before there is asset optimization in the range of 30 basis points, as I said before. The other are, in providing the number, you will see during the disposal of the different assets as you can imagine we cannot provide the numbers before the closing, the general the convertibles is quite easy to be calculated.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Jernej Omahen of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi guys. Sorry. It's Jernej from Goldman. I just have a couple of short questions. The first one is on page 26 of your presentation. And I was just wondering how simple it is to calculate what the reversal of the negative marks. I know the impairment, just the negative marks on the ABS portfolio is going to work. Is it as simple as to say that if you lose 34% or if you reduce the volume of the ABS book by 34% in '08 that we will see 34% of that -- of the negative marks relating that this portfolio being reversed as well? Or whether it works in a different way? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two, maybe just a technical question is what is the tax effect on these negative marks that UniCredit is taking, if any? And question number three is a broader question, I guess. I was just wondering whether UniCredit wants this debate or not. I think investors are now focusing on the core Tier 1 ratio target again. And there is a view of many of your investors in the market that core Tier 1 ratio even as it currently stands looks tight. And I was just wondering whether you could comment to what extent you feel comfortable with the current level of capital and to what extent you will feel comfortable when you reach -- if you reach 6% by the end of this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the first question clearly I wish it would be the case. But obviously the size, the marks of our books reflect the risk and the time to maturity and therefore unfortunately it is not possible to recover 30% of the losses in '08. I think that this is -- we do expect on a more general basis, if you look at the historical write-downs we took on this position, something in the region of 65 to 70% to come back over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is quite important to say that in the earnings per share guidance we have provided, there is -- there are no capital gain on this ABS portfolio. So, we are considering that there will be not further deterioration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, what you have done in the EPS guidance is you've kept the level of spreads flat on -- in Q1 '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have to say on the cash, not necessarily this is the case. You have always to remember that -- and again, we have not been capable to understand the position of many of our competitors because we know what is for us. This is completely mark-to-market, first of all. And we don't have any edge. So our net position is exactly the same. And because like for others we have seen that having the edge maybe that they were losing many on the edge because the basic risk was changing. So what we implying as assumption for our earnings per share guidance is that there will be not further deterioration, but not improvements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, perfect. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry, on the capital base, as I said before and we feel comfortable with the position we have. Because we know that we have a plan for being at 6% by the year-end. So and we are implying the actual market scenario. As I said before we fully understand the position of the one who are saying, but you don't have cushion for eventual stress scenario experiment. Again process stress scenario would be a significant slowdown not only in US and Europe, but also in Asia, more than slowdown, a recession I would say. So this is what we are considering a stress scenario. We don't see this case to be honest about that. But we have to consider the stress analysis. And also we are not foreseeing -- also considering the different area -- business areas that we are not foreseeing deterioration in the portfolio. As we said we are significantly involved in commercial banking that we have a significant growth rate in Italy and in Central/Eastern Europe. The portfolio in MIB is what we have just seen. So, we don't see any risk area that is coming out from the actual situation. In the long run, the target remain 6.8%. We have to remember with 6.8 we have the aim of adding a AA rating, so -- because you want that with an area capitalization in order to have a lower cost of funding and to have more business opportunity strengths. So, that rating, but we think that -- the part that we have total asset is the right one. As you can imagine, we are always comparing our sales force with our competitors. We are seeing that our competitors, somebody to have as a target where we are now. Somebody have to pay capital increase will give 6% -- or close to 6%. So, we think that we are exactly in -- on the right track.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. Three questions if I may. First of all, looking at other European investment banks which are increasing their capital requirements, I just wonder if internally -- you're thinking of revising your capital allocation by division, especially considering that MIB, which is now attributed 6% of this &#x2013; let's put that -- in this period, which confirm -- really don't know other investment makes allocating with quarter one into region of 8, 9%. And this is first question. And second question is, I wonder if -- I can imagine your answer, but just to be sure that there are no performance fees on interest quarterly? And last question is, if you can give us getting -- a general outlook on loan loss provisions going forward? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to the capital, we differentiate our location or capital, obviously according to the different revisions based on the obviously the intrinsic riskiness of each divisions. Clearly in terms of pricing the key action on the pricing and it's not been obviously on the capital per se, that's been on the asset side, that's clearly as the cost of funding also of the group like for any of the banks is actually increased. Clearly, the targets in terms of earnings and return of the assets are actually being increased. And obviously as we have a target of 6%, the reduction in risk-weighted assets will be done based on the best risk return profile of the asset either EVA or RARORAC if you wish in terms of profitability.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning everybody. I have three questions. I'd like to go back to your guidance with a range of 52 to 56 cents or what I'd like to understand is what actually have included in terms of potential scenario sensitivity. So your bottom guidance takes account of what kind of scenario? Is it the severe economic declaration with higher loan loss provisions or is more paying on the investment banking? If you can just give us an indication of what is the range here. What I wanted to clarify is also, you have 700 million you said now of cost cutting in your budget. Should we assume that that is done in a higher than the 400 million of synergies on Capitalia, so it's 300 million synergies more, or simply general cost reduction on the UniCredito platform? And on the cost actually, can we see at this stage what should the cost guidance for this year? Should we actually see at this point cost effectively coming down in your core scenario for the year and starting in the following quarters?  Because if I'm looking year-on-year cost is flat, so I really don't seem to have the Capitalia cost synergies, but you haven't started integration yet. So, are we going to see cost progression in the following quarters?</p>
          <p>Going back to capital, you haven't really given us anything on Bal II. I understand you are discussing floor with a regulator, I don't know what you mean by floor, whether it's actually maximum benefit that can be taken on a year basis kind of phasing which Italian regulators seem to still impose, but others don't in Europe.  For example, not in Germany. I'm wondering whether you are having a discussion with them on this. But can you give us an indication of the order of magnitude or the potential theoretical benefits coming from Bal II, even if it's going to take two, three years according to Italian regulator to take it. Just to have an idea when is that buffer coming, how big it is? And when do you actually expect to start showing that, is it going to Q2 or is it going to be the end of the year, in terms of the capital buffer of Bal II? One last question that I had was, sorry, going back to your EPS target, so said low recovery of the investment banking division as a base case. Is it fair to say then that at this stage what you have in there is everything negative, the markdown you've taken so far, but also all the reasonably expected capital gains, which are certainly netting that off, which we know about.  So the branches in Poland, BPH and so on. Just to have an idea at least of what we are talking about. Last question, on asset quality. back to provisions. You've just made a comment there on the large corporate there.  Generally, we've seen provisions still slightly moving up in both retail and corporate. Do you see a little of deterioration starting to materialize or what is the reason behind that one comment you just made? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Many questions. Let me try to address them. First, the 700 million that we talked about cost is cost saving vis-&#xE0;-vis what we had in the plans. And as we've said very, very clearly is we are now going to delay the branch openings in terms of the investments that we are doing particularly in Central/Eastern Europe and you need to consider obviously Central/Eastern Europe has a higher inflation. So, clearly, this is base what I would call more on our Western type of Europe activity. And as I said, it would be based on the reduction in terms of the anticipated growth profile that we have in our plan. With regard to --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, this includes the Capitalia 400 synergies and there is another 300 of general savings on top?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. The synergies were already in the plan obviously so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so this is on top of the 300.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course, as I said it's clearly on top. As I said savings with related or what was our regional base plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard of -- I think you were referring to Basel II, I suppose.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basel II, yes, we are -- we have been approved on Basel II. Basel II numbers will be disclosed in the second quarter, the reason is that the regulator is finalizing their review, and unfortunately their reviewing is not in line with first quarter numbers. It would be actually being completed in May. Said that, you know that the full benefit of Basel II will not occur in the first year, but there are a series of haircuts, so the full benefit of Basel II effectively keeps in the third year from adoption.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us an indication of a range or what is the theoretical full benefit that you could possibly achieve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will provide it as soon as we issue the new Basel II numbers. The haircuts you know them, so it's a -- but clearly we expect Basel II on the food loan to be positive for us on a net capital release. But I would like to point out that the 6% core tier 1 target that we communicated is clearly Basel I related.</p>
          <p>With regards to the asset quality, the asset quality overall is actually higher but it was higher in our focus. We are not seeing signs of deterioration that were not quarter-on-quarter expected and as somebody said before we are also coming out from a year of 2007, which was particularly benign -- particular with some of the corporate and the large corporate business, as well obviously is seen interest rates in Europe. In reality, for corporate and we have taken a leave for maybe so Roberto can elaborate a little bit. I think you need to segregate a little bit geographically. I think what you see is not generically a deterioration across the board, but we see some deterioration in some geographies while other geographies actually continue to perform fairly satisfactorily. So, Roberto you want to comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. As far as Italy is concerned, certainly growth that we have seen, the number in reality was almost entirely budgeted and is coming mainly from two reasons. One on side, we have a comparison. We have unsustainably low provision level in the Capitalia world in the first quarter of 2007.  That's the main driver for the growth. Then we have the increase in the asset basis that is growing by close to 7% year-on-year. The third element is a slight deterioration in the mortgage book in Italy that was also quite forecasted. So that, on an annual basis as far as Italy in concerned we keep clearly our forecast of low double-digit growth in the provision level. As far as these concern, also there, we are quite in line, completely in line with the forecast. Forecast was based on the fact that the announcement that perimeter Kazakhstan and Ukraine is increasing the overall provision level, but also here, the net -- non-performing loans, evolution and also internal watch list are moving absolutely in line with forecast. So, we don't see a problem or issues in asset quality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to add just for the corporates, and the large corporates specifically, that obviously we do not budget normally for net redemptions, so when you compare the year-over-year clearly in specifically in the first quarter of last year, we had net redemptions overall on the large corporates where they may be. So, clearly, some of the growth is also driven by the fact that on the corporate side we have had basically no provisions &#x2013; the large corporates side &#x2013; we have basically no provisions in the first quarter of last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And going back to your sort of EPS guidance. What is the reason for the variance, what kind of scenario are you assuming in your bottom guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Quite clearly, there are different elements that must be considered that in the $0.52 is considered also a worst scenario for MIB, which must be considered as possible. So for the negative market as we said in with the high corner of the forecast we are foreseeing a normalized scenario. In terms of credit market as has been said before, we don't think that there is some worsening was foreseen when we had budgeted, when we made the budget -- but we are not seeing any signal that this will be worse than what we had budgeted. And so we are foreseeing a slowdown in the economies where we are -- but we don't see negative -- better and more negative than what we have foreseen in the banks. Our models are working pretty well and so we are on line with the expectations. To be honest, before you were asking on relation in corporate and MIB, we have been always very transparent in saying that for MIB our guidance in terms of cost of risk was 25 British pounds. We have to remember that in the first quarter -- I'm sorry, in '07 we have write-backs. So, we have a positive cost of risk in MIB and again also what we've seen in this first quarter has been something that is not worrying in terms of trend. And so overall, we need a range for earnings per share because the market is still volatile. So it's impossible to say that the volatility will go down to zero in market conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, effectively the range is very much linked to investment banking earnings and market volatility rather than a more conservative economic scenario underpinning the bottom range.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To be clear, the scenario on which we have built the budget was more positive than the one we're seeing today. Because if you consider that the scenario for the budget usually is provided in July of the previous year. So we can say that we have adjusted in October -- September I mean there, in '07 in September decline was already there, but was still unclear. And today the external environment is worse than the one we could foresee in September. But despite of that, the performance we are having are in line with our expectations. So the delta is only related to the volatility of the market. Again the model, in terms of credit risk, are quite solid. The monitoring we have is pretty good, as we said during the year-end presentation. In '07, before the crisis we have seen some deterioration in the mortgage business in retail Italy, mainly related to third party distribution. It was more a commercial issue than worsening of the scenario and already in '07 we have taken managerial action in order to offset that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And -- thank you for that. Just going back to your costs, so its really 700 million of additional cost savings on top of the 400 million Capitalia synergies that makes 1.1 billion of cost savings in the year, which if I am taking it as a percentage of your cost base for 2007 even gross on some of the positive elements you had, is close to 6.5% potential cost decline in '08. Clearly you have cost inflation...</p>

          <p>I am sorry...</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Francesca, Francesca, Francesca. This was a bad debt that was growing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, clearly have growth underlying...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have never provided the growth cost at the bad debt level. We have to be very clear and transparent on that. Is -- this is in order to say because you have to remember the question to which I have answered this 700 million was, are you taking any managerial action in order to offset the revenue reduction. We have also not provided any guidance on the revenue growth in terms of budget ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>... because we are talking always of bottom-line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the answer was yes, we have taken managerial actions that were -- we are working on a cost &#x2013; in fact, I was talking about cost savings more than cost cutting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because our savings on the budget.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand, but potentially...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So is -- you cannot mix the 400 with the 700.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand that to the financials, but is that you know given the potential different amount of cost cutting and savings, obviously as you said we don't know what your planned underlying growth is. But is it fair to say that at this point with the savings and the growth of cost in the world definitely go down in absolute numbers this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Because opening branches is on. We have investing -- we are investing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're looking at, you know, savings -- how keep costs flat or something like that, but not that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not provided guidance on the cost, Francesca.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what I am trying to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But I get your point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we can do, we can do; what we can't do, we can't do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unfortunately in 15 minutes I have the AGM, so unfortunately we have to close. Only one final statement that nearly the matter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, is not the final statement. There is a too much about -- since there are some questions regarding the net write-down for loans and the generated asset quality, I wanted to stress the fact that as you look at the performance of the first quarter, this stock of gross impaired loan as well as stock of net impaired loan is actually going down, as obviously the recovery ratio is going up. So again as we look at the de-risking of the balance sheet, if I can call it this way, and by the way this stock is going down notwithstanding the acquisitions of <mark type="inaudible" /> which by definition brings some additional NPN. I think is to the credit of the people that actually managing down the exposures. We have not talked about Germany but the area portfolio is basically strong. And even on the special credit portfolio, we do continue to make significant progress. So, in that sense obviously there is actions by the management and in terms of propriety or manners that we are risking giving ourselves the credit.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry again for the fact that we have to close now. But just two minutes break before the AGM and also for other needs. So, really many, many thanks to all of you and we will meet now for an official event at 26th of June where we have a presentation of the new three-year plan. And then for -- afterwards for the first half results, 1st of August. So, thanks a lot again and very good day.</p>
