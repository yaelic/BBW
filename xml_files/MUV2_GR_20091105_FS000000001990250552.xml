          <p> Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Munich Re Q3 Results 2009 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Becker-Hussong, Chief of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to our conference call on Munich Re's financial results for the first nine months of 2009. Let me start with a few unavoidable housekeeping remarks. Also, since some other insurance companies are reporting their results today as well, we have opted for a lean presentation format. J&#xF6;rg Schneider, our CFO will be today's speaker. J&#xF6;rg will give you the usual brief overview and outline the main points from our perspective.</p>
          <p>Afterwards, we will have plenty of time for questions-and-answers as always. However, as we would like to make this call as efficient as possible for you, we kindly ask all analysts and investors participating in the call to limit their contributions to a maximum of two questions per person.</p>
          <p>So far from my side, so J&#xF6;rg, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I hope that I will be lean enough in my presentation. I'm not always so sure, but I do my best. First, some key messages in a nutshell and I look at slide three.</p>
          <p>In the first nine months, Munich Re was able to benefit from its strong capital position and exploited its scope for profitable growth. In view of the weakness of the capital market in spring, the results were pleasingly unspectacular and therefore very good. The profit of almost 1.8 billion equals to a RORAC of 14%, so we almost met our ambitious 15% over the cycle target.</p>
          <p>The third quarter profit of 651 million was somewhat lower than the second quarter result, but the difference is merely due to a one-off tax effect in the third quarter. We took a somewhat cautious approach here and strengthened our provisions for future tax audits in property-casualty reinsurance, and I back your understanding that I can't be more specific here with this kind of sensitive topic.</p>
          <p>The underlying earnings, I assure you, are strong. Our strong capital base provides strategic flexibility in terms of growth and at the same time allows for continuation of our share buyback program.</p>
          <p>Our financial strength makes us a reliable partner for our clients in all our business fields. Therefore, we prefer to deploy our financial capacity to cover insurance risks rather than speculate on the financial markets.</p>
          <p>Our reinsurance business performed well, thanks to a good underwriting performance. In the third quarter, we had to absorb only very few additional recession-related major losses, while the NatCat season turned out to be very benign.</p>
          <p>In primary insurance, the financial crisis had a more significant impact in the quarter of this year. Our result was negatively affected by goodwill impairments and accounting distortions from interest rate hedging. But the operating trend in the life and non-life business is clearly positive. Plus ERGO returns to the profit zone in the second quarter, and continue to turnaround in the third quarter. Also ERGO is doing a good job in implementing its efficiency program.</p>
          <p>Let me start with a quick look at our capitalization on slide six of the presentation. We meet all requirements with substantial buffers. And I would also like to point your attention to the fact that our book value increased by some 7% in the third quarter to &#x20AC;115 per share. The financial solidity was externally reflected by the low beta of our Munich Re stock, the low CDS spreads or the very robust AA rating by all agencies. This provides us with a clear competitive edge on the insurance market. And at the same time this is beneficial for the valuation of our stock.</p>
          <p>On slide seven, you see the development of the shareholder's equity. During the first six months, it was roughly unchanged which was quite an achievement taking in account the dividend payment of one billion. In the third quarter, you'll see the development on the right hand side of that slide with negative FX effect of minus 300 million and unrealized gains and losses contributing positively with 1.2 billion, overall an increase of 7% or 1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>We are on our way with our share buyback, this has become for us somewhat &#x2013; something of business as usual meanwhile. On slide nine, you see summary of the segment results. It becomes obvious that the Group result has been supported strongly by the reinsurance segments here. Their operating results could even beat the previous year's numbers, which included the ERGO 2008 dividend which was 947 million. The same applies for the property-casualty consolidated result, which was also ahead of the number of 2008, whereas life and health was slightly below. This was due to a positive one-off tax effect in 2008.</p>
          <p>With regard to primary insurance, in the third quarter, on a standalone basis the ERGO contributed some &#x20AC;89 million to the Group result with all segments positive. This brings me to the question of ERGO's target for 2012.</p>
          <p>At the end of '07, we announced that ERGO envisaged a profit of 900 million after tax by 2012. Since then the macroeconomic perspective has worsened. This caused us to point out in recent months that this target was increasingly ambitious. Many competitors have already revised their financial forecast.</p>
          <p>Despite ERGO's pleasing result turnaround in 2009, we have to take into account the &#x2013; all such parameters and can no longer maintain ERGO's absolute return target for 2012. The expectations that we had in '07 for organic and inorganic growth cannot be realized in this new climate. And I also would like to point to the fact that the derisking also took place in ERGO's balance sheet on the asset side of their portfolio, which means lower risks and somewhat lower returns. And we don't want to take any imprudent risks in order to achieve two ambitious goals.</p>
          <p>But ERGO is sticking to its 12 to 15% return on equity target, and we are convinced that ERGO's result will already return to a good level in 2010 and for the subsequent years, we are even more optimistic.</p>
          <p>Coming back to 2009 and here to the investment results on page 10. The increase in the investment result was mainly due to the significantly improved results from write-ups, write-downs. You see more details on that and also on the other elements of our investment result on the following page, which I will skip later on here during my presentation. Just a quick look on the overall investment result, it was up to 4.3% from 3.1% in 2008.</p>
          <p>The portfolio mix of our investments is shown on slide 15. Loans and fixed interest securities make up for 86% of the total. Details of our fixed income portfolio are shown in the quarterly report and also in the back up of this presentation. In 2009, we made a cautious shift from government bonds and structured-credit into corporate bonds and fund fees and I am very grateful to say that we had quite a good timing for these moves. But to maintain a low to moderate risk profile is a strategic decision which is not subject to date &#x2013; of day-to-day changes.</p>
          <p>So much for the investments, now a few remarks on each segments. I start with Life and Health Reinsurance on slide 19. Here we had a very strong growth in Life plus 26.7% to 4.9 billion and in Health plus 60% to 1.3 billion and this was due to large quota share deals providing capital relief to clients and also due to the acquisition of Sterling Life U.S. American Health Primary insurer, which belongs to our Munich Health business entity.</p>
          <p>And all the other items of the P&amp;L show corresponding impacts of that growth without any specific abnormalies. Just I want to mention that our technical result was influenced by the derisking of the investment portfolio. And we come to somewhat lower expectation for our investment returns as already mentioned and therefore apply somewhat faster amortization of our deferred acquisition cost, that had a negative effect here on the IFRS result. But anyway we look at market consistent embedded value numbers when we judge upon the performance of our Life Reinsurance business.</p>
          <p>The consolidated results was impacted also by the impairment of goodwill and intangible for Sterling Life and was 65 million hence of the tax effect which I had mentioned before in the preceding year. So we ended up with a net result for Life and Health Re of &#x20AC;536 million.</p>
          <p>Continue with property-casualty, page 20. The increase in gross premiums of 6.2% was due to the acquisition of Midland and Hartford Steam Boiler and of some positive foreign exchange effects. Adjusted for both, it was minus 1.1%. This is a clear sign of our disciplined underwriting approach.</p>
          <p>On slide 21, you can see the combined ratio. Our major loss experience was somewhat below the five year average and natural catastrophe substantially below our expectations and man-made losses clearly higher and here especially with regard to recession related claims from credit surety and similar business, which now make up for some &#x20AC;343 million for the whole year.</p>
          <p>We saw only minor changes in the third quarter, if we look at the numbers in total. At first glance, our combined ratios of 93.4% for the quarter and 96.3 looks mediocre in comparison to that of Swiss Re which initially, I must admit, shocked me quite a bit. The differences are some eight to nine percentage points, which is very substantial.</p>
          <p>We meanwhile had a chance to look a little bit deeper into it from the outside and if one adds back the non-traditional financial guarantee and overhead expenses to an overall combined ratio, then Swiss Re is still somewhat better than Munich Re, but the differences narrow down to something between one and 2.5 or even 3%, depending on how you want to calculate it.</p>
          <p>So please bear in mind, when you look at Munich Re's combined ratio that is an all inclusive number and I trust that most observers will appreciate the differences of external presentation, so much for reinsurance.</p>
          <p>Moving on to primary insurance, and here primary life insurance &#x2013; the most important development are shown on page 25. Premium income up 3.2% due to the acquisition of BACAV and we had some countervailing effects with regard to our German business, where you can see for the new business all details on the next page 26. But still saying on 25, we had higher write-downs on the derivatives which we use for hedging against low interest rates, where the economic benefit of the long-term protection is not at all reflected in the accounting figures.</p>
          <p>We regard this protection has been very reasonable and necessary, but the full impact is not reflected in IFRS accounting, but it is definitely embedded value accretive. And therefore we stick to that kind of policy to protect ourselves here.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Primary Health, premium income on page 27 plus 3.7%, the rise in gross premiums was thanks to premium adjustments basically and some new business and lower cancellations here. And also I should mention that we started in Spain and the expansion in one region there where we are responsible for the full provision of healthcare Marina Salud. The rise in net expenses for claims and benefits was due to increased healthcare costs and a higher location to the provision for premium refunds. We had a strongly improved investment result also here due to lower write-downs on equities.</p>
          <p>Property-casualty on slide 29. We have a slight decrease of premium volume owing to negative foreign exchange effects here especially in Poland and Turkey. This was not enough to offset &#x2013; this was higher than the effect of the acquisition of Daum in Korea. And on page 29, you see the combined ratio and the loss development here, and it was quite favorable combined &#x2013; their combined ratio in Germany whereas for our subsidiaries abroad, we saw a substantial deterioration due to more difficult economic circumstances.</p>
          <p>Overall, we are satisfied with the combined ratio of 93.3% for the third quarter and 94.2 for the year. The comparison with the preceding year is not easily possible because we had a major one-off effect there in the calculation of the claims provisions.</p>
          <p>That brings me to the summary. In 2009, we had a very turbulent year and especially, in the first quarter when stock markets and capital markets collapsed, Munich Re stood like a rock and no client of us had to worry about our financial solidity. And we saw the strong recovery also on the stock markets, where some of this over performance was revered here. But, this doesn't change to what happened to the crisis. And I'm absolutely convinced that Munich Re's stability under these very difficult circumstances provides us now with a very strong basis for ceasing opportunities going forward, especially because we enjoy the luxury of, I dare to say, very healthy balance sheet.</p>
          <p>That brings me to the outlook for 2009 on page 32. Meanwhile it is possible to make the prognoses for this year, which we somewhat carefully place with 2.2 to &#x20AC;2.5 billion. We shouldn't forget that we are still in a very active natural catastrophe season, and especially the risk of still some Atlantic hurricanes or tropical hurricanes elsewhere but also of European winter storm is existing in spite of the good experience in the third quarter. And, therefore, this 2.2 to 2.5% is not extremely optimistic but also not over conservative. We would come to return of risk adjusted capital of up to 15% with these numbers.</p>
          <p>In the reinsurance, we still stick to our guideline of 97%, which is not a given. By the way, I forgot to say in the combined ratio of the last quarter, there were also a lot of run-off effect. These were not old claims or systematic release of reserve, but these were individual major claims, which just ran off in the course of their normal life like from the storm Kyrill in '07 or like from the storm Emma in '08 of the Queensland floods also in '08. So not something which we deliberately did to manage our results here.</p>
          <p>Primary insurance below 95, return on investment expected still to be slightly above 4%. Going forward for 2010 and following, we do not anticipate into our plans &#x2013; in our plans any significant increase in capital market interest rates. And therefore, we expect our regular income to be somewhat low and somewhat declining, but not drastically declining. Since we reduced our exposure to risky assets, we can also not expect a lot of realized gains from this source, but also I would like to stress that we do also not expect the same exposure to impairments then we had in the past.</p>
          <p>And therefore, we expect a very stable development of our investment result &#x2013; of our overall results, but at a somewhat lower platform. And even though, more ambitious &#x2013; we stick to our ambitious target of achieving 15% after tax with less impact from volatile investments, it will be somewhat more difficult to achieve, but we still have it quite clearly on our screen. So far with the results for the first nine months and our outlook for this year and a quick glance into next year. And with that, back to Christian.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take our first question from William Hawkins from KBW [Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I was lucky. I did not see registered to ask a question, but I'm seeing I do have to ask one. I suppose just in terms of your outlook for 2010, when you talk about the return on investment noticeably below 4% but you can still reach your 15% RORAC target. What do you think that means for absolute earnings progression going into 2010? Is it inevitable given that the pricing environment is still challenging and the investment return environment is going to be falling that they could actually be some negative progression in your earnings, or do you think they've been enough one-off in 2009 and there's enough efficiencies coming through in ERGO and elsewhere that you can still continue to grow your earnings next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, William. It's difficult to answer that question. So the known factors, as I told you before lead to somewhat lower result overall that is true. On the other hand, we have a lot of initiatives, especially in the reinsurance underway and we also expect quite substantial recovery of ERGO during the next year and going on. And therefore, I don't want you to be too optimistic with regard to the absolute amount of return. The relative amount compared to the risk involved and especially the return on risk adjusted capital and with that the value creation of Munich Re I think is absolutely to stand and is as strong as it never was. And therefore, I'm optimistic I would not give today a negative prognosis that we would run into lower earnings in this year. This is too early now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. May I ask a second question, please, just in terms of the positive run-off that you flagged from large losses? Could you just quantify that in euro terms please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That takes me a couple of minutes. We will come back to that later. So it was a normal run-off of these major losses. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Will Morgan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions, please. First is given your talking about potentially struggling to make your RORAC target, obviously we remain in a benign interest rates environment and I guess &#x2013; as Will mentioned before, obviously with potential pressures there on pricing. To what extend does that influence your view of capital management going forward? I mean, would you ever think about becoming more aggressive on that if you were to remain in a low-rate environment?</p>
          <p>The second question just relates to the practicalities of your share buyback that you're undertaking out until April because as I understand it under your original Changing Gear plan, there should be 1 billion left after you're done in April. I just wondered how the retained earnings situation is at the &#x2013; under the HGB account at Munich Re AG given that that is obviously going to influence the way that you are able to continue with the buyback. And if you can give any color on how you expect that number to develop, that would be very useful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, you mentioned yourself the limiting factor here. When we talk about share buybacks, we are very seriously pro, as you could see from our latest decision that we resumed the share buyback even before the end of the hurricane season because &#x2013; and this is very high on our agenda. And I also do not think that we inadequately restrict our growth potential by the share buybacks because our capitalization according to rating agencies, according to our internal capital model and according to Solvency 1 and Solvency 2, it's beyond the necessary level.</p>
          <p>And the limiting factor is indeed the HGB reserves, and these are more difficult to predict than the earnings of the Group as a whole because they are also depended on factors like interest rate movements and so on. So even if we are economically in good shape, because we have a good assets liability in that scene, the development of our HGB reserve could be somewhat impacted by write-downs on our fixed interest securities. They can be avoided somewhat by booking rules, but nevertheless, so there is some exposure, which is non-economic.</p>
          <p>The same applies for the development of the equalization reserve, the better we perform on the underwriting side, and we are still very optimistic here, the more we have to put into the equalization reserve. Therefore, it's not such an easy one-to-one translation. According to our internal prognosis, it is possible to continue our share buyback also into the next year. So the next tranche of this long-term program, but no decisions have been made yet and I wouldn't dare to anticipate what we intend to do in the course or after we have effected the current share buyback.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question from Jean-Francois Tremblay from RBS [The Royal Bank of Scotland]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have firstly, a question regarding your growth potential. Can you provide some color as to what extent the results of the latest national election in Germany might open up new growth opportunities for you in your primary life and health business? And then the second question has to do with your tax rate. Following this charge what should we expect on a go-forward basis in terms of the tax rate for next year and for the fourth quarter of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And I start with the latter, but because I didn't quite &#x2013; could you please repeat your first question? To what event where you referring to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's really a broad base question, but my impression is that -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>German election. Yeah, okay. Sorry. Yeah, yeah. Now I got it. Yeah, German action, yeah, that is difficult to say. Because we have a somewhat changed government, as you know, with stronger elements of private provisions, I would say, with the FTP as being part of the government. But as you know, the majority of the government parties are still &#x2013; were also member of the latest government. And therefore, I wouldn't be too bullish at the moment with regards to major changes, especially in health insurance rules. But on the other hand, I think all parties agree, more or less, that the social system cannot be enough to provide for the people who really want to pay for high-quality healthcare and all provision services. And therefore, we are in the long run very optimistic, especially when it comes to our supplementary product. Over time, they will enormously gain importance here.</p>
          <p>Second was the tax rate. Perhaps you might have seen, in Q3 we had a tax rate of 45% in primary &#x2013; in reinsurance property-casualty, which was due to this one-off contribution to the tax audit reserve, and this is definitely not sustainable. Our Group tax rate is in the order of 33%. And in reinsurance we would expect a somewhat lower tax rate due to the fact that our U.S. American income is to a large extent tax free, because we had written down our deferred tax assets, which were originally set up for losses carried forward.</p>
          <p>So overall, I would, as a rule of thumb, think dependent on how big the income from the U.S. is, it should be somewhere around 30%, definitely higher than predicted a while ago, when we had more income from our equities portfolio, which is, under German tax rules, tax free, so again from the exposures and dividend income. Therefore, at that time I would rather have thought about a 25% and now it's more around 30% as a recurring tax rate. Does this answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our question from Andrew Broadfield from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just two quick questions please. One is just on the asset duration and a number of companies have gone, I think, a little bit short duration and over the last little while to position themselves for what they think might be interest rate increases over time. Just wondered whether you can give me your position on that, whether that's part of your thinking at this stage? And then the second question is on reserve releases. I think, historically the reserve &#x2013; this time the reserve releases come out of relatively short tail activities. But I was wondering whether you might give us some color around the movements between the years and the longer terms, and whether it's relatively stable across the board? Or I think for some years now we've still seen sort of more recent fix years funding some of the really unpleasant older years which haven't really settled down. And if you can give us some color on that that will be great? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you. First, on asset duration we don't run bets on the asset duration by being short here and betting on rise in interest rates. To the contrary, at the moment we are, in reinsurance, somewhat long and in primary insurance, for structural reasons, we are somewhat short and there's a good diversification between the two. And in &#x2013; with regard to the reserve, first, I can clarify that the run-off profit from natural catastrophes of the years 2008 and 2007 in 2009 were in the order of &#x20AC;70 million or 0.7% loss ratios. And the long-term reserve, we did not make any move in the course of this year, just the normal run-off of the reserve. We will have our major reserve analysis on the basis of the data of the third quarter, and than we will have our major disclosure of the triangles together with the annual result.</p>

          <p>Okay. So, just very quickly, if possible &#x2013; if you can just give us a bit more explanation why you are longer in the reinsurance and shorter in the primary divisions?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In primary insurance you have theoretically very long-term duration of your liabilities, but with the high convexity that means that this duration changes at a time of rising interest rates, because you get more lapses there. Therefore, it would be very courageous to do an asset liability matching that is the reason there. And in reinsurance, we have a duration in the order of some 5.4% currently, 5.4 years, and this is somewhat above our duration of the liabilities, but the reason is that we have just recalculated the duration of our liabilities and that is where the difference comes from. But we feel rather comfortable here. So, there are no major changes currently.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. On ERGO, you talked a lot it was quite natural, it's &#x2013; that's improving, but it's not 900 million, but it is improving. And I wonder if you can either give a few numbers, a few kind of milestones what that numbers could look like 2010, 2011, I appreciate it's not 900 million, but any kind of guidance would be interesting. And any &#x2013; maybe conceptually you would say, well, thanks for this, these are milestones we definitely expect, that would be hugely helpful.</p>
          <p>And then on the goodwill, in the past you've been quite systematic about writing off any goodwill, it was almost like &#x2013; it was quite radical; BACAV were written off; Sterling, written off. Should we &#x2013; the fact that there is no being intangible or goodwill write-off in Q3, is that, you're quite happy with balance sheet as it is, and it signals you would be more comfortable with doing deals now that you've kind of reset the clock, or is there still areas or pockets of concern? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If you were in my job, you would always have areas of concern. And even with the Munich Re balance sheet. But to be serious, no, there is nothing in the pipeline. We had written down some intangibles also in the third quarter. We are in the constant <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; how much it &#x2013; current, we also &#x2013; always have a running write-down that was the majority and overall something like 40 million or so in that order, so not dramatic amount. All business plans are under, more or less, constant reviews and where we have substantial differences to what we had originally in mind when we set up the intangibles, then we swiftly corrected. So you are somewhat right by saying that we were perhaps a little bit more radical than the average market player here.</p>
          <p>With regard to ERGO, and we just wanted to get rid of this 900 million target and &#x2013; but apart from it everything else is to stand, especially the expense ratios will be brought down. And we are well underway with our programme, which we call continuous improvement of competitiveness here. And so, it's just a bottom line number for the years form now to 2012, where we would not expect the same amount as we did before. Apart from it, the ERGO programme has not been come to an end and has not been stopped. But I can't give you any milestones now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Two questions, please. The first one is J&#xF6;rg, I was just wondering if you could give us a number for what you would need to get to in terms of net income to attain a 15% RORAC. And the second question is, just I guess coming back to sort of the earnings base, looking through the next two your accounts, I'm looking at the sort of the net of realized gains, realized losses, write-ups, write-downs, but excluding the Primary Life and the Primary Health business, I get to a net contribution to the first nine months' results of &#x20AC;765 million.</p>
          <p>And J&#xF6;rg, I think you also mentioned you expected the regular income to be slightly lower as well. So I guess when I put those things together, is it fair to say that we should be looking for investments income in the shareholder businesses, excluding Primary Life, Primary Health to be noticeably lower in 2010 and in 2009. And I guess just following on from that, given that the combined ratio this year is, we presumably wouldn't be expecting a better combined ratio to last year, do you feel that the sum total of I guess the lower tax rate, but also the Primary Health business should be more than the, I guess sort of the lower realized gains that &#x2013; assuming you were to get say no realized gains next year, which I know I realize it's a &#x2013; sort of another way of asking a, I think a William Hawkins's question, but coming at it from a slightly different direction? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, James. First answer is, in our internal plan, we do not have any material realized gains from now on. That does not mean that they can't come, but this is a somewhat conservative basis and that led us to giving you the first rough indications for 2010 and onwards that the investment income must be somewhat lower here. And therefore, if, all other things being equal, the earnings base would suffer. But I think that there is still some potential on the underwriting side because we have refined our value proposition here, and we have, in my view, improved in many areas, which will have an impact on our net results over time. Also, I strongly believe that this stability shown during the crisis will have &#x2013; also help in the long run in the competition with other reinsurers. And your first question was about the net income, which fits to a 50% RORAC, that would more or less be precisely 2.5 billion, little bit more than 2.5 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In fact it looks like just come back quickly, I mean, yeah, I don't think anybody would dispute this, obviously improvement potential in the combined ratio, but given this year has been a fairly light year for losses, I'm just surprised that you think it would be better next year even taking into account some of the improvement potential? But I guess the other point is that, I mean those realized gains are equivalent to almost a quarter of your operating profits for this year. So I mean it's more than, I guess, just going down a bit, possibly coming down quite a lot even if you were to assume that, let's why you would have a base level realized gains on some assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, James I think everything is transparent at the moment. You know our asset portfolio, you know our unrealized gains which went up quite nicely, but on the basis of fixed interest securities, mainly a lot of it was, by the way, tightening of spread, which was particularly helpful, and which is not worse than increases in the value of equities. And so, it was for good reason that we did not give any guidance for an absolute amount, but we just wanted to give a first hint that from the investment side, we look to very low volatile, but somewhat normal best earnings going forward. But I think in a way, everybody had to know that looking at our numbers in the course of the last couple of months and years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Just one question regarding the combined ratio going forward. At the beginning of 2009, you targeted a combined ratio of 97%. Now we have seen significant rate increases, 2.6% in the January renewals, 7.2 in April, 4.4 in July, above claims inflation, I would say. Knowing also that one third of the rate increases in one underwriting year show in the next calendar year and assuming overall a flat rate development in 2010 renewals, is it too ambitious to assume a combined ratio below 97% for 2010 calendar year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That sounds good, Michael. I can't say more. So, it's right that part of the rate increases will only be earned next year I think, it's about some 60%, well, how we measure it at the moment, which is earned in the same year and the remaining part in the following year. So, your observation is quite correct. And I would very much like to share your optimism if I were not the CFO of that company. But to be serious, yes, I think so, we could see some improvements here. But I do not want to put an inappropriate stress on our underwriters now by setting unrealistic targets.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Marc Thiele from UBS. My first question is regarding this slide that you included in your presentation 35, with the adjusted operating result. You presumably want us to take this as the basis going forward. But you mentioned something earlier regarding DAC, I'm not certain that I completely understood that. I think you said something about, de-risking had led to a quicker DAC amortization. Maybe you could give us a number of how much is already captured in here and how we need to think about this going forward?</p>
          <p>And then my second question is, with the capital strength of the company, I was wondering if you internally thought about redeploying this, either by looking at growth opportunities from potential for sellers and or, if you would look at potential growth opportunities in cash-generative markets, and maybe you can remind us regarding your criteria. How will you lay out M&amp;A against share buybacks and dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Marc. And first the slide 35, we just wanted to give you one impression about the development from last year to this year, and one can see quite easily here that on an adjusted, on a basis adjusted for the extraordinary items of the investment result, the result of this year is more or less in line with that of last year, a little bit worse; that is the effect coming from lower running investment income. Hence also you can see on the bottom line, that we had higher taxes this year. What I mentioned before, the cost &#x2013; the DAC amortization, this is not such a big effect here. We are talking about the very low, very, very low double-digit million number, and it does not have a major impact here.</p>
          <p>On your second question, yeah, we were a bit disappointed over the last some 12 months or so because we had hoped for getting more opportunities for what I could, somewhat shortened, call lucky buys on the M&amp;A side. So to put it more seriously, acquisitions at adequate prices which really take into account the changed economic environment. What we saw was that very few sellers were really forced to get rid of their assets and that the expectations of the seller side was, in our view and with our look, very strongly profitability-oriented look, was absolutely not in line with the profit potential of the respective target.</p>
          <p>That might change, because we heard during the last couple of days about some examples of banks which were supported by the government and which are now forced to get rid of their insurance operations. They will definitely not sell them at an inappropriate price, but I hope that we move on now to more normal circumstances, where demand and supply is in a better relation than it was in the past. We will look to a lot of that, but I would be very surprised if we do a major acquisition very soon.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Can I ask two things; firstly, you said, J&#xF6;rg, that you're in a position to seize opportunities next year. I was wondering if you could give us some indication as to how much sort of organic growth you see, particularly on the reinsurance side of the business, given that I think on the &#x2013; at least on the PMC side, there was a decline.</p>
          <p>And the second thing was just coming at this sort of profit outlook in a slightly different way. There is a quote on Bloomberg, I guess, from the media conference this morning, where you said that topping &#x20AC;2 billion in 2010 profit was possible. I was just wondering what sort of weight you would give to that comment, the way you were quoted, it would suggest that there's a fairly good chance presumably because of the investment income outlook, but even that might be something of a stretch? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think I was correctly quoted here, but I would nevertheless put a high probability in us going above 2 billion. But I can't be more specific at the moment, because there are still a lot of uncertainties from the impact of the economic crisis, especially when we talk about insurance. We have the supply-demand factor, which is very difficult to judge on.</p>
          <p>There was destruction of capital. There is lower supply. Lower supply should lead to better prices somewhat. On the other hand, on the demand side, it is very difficult to predict now how much the crisis will have an impact on the real economy, and here especially also indirectly, on the demand for insurance.</p>
          <p>And with regard to our opportunities in the course of next year, I'm somewhat optimistic that we could see some more capital relief deals. Because accounting allows for some delay of a loss recognition, especially when we talk about local GAAP accounting, which is in most countries relevant for the supervisory system. That means that it can well be that in the course of setting up the balance sheet for 2009, the one or the other party in primary insurance could realize that a little bit support from a reinsurer could be helpful.</p>
          <p>Therefore we are still open for business; for that kind of business. And we provide our capacity also for this kind of capital relief deals where some additional growth could come from.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just to follow-up on that. Would say, in the last quarter or so, that you see a greater likelihood of those deals, or a lesser?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In my view, the last quarter of a year should mean a greater likelihood of the arrangement of such a deal. It would then most probably come into force at the beginning of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have two questions, please. First of all, when we're looking at the running investment yield, J&#xF6;rg, could you maybe just eliminate a bit better all the moving parts? There's three that I'm thinking of. At what rates &#x2013; at what yield are you investing new money? What is the yield at which investments are coming out of the books? And then, what is the rate &#x2013; the speed at which the investments are turning over?</p>
          <p>That was hopefully, one question. And then secondly, on primary life, as most quarters, it'd very nice to get a gauge for the underlying profitability level in the quarter. You mentioned that there was the mark-to-market of the hedge. Maybe if you could quantify that? Or is there anything else you can identify that we should strip out to get a view for the underlying profitability of primary life and health?</p>
          <p>I would prefer to look at that on a operating profit basis, but I'll just take it anyway you can answer the question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Brian, running yield, and our current running yield is about 4.2%. About 20% of our fixed income volume will be reinvested over a year, roughly. The new average coupon would be dependent on the risk we take. And here I cannot fully anticipate that yet. So by taking some risk with, for example, investing in fund piece or investing in government bonds, not from the United States and from Germany, but from the other second-tier countries.</p>
          <p>You can also have running yields which is somewhat above 4%. But when we invest in a more moderate to low risk version, then we should anticipate something somewhat below 4%.</p>
          <p>And also there might be some dividend income from our equities portfolio. So the development is slow and it's not extreme. And the extent of the development is not that we are talking here about some decline of average yields of 20 basis points or so per year, it is less. But what is falling away, that is, the realized gains we had in the past. So this is the more &#x2013; the more important impact on our investment yields less, the running yield.</p>
          <p>Then primary insurance, perhaps somebody can give me the numbers from the hedging. That is, for the full year, minus 344 million on a gross basis. And after policyholder participation and tax impact is minus 70, roughly.</p>
          <p>And in the third quarter, on a standalone basis, it's slightly positive, some 14 million on a gross basis and relatively unimportant on a net basis. What makes the look at our primary life and health calculations somewhat difficult is this relatively high allocation to premium refund is based on our local GAAP calculation.</p>
          <p>And as we are not preparing quarterly financial statements for HEB, local GAAP. The allocation to premium refunds is based on an artificial split to the four quarters. And therefore, they are contradictory affected during the fiscal year. So that will clear up in the course of the full year numbers. And I would guess that this will look relatively better then. Whereas, the first three quarters of 2008 were somewhat overstated due to that mechanism, which can only be far away from being perfect because we have totally different ways of calculating. It's in local GAAP.</p>
          <p>And some local GAAP items are not reflected under IFRS. For example, this impact from the derivatives, the minus 344, does not show up under local GAAP. So when we put up the local GAAP calculation of the policyholder participation, these are ignored, which means that that leads to &#x2013; in the accounting numbers &#x2013; to an extraordinarily high contribution to the policyholder's fee. So that makes it so difficult, especially on a quarterly basis where we have too many distortions.</p>
          <p>But let me make one final remark, one thing is for sure, the difference between the guaranteed level and the level we can earn in such a low interest environment is too small. That means, due to the strong competition, the crediting rates which are given to the policyholder eat up too much of the margin we need to support this kind of business. And therefore, we are not in bad shape, but the inherent profitability of German life business must be improved over time.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. J&#xF6;rg, I'll just clarify you were saying the 344 doesn't show up in the statutory accounts at present. But it will be in the Q4 true up, right, so the full-year would reflect it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this will never show up, because these are derivatives which are created from split up of financial instruments from loans. So very complicated to translate that from local GAAP into U.S. GAAP &#x2013; into IFRS. But perhaps we can talk a little bit more on that with our experts offline, Brian, because it's so complicated it makes me such a lot of headache in the course of the preparation to such a conference. I understand it meanwhile, but it's very difficult to explain it in an understandable way for me.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, altogether. I have actually &#x2013; the case is crystalline for me, so I need only question. It's about the inflation-linked bond you have in the portfolio, the 11%. This bond portfolio would protect you of course in case of inflation, but currently it has some opportunity cost there. And I am trying to make your ROI comparable to other player. So the question is, could you give me some sense of what the average coupon is that you have on this 11%? Or, asked differently, could you tell me how would the 4.3% ROI change, if you would for instance be investing copper bond instead of this type of protection?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fabrizio. This is an interesting question because exactly that cost us some running yield. The reason is, we are in a kind of worst case situation at the movement. We are absolutely fine of having invested in these bonds because they have somewhat increased in value because the expectation of the inflation is rather high.</p>
          <p>The coupon is dependent on the actual inflation, which means that this is extremely low. That leads us to a running year in the order of 1.6% and the impact on our overall return on investment is roughly 0.15%, this is substantial.</p>

          <p>Yes. Thank you. The first question is regarding your tax burden in the third quarter, I somehow missed what's the reason was for this higher tax burden I only understood that we will go away in later quarters? And the second question is linked to your investment income, I suppose that the restructuring of your P&amp;L presentation, which showing a technical result is partly responsible for showing the value increases in the unit-linked product, which now show up in the investment income, how much was this in the third quarter? And how actually do you treat this business?</p>

          <p>Stephan, thank you first. The tax burden, unfortunately I can't say a lot more because otherwise I would have to describe the case. And in most cases when we talk &#x2013; when we have some uncertainties, it has to do with cross-border cases and this is also one. You have a lot of management judgments here, because it is more probable than not, that there is a liability in future. In other words from a probability of 51% you have to set up 100% of the reserve. And if you have a case, where you are thinking of probability between 40 and 60% you have some ground for estimation here and perhaps we took here somewhat more cautious approach, or not perhaps but definitely.</p>
          <p>And investment income and here especially your question was about the unit linked stuff How does the unit link finds its way into our reporting? Market value fluctuations of unit linked assets are shown under other income in the investment results or other expenses in the investment, results with technically that is the value of funds in a way.</p>
          <p>And in accordance with the change of the assets, the provisions for future policyholder benefit show the same increase or reduction that the effect is overall zero and this fluctuation of the corresponding liabilities is also shown in the technical result under expenses for claims and benefits. And to improve technical result significance and we have put it here into our technical result and as a revolving entry here. So it's a bit difficult to describe but effect for the shareholder is zero. When you look at our other results for &#x2013; from investments the difference to last years 700 million and also it's 700 million than last year for the full year. And it was a positive &#x20AC;353 million in quarter one to three. And 216 for the third quarter alone and the swing was for the full year 700 million. Does this answer your question, Stephan?</p>

          <p>May be on the tax issue, I understand that you don't want to say what's the details are behind this, but it's 100% sure that it will not be another burden in the next quarter and there is a chance that there will be a release in future years, if you are too pessimistic here?</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have a question concerning the sustainability of operating profit in the life hedge reinsurance segment. The actual number was 857 million after nine months and I think this looks fairly high compared to the indications given on the Investors Day a year ago. So my first question is whether there are any one-offs in this number except from the investment results or the high investment result?</p>
          <p>And second question is whether it would be reasonable to expect an operating profit in the order of magnitude let's say 600 million or so for the next year? These are my questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thorsten there is no substantial one-off in these numbers. And we talked about technical result in the course of the analyst conference, roughly 300 million as a recurring number and this is higher than we achieved during the first &#x2013; this is inline with because it's an annual number and we achieved 192. That one remark is and the split of investment income between life and non-life is always very difficult because part of the business and the large part of the business is written out of Munich Re AG in Germany.</p>
          <p>And there must be an artificial split and at the moment life gets very high share of the investment results and that becomes now more obvious when there are less realized gains on which in the past always distorted that view. So going forward I think the profitability of life will be good measured in terms of market consistent embedded value development, the IFRS number could be somewhat lower than it is today if we do another split of the investment result that going forward but we would report on that, nothing to worry that I can safely say.</p>

          <p>Thanks, good afternoon. Two questions please, coming back to the combined ratio reinsurance. If I take the third quarter combined ratio take out mediclaims and adjust for reserve releases. And the underlying combined ratio, and it's my calculation deteriorated somehow, not quite but percentage points over the half year figure, is this correct are there any reasons for this?</p>
          <p>And secondly could you comment on the Allianz quota share deal you might lose next year the impact of this? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Roland. And combined ratio yes, you are right. Underlying combined ratio except for natural catastrophes was worse than in the preceding year. But we I think one should have an eye on the recession related major claims which are really one off, and which we do not expect to continue going forward. Also we're talking about a very small effect if we take out and all losses including man-made losses, we are almost at the same level, so no major change here.</p>
          <p>With regards to Allianz quota share yes, it's right it's running off on the other side we have very good and for both sides interesting business with Allianz and I should also mention that this quarter and this quota share treaty, it also has &#x2013; is mirrored by a same quota share treaty in the other direction that means on the net basis it is a very good contribution to the diversification of the risks profile of both companies, but it's not that we lose one sided business here on a net basis the impact for us would be zero.</p>
