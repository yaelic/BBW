          <p>Greetings, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Union Pacific Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Release Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>As a reminder this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Young, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific.  Thank you. Mr. Young, you may begin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone.  Welcome to Union Pacific's fourth quarter earnings conference call.  With me this morning are Rob Knight, our CFO; Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales and Dennis Duffy, Executive Vice President of Operations.  Today we are reporting record quarterly results despite facing some challenges in the quarter.  In the fourth quarter Union Pacific earned $1.86 per share, a 4% increase over 2006.  Rob will provide you with the details on how record high fuel prices, the economy and weather impacted earnings but there were basically four major drivers to this quarter.  Rapidly rising diesel fuel price was a major challenge especially with the two-month lag in the majority of our fuel surcharge programs.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter car loadings were up nearly 2.5% coming into December but we ended the quarter roughly flat after being impacted by winter weather in December and some economic softness.  Operationally, we improved across the board.  Our service metrics, productivity measures and customer satisfaction surveys all showed progress.  And consistent with prior quarters, core price increases remained strong.  Looking at our full year results, our progress can be summarized by looking at the gain in return on invested capital up a half a point to 8.7%.  We achieved these milestones by focusing on the key areas of our business that drive our results.  We operated a safer railroad in 2007, improving safety for our employees, customers and the public.</p>
          <p>We set new financial records for our company including net income of 1.86 billion, up 16% versus 2006, and we delivered better service to our customers, which they recognized by giving us our highest ratings ever under satisfaction surveys in 2007.  The progress we made in these areas enable us to deliver a 38% total return to our shareholders, through stock price appreciation, a 47% dividend increase and $1.5 billion of share repurchases.  So with that let me turn it over to Jack to talk about our revenue performance and our 2008 outlook.  Jack?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jim and good morning. Despite continued softness in some markets and challenging weather in December, our fourth quarter volume edged past a year ago. Average revenue per car improved 6% driving a similar improvement in commodity revenue, which topped $4 billion.  Although volume returned a little over 1% for the full year, revenue grew to a record 15.5 billion as our ongoing efforts to drive yield improvement resulted in average revenue per car of $1,594.  Improving service in 2007 helped create pricing opportunity even with softer market conditions as customers recognized greater value for their price dollar.  And while we are pleased with the record revenue that we posted in 2007 the best proof statement of our success was the satisfaction scores we received from our customers, our satisfaction index improved over 2006 every quarter and for the full year came in at 79 which is a new post-merger record.</p>
          <p>Now let me take you through each of our six business groups with a look at the fourth quarter played out and what we see ahead for 2008.  Let's start with our Ag Products business.  Ag Products revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter to $719 million with a slight increase in volume combining with a 6% increase in average revenue per car. Wheat exports especially to the PNW and the Gulf, and ethanol and DDGs led the increases.  Largely offsetting that growth were declines in three markets. Domestic feed grain moves to Texas were soft because there was a strong local crop in the Texas area.  The cottonseed crop was smaller than a year ago because acres were shifted to corn and we moved fewer cars of import beer due to higher inventories and the elimination of the transload from plane to insulated boxcars at Longview, Texas, which reduced car loads but actually increased our efficiency and profitability.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to 2008 we expect continued growth in ethanol and DDGs.  Ethanol demand is also going to drive growth in corn volumes with increased shipments to our forward ethanol plants on the West Coast.  Wheat should stay strong and the start-up of our second produce unit train in February along with increased meat and poultry exports should help drive growth in our Food Products line.</p>
          <p>Turning to Automotives the 7% increase in average revenue per car allowed our Autos team to post a 4% increase in revenue even as volume declined 2%.</p>
          <p>Vehicle shipments fell 6% as sales continued to soften. That decline was partially offset by a 2% increase in parts as we saw continued success with the intermodal train service between Detroit and Mexico that we started up in conjunction with the CSX earlier in 2007.  Both vehicles and part volumes are expected to decline in 2008 as US vehicle sales are predicted to fall somewhere in the range of 15.5 to 15.8 million vehicles.</p>
          <p>Our Chemicals markets have been the bright spot throughout the year.  In fact it was our only business to post volume growth in all four quarters.  For the fourth quarter revenue grew 12%, with volume up 5, and a 7% improvement in average revenue per car.</p>
          <p>While we saw strength pretty much across the board in the fourth quarter, our 23% increase in fertilizer led the way, driven by strength in the export potash markets.  Plastics volume was up 6% with both line-haul and storage-in-transit moves favorably impacted by contracts that we renegotiated in 2007. Liquid and dry volumes grew 4%, aided by caustic soda production, which shifted to the Gulf Coast.   We're looking for our Chemical markets to remain stable throughout 2008.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our Energy business, 4% growth in the Southern Powder River Basin in coal drove an overall 2% increase in volume, more than offsetting disappointing Colorado/Utah loading.  Revenue grew 8% as the volume growth combined with a 6% average increase in revenue growth per car. Strong demand, consistent production, few weather incidents and fluid train operations all combined to produce the best ever quarter for the SPRB trains, tons and carloads.</p>
          <p>Mine production and coal quality problems held Colorado/Utah volumes 12% below a year ago.  We did however achieve a record average tons-per-train out of that region at just over 11,000 tons.  Looking ahead our Energy business looks like it's got the best growth prospects here in 2008.  Although Colorado/Utah volume is currently expected to be flat, we are beginning to see some activity in the international markets that could be favorable for this coal.</p>
          <p>Strong demand should produce growth of about 5% for the SPRB and that growth outlook could be even a little stronger if we have fewer weather incidents and mine production problems than we experienced in 2007.</p>
          <p>For the first time since third quarter 2006 our Industrial Products business posted revenue growth up 1% as a 3% improvement in average revenue per car offset a 2% volume decline.  Weak demand in the housing market continues to impact our lumber business, and other construction related businesses and the paper markets continue to shrink with the conversion from print to digital media.</p>
          <p>The good news was the 7% growth in stone volumes driven by pent up demand from projects delayed by customer production issues and bad weather that had occurred earlier in the year.  This is a group where I think it's important to note that the mix shift associated with reduced high revenue per car lumber and increased lower revenue per car stone impacted the average revenue per car in the quarter.  It's really masking the true price improvement the Industrial Products team has been able to achieve in very difficult market conditions.</p>
          <p>This is the business that of course is most sensitive to the economy and all indications are that softness in these markets is going to continue to be a challenge throughout 2008.</p>
          <p>With a 5% improvement in average revenue per unit, Intermodal revenues grew 4% even though volume ran about a percent below last year.  Continue soft import markets produced a 3% decline in international volume.  Economic softness also impacted our premium and domestic business.  But despite that softness, domestic volume was up 3%, driven by growth in our legacy contract business.</p>
          <p>Although we look to Intermodal to be one of the long-term drivers of future growth, the outlook for Intermodal for 2008 is somewhat modest.  While we expect to see some strengthening of the international market our domestic volume is expected to decline a little due to business losses that we occurred in our IMC and truckload segments.</p>
          <p>Let me wrap up.  As we went through each of the business groups I highlighted our expectations for 2008 and here's how that shapes up in terms of our volume outlook for the year.  As I said, our growth is strongest in Energy and Ag is also looking pretty good for us.  Chemicals and Intermodal have some upside and Autos and Industrial Products will likely see some further softening.</p>
          <p>Of course the wild card is the economy. Clearly there is a lot of concern about whether we'll avoid a recession, or a downturn.  Overall, volume is expected to be up 1% to down 1% with the low side driven by a longer or deeper economic softness.  As in the past, we expect the diversity of our franchise will help us weather a slower economy.  With continued focus on driving every piece of business to our re-invest ability threshold including the opportunity to re-price legacy contracts for about 6% of our revenue.  We expect to see revenue growth in all six of our business groups in 2008.  With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dennis.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jack and good morning.  The operating team made significant improvements in 2007 concentrating on the core areas of safety, service, value and leadership.  Starting on slide 15 with an overview, employee, customer and public safety programs made gains during 2007 with improvements in all three categories.  Our employee incident rate was at its lowest level ever.  Focused derailment prevention initiatives also paid dividends saving more than $11 million year-over-year.  And despite increasing highway traffic and urban expansion, crossing incidents declined 9%.</p>
          <p>Public education programs and crossing closures during 2007 helped drive this improvement.  Jack just talked to you about improved customer satisfaction ratings, which correlate directly with our service metrics.  System velocity increased nearly one-half mile per hour while terminal dwell time improved more than two hours to 25.1 hours.  I'll talk later about capital.</p>
          <p>We are strengthening the infrastructure, de-bottlenecking key chokepoints, and positioning our railroad for resiliency and growth.  In addition, we made strong productivity gains in all facets of our operations.</p>
          <p>As shown on slide 16, we improved freight car cycle time by 7% to best ever levels.  This is the result of our service initiatives, such as improving our on-time spot and pull performance to customers, lower car cycle time is reflected in our income statement in the form of lower rent expense, and it also helps our customers manage their freight car expenses.</p>
          <p>We've also increased train lengths in all of our networks.  In the Powder River Basin we moved 1 million more tons with 1.4% fewer trains per day.  We added ten intermodal boxes to every train allowing us to move about the same volume with 5% fewer crew starts.  And in total first crew starts declined 4% on a 1% lower volume.  Better yet, our rate of improvement accelerated throughout the year with more to come in 2008.  And we adjusted the workforce to keep our costs more volume variable.  We started the year with a train crew hiring plan of about 2,300 but adjusted it down to less than 1,400 letting attrition reduce our operating crafts by about 475 people.</p>
          <p>Another key focus in our productivity efforts is fuel conservation; saving money as well as reducing emissions and making us even more environmentally friendly relative to other transportation modes.  Our 2007 consumption rate improved 2%, saving nearly 21 million gallons of fuel and $43 million.  Key activities include Fuel Masters, which includes training, follow-up and rewards the best engineers with personal fuel cards to fill their own vehicles, something very popular these days.  Technology improvements such as automated shutdown devices and our new hybrid switch locomotives that burn less fuel and reduce emissions.  The Fuel Conservation Speed initiative that analyzes specific corridors and finds opportunities to adjust speed for the most efficient fuel consumption rate while protecting fluidity and good flow management principles.  Results so far are encouraging and should help us achieve another nice improvement in 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving now to capital on slide 18.  We significantly strengthened our physical infrastructure during 2007.  Through our maintenance programs we reduced flow order delay, upgraded heavy-haul corridors, rehabilitated yards, and improved the overall maintainability of our network.  Key capacity projects include tunnel clearances on the I-5 Corridor that were completed allowing us to run double-stack trains between Los Angeles and Portland, 33 miles of double-track and various terminal enhancements on the Sunset Corridor, the third main line in the Powder River Basin Joint coal Line was finished and work started on a portion of the fourth main line.  Although we acquired about 1,000 new freight cars in 2007, our total fleet declined nearly 12,000 cars year-over-year as we scrapped older cars and terminated freight car leases.</p>
          <p>Finally we acquired 300 new high horse-powered units and 149 hybrid switch locomotives, all helping us to lower fuel consumption, reduce emissions and improve reliability.  We are offsetting this with retirements and lease turn backs with more to follow in 2008.</p>
          <p>Turning to 2008, despite the fact that Mother Nature has dealt us challenges with mudslides in Oregon and severe winter weather in the Midwest to start the year, we are optimistic about the operational outlook.  Our priorities remain straightforward; achieve unprecedented levels in all areas of safety, continue productivity trends, and whether volumes pick up or slow down become more volume variable regardless of volumes, continue to provide a better service product to our customers and make a strong investment in our network, further improving our infrastructure.  With that, I will pass it to Rob for the numbers.</p>

          <p>Thanks Dennis and good morning.  Fourth quarter earnings totaled $1.86 per share. That compares to 2006 earnings of $1.78 per share, which is slightly better than we were anticipating in mid December.  As I walk through the quarterly drivers, I will point out a couple of good news items that drove the upside.  But it primarily relates to better operating productivity with some additional benefit from other income and a small insurance settlement.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the top of the income statement.  Operating revenue grew 6% in the fourth quarter to nearly $4.2 billion.  Quarterly operating expenses also increased 6%, primarily as a result of a 30% increase in fuel and utilities expense.  Through our continued focus on efficiency and returns, we overcame both fuel and weather challenges in the fourth quarter to produce record operating income of $864 million, up 7%.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide 23 and the drivers of the fourth quarter commodity revenue.  Revenue grew 6% to just over $4 billion on flat volumes.  Revenue growth would have been even greater had it not been, had we not lost an estimated 30, or excuse me, 20 million or so from the impact of the December storms on coal and grain loadings.  Average revenue per car increased 6% year over year, with improvements in each of our six business groups.  Continued efforts to increase core prices were the primary driver of the gains.</p>
          <p>Moving to expenses, fourth quarter salaries and benefits expense totaled $1.1 billion, a 3% decline.  Our labor productivity continued to improve in the quarter.  Although volume was roughly flat year-over-year, we reduced our work force more than 3%.  As you just heard from Dennis, in a lighter volume environment we grow productivity by significantly reducing train starts.  Trainmen costs were also lower year-over-year as we aligned our work force needs with business levels.  In addition to trainmen reductions, we reduced our non-operating workforce as we continue to improve our overall organizational effectiveness.  Wage inflation did offset some of these productivity gains.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead we will continue to increase productivity.  Actual work force levels in 2008 will depend upon volumes.  These two variables will move together directionally, but it won't be a one-for-one.  In other words we will achieve greater workforce productivity relative to the volume changes.</p>
          <p>On the next slide we show our average monthly diesel fuel prices for the last seven months of 2006 and 2007.  This illustrates the large year-over-year price hike we experienced in the fourth quarter.  Unlike 2006, when prices began declining in the fall, diesel fuel prices increased dramatically in the last three months of 2007.  Our average price per gallon started at $2.44 in October rising to $2.66 in November, and ended the year at $2.68 in December.  In fact, we paid an average of $2.59 per gallon for diesel fuel in the fourth quarter, a 34% increase from 2006.  Because of the two-month lag in the majority of our fuel surcharge mechanisms the increased costs associated with these rising prices could not be recovered in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Equipment and other rents was down $2 million in the fourth quarter.  We reduced car hire expense as a result of faster asset turns and lower freight car inventories.  Expenses per car and container leases were also lower in the quarter due to fewer leased units.  These gains were partially offset by higher locomotive lease expense.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide 27, purchased services and other expenses.  This category declined 3% or $15 million to $431 million. Although we had initially expected costs to increase in this category several different factors combined to drive the year-over year change.  Casualty expense was roughly $10 million lower in the quarter, as a result of improved safety and lower freight claims.  In addition, a small insurance settlement increased productivity, lower volumes in a couple of other items contributed to the decrease.</p>
          <p>For 2008, we will have an expense headwind in our casualty line.  As you'll recall in the first and third quarters of 2007 we recorded casualty expense reductions totaling $77 million as a result of semi-annual actuarial studies.  Although we expect some ongoing benefit from our improved safety performance, we won't be able to completely offset these headwinds.  The net result of a 6% increase in both operating revenue and expense is our fourth quarter operating ratio of 79.4%.  This slide illustrates the drivers of our operating ratio.  Although coming into the quarter we expected high fuel prices to be a challenge, a sharp spike in prices had a greater than anticipated impact. In total, higher fuel prices added 3.6 points to our fourth quarter operating ratio.  The carloading impact of the December storms also pressured our operating ratio adding almost half a point.  The good news is that we more than offset the challenges of fuel and weather, primarily through operating revenue growth and productivity gains.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, slide 29, we show our fourth quarter income statement.  Fourth quarter other income totals $40 million.  Although this is slightly higher than expected due to some December real estate transactions, it is $17 million lower than last year's fourth quarter.  Interest expense totaled $125 million, up 6% as a result of higher debt levels.  Income taxes grew 4% to $779 million.  Higher pre-tax income and a higher year-over-year effective income tax rate of 37% drove the increase.</p>
          <p>If you step back and look at our results on a full year basis, 2007 marked another year of solid gains.  Over the past two years we've taken 7.5 points off of our operating ratio, more than two points in 2007.  Everyone in Union Pacific is committed to continuing this improvement trend as we focus on profitable top line growth and ongoing productivity gains.</p>
          <p>Slide 31 shows our full year income statement.  Operating revenue grew 5% in the year to a best ever $16.3 billion.  Operating expenses were up 2% with higher diesel fuel prices accounting for much of the year-over-year increase.  Other income was down slightly in the year at $116 million.  For 2008 our current thinking is that this number will be more in the range of 50 to $75 million.</p>
          <p>Interest expense increased $5 million as we added 900 million of long-term debt to the books.  Income taxes grew 26% to $1.2 billion as a result of a higher effective tax rate in 2007 and increased pre-tax earnings.  And in 2008, we're expecting a tax rate of about 38%.  2007 net income was up 16% to a best ever $1.86 billion.  Full year earnings per share totaled $6.91 per share, a 17% increase.</p>
          <p>Turning now to cash.  We've grown cash from operations, nearly $700 million since 2005, to $3.3 billion.  This includes the impact of significantly higher cash taxes.  Between 2005 and 2007 our cash tax rate increased from about 2% to 28% as we used up our AMTs and NOL credits from prior years.  We continue to take a balanced approach to the uses of our cash with a combination of capital investments, dividend increases and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>In 2007 total capital came in around $3.1 billion, 2.5 billion of cash capital plus another 600 million in non-cash capital primarily for equipment leasing. We haven't finalized our 2008 capital plans yet but our current thinking is that spending will be roughly equal to 2007 levels.  Similar to prior years, the total investment will include some combination of cash capital and leasing.  We will provide more details about our capital plans in the coming months.</p>
          <p>As we announced last November we are also using our cash to pay higher dividends. We increased our quarterly dividends to $0.44 per share. This was our second dividend increase in 2007 resulting in a total increase for our shareholders of 47%.  Another use of cash is our share re-purchase program. We continued to purchase shares during the fourth quarter, buying back 2.4 million shares of UP common at a total cost of about $305 million.  Since instituting the program in January 2007 we have repurchased 12.6 million shares.  We are committed to rewarding our shareholders as illustrated by the nearly $1.5 billion of cash that we returned through repurchases in 2007.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 34, we show our total debt level.  In 2007 our total debt related obligations increased about $1.2 billion.  This drove our lease adjusted debt to cap ratio two points higher to 43.6%.  For 2008 we see a number of variables that will drive our results.  Jack talked about our volume outlook. Of course with 11 months left in the year, any number of things could happen that would change our volume expectations.  It really depends upon how long the economy stays soft, how soft it gets and the overall demand levels for less economically sensitive goods such as coal and grain.</p>
          <p>As Dennis discussed we are trying to be more volume variable as an organization, volume growth not only drives revenue but also productivity. We are confident in our ability to improve our operating ratio in 2008 through better returns on our business and increased productivity.  The level of the improvement however is hard to gauge today given the uncertainty with volumes and fuel prices.  We are currently forecasting 2008 diesel fuel prices will average 15 to 20% above our 2007 price of $2.24 per gallon.  But if prices differ from this estimate it could impact our earnings for the year.  Taken together, we believe our 2008 earnings should be in the range of $7.75 to $8.25 per share.  These results would drive another year of strong ROIC growth in 2008.</p>
          <p>This slide reflects the financial strength and flexibility of Union Pacific. Coming off 2007, where we grew earnings 17%, we are forecasting another strong year of earnings growth in what may be a tougher economic environment.  We believe we can achieve these results because of our focus on efficiency, our dedication to returns, and the diversity of our franchise.  Looking at our first quarter outlook in slide 36, we would expect earnings in the range of $1.50 to $1.70 per share.  The key drivers of this earnings range are volume and diesel fuel prices.  To reach the high end of the range, we'd expect to stay around 2% volume growth.  We would also need fuel prices to stay around the current January average of $2.68 per gallon.  Factors that could push us to the lower end of the range would be slower volume growth or rising fuel prices.  If diesel fuel prices increase in February or March we would not recover that incremental cost until the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, we do have a challenge in the first quarter from last year's casualty expense reduction, which totaled $30 million.  In addition, demand for coal and intermodal car loads, which have a lower average revenue per car could impact our business mix and be a drag on earnings.  This mix effect may be magnified by less demand for higher average revenue per car moves such as lumber and finished vehicles.</p>
          <p>Although we clearly expect our strong trend of productivity improvements to continue, those gains will likely be masked in the fourth quarter by increased casualty expense and higher fuel prices.  Beyond the first quarter, we would expect the pace of operating ratio improvement to accelerate.  So let me turn it back over to Jim for some closing comments.</p>

          <p>Thanks Rob.  What you've seen in our results and heard from the team today is that 2007 was a good year.  We achieved a number of financial and operational milestones in a more difficult business environment.  We expect 2008 will be another record year, even with some ongoing challenges.  As Rob walked you through our outlook for the year, he talked about the expected headwinds of the economy and higher diesel fuel prices.</p>
          <p>Another issue in 2008 is the regulatory environment in Washington.  The STB just issued another decision on CAPM last week and we expect Congress to refocus on the rails when they're back in session.  No matter how you look at it though, rails must be part of the solution to addressing America's need for increased transportation infrastructure.  These challenges are largely external factors.  Our opportunities, however, are within our control and we have initiatives underway that will drive record performance in 2008 and beyond.  So with that, we've got some time here to take a few questions.</p>

          <p>Yes.  Good morning.  I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about the operating plan and what sort of metrics we can watch for as fluidity improves.  How that can sort of manifest itself in the financials.  Whether we want to think about cost per carload or cost per GTM.  How much improvement is there left to go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Bill we set a minimum goal here of offsetting inflation, when you think about productivity. And again as Rob had mentioned, Dennis talked through, this business is also a function of volume and on the higher end of the volume you can see some pretty decent improvements in unit costs.  If volume is soft it will be a challenge, but overall I -- you know a good planning tool for me is to offset inflation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then if we get the investment tax credit passed by Congress how would that affect how you would think about your CapEx spend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have got a list of projects that clearly we would take a very hard look at accelerating and make the right decisions.  We, as Rob mentioned, our -- while we don't have Board approval on our capital, we are looking at about the same level this year.  These are strategic investments when you look at it.  We are going to take a hard look at some of the shorter-term areas like locomotives will be lower locomotive buying next year, freight car rebuilds will be reduced -or this year -- and, but we have some opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one last question.  Mix and price, how does it affect your average revenue per car?  In the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think overall when you look at the fourth quarter, our average revenue per car shows you about what our core price improvement was and I think our negative mix effect offset some of the upside we saw from fuel surcharge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks for your help.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Ed Wolfe with Bear Stearns.  Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey.  Good morning everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, with the guidance it looks like for the first quarter you are giving volume guidance of 0 to 2 and then for the full year minus 1 to positive 1, a little less than that.  What is it that you see that makes volume more challenging as you go throughout the year?  I would think the comps get easier and maybe the economy improves if anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ed a year ago we were battling some pretty major weather issues up in the coal mines so your comps are a little bit easier so far in January.  In fact, if you look our carloads that were produced yesterday show us up about 3% I think overall for the month, 2 to 3%.  And we're being cautious on the rest of the year in terms of the economy.  And there's a lot of winter left here in February and March.  So right now on the surface the volume looks a little bit, it is a little bit stronger than we have in the plan, but I would be careful about projecting that out for full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there some make up from the 20 million you lost in the coal and grain loadings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not in coal.  We -- the coal demand right now. With the coal production line you've got plenty of demand there, and we're handling every carload we can.  There may be a little bit of carryover in Ag that's out here, but we're expecting a pretty strong, as Jeff said, still a pretty strong year for Ag overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the Jack talked about some business losses in truck and domestic intermodal.  Is that in the thought process, and what were those losses?  Can you talk a little bit about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll let Jack talk a little bit about the specifics here, but I will come back to we're not going to chase business with price.  And when you look at the domestic products out there, what's happening with truck capacity and freight rates on the trucking side, we've lost some business out there.  And again that may continue the rest of the year, but we are staying very focused on our price and our return requirements.  Jack do you want to provide any color there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed, I think Jim just summed it up.  We did lose a piece of business that we couldn't get to our reinvest ability threshold on it, and so it's not going to be on the UP next year.  But other than that we think the business environment is still very solid for Intermodal.  There's plenty of opportunity for us, and it won't be an issue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay separately, Rob; in one of your slides you talked about the OR impact from fuel in the fourth quarter, of 3.6 points.  If my math is correct that's 151 million or $0.36 could that really be the impact of the timing of the fuels surcharges in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's an easier comp Ed.  When you look at it year-over-year that's roughly the right math, but you have got to look at what happened last year, which was basically the complete opposite.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but I would think that you would see a large part of that invert as now the surcharges catch up in first quarter.  That should be a pretty good positive.  Am I thinking about that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is the way of course it works.  We are getting a stronger level of fuel surcharge, but you don't see it at the bottom line until actually fuel prices drop because Ed while fuel surcharge is higher as a result of that fourth quarter price, the fuel price itself is also higher, continues to be high. So you don't see the net benefit flow to the bottom line until such time as fuel prices will have dropped.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Ed, keep in mind, we're not recovering 100% with our legacy contracts and the things we have out here. We made good progress but we are still not at 100% fuel recovery.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Ed, as I said, we completed about 33 miles but we made major improvements also on our terminal. And if you remember part of the original plan was to balance the double tracking along with our terminal improvements in our infrastructure.  So in '07 we made good improvement in West Colton, Yuma, Tucson, El Paso, along with the 33 miles.  Now we're still sticking to the timeframe of 2010, 2011 first part.  We're going to do a substantial piece of grading this year so that we can look at the pace of construction and we'll be responsive accordingly.  But right now we're still sticking to our original plan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, good morning.  On your pre-announcement, I guess just maybe a month ago on December 19, it looked like you lowered the range to $1.70, $1.80 and here you are posting above it.  I just want to understand what happened in the last two weeks that surprised you on the upside just given that that volume seemed to have continued to come in weaker in those last two weeks?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Ken, Rob had mentioned our overall productivity and cost numbers came in a little bit better.  We did a little bit better on other income, real estate.  We had a small insurance settlement.  But I'll tell you, we were sitting, as I mentioned, in the end of November with our volume up 2.5% and quite honestly we were feeling very good about our guidance and within about a two week timeline that thing turned from volume up to just about flat.</p>
          <p>Now, we, and when you look at the numbers here, the real driver was fuel.  We had enough I think potential to deal with winter weather.  You have winter every year, and we had enough I think momentum to deal with the weather issues, but fuel really caught us.  So, I don't -- I understand we're only two weeks out, but just to give you some perspective on the volatility in this business on a two or three week time-line.  Rob, I mean you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's exactly right.  Again it was just a penny here, a penny there, but a big driver in terms of the delta that finished strong for us in the quarter was on the cost side.  I mean productivity came in strong, and as Jim mentioned, there are one or two items that came in a little earlier than we had anticipated.  The minor insurance settlement, a minor real estate transaction came in a couple of weeks earlier than planned, and you add it all up, it pushed us above that revised guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and if I could just delve into, Rob, on some of the commodities.  If we look at Auto, Chemicals, Intermodal, yields were stronger than some of the other commodity bases.  Is there -- were there more contract renewals or anything else we can highlight as to what would be driving that pricing if it's stronger than in some of the others?  And then while we're talking about that, can to stick on the coal side, did I catch that you said that you're going to either start exporting more PRB coal out of the West Coast, or have you already started to see that demand hit?  I'm just -- seems like that's a newer potential growth area for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Jack, why don't you take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Ken we did have a couple of legacy contracts in the Intermodal and Autos world that renewed last year that provided a little additional upside there for us, and actually Chemicals as well.  So, I think some of the legacy stuff gave us a leg up on some of those areas.  We are looking at West Coast exports.  We're looking at moving some coal right now out of Utah, moving it over to Long Beach and testing that and see how it works out.  Right now, it's not a big issue for us.  It's not a huge opportunity, but we have to be very careful and watch how the international markets play themselves out and how well that works for us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Of the 6% that renewed this year, is there any particular commodity group that you should see it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've got some coal business.  We've got some Autos business.  We've got some Intermodal business.  Those are really kind of the top three, and I think if you'll recall from some of our earlier presentations, those are the places where we have the greatest opportunity, in terms of legacy contracts.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One last, I guess technical question for Rob.  But on the other income, I think you threw out a 50 to $75 million number.  I'm just wondering why you would look for that to be down from the $100 million plus run rate you've had for the last three or four years.</p>

          <p>Morning, Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see.  I wanted to see if you could give a few thoughts on the pure price or effective price you'd expect to get in 2008.  I think Jack's comment implies you got about 6% that would have been effective price in fourth quarter.  And I'm wondering if that pace is reasonable to expect in '08.  And also, what kind of visibility you have in terms of carry through from '07 or contracts you've already signed up.  How much visibility do you already have to pricing in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, when you look out next year, core price that excludes fuel, we're looking in that 5 to 6% range.  There is two primary drivers there.  One, our legacy contracts as we've talked about.  Two, our service metrics continue to improve which brings some value.  We're seeing some direct connection there in terms of our ability to get some price for the value of the service. Wild card obviously could be volume and the economy where you could see a little bit of softness in some areas.  Overall, Jack, our &#x2013; right now when you look at probably what's locked in I think we're in that probably a little less than half, 40, 50% is what we've already really have on the books so far.  Jack, you want, did we miss anything there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sounds good to me.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And I guess the subtlety in the way you're looking at price.  Are you including, are you rebasing the fuel surcharge level moving that up, in your contracts that you re-sign?  And if you are doing that are you including that in the pure price or is it kind of a technical thing I just wondered how you, what you're doing with that.  And how you're viewing that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the re-basing of the fuel surcharge is not included in what we target ourselves for our core price improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you doing that though?  Are you taking the baseline level from 25 a barrel to 50 a barrel or something like that?  I know you do it in highway diesel but you know the equivalent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's pretty situational for the most part that's the direction we're going, Tom.  But we work with customers and we work on each individual contract and the competitive situations to determine how we lay out the fuel surcharge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On head count, you've had some very good traction in the quarter, and fourth quarter in head count reductions.  And I'm wondering how you look at that in '08, should we expect another two quarters of you know, call it 2.5, 3% reduction in average head count and then maybe that slows down in second half, or how would you look at the head count in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, we expect increasing productivity per employee this year.  You know Rob had mentioned, our non-operating force levels were lower, we have underway an initiative called, or looking at organizational effectiveness we continued to make some good progress this year really working through really, our overall cost base.  Again, part of this will be a function of volume next year. We should be able to absorb the volume with the current force count that's out here. But again, you'll see increased productivity.  I'm not going to give you a projection here right now, there's, we've got a lot of opportunity and I think you'll be pleased to see the results.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much was the non-operating change, and when did that take place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was about 250, 300 non-operating head count, and as Jim mentioned, Tom, we're very focused on, as you would expect, very focused on ensuring organizational efficiency and effectiveness and we touched about 250 to 300 non-operating jobs as part of that process and we'll continue that effort.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But was that, was that impact primarily starting in third quarter, or was it earlier than that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, it was about 3% of our non-operating force though.  I think the thing we've got to be careful on, we can cut headcounts.  In this business we know it's pretty easy to go out and cut jobs. What we've got to do is make certain we maintain enough surge capacity when business does come back strong that we can handle it efficiently and you take them out of the right places.  So, we're working very hard at taking a look at really every position in the company and ask ourselves the questions, what's the value, can we do it better? Can we basically eliminate the work in a lot of cases?  So, it's a, we've been working on this over a year on the organizational effectiveness piece and I'm really excited about some of the things that we see on the table for this year.</p>

          <p>Okay, I got just one last one, and I'll turn it over to someone else.  You talk about the IMC, or I guess it was truckload business in Intermodal where there was a contract that you lost. It was unclear to me whether that was a loss to your primary rail competitor, or whether it was just business that was converted back to truck.  And if it was a loss to a rail competitor, does that indicate any change in discipline on the margin, or is that really just a small thing that's noise?</p>

          <p>Overall, Tom, we lost the business.  I'm not exactly sure where the customer will decide to put that business.  Overall, it doesn't change my outlook on the opportunities that we have for pricing in the Intermodal world or for any of my other businesses.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen, and thank you for taking my questions.  The lag on the fuel surcharge, which you said in many cases is as much as two months.  Is there anything that can be done during contract renewals or perhaps outside the contract renewal cycle to perhaps shorten that up?  It seems like an extraordinarily long adjustment period, given the current volatility in fuel prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, we work with our customers in terms of their ability to process changes in the rate structures.  Some contracts do a bit better job, others are longer ones out here.  I'd keep in mind though it also works the same way when prices go down.  And while we took the pressure in fourth quarter, and the hit in the fourth quarter as prices moved.  Now, if prices are continually on an upward trend here for the foreseeable future then we're going to lag behind in the quarters.  But we look at it both ways and work with our customers.  You know, do what's best for both parties.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  One question on the construction up in the PRB, you indicated, I think Dennis did, that the fourth main line is now underway now that the third main line is completed.  Could you give us a little indication as to how long that project will take, and the impact that it might have on operational efficiency up in the PRB?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  John, well principally what we are addressing is the grade territory with the loads.  So, I can just tell you this, that the Powder River Basin, the efficiencies up there will not be impaired, nor will our loading capabilities as a result of the construction.  And it's going to be a phased approach that we're working with the BNSF on to time out, but rest assured it will not -- and we've seen that this year even with the construction of third main line will it impact our ability to load out the trains on a daily basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, hopefully the demand will take us to that point, where we will need to do that. But right now we are just addressing the first areas of critical need. It will probably follow the path of what we did with the third main line coming up Logan Hill with the loads to accommodate the grade territories and make sure that we have adequate ingress and egress capabilities to the south end of the mines there, so that's where are starting first and then we will go on from there.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  And then with regard to your '08 volume outlook, the plus 1 to the negative 1% range that you've outlined, I want to understand what the sensitivity is there. You talked about the six business that you serve and two of them being challenging; Autos and Industrials, I just try to understand it, the difference between negative 1% and plus 1% is that just the difference in those challenging businesses being more or less challenging or is it across the whole broad spectrum, maybe a little bit more color about where the sensitivities are to the economy or to your outlook by business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Jack had in his one slide, Energy and Ag are not highly impacted by the economy here so we think the demand there will be pretty strong going forward. In the middle where it is a little more of tossup we had Chemicals and Intermodal. In that one clearly--- we are not assuming a significant fall off in the economy.  We are assuming at the bottom end a pretty slow economy but not a major fall off there.  And then on the other side where it's a real question mark, is the timing of the Industrial Products and Autos.  It's not as much of a science as it might appear to be.  We obviously can do better with a little bit stronger economy.  You obviously -- if the economy really turns down, it's going to be worse than the minus 1%.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to talk a little bit about Intermodal and obviously your international customers, the Latin companies are also feeling the high impact of fuel prices on the cost side. Do you get the feeling that it is; is it getting tougher and tougher to renegotiate these contracts?  Do you think there's more push back from them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, John there's, no customer is ever going to thank you for a price increase and they are tough, tough negotiators.  Particularly the Intermodal guys who can offer a pretty big book of business out here.  My view though is when you look at the returns in that business, we've got to make significant progress. And we, as Jack mentioned, we've lost some business in Intermodal.  If I can't get the returns, we're going to have some challenges but I think when you really look at, if the service is there, it's the best value and the best option to have long term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you think that we're not here in a shift toward the Eastern ports because of that? Do you think that's a longer term issue or just because fuel prices are higher today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think overall John when you look at the Eastern port situation, if you just kind of step back and you look at 2007, the West Coast imports were down about 3.5%.  The East Coast imports were up about 7%.  That was a very unusual occurrence for us.  I think part of that might be attributable, and this is speculation to some extent on my part, but also some indication from customers is 2008 is an ILWU negotiation year and remember the last time, in 2002 I think it was that that contract got negotiated, there was a lot of port disruption on the West Coast so a lot of customers were very concerned.</p>
          <p>So I think they took 2007 as an opportunity to redistribute some of their business overall and prepare themselves so they're not got all their eggs in one basket as they look in 2008.  I do think, overall, the market international in 2007 was only up about 2%.  Our forecast for 2008 thinks the overall market is probably going to be more like 4 to 5% this year, so we'll see a little bit of a stronger market and hopefully if the ILWU contract negotiations go a lot smoother than the last time, we'll see some strength in that business this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Randy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jack, I wonder if you could talk about Blue Streak, how it's developing up, what the prospects are for '08 and then as well, one of the big issues for the container companies has been repositioning empties. I saw the LA statistics -- export numbers are going up quite dramatically, what opportunities is that creating for you and how do you see a better balance in terms of in versus out evolving and affecting your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all Randy, Blue Streak's and in particular, our Shreveport train with the NS is doing quite well. Customer receptivity is good. Operations have done an outstanding job of keeping that train on time and running and so we think there is some really nice growth opportunity for us in that market segment.</p>
          <p>In terms of the positioning and the empty containers and those kinds of things -- actually as we have renegotiated our legacy contracts on the international side, we have put provisions in there that require balance. And that has helped a lot in terms of the operating department and train operations and how we move equipment back and forth across the network. So we're seeing our balance improve considerably, certainly the fact that the import dollar -- that the US dollar is low right at the moment is kind of inspiring more or facilitating a lot more export business for us that improves that balance as well. It gives us greater efficiency and greater profitability. So it's kind of a win-win all the way around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question has to do with your Chemical business. I think you guys mentioned it was the one franchise that's had volume growth all through the year and obviously you've got it in your sort of neutral category. It would seem to me that fertilizers and potash and that kind of stuff would still be an area of fairly significant growth. Any reasons for your cautiousness that are sort of company-specific or facility-specific or is it just the economy that you're worried about in terms of that Chemical business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's entirely economy. In fact, we have a couple of new facilities coming online that should provide us some growth if the economy stays with it. The anomaly for us has been that our plastics business and liquid and dry has stayed relatively strong and they have tended to follow historically more the pattern of the automobile business and the construction, and they're bucking that trend. And again, part of that, I think, is the lower dollar, part of it is that our Chemical industry is more dependent upon natural gas than -- and their competition in the world markets are dependent on oil. And you've seen the humongous run-up in the oil prices, but natural gas prices have stayed relatively stable. So it's given them somewhat of a competitive advantage. But it's hard to guess if that's going to turn, and particularly if the economy were to nose-dive from where it is today. So that's really my caution there, is entirely on the economics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last question is just with reference to productivity, if we use GTM per employee as the metric, Jim, you kind of indicated that productivity would match with unit cost growth. So does that imply a 3% increase in GTMs per employee? I wanted to get some sense of leverage. If the volume starts to come back, does that mean we're looking at sort of 5% GTMs per employee? How should we think about this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Randy, I hope we do see good volumes coming back here. We'll see very nice leverage on the business. There's two things you look at. The simple measure is gross ton miles [GTM] per employee. The other measure we look at will be our operating ratio improvement and also our overall unit cost that we can drive. Dennis had mentioned earlier that we have put a strong focus, and he mentioned on building train size. That not only improves your productivity of the employees but it significantly improves the productivity of the assets in terms of locomotives. So we got upside on productivity if the volume moves up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But in terms of GTMs per employee, obviously if we've got flat volumes and you got unit costs up, should we still be thinking about 2 to 3% GTM per employee growth? And then if the volumes come back, even more leverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

But, I would assume based on one of the other analyst's questions that 4Q should actually be easier comps for you with what the weather did towards the end.

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is, the economy, and although you had mentioned first quarter I think also keep in mind February, you get the most snow in February in the US. But we are being cautious on the economy, it is hard to see visibility right now, we have had a heck of a swing even from four or five weeks ago till today, and while some of it was weather, we did see production shut down, we saw plants that extended their holidays and so we are being cautious there.</p>

          <p>Morning John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim as you talked about investment type credits, or bonus depreciation or something like that, given that your outlook for capital spending this year is flat with '07, if some of that legislation got passed, what kind of magnitude of change would you be looking at in your CapEx budget?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, overall the industry has said it could be maybe 15% plus. But again you have to look at the location of the projects, your ability to get the projects mobilized that are out here, we're &#x2013; and the returns, when you sit down to look at it, I have got a long list of capital projects that exceed what we spend but what we will do is work backwards to make certain what does it do to the return, and our assessment on the performance. So overall it could be up to 15%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and a lot of discussion about head count. If I go back and look at the downturn in '00 and '01, the whole rail sector got a little overzealous in terms of head count reduction, and a lot of the rails came out of that downturn and when volumes spiked, they really didn't have the manpower for at least a couple of quarters. How are you guarding against getting too aggressive on the head count?  Are you &#x2013; I can't remember, did you guys actually in '00 and '01 quit hiring people, or completely, and this time it's a matter of continuing to train people, but let attrition kind of work its way out a little bit more?  Just how are you balancing that to make sure you don't get caught shorthanded should volumes kind of materialize?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we not only didn't hire many in that timeline; we were offering buyouts. Those days are over, because as you know with UP, we learned a pretty hard lesson, and we remind ourselves of that every time we start talking about resources here.  I think the problem is even potentially greater because of the acceleration in attrition in our industry.</p>
          <p>We lost last year through attrition almost 4,000 employees.  We project again this year another 4,000 employees that will be leaving the industry.  We are being very disciplined in terms of how we look at our surge capacity. And quite honestly, as I said earlier, we've cut lot of jobs in this industry, and were famous for it over the years, but we have clear guidelines, analysis where we are keeping that surge capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And if I look at head count, and with the assumption that volumes are pretty flat in '08 with '07 levels, and therefore with head count on the operations side, let's assume it's flat, or maybe slightly down.  Even if it's flat, are we still going to see labor savings as a result of 4,000 employees going through the attrition process?  I would assume more of the longer standing, more expensive employees being back filled with &#x2013; I guess what I am asking is, could you see flat head count and still see labor savings without a necessary big jump in volumes and the productivity gains?  Can it just be pure cost reduction as a result of lower cost labor and those type things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you need to factor inflation into your numbers in terms of what you look at on here, but we will see &#x2013; I think we've got a very good &#x2013; a good opportunity in '08 in terms of continuing to show productivity beyond the operating areas.  But again, we want to be smart about it, but you'll see good productivity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then, lastly, just as you look at &#x2013; you made some comments on the regulatory and legislative agenda that's out there. In talking about when they may get back to focusing on the rails.  Are you concerned at all about '08 as being a big year for rail re-regulation or legislation or is the likelihood of the election takes that off the table in '08 and makes it more of an '09, 2010 issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I'm going to take it very seriously whether there's an election or not going on.  We're going to basically be in Washington telling our story about the need.  I think the CAPM example that came out of the STB is a good example where the STB listened to both parties and quite honestly they listened to the railroad industry in terms of some of the calculations.  So we're going to continue to be active.  You can't take your eye off this thing because of the potential.  When you get to the second half of the year and people are looking at the elections, you may see a little bit less focus but we're going to continue to be in front of them for a long time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how quickly do you think the rail industry makes a proposal on the replacement value discussion?  I think they put that on hold until you guys came back with a firmer kind of proposal.  How quickly do you think you present, the industry presents something to the STB that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think right now maybe first half, sometime of '08.  We want to -- it's very complicated.  There are a lot of different approaches out there.  We want to make certain we understand the long and short term implications but it clearly is, you know this industry, do the math, replacement costs on our capital investments are significant.  So we're going to make certain we think through it in detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, very good, thanks for your time.  Nice year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our last question comes from the line of Gary Chase with Lehman Brothers.  Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Gary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple quick ones for Rob and then one for Jack.  The first one is I presume that the 20 million in lost, or the 20 million weather impact in the fourth quarter is predominantly lost revenue.  Is there an assumption that you'll be able to recapture some of that moving into the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right, the bulk of that is lost revenue and as Jim indicated earlier, maybe a little bit in grain business but not a significant proportion of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The majority of it was in our Energy business, coal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if our calculations are accurate it looks like, based on where we are right now in the energy markets you would have a modest amount of tailwind from the timing lag on the surcharges in the first quarter.  Is that -- are we looking at that the right way, about $0.10 versus a 0.20, $0.25 headwind in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now I would say no.  We're paying about, we're paying the spot is around 2.68-ish level still.  So with that kind of price there is no tailwind.  We would have to see prices moderate here and rather quickly to get the benefit in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The surcharges are pretty close on those areas to recovering the costs.  Although, keep in mind again, we don't recover 100% of fuel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right.  And then for Jack, actually on that topic.  Of the 6% of these contracts, the legacy contracts that are rolling during the course of '08, can you give this a little bit of flavor for how many of those have fuel recovery mechanisms embedded within them?  So, in other words, on the 6%, how much of that do we need to bring up, not just for core pricing which has obviously changed a lot, but also for fuel recovery versus just core pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Gary, that's a real test.  One for sure had a fuel surcharge mechanism in it, and I'm just trying to think, the other ones I don't -- well there's another one that did have some fuel recovery.  Some of them had RCAF kinds of increases, which isn't really a full fuel surcharge recovery.  But I think you are probably looking at 30 or 40% of it had some form of fuel surcharge in them already and 60% of them did not.  That's just kind of off the top of my head guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, because that's clearly going to make a big difference.  And then, just lastly for you Jack, you said there was a lot of mix impact in the Industrial business, and that masked some of the true pricing progress that you'd made.  I'm just curious for some flavor on what that true progress actually was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the Industrial Products world came a lot closer to my average price increase for the business than what their actual results would reflect because of the mix impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lumber versus stone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lumber versus rock. The average revenue per unit on a lumber move is much higher, again length of hauls can be part of the issue, than on a stone move which is much lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And we should think of that as core right?  I mean, not in other words -- you said 6 was about your core price change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
