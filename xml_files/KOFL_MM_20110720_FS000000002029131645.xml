        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During the second quarter of 2011, our portfolio of franchise territories across Latin America delivered strong results, achieving double-digit top and bottom line growth.</p>
          <p>The main drivers of our performance for the quarter was volume growth generated by our operations in Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, and our pricing initiatives implemented in our multi-category portfolio approach over the past several months across all of our territories.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, our consolidated revenues reached more than MXN28 billion, up 13% from the second quarter of 2010. On a currency-neutral basis, our consolidated total revenues grew 14% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, our consolidated sales volume grew 5%, mainly driven mainly by the popularity of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 4% supported by strong volumes recorded in Mexico, Colombia, Central America and Argentina, and the double-digit volume growth of our still beverage portfolio. This volume growth primarily resulted from the Jugos del Valle line of products in Mexico and Brazil, coupled with the strong performance of Nestea and Powerade in Mexico and Cepita in Argentina.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated gross profit increased 12%. Cost of goods sold grew mainly as a result of higher PET resin and sweetener cost across our territories. This increase was partially offset by the appreciation of our main operations local currencies as applied to our U.S. dollar denominated raw material costs. Consequently, our consolidated gross margin declined 30 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated operating income improved 12%, reaching MXN4.6 billion in the second quarter, supported by double-digit operating income growth achieved in our Mexico and Mercosur divisions.</p>
          <p>Operating leverage achieved through higher revenues allow us to compensate for gross margin pressures and higher labor cost recorded in the Venezuela and Mercosur, as well as higher freight costs in Argentina.</p>
          <p>As a result, our consolidated operating margins remained flat at 16.2%. On a currency-neutral basis, our consolidated operating income grew approximately 13%. Our consolidated EBITDA increased by 14% to MXN5.7 billion in the second quarter. And our net controlling interest income reached MXN2.6 billion, an increase of 6%.</p>
          <p>Now let me expand on the performance of our operations. Our Mexican operations delivered double-digit topline growth in the second quarter of 2011, successfully building on the solid results imposed in the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, the sparkling beverage category significantly contribute to our incremental volumes, mainly driven by the 7% volume growth of brand Coca-Cola in most of our presentations, combined with 5% volume growth in flavored sparkling beverages.</p>
          <p>Our still beverage category posted mid-single-digit volume growth, supported by the Jugos del Valle line of products, as well as the performance of Nestea and Powerade. Additionally, the volumes from our water portfolio, including bulk water, grew 7%, supported by double-digit volume growth in our personal package offerings.</p>
          <p>Thanks to our greater focus on designing tailored portfolio alternatives that targeted a differentiated base of consumers, we saw volume growth amongst all of our sales channels during the quarter. Our average price per unit case increased 3.9% in the second quarter. This increase was mainly driven by the selective price increases we have implemented over the past several months, specifically in our sparkling and still beverage portfolio in the quarter and also by higher volumes of brand Coca-Cola which carries a higher average price per unit case. As a result of our increased volumes and prices, our Mexican operations total revenue grew 11%, reaching MXN11.8 billion.</p>
          <p>With regard to our profitability, higher PET resin costs were offset by the appreciation of Mexican peso, as applied to our U.S. dollar denominated raw material costs, coupled with a more favorable sweetener cost environment. Compared with the second quarter of 2010, our gross profit increased by 11% to MXN5.9 billion and our gross margin improved 20 basis points reaching 49.7%.</p>
          <p>Our operating income grew 19% to MXN2.3 billion. Operating leverage achieved through higher revenues combined with tightly controlled operating expenses and more efficient marketing and branding initiatives allow us to expand our operating margin by 130 basis points to 19.7%. The profitability we obtained at the operating level translated into EBITDA growth of 16% to MXN2.8 billion compared with the same quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>In summary, our Mexico division successfully continue on its path of growth, delivering solid results.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we experienced growth in our single-serve portfolio, which may imply a more tangible economic recovery for our consumers. We believe we have undertaken the right initiatives in the marketplace over the past year to provide our wide multi-category portfolio approach on certain patrons to a broader base of consumers. To this end, we invested significant resources across our Mexico region to enhance our execution at the point-of-sale, also our turnover base. We improved our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (08:21) and enhanced our growing still beverage platform and support our flavored and sparkling beverage category.</p>
          <p>Thanks to our implementation of these initiatives and our greater focus on addressing our consumers need through our refined segmentation strategies, our portfolio continues to gain market share across most of our beverage categories. Despite the important brand recognition we have enjoyed over the years, we constantly challenge ourselves to stay ahead of the curve, to reinforce our position of the forefront of those categories in which we lead and to improve our position in those categories in which we do not. Clear examples of these efforts are Nestea and Powerade, brands <mark type="indiscernible" /> (09:15) and supported over the years together with our Coca-Cola Company.</p>
          <p>In the case of Nestea, it now enjoys a new position across our Mexican territories. With respect to following our isotonic brand, we work to better understand the drivers of the category, to further develop it and to achieve a higher market position. As a result, during the year, we continue to gain market share.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn our attention to our Latincentro division. Our Latincentro division recorded 3% volume growth in the second quarter. This increase was driven by the strong performance of our Colombian and Central American franchise territories, which recorded 10% and 8% volume growth, respectively, and compensated for a 9% volume decline in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>In Colombia, our volume grew 10% during the quarter, mainly driven by the strong performance of brand Coca-Cola in multi-serve presentations. After the severe weather conditions that prevailed over the past 12 months, we have seen agile recovery of our volumes in these franchise territories.</p>
          <p>In Venezuela, our volume decreased 9%, primarily resulting from lower sparkling beverage volume. During the year, we have observed a more cautious consumer spending environment, mainly driven by increased consumer goods and services prices. Additionally, over the past three months, we have experienced adverse weather conditions that further affected consumption. However, our operators continue to evaluate strategies to address our consumers' needs, providing more affordable packaging alternatives and implementing innovative options in the still beverage category to foster consumption.</p>
          <p>Our Central American operations, sales volume grew significantly. This growth was mainly driven by brand Coca-Cola in both single and multi-serve presentations across our franchise territories and our still beverage portfolio in Nicaragua, which was fueled by the Jugos del Valle line of products.</p>
          <p>Our Latincentro division's total revenues grew 11% to MXN8.2 billion. This increase primarily resulted from the volume growth in our Colombian and Central American franchises and the implementation of selective price increases in Venezuela over the past 12 months. On a currency-neutral basis, our Latincentro division's total revenues grew 15%.</p>
          <p>With regard to our profitability, our Latincentro division gross profit grew 10% to MXN3.8 billion. Higher PET and sweetener costs across the division were partially offset by the effect of the appreciation of the Colombian pesos as applied to our U.S. dollar denominated raw material costs. Compared with the second quarter of 2010, our gross margin declined 60 basis points to 49.9%.</p>
          <p>Our operating profit declined 1% to MXN1.2 billion. Operating levers achieved through higher revenues was offset by higher labor cost in Venezuela. These resulted in an operating margin decline of 180 basis points to 14.9%.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA in Latincentro grew 4% to MXN1.6 billion compared with the second quarter of 2010. Depreciation and amortization expenses in the region grew mainly as a result of our continued investment in the marketplace to increase our <mark type="ph" /> cooling (13:44) products and reinforce our turnover base.</p>
          <p>In summary, our Latincentro region delivered positive results for the quarter, the strong performance of our portfolio beverages across our Colombia and Central American franchise territories compensated for a high single-digit volume decline in Venezuela, and they are scoring the benefits of our geographically balanced portfolio.</p>
          <p>However, we continue to face several challenges in the region, from an increased competitive environment in Colombia to the continued higher labor cost in Venezuela. As previously noted, our operators remain focused on adapting our business to these conditions and to minimizing their impact on our profitability.</p>
          <p>For example, in Colombia, we are analyzing different strategies from reinforcing our turnover base to increasing the availability of more affordable products to developing alternatives that will attract consumers who are normally accustomed to drink tap water and home-made fruit beverages.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about our Mercosur division. In the second quarter of 2011, our Mercosur division's total revenues grew 18% to MXN8.4 billion. Excluding beer, which accounted for MXN850 million, our total revenues reached MXN7.6 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, our Mercosur division's revenues grew 16%. Volume growth in our Mercosur division was up 4% in the second quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Our Brazilian operations volumes rose 2%, successfully building on the significant volume growth we recorded in the second quarter of 2010. This growth was mainly driven by the strong performance of our still beverage products, which grew close to 30% supported by the Jugos del Valle line of beverages, the Matte Leao tea portfolio empowering our isotonic drink.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, our volumes grew 9% in the second quarter of 2011. The solid performance of our sparkling beverage portfolio was mainly driven by brand Coca-Cola in multi-serve presentations, and Aquarius, our flavored sparkling beverage product. The still beverage category in the quarter considerable growth mainly due to the strong performance of Cepita, our juice brand, and the novelty product we introduced over the past several months, including Hi-C, the juice brand and Jugo, our new juice dairy product.</p>
          <p>With regard to our profitability, our Mercosur division's gross profit increased 17% to MXN3.5 billion. The increased cost of high-fructose continued in Argentina. And PET resin across the region was partially offset by the appreciation of the Brazilian real as applied to our U.S. dollar denominated raw material cost. Our gross margin decreased 40 basis points to 41% for the second quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Our operating income grew 18% to MXN1.1 billion. Operating leverage achieved through higher revenues across the division and more target marketing investment compensated for gross margin pressures and higher labor cost through our transaction reports. As a result, operating margin remained flat at 12.5% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA grew 25% to MXN1.3 billion. Depreciation and amortization expenses in the region grew mainly as a result of the increased production capacity which was installed in Brazil over the past several months, and now we're continuing investment in the marketplace to increase our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:07) and reinforce our internal growth across the region.</p>
          <p>In summary, our Mercosur division delivered positive results in the second quarter of 2011. In Brazil, our bulk &#x2013; still beverage platform continues to perform strongly, especially the Jugos del Valle line of products.</p>
          <p>Consumer preference for these brands of beverages is driving higher demand. Moreover, our strategy of increasing the availability of internal presentations for brand Coca-Cola for what &#x2013; for our consumer has proven successful.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we extended, due to terminal offerings, to the Coca-Cola Ciel and Fanta brands. Furthermore, the Schweppes sparkling beverage lines have gained marked popularity among adult consumers, providing important incremental volume growth in the flavored sparkling beverage category.</p>
          <p>Our prospects for future growth in Brazil remain positive despite the recent slowdown in consumption we have seen due to higher interest rate implemented by the government to moderate inflation growth.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, we continue to reinforce our efforts to broaden our growth portfolio, focusing on developing new products and categories and leveraging prevailing consumer momentum in the country. To target different consumption occasions during the quarter, we launched an orange strawberry under the Hi-C brand with outstanding results. And over the past several months, we started to participate in the juice dairy segment in Argentina with Jugo, our dairy juice brand.</p>
          <p>Going forward, in our Mercosur division, we see ample opportunities to continue developing our portfolio to address our consumers' questions and future e-mails.</p>
          <p>Now let me walk you through our financial performance for the quarter. In the second quarter, our operations produced strong results, delivering double-digit top and bottom line growth. Despite increased volatility, we have experienced in some of our key raw materials, particularly PET resin, our operators have adapted our business to those conditions, and sustained our company's profitability.</p>
          <p>As of June 30, 2011, we had a cash balance of MXN16.7 billion, an increase of MXN4.2 billion, compared with year-end 2010. This increase was mainly the result of the debt we issue and the cash we generated in the first half of 2011. Net of the dividend payment we made in April in the amount of MXN4.4 billion.</p>
          <p>As of June 30, 2011, our net debt to EBITDA coverage ratio was 0.2 times and our EBITDA to net interest coverage ratio was more than 16 times.</p>
          <p>As we know, at the end of last month, we announced the merger agreement with company shareholders, Grupo Tampico, to integrate their beverage division into Coca-Cola FEMSA. Grupo Tampico beverage division is the fifth largest Coca-Cola bottler in Mexico with operations in the Northeast part of the country. This franchise, the oldest in the Mexican Coca-Cola bottling system, is expected to sell 154 million unit cases of beverages during this year.</p>
          <p>This transaction is subject to the completion of a confirmatory legal, financial and operating due diligence process on which we are advancing as planned. We expect to successfully close this merger agreement during September and start consolidating Grupo Tampico's beverage division results into Coca-Cola FEMSA as on the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>As we have emphasized in the past, we will remain committed to pursuing opportunities in the beverage industry that will maximize our shareholder value. This transaction exemplifies that commitment.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, our operations delivered positive results for the quarter. We believe that our geographically diversified sources of cash flow generation will present a competitive advantage that will allow us to continue investing in our industry future growth and enhance our leadership position within our market. We are proud to manage a wide and wonderful portfolio branch in one of the best markets in the beverage industry.</p>
          <p>As we enter the second half of the year, together with our partner, The Coca-Cola Company, we will celebrate the 125th anniversary of brand Coca-Cola.</p>
          <p>As we commemorate this event, we feel even stronger and more enthusiastic about our merger with Grupo Tampico's Beverage division. We are confident that our combined operating capabilities to manage our business under challenging conditions will enable us to continue outperforming our industry and delivering increased value for all of our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your continued trust and support. And now, I would like to open the call for any questions that you may have.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from the line of Lauren Torres from HSBC. Please proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Hector. My question is on commodity costs. We're obviously hearing from a number of beverage companies already this earnings season that certain costs are trending a bit higher than initially expected. In your second quarter, we did see some gross margin contraction, but you were able to actually keep operating margin flat.</p>
          <p>So just curious, somewhat a short-term question or short-sighted question, but as we think about the second half of the year, do you expect continued pressure on the gross margin line? But with that said, do you think there still are offsets, meaning that maybe you could take more pricing or there's other savings flowing through that will help you to keep your operating margin flatter or maybe even grow for the year? Just how do you generally think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Lauren. I think that in order to appropriately answer that question, we have &#x2013; even though commodity prices are kind of &#x2013; although with international pricing, which have different environments within the different countries, sometimes because tariff, regulations, et cetera. Let me start with Mexico, and then, I'll give you a general sense of &#x2013; on the trends that we are seeing for the second half.</p>
          <p>Mexico, I see more stable sweetener cost, and these numbers are already the same with some countries like Venezuela where we have a lot of scarcity and frictions in importing some of these drugs. So Venezuela we see still some pressure on fuel prices. Brazil, as you know, which is a very large market for us, it's totally following what the international prices are in that point. Mexico, with higher taxes than Brazil, but actually stable prices, and therefore, not much pressure in general.</p>
          <p>In all of the different countries, it is really the big question because we have received a lot of pressure in increases in prices of resin in dollar terms, but then here is the pretty part of your question is depending on how the foreign exchange, the sales in each country going forward, that's the extent of the suffering that will follow in Q2.</p>
          <p>Let me give you an example. If we use for this quarter, just for this quarter, on a consolidated basis, PET prices have grown in general &#x2013; in dollar terms, even try to stay with normalized exchange rates, PET prices will have impacted our numbers somewhere around $14 million to $15 million, but approximately half of that effect was offset because the Mexican peso per share versus last year <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:32) when we compared that versus last year and the same with the Colombian peso.</p>
          <p>So it's a long answer, but my perspective for the second quarter is that we continue to have some pressure on dollar terms on PET, and the exchange rate would play an important role there. Second, fuel prices, I don't see &#x2013; I see stability in that market &#x2013; on those prices in the second half. And I think that it is very important that we continue focus on improving the operating expenses line that we have commented with you for many quarters now that have been the focus of &#x2013; a lot of attention on Coca-Cola FEMSA in the last two or three quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could just follow up on that then, as far as offsets are concerned, is your pricing plans, or are your pricing plans are more or less in place or there's further opportunities do you think in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In general, you are right that was an important element here also. In general, we continue &#x2013; we have &#x2013; at least we should have increases with inflation in lots of our territories. There has been some examples where we advance for inflation in some occasions. There have been some examples, where for example in Mexico this quarter, with the growth of brand Coca-Cola, with the growth of single-serves, we have a positive effect of the mix, that's happened also in Argentina where we saw an important price increase mainly related to mix.</p>
          <p>But in general, I'll see that most of our pricing plans are in place. The only question mark we have here, Lauren, is Venezuela. I don't know if anyone is aware, but yesterday there was a new regulation passed that in theory would focus in trying to I guess exercise some price control in the industry, in general, in the country, and commerce. It's not clear still the extent of that or which products will enter or with which degree of control. But Venezuela is always a question mark in that front. But in general, the rest of the other eight countries worked very well in our plans with respect to price.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hi, H&#xE9;ctor, congratulations, good quarter. My question has to do with Mercosur, the volume have been kind of weak in Brazil in the first half, I think 2.5 growth. And we're seeing, as you mentioned, pricing, pretty strong pricing across the board, couple of questions there, what's the outlook that you see in terms of volumes, particularly in Brazil as you get tougher comps in the second half?</p>
          <p>And if you could comment on the market shares, not only in Brazil but across the region, the Coca-Cola Company mentioned that the Coke system has been gaining market share, particularly in Mexico and Brazil. Any color that you can give us on market share would be appreciated?</p>
          <p>And finally just any comment that you can give on the announcement of Pepsi and consolidating its bottler in Mexico into a single operations with the JV of Polar and GEUSA? So those would be the three questions. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alan. Good morning. Let me start with Brazil. I think that in general, Brazil &#x2013; I see that &#x2013; you are right in pointing out that the comps versus last year are greater. If I remember correctly last year, the second quarter, we grew around 13%, then we have a third quarter that also grew double-digit and a fourth quarter that was in the single-digit range, but that's an important growth.</p>
          <p>So the comparison is tough, but still my feeling is not &#x2013; following in this environment. I think that we have during this scene of the movie, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, no? The good part of Brazil is that the macro economic environment and all the indications you see there are very, very positive. We had a tremendous chunk of the population moving from lower socioeconomic levels to the middle or low-middle class segments, and that only brings a lot of consumers with more disposable income in their pockets. I think that's very good news. I think that the amount of some estimates that we have is that, in the last 10 years, we've had around 60 million people moving from very low socio-economic levels to more interesting level, closer to middle class. I think everybody is &#x2013; as a country, at the end of the day...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These are very large numbers, so I think that's the good part of the story. The bad part is in the view that that also has created a lot of, I guess, activity in the country that have pushed inflation importantly. The government is trying to control inflation. They can increase rate importantly. They can stitch a lot of &#x2013; all those hearing in the economy in a sense. And you have a consumer that sells more &#x2013; a lot of resources for buying a car or buying a TV or buying a electromagnetic equipment or whatever. And part of the discretion that the government is putting in relation to high interest rate, it's a tougher restriction on limits on what they have to pay on credit cards and all of that, that we believe that is causing our consumer to dedicate part of those resources to repay these loans and not so much to our products.</p>
          <p>I guess, and I don't have information here, and I don't have comparisons, but I think that this is more of a general trend for consumer good companies in Mexico, and we'll like to see how the reports later on.</p>
          <p>The ugly part of the picture is that when we start speaking about &#x2013; the environment continue with these social programs and then looking for taxes. And as we here, the first part of the quarter &#x2013; with tougher upgrades, tax increase in our industry, that basically we have to increase prices to the consumer around 4%, 5% basically to stay neutral for us now in terms of the taxes of royalties.</p>
          <p>So in general that's the comment that I wanted to make. We feel positive in the future in Brazil. There might be some weather-related problems that we face in the past. But we feel positive about the growth prospects and a bit cautious with this consumer sentiment about how they are sharing their investments, and obviously with the tax situation in the country.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, turning to the announcement of Pepsi-Cola, Polar and GEUSA, I think they're &#x2013; it's very interesting and clever move. We compete with Polar in Venezuela. It's a very tough competitor; GEUSA is very tough in the territories; we fight with them in the street. And I think that is an interesting move for Pepsi. I think that we will have a combination of two operators in the Pepsi system now combined here in Mexico for the full country, no? I think now, if I missed one question from you, I'm sorry.

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thank you. Good morning, everybody, and congratulations on the quarter, Hector. My question had to do with package mix, and I was wondering if you could remind us little bit of your returnable, non-returnable mix in the major markets. And if you could give us a sense of how much of the incremental volumes came from returnable packaging? And when you look at maybe some of the mitigation strategies when it comes to PET in addition to maybe returnables? What can you do in terms of, I don't know, greater use of recycled PET or further light-weighting of packages and caps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard to kind of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:37) questions. Obviously innovation on light-weighting and all the way from the PET bottles and caps and labels and other parts, it's always top of mind in our think and people. Obviously, working very closely and sometimes and say, from our commercial point of view or from a financial point of view of a company, basically slow because it has to go through a lot of approvals in terms of the quality control, but obviously it's very important that we support those initiatives to be sure that we don't have any quality issues with respect to the carbonation of the products and all of that.</p>
          <p>And the other element which has been very important and we have said that for many quarters also it's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:34) issue. We have in no less than general, if I remember correct, our sales should be around 17% of the mix is returnable. Mexico, certainly it was more than that, it's closer to 30%, 31%, and in both cases, increasing. Brazil, there are still &#x2013; a big portion of the volume that was &#x2013; the growth and volume that we know for the last 12 months, what's coming from the push for returnability.</p>
          <p>And then also as we maintain higher prices of our product compared to our competitors, having an affordable returnable product not only works from the point of view of isolating the effects of PET increases, but also from the point of view of competing without having to adjust our pricing of our growth. In other words, put it on a returnable growth rate close to the prices of the one-way approach of our competitors.</p>
          <p>In fact, it was &#x2013; the strategy in Brazil has been so successful that we are now doing returnable Coca-Cola, Ciel and Fanta which honestly sometimes in the flavor categories we didn't have as strong brand presence as brand Coca-Cola. It's a little tougher and riskier to moving to returnable flavor drinks because already embedded in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:12) is large. Then we feel confident that because of the success that we have seen in Brazil for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:20), then we can increase that 17% with regards in all the mid-20s in return. But it helps us mitigating the effect of PET and also on the competitive front and on the pricing front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, H&#xE9;ctor, just with respect to recycling several years ago, I think it was you and the Coca-Cola Company established a fairly important recycling facility in Mexico. And I was curious if that's a dimension that could help ease some of the pressures as well or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you are right. There was a &#x2013; yes, we have a very important recycling center near Mexico City. It's a partnership between the Coca-Cola Company and the &#x2013; which is one of the suppliers the major partner we have for PET 1 is in our operations and conference.</p>
          <p>That facility is every day a little bit more efficient. It started for two or three years in a learning curve where we were basically having recycled PET that was not very competitive with the new PET, but now it's very good for us because we are using recyclable and correctly <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:42) I believe we are allowed to use about 25% to 30% of every bottle. We can use the recycled PET which that index has been increased from 5%, 10% a few years ago. So it's an important source for us of savings in the PET front.</p>
          <p>That plant has been &#x2013; it is an important basement for the volume in terms of efficiency on &#x2013; and as a matter of fact, The Coca-Cola Company is looking at replicating some of that, something similar to that in all their bottles around the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And then, H&#xE9;ctor, just we're backing out that about a third of the incremental volumes is coming from returnable packaging. I wasn't sure if we're in the ballpark or not. And then, if you could just touch on the relative cost of recycled PET versus virgin resin, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me give you the figures that I have in the top of my mind right now. Around half of the additional volume in Mexico is coming from returnable products of additional volume. And the rest is coming from obviously <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:06). But it's an important element here in our strategy. I don't remember exactly that numbers for the rest of the countries report, but then we have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:28) we do it without question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, just lastly on the cost savings with the use of recycled PET, is it significant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, it's very little but it's important as a source of having an additional supplier and not relying on the few halves of the resin produced. It's very little but it's improving. And we will start, as I said at the beginning, with a higher cost than the virgin PETs at the very beginning. But as we have improved that efficiency and the knowledge of that, and so that we are slightly below the cost of PET.</p>
          <p>But one issue that we should not lose sight here, Bob, is for us, very importantly, in addition to the replication of our sourcing of PET is the sustainability issue. I think that if we having had that plant in Mexico for many years now, we probably would have had some either taxes or some extra cost in our cost structure because of issues production and stability.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, H&#xE9;ctor. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask first on Mexico. I mean, year-to-date you've seen a very strong growth both in terms of topline, as well as in terms of operating profit. And I think you've emphasized that the adjustments in your commercial strategy have been a quite important in driving these topline and EBIT growth.</p>
          <p>But I wanted to ask you if you think that looking more into 2012, more with a &#x2013; probably a multi-year horizon, do you think some of these growth will carry over into the next years? And are you now more bullish with respect to in the longer term, maybe topline and EBIT equation for Mexico? Do you think this is an impact that will be mostly concentrated in this particular year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that in general in general, we feel very confident that the commercial model that we have implemented has helped us to take footprints in Mexico operations to be ahead of the goal and going to the next level which is where we are now. I think that these changes are here to stay. But one issue that is very important is with a the number of SKUs that we are selling and number of category where we are now serving, it's impossible to serve the market. We don't have these commercial models in place. The big investment that we have done in technology within the information systems and training our people and then changing compensation by also our sales force it's just an adjustment that is necessarily when you handle such a large portfolio approach.</p>
          <p>And so first of all that's a very important element and second point in the future I think that because of that, those changes that we have implemented in our commercial practices, I think that that will carry over to other year so I'm going to be more bullish on the future of the topline growth. With respect to the bottom line of the P&amp;L, I think that will increase that additional volume and the growth that we are experiencing would trickle down to the bottom of the P&amp;L. All of this is subject to FX cost and some of raw materials, sweetener, and variables. I think I feel more confident now for the products growth from the last three or four quarters that a lot of our operating expenses are much more under control and on a more stable basis that would help us also to continue with this trend of increasing the bottom line of our P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And that's very helpful. And secondly if I may, in your prepared remarks you mentioned the market share gain that you're seeing in Powerade. And I think that even anecdotally we're seeing a lot more advertising and marketing for the brand across the region. So I just wanted to see if you can give us some more color on what have you changed in the brand that you think was necessary to see these better results? And maybe if you can share with us a little bit what's the outlook that you expect for the evolution of these brands in the next two or three quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that things that have &#x2013; Powerade is &#x2013; let me start by saying that Powerade is an important alternative because we are still behind, very far behind our main competitor, which is Gatorade. I think that we have gained importance in market share from basically what we are in present. We have market shares closer to 30% in Mexico, which is very, very important and again as I have said in the past, especially when you see that our competitor drives a lot of the profitability from that product.</p>
          <p>The homework we have in Powerade is &#x2013; and is related to your question, we have invested heavily in innovation and the formulation. And you have seen the advertisement with these ions that are included in the formula that is really, fancy weather, induce and then as a sport drink, and very importantly, the investment behind <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:54) which is &#x2013; which we didn't have before.</p>
          <p>So to be very honest, our formula was not top notch a few years ago. We invested &#x2013; after the introduction of Jugos del Valle <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:10) facilities, we have continued to invest in lines within our facilities. We continue to invest in those lines, because already use all &#x2013; it is also useful to reduce pull on there, and I think that has been a key element in carrying a formula that is &#x2013; that can be comparative versus other.</p>
          <p>And the homework going forward is that also to help foster this volume growth is a lot of marketing activity behind this and you see a lot of the sponsoring of sports from especially World Cup and things like that. So to have probably a case with our team, a very important topline growth and a good pricing because we have stopped discounting our sort of competitor and we have a better formula but we feel spending big bucks on marketing and the bottom line of Powerade when you look at that alone, it's good, but it's not as good as we would like to see it.</p>
          <p>I think that we still have to benefit going forward or in the future of a better margin on those products, as we start having a little better pricing and less marketing expenditures and promotional activity.</p>

          <p>And that's part of the thing that happened when you are successful and you have a new talented team of professionals. We feel that we have very strong bench inside. We actually have &#x2013; because these have been very recently was basically as we announced Wednesday or Thursday of last week. We are having internal meetings tomorrow. We have a board meeting a couple of days ago, where the organization was basically approved.

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the packaging question from before, and then ask a separate one. But the returnability in Brazil, we understand from &#x2013; that one of the major competitors is starting with little dep&#xF3;sitos in some of the supermarkets to help drive the concept to returnability even in supermarkets. Can you update us on where you are in that process? Are you part of that development, or are you thinking of doing that as well? And I'm thinking of course of the success that you had in Argentina with that? So if you could address that please.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Celso. I know that most of our efforts it's in the traditional channel, and I'm not aware there's an specific foods for supermarkets. Let me take in that specific question, but it didn't come yet back to me, but most of our efforts have been in the so called <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:33), the traditional channel, not where usually we use a lot with the return. It also serves a lot as a differentiator between supermarkets and the traditional channels as we have presentation that is very well dedicated for traditional channel. But let me tell you that our operators over there and then answer to you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. And then, if I could just ask, with respect to Mexico, I think we're all fairly impressed by the success of results there, and touching on some of the questions from before, the commercial model that's been rolled out seems to have played a big part of that. Can you update us and remind us of the status of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:20) model in the different countries, kind of where is it now fully rolled out versus just beginning or if it hasn't started yet when it might start country by country, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In general, we did &#x2013; it might sound strange but we did a big push in Brazil and we did basically like a big bang and move to 100% of our sale in Brazil, so Brazil is 100%.</p>
          <p>Mexico is &#x2013; and here around three quarters, so we still need to roll out part of the Mexican there &#x2013; even though a lot of the initial thought process and development of this model was probably in Mexico, so we are still areas to cover Mexico.</p>
          <p>Market like Colombia, we are around 25%, so we still need &#x2013; looking forward to do that. We have to do also with the speed up of that process even though some of these have been successful in the market we don't implement. We have to go in a lot of the training that is needed, adapting and changing the compensation scheme for sellers, which is obviously a process that is tough because you have to negotiate with unions.</p>
          <p>And also growth climbing high with the implementation of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:51) and as reported &#x2013; recall, we have experienced that a lot of the platform that we have with SAP few years ago, we received a &#x2013; couple of years ago we received a news SAP that system was not going to be maintained in the future and we needed to change to the new version of SAP. So this &#x2013; at a phase where trying with a little bit with a process of rolling over to move our SAP system in our operations. That's why it's something that you &#x2013; that is difficult to just do a big bang as we did in Brazil. But that's more or less the status of where we are.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. H&#xE9;ctor, can you please expand on the Powerade comments you made to my colleague, Antonio Gonz&#xE1;lez? You said that you see room for improvement in marketing of Powerade. What do you think can be better for Powerade to take more share or there's price gaps that you think need to be close there? And, obviously, Gatorade is very important for the profitability of the Pepsi system here in Mexico, you mentioned, but what is Powerade's profitability look like for you, is it higher, is it equally, is it lower than brand Coke? how do you see that improving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Carlos. Right now, if we look at the profitability of brand Powerade, it's much lower than brand Coca-Cola, especially as I mentioned because of the high marketing expenses that we have been investing.</p>
          <p>We believe that it's important that we continue to invest those marketing costs on the brand until we get a better market position. But just to give you an idea, during some quarters, imagine when we have the World Cup, marketing expense, including all the expenses related to the World Cup and the share that we have to pay here in Mexico from that.</p>
          <p>We're closer to around 55% to 60% of revenues, when usually we go 2%, 3%, 4%. So just to give you a sense of the high marketing investment that has been behind the brand. There is an important brand that is well known. We have already different bottles in Mexico and the Coca-Cola company and this is one cloud that is under this 50-50 modern umbrella, to where it will go for the company.</p>
          <p>But I think that little by little as we grow volume, obviously that number looks very impressive, because the topline was &#x2013; we don't need to grow the topline at the end of the day. This is no longer an issue of the denominator but also the numerator. But my objective at some point in time is to reach a similar level to brand Coca-Cola. But we are not there yet with that.</p>
