          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Inditex Conference Call for the Fiscal Year 2009 Results. The presentation will be chaired by Mr. Pablo Isla, Inditex's Deputy Chairman and CEO. The presentation will be followed by a Q&amp;A session comprising two parts. The first part will be dedicated to questions received on the telephone and the second part to the questions received through the webcast platform.</p>
          <p>Mr. Isla, you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex results for fiscal 2009. I am Pablo Isla, Deputy Chairman and CEO; and here with me are Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, CFO; and Marcos L&#xF3;pez, Capital Markets Director.</p>
          <p>The results for fiscal 2009 showed that Inditex continues its ongoing international multiconcept growth. Sales in local currencies increased 9%, demonstrating the global reach of our business model.</p>
          <p>Let me highlight that 2009 has also been a year of increased efficiency and tight operating control. As a result we have generated a strong cash flow which we have dedicated mainly to the expansion of the business. Additionally, shareholder remuneration will increase 14%.</p>
          <p>As you can see in this slide, our results for fiscal 2009 continue to show growth in all the key lines of our profit and loss account. The ongoing international expansion of our group has led to a widely diversified sales platform with international store sales reaching 68% of the total. I would like to remark that over 2009 we have opened stores in 46 countries.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over to Ignacio who will provide you with some detail behind the headline numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Sales performance of 2009 has been satisfactory with 9% growth in local currencies. We have sustained our like-for-like sales over the year. I would like to highlight that like-for-like sales in the second half of 2009 have increased 2%.</p>
          <p>Regarding the gross margin, we can say that we are pleased with the evolution over this year. Inditex gross profit has increased 7% to &#x20AC;6.3 billion in 2009. The gross margin has reached 57.1% of sales, 27 basis points higher than in 2008.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are tightly under control. They have grown 7% in the period, mainly due to the addition of new retail space. The plan to obtain operating efficiencies of &#x20AC;75 million for 2009 that we announced to you last month has been fully achieved.</p>
          <p>All the lines of the working capital continue to show tight control, reflecting the flexibility of the business model. I would like to highlight the strong cash flow generation in 2009. Funds from operations have increased 11% over this year to &#x20AC;2.1 billion.</p>
          <p>I would also like to underline our strict capital allocation process. Capital expenditure was &#x20AC;510 million, while our commission sales piece has experienced a time-weighted growth of 10%.</p>
          <p>I will now hand you over to Marcos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>As you can see in this chart, Zara continues to represent approximately two-thirds of Inditex sales and the younger concepts one-third. Let me add that all the concepts have increased their percentage of international store sales proving their international scalability.</p>
          <p>Regarding Zara, sales in 2009 have grown 6% in local currencies, 4% on a reported basis. EBIT has grown 5%. Regarding the younger formats, 2009 has been a satisfactory year. Bershka has shown a strong out-performance. Zara Home and Oysho have also had a good performance. And I would like to highlight the successful expansion of Uterq&#xFC;e, our format focused on accessories. Uterq&#xFC;e has opened 60 stores in 13 countries in 18 months. The performance of this format is meeting our expectations.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Pablo for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Before closing, I would like to elaborate on a number of strategic issues for Inditex. Regarding the outlook for our group, let me tell you that Inditex is in an excellent position to take advantage of global growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>We have a greatly diversified sales platform with operations in 75 countries. We operate a highly flexible business model and our concepts offer a strong fashion proposition with attractive pricing. Our business model avoids the main fixed costs involved in international expansion, allowing us to take advantage of growth opportunities wherever they are present. Additionally, we have invested significantly over recent years in our infrastructure and we now have in place the capacity needed to support future growth.</p>
          <p>We have a strong potential to continue expanding profitably in the coming years. Our priority is to focus our growth in Europe and Asia. Regarding Europe, our domestic market, it is an area of expansion for all our formats. In Western Europe, we enjoy strong growth opportunities in markets like Italy, France, Germany and the U.K. We also see significant opportunities in Eastern Europe and the Russian Federation. We see great potential to expand profitably in Europe for many years. As our market share is below 1% in most countries.</p>
          <p>In Asia, our priority is to leverage on the strong and strategic presence we have built over recent years. Asia accounts today for 12% of Inditex sales. Our expansion has been remarkable due to the excellent reception of our business proposition focused on the latest fashions and the fact that many of these markets are in transformation. We currently enjoy a very strong position in the region and we have built a relevant presence in most Asian capitals. We are following a multiconcept expansion strategy in Asia combining openings of Zara with openings for a number of our formats in the majority of markets. As an example, we are currently expanding in China with five concepts.</p>
          <p>The main areas of growth for Inditex in Asia are currently China, Japan and South Korea. We will further enhance our market presence with the launch of Zara in India in May 2010, with initial store openings in Delhi and Mumbai to be followed by other capitals. The expansion in these markets will be combined with selected openings in other Asian countries in which we are present already. We see huge long-term potential for Inditex in Asian markets.</p>
          <p>And finally, our current plans for the Americas are to build on the existing presence through our selective expansion process.</p>
          <p>Our priority remains to invest profitably in the long-term expansion of the Group in countries with attractive long-term returns. Following our plans, we expect that by 2012 we will increase the diversification of our sales with operations in more than 80 countries through eight formats.</p>
          <p>Europe, ex-Spain will amount to approximately half of Inditex's sales, Asia to around 20% of sales, similar to the weight of Spain and the Americas around 10%.</p>
          <p>We expect Zara to be around 60% group sales and the younger format around 40% by 2012. We expect space to grow annually between eight to 10% in the period.</p>
          <p>Additionally, I would like to highlight that our plans to launch Zara online sales for the Autumn/Winter period 2010 are on track. Our teams have been working to ensure a successful launch we feel encouraged by the opportunity to take Zara into e-commerce.</p>
          <p>Regarding our expansion plans for 2010, we expect to open 365 to 425 stores. 95% of new space will be opened in international markets. Capital expenditure will be approximately &#x20AC;570 million.</p>
          <p>Regarding shareholders' remuneration, the Board of Directors will propose to the General Shareholders Meeting a total dividend of &#x20AC;1.20 per share for fiscal 2009, and interim dividend of $0.60 per share will be payable on the 3rd of May and a final dividend of $0.60 per share including the bonus will be payable on the 2nd of November. The total dividend payment amounts to &#x20AC;748 million, 14% higher than in the previous year.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me tell you that the stores sells in local currencies have increased 14% from the 1st of February to the 14th of March, 2010. As you all know the Spring/Summer season is influenced by the performance over the Easter period due to its significant sales volumes.</p>
          <p>And is all from us, we will be pleased to answer any questions you may have.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Richard Chamberlain from the Bank of America-Merrill lynch. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Can I just start with a question on space please, Pablo? I mean obviously it's interesting that your space development seems to be falling a little bit, obviously H&amp;M, some, we've seen going up a little bit in recent quarters. And you say that you've got 70% of contracts signed but that there maybe some delays. I mean which are the areas that you are seeing these potential delays? Is that mainly a Spain issue or outside Spain in Asia, or where is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I would say is that as we were saying during the presentation and as we anticipated to you in the nine months results presentation, our time-weighted average space growth during the year has been 10%. We continue seeing a strong growth opportunities in the coming years in all the markets in which we are present with all our different formats. In fact as we are saying to you right now we think about the next three years we are seeing space growth to be between eight to 10% with strong growth opportunities everywhere. In most of the markets our market share is very low and for us the space growth is always &#x2013; we always have in mind something that we have thought previously.</p>
          <p>We always have in mind the idea of we would never sacrifice quality in order to achieve higher quantities of space growth. We are extremely demanding about the locations, and the result of all that is that as I was saying to you before, we continue seeing strong growth opportunities in most of the markets, and we are planning for the coming year's space growth to be between eight and 10% with the different formats.</p>
          <p>Of course, most of this growth will &#x2013; well, a big part of this growth will take place in Asia. As it has been already the case during the year 2009, half of Zara openings are taking place in Asia. It has been the case in 2009 and it will be again the case in 2010. More than 40% of our total space growth is taking place in Asia. And we continue growing significantly in most European markets, both in Eastern European markets and in Western European markets.</p>
          <p>So globally, what I would say is that we feel very &#x2013; I don't know what word to use. No, but I could say that we feel quite satisfied with our space growth. At the same time, we are opening flagship stores, as you know everywhere. Very good flagship stores in the year 2009 in Tokyo, in Shibuya, in Michigan Avenue, in Chicago or in Wangfujing in Beijing. So we are opening flagship stores in the different cities. We feel very, very comfortable with the rate of space growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Fred Bjelland from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I actually had a follow-up question on the space for ticket. I seem to recall last year you said you were going to open 230,000 square meters of space of which 70% had already been signed. Given that you've opened nearly 30% less than the original target and the weighting H1/H2 has been quite different from the 25/75 that you originally laid out. Does that mean that the amount of space you signed in the second half in particular was almost non-existent or did a lot of the existing contracts get cancelled, and what kind of visibility can you give for a stronger space growth and the risk to downside or upside for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would tell you is something that you perfectly know. I would say that if you think about our company and our expansion with the different format, you must always have in mind that six months delay in four or five shopping malls, this is representing 30,000 square meters, so 1% or 1.5% of space growth. So what we could say is that globally space growth is very much in line with what we were anticipating at the beginning of the year, but you always must have in mind that possibility that if there is three, four months delay in four shopping malls, having in mind that we go with all our brands to the different shopping malls, this means 30,000 square meters, and also that is the case.</p>
          <p>If we think about the year 2010, the situation at the beginning of the year is what we're saying during the presentation, 70% of the contracts are already signed. We see strong opportunities in most of the countries and of course, we plan to continue taking advantage of these growth opportunities, and always combining as we always try to do not only with Zara, but also with all the other brands, always combining high street openings with shopping mall developments.</p>
          <p>So if we anticipate the range for the year 2010, at this stage of the year, what we think is that the space growth will be in line with that range we are anticipating to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could I just follow-up and ask then approximately where you are today? What proportion of your space growth is mall-based and how much of it is in high street?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's approximately half-on-half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Richard Edwards from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Hi. Just a quick question on Spain. I know for most of the result statements last year you suggested the Spanish like-for-like pattern was somewhere around 200 basis points or within 200 basis points of the Group average. Just want to understand has that continued through the fourth quarter into the new year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say about Spain because as we always say also in Spain, we prefer to analyze total sales evolution. The year 2009 has been for us a year of stability in Spain. We have maintained our level of sales, more or less our space has not increased in Spain. So the space also has been similar to what was the case in the year 2008. So what I would say about 2009 Spain is a year of stability from any every point of view. As you know and as we have told you before Spain is a market that we know quite well, in which we operate since many years ago and what I would say about this year is stable regarding our performance in Spain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And just to ask a second question on working capital. It looks like your inventories were down about 6% at the year-end and payables were up about 5%. I wonder if you could just explain the major drivers of those two numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first issue, Richard as you know well, inventory in our opinion does not reflect properly, the situation regarding product because the commitment is more important. Okay? So on that part what we would say is that we remain with an adequate commitment level and we are in a perfect position to flex the business and meet demand. So I would not read anything specific on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Robert Miller from Redburn Partners. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Could you explain why you've not paid out a bigger proportion of net income given the huge cash balances.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what we would say is that, you know what are our priorities regarding the use of cash. Our main priority of course is to continue with the profitable growth of our business to invest in the future growth of our business. At the same time, we always want to have a high level of flexibility, but always also having in mind that disciplined financial approach and our shareholders remuneration policy.</p>
          <p>In &#x2013; regarding the dividend, we would always prefer the dividend policy to be progressive with not big gaps in from one year to another. Having in mind all the elements we think that this 14% increase in the dividend is combining very much all the different elements regarding cash generation and regarding the use of that cash. That is what I could transmit to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But it's &#x2013; given that you are not spending as much as your depreciation charge, cash is going to explode again in the next 12 months. You must consider your balance sheet is inefficient given its current structure, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't want to have an inefficient balance sheet and you know that we always take care about our return on capital employed. So we do not what to have non-efficient balance sheet. But as I was saying to you, the &#x2013; what you are saying about what is going to happen this year, we will talk about that from now in one year. But we think that if you look to what has been going on in the last few years, we have increased in a very, very significant way our dividends year-after-year. And this year a 14% increase is what we have considered as the, I would say most reasonable approach having in mind all the different elements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could I just ask on Pull and Bear, it seems to have been the only division that in a recession suffered a profit setback, which is remarkable, but were there any specific issues around the Pull and Bear performance that you would highlight?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what I would say is that having so many formats it's always possible to see one format underperforming in one particular year. If you think about Pull and Bear in the last two years, EBIT growth has been 50% combining 2007 and 2008. So the growth has been huge in the last two years and as I was saying to you before, I have &#x2013; we think that it's much better to look globally at the different formats. So the global performance of the different formats has been very positive. It could always be the case to see one format with a lower performance in any particular year. I think that is &#x2013; what that shows is the strength of our multiconcept approach. I think that is clear that having different brands is something &#x2013; and having this, as Marcos was saying during the presentation, having this international scalability of the different formats is a key strength of our company.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Could you just talk a little bit more about CapEx logistics? Judging by the guidance for 2010, there will be no major infrastructure being put in. But when would you expect the next stage of infrastructure spend to start? And is there a stage at which you'll start building out infrastructure in Asia given that your prioritization there or will you continue for the medium term to route everything via Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding our logistic CapEx in &#x2013; we have logistic capacity with the current infrastructure until the year 2012. So we would not see a strong logistic investment at least until the year 2013.</p>
          <p>And about where to build new logistic infrastructure well Asia is always a possibility. This is something that we are considering but no decision taking right now. But you should not expect in the next &#x2013; in this 2010 to 2012 period a significant logistics investment. Every year there is some logistic &#x2013; there are some logistic investments as we always say and you could assume logistics to represent around 10% of total CapEx in the coming three years.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And in terms of cost for the current year are there any particular measures that you are bringing in on costs or should we just expect costs to increase broadly in line with space growth?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I know you typically will plan your gross margin looking for the full year to be up or down I think 50 basis points. I know that this quarter though we &#x2013; you saw quite an extreme jump-up, up about 200 basis points, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what was driving that sort of a swing because obviously that's pretty meaningful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Beginning of the fiscal year 2009 we anticipated you that we expect a broadly stable gross margin and we have achieved a stable gross margin in fiscal year 2009. 27 basis points higher than 2008. It was due to a combination of factors: inventory management, product mix, mark ups, mark downs and currencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess specifically looking at this quarter though, is there anything, were you less promotional in the fourth quarter, did you have a higher average selling price, anything that would have made material difference?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and you should never read in one particular quarter the gross margin. We always think &#x2013; we always like to look at most of the figures on a yearly basis, but at least on a &#x2013; I mean, regarding the gross margin on a full season basis. And globally in the year 2009, our gross margin has been stable having in mind what we always say that the stability means 50 &#x2013; includes 50 basis points above or below.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually it'd be on a full season basis, that will the third and fourth quarter, right, so that would actually be up 150 basis points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the full year stable gross margin. It was slightly negative in the first half of the year and slightly positive in the second half.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I've got a question on the space again. You opened 573 stores only two years ago and I'm just wondering why we had the shortfall to a maximum of 425 stores for this year. Is it the fact that you haven't got the space development potential in Spain anymore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we discussed over recent conference calls, we mentioned that in Spain our space growth was going to be very limited. But the main issue I think that you should consider is what we have been discussing on the call that for us the quality requirements of the openings are a key priority. This doesn't mean &#x2013; this does mean that being present in 75 countries, we are extremely careful with the quality, the capital efficiency for investment, and the returns of these stores and this is just the reason for this opening plan for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think you could ever get back to 570 stores again or is sort of 425 the new normal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First thing is that we see space growth to be between eight and 10% in the next three years. I think that is the relevant figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you. And then just a quick question on the tax rate if I may, what's your best estimate for that please this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we announced to you, we expect the tax rate to move progressively towards 25%. As you know, the tax rate of the Group is a mix of different tax rates, this is the main point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So going towards 25% this year? Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning, everyone. Just one quick question because most of my questions were already answered. The 365 to 425 new store openings, is the top end of the guidance to &#x2013; from eight to 10% square meter growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Inside that guidance, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not inside, it's in the top end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, not in the guidance. As I was saying to you before that a delay in four or five shopping malls could be &#x2013; could mean one point up, one point down, so that is why we prefer to talk about range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Both in terms of number of openings and in terms of total space growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Assume that the bottom of &#x2013; so that the guidance in the number of openings between one point and the other is equivalent to between eight and 10%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. Again a question on space actually, in the year just gone there's been a much bigger proportion of stores opened that are franchises. Could you just say broadly geographically where these stores have been and also whether you expect to add similar number of franchises in the year ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Franchise store sales are around 13 to 14% this year. It has increased one point. It is not very relevant. It is between the normal evolution of the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But in store numbers that was 80 out of the stores you opened. Can you just say roughly geographically where those have opened?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Openings in America and in countries such as for example Columbia, some openings in the Middle East. It's diversified in the &#x2013; some openings also in Asia in the countries in which we manage under franchise, because as you know in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore we are operating through franchise agreements. So it's diversified in the different geographical areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And just on &#x2013; just a point of clarification; you said cost growth you are expecting to be in line with space growth. Could you just break this down, does this mean you're expecting like-for-like inflation in both rents and wages to be flat or are there other measurements in the cost line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There &#x2013; well, if you analyze what has been going on in the last few years, you can see how we have been increasing the efficiency of our operations, particularly in the year 2009 with our &#x20AC;75 million efficiency plan it has been particularly remarkable because cost growth has been below a space growth. The average space growth during the year has been 10% and cost growth has been 7% with a slightly exchange rate impact, so in normalized terms around 8%. So it has been significantly below our space growth.</p>
          <p>If we think about the coming year and the next few years, we think that we could assume cost growth to be in line with the space growth. So this means not to see cost growth increases on a like-for-like basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just typically on rents and wages, what does that imply?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it means globally because we prefer to analyze cost growth evolution globally. We think that we can be able to maintain cost growth in line with the space growth which is very ambitious.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks a lot.</p>

          <p>Our final question today by telephone comes from Peter Farren from Bryan Garnier. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Just two questions. The first one is on the gross margin 2010, if you can confirm that you're guiding for a flat gross margin again? And within that I was wondering what the hedging impact would be, because I assume you fully hedged for this year? The second question is whether you are actually abandoning your policy of a neutral balance sheet on a four quarter run basis? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding the gross margin for the year 2010, you should assume a stable gross margin as we always say at the beginning of the year that is our target to have a stable gross margin for the full year. Regarding the potential dollar impact in the gross margin, you see that in our case is very limited. You know that it's very limited because of our sales team structure, we maintain more than 50% of our sales team in proximity, so our exchange rate exposure is very, very limited. But regarding the dollar impact, you could expect at current exchange rates, not a significant impact during the year, perhaps slightly positive in the first half and negative in the second half, but not a significant impact during the year.</p>
          <p>Regarding our balance sheet and our &#x2013; the way we analyze the balance sheet, I think I have answered before to this question, what are our priorities in terms of the use of cash. Of course, the first priority is there to invest for &#x2013; in the long-term profitable expansion of our business, but combining this with our disciplined financial approach and our predicable and attractive shareholders' remuneration policy.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we're now finishing the telephone Q&amp;A session to address the questions received through webcast platform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. Now we're going to try to answer questions we have been receiving through the webcast. Well, the first question is coming from <mark type="inaudible" /> from Citi. Well, analyzing the performance of working capital in 2009, he is asking about if it's &#x2013; if we can expect a further working capital inflow for the year ahead &#x2013; for the year 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, <mark type="inaudible" /> you should expect this for the working capital to remain negative. This is a result from our business model, and very much performing according with sales growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, another question, which is quite general, which is try to &#x2013; if we can comment the main trends about the largest European markets, would be Spain, France, Germany, the U.K., about environment &#x2013; weak environment in those geographies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we prefer not to analyze market-by-market, and we think it's more sensible to see the different geographical areas that we are covering. And globally Europe as you can see would be evolution during the year, both in terms of number of openings and in terms of like-for-like sales, has had satisfactory evolution.</p>
          <p>And when we analyze Europe, it's always a combination of Western European countries and East European countries. So that is what I would say about the evolution, as I prefer to analyze Europe as a whole than to enter into specific analysis of any different countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have another question and this is coming from Jes&#xFA;s Dom&#xED;nguez from Banco Sabadell. Well, the first one has been already addressed, which is about the performance of cost for 2010. And the second one would be, if we can comment about any potential drivers of like-for-like growth over 2009 between price and volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our like-for-like growth evolution is always volume driven, because our idea is to maintain the ability of our prices in the different markets in which we operate. So our like-for-like sales evolution will always be volume driven. And if we &#x2013; and if you ask us what is our target, our like-for-like sales target for this year, for the year 2010, our target knowing that it is ambitious but our target would be to have positive like-for-like sales growth during the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. The next question is coming from Kepler Equities is about Zara. The question is focused on the return on capital employed of Zara and the reason why the return on capital employed of Zara is slightly below the average of the group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding Zara what I can say is that Zara sales growth has been 6% in the year in local currencies and EBIT growth was 5%, so it's very much in line with the average of the group. Regarding the return on capital employed, the slight decrease is due to the strong investment that we've made in logistic over the last two years which is still weighting in the base, that is purely a rise effect really, we believe that Zara is clearly leading the way in our expansion in many markets and the opportunities to keep on growing Zara are huge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then we have <mark type="inaudible" /> also a question regarding a potential impact from the also potential rise of VAT in Spain that is in the media these days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are not planning to transfer the VAT increase into prices as was the case when we didn't transfer that into prices when there were VAT increases in countries such as Germany, the U.K., or Portugal in previous years. At the same time we are not planning any significant impact because we think we will be able to compensate that through efficiencies in all the lines of the profit and loss account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect and next question is about any change in the sourcing prices that we may perceive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really. You know that our sourcing structure is a combination of between proximity sourcing which is key regarding our business model and then some Asian sourcing, we always strive to have long-term relationships with our suppliers all across the world and we are not seeing any significant change from that point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, then move on &#x2013; next question would be regarding the online sales of Zara. If we can provide any further detail about the potential sales level and about the way we are going to manage the online sales of Zara?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we can say is that, as you know the first countries in which we are going to launch Zara online are going to be Spain, Italy, Portugal, France, Germany and the U.K. In this Autumn/Winter season progressively we will expand this to many different countries, to most of countries in which we operate. Our plans are on track, we prefer to update you on that in the first quarter results presentation with much more details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are two last questions, the first one is coming from Pedro Balcao from Santander, talking about the main drivers for Asia to grow to 20% of group sales by 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A combination of new openings and like-for-like sales growth evolution, China is going to be the most relevant country with a very significant number of openings every year. Now in China we are present with Zara with Massimo Dutti, with Bershka, Pull and Bear, and Stradivarius. We're also growing in Japan and in Korea. Korea, a very recent opening with a significant level of growth. This year we are opening in India I think, India &#x2013; the opening in India is going to be very strategic in the medium term. We are beginning with the stores in Delhi and Mumbai. We are planning in the coming years to move to other Indian cities. We think that in the medium term this will become very relevant.</p>
          <p>So it's a combination of space growth, like-for-like sales evolution in the different countries, but of course having in mind its size and its economic growth and opportunities in the number of cities in which we can be present. China is going to be a major driver in this evolution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there is another question which is if we can add some color regarding the variable proportion of the operating expenses line, if we keep on working on that aspect of our cost base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know over recent years we have made a very important effort to increase the variable part of our cost base from one-third to around 40%. And we believe that now this is very much the right approach to the current market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine. There is another question regarding, is the expansion into Asia is impacting in some way or another our sourcing base, if we are moving to sourcing from one area to another?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really. We are not planning any change in our sourcing structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is a very detailed question about receivables performance that we can address after by the &#x2013; into the IR department. So I think that there is a very &#x2013; well, it's a question coming from a private shareholder which is first a suggestion and second a question. Suggestion is if we are going to allow them the opportunity to receive the dividends, reinvesting into shares of the company in some way or another.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's always the decision of the &#x2013; of each individual, no we'll pay dividend in cash, and each one can decide what to do with that cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And his second question is regarding the eco-efficient stores both in Athens' Korai and Portal de l'Angel in Barcelona. It's about any significant difference in payback periods, and that if we are going to roll it out relatively to the rate of store base of the company?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. No, in terms of payback there is nothing &#x2013; there isn't any significant impact. What we can say is that these eco-efficient stores are &#x2013; the energy consumption is 30% lower than in the regular stores. And what we are doing is to introduce this concept in all the new openings. And we are also having that in mind in the refurbishments of the existing stores. So progressively all our stores are becoming eco-efficient.</p>

          <p>There is another question regarding the opportunities that we see opportunities in Eastern Europe and specifically in Russia.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For Russia &#x2013; for Eastern European countries all of them are very attractive for us because the appetite for fashion is very high in all these different countries. We have been extremely well received, with Zara and with the other formats. And we can talk about all the different countries.</p>
          <p>If we think about Russia, well, Russia is the biggest and very, very attractive market for us. I would say not only thinking about Moscow and Saint Petersburg, but thinking about many different cities, such as Katerinboro, Rostov many, many different cities all across the country in which we are opening stores of the different brands. With very &#x2013; also always combining as we do everywhere flagship stores. We have a very, very flagship store in Saint Petersburg, one Zara, one Bershka in Nevsky Street, now we are opening a second Zara store in a former library in Nevsky Street in Saint Petersburg this year which is going to be extremely, I would say, beautiful. So, a very attractive market for us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And I think we have covered all the questions because most of the questions have already been answered at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in any case, of course, we will be ready to answer any additional questions you could have by phone or in meetings during the coming days. Thank you very much to all of you for joining us in this conference call.</p>
