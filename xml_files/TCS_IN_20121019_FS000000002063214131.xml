          <p>As you are aware, we do not provide specific revenue or earnings guidance.

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kedar, and good morning, good afternoon, good evening, everyone. I'm very happy to report that we have had an excellent performance in Q2. As we have seen &#x2013; as you may have seen, we have delivered a growth of 5.1% in rupee terms and 4.8% CC terms and 4.6% in dollar terms on the top line.</p>
          <p>And the volumes have been 4.95%, and the growth has been pretty well rounded. We have grown in all our markets. U.S. has delivered a 3.6% growth; Latin America, about 8.3% growth; U.K., about 5.7% growth; Asia Pacific, about 7.3% growth; Continental Europe, again 4.7% growth. So it's a pretty well-rounded growth across markets.</p>
          <p>And in terms of industries, we are very happy with the growth again. BFSI has delivered a 4.3% growth, and Telecom has done well at a 5.5% growth. And Manufacturing has done almost 9.5% plus, and Retail has done 7%. And you know all the industries have done well. Life sciences has been a bit soft at around 1.3%, 1.4%.</p>
          <p>So the growth is pretty broad based and we have seen it coming from all quarters. There are no one-offs. There is no specific kicker from one corner that has driven the volume. So it's been a good volume story. Pricing has been pretty much stable. We'll talk about the margin analytics and the revenue analytics a little later on. But pricing has been pretty stable and the environment from a growth point of view is good, and I will come to that in a minute.</p>
          <p>Margin per se on this quarter, we have delivered 26.8% in the operating level and then <mark type="indiscernible" /> (03:49) in the net level, over 22%. The operating margins, there has been a drop of a little over 70 basis points primarily due to couple of reasons. One that we have had to move some work on-site and we have taken some transformation engagements in Europe in the last few quarters and especially the staffing and on-site ramp up in terms of both local resources as well as expats is high. And we are having some additional cost in doing these &#x2013; executing these engagements. It is a startup phase and this will even out and work will normalize to the usual on-site/offshore ratio and that is one area.</p>
          <p>The second area is that all our emerging markets, Latin America, India, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, all have done well and in India we have taken some system integration contracts. You will see the cost of third-party equipments and products going &#x2013; having gone up this quarter. And these are couple of reasons why you see a softness, a little bit drop in margins. But otherwise company is operating at a very healthy margins. In all the engagements we are executing well. We are closing deals with the right price levels and focused on productivity, so there are no concerns on that fact.</p>
          <p>From a deal perspective, it's been a very good quarter. We have had excellent deal signings and I would like to at least number 11 of them as a large deal category and the deals have come across the board in all verticals. Four of them are in BFSI and I'm particularly happy, three of them have come from BFS and one is Insurance, a pretty transformational deal. And two deals in Telecom, which again I'm happy about and couple of deals in Retail; one in Manufacturing, government and then energy sectors. And the outlook in terms of the deal pipeline, as well as client decision making is pretty satisfactory, clients are making decisions, deals are getting closed and ramp ups are happening.</p>
          <p>The employee add has been pretty strong, 18,654 employees were added at a gross level, taking the tally to 254,076 associates. And it's also been a quarter where our attrition has been managed incredibly well. Our HR folks have done a stupendous job and our attrition in the quarter is an all-time low from our last 10-quarter perspective. We are at a 10.2% in IT services attrition. And including BPO and everything else, it's a little over 11%. And utilization has gone up, both including trainees and excluding trainees; including trainees to 81.6% and excluding trainees to 72.8%, both up from the &#x2013; sorry, the earlier on, both up from the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>So all I would say is that, we are seeing very good traction with customers. Demand looks good. Technology is in the forefront of everything that the customers want to do. And the nature of deals are wide ranging. We are engaged in a number of efficiency-related deals where we are either optimizing the infrastructure, optimizing the application portfolio, optimizing the core ERP in terms of an SAP instance or a supply chain system or a <mark type="ph" /> enhancement (07:54) accounting system or a CRM system and also seeing enormous opportunities in the digital and cloud and mobile and predictive analytics area.</p>
          <p>Customers clearly are investing in digital space. And there is an opportunity to partner, to rethink their businesses, processes and productivity, whether it is a retail company or a banking or a financial service institution or a manufacturing company. We are seeing traction across the board and we wanted to give you some sample of the kind of engagements in analytics and mobility that we get, which we have added as part of the pack this quarter.</p>
          <p>So we are quite positive where we are with respect to the outlook going forward. So barring the usual things that you will see in Q3, which is in terms of holidays in U.S. and some furloughs that you will see, I don't see anything negative about the environment and we are quite positive and remain bullish about the future.</p>
          <p>Thank you and over to you, Maha.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Chandra. Our first quarter revenue of INR156.208 billion represents a growth of 5.1% Q-on-Q and 34.3% year-on-year. Revenue in dollar terms, just to repeat that, is $2.853 billion, which is a sequential growth of 4.6% and year-on-year growth of 13%.</p>
          <p>In constant currency, the revenue is $2.86 billion, a sequential growth of 4.8%. That breakup of our sequential INR growth of 5.1% is given below. Volume growth plus 4.95%, constant currency realization minus 49 basis points, currency impact plus 22 basis points, on-site shift 38 basis points plus.</p>
          <p>Operating margin, strong growth of emerging markets on the on-site ramp up on large deals led to a 75 basis points Q-on-Q decline in our EBIT margin to 26.75%. The breakup of that is as follows; currency impact minus 12 basis points, productivity shift minus 22 basis points, the SG&amp;A efficiencies plus 9 basis points, on-site shift minus 50 basis points, totaling to 75 basis points minus.</p>
          <p>I said, currency impact of minus 12 basis points. You would have noticed that currency had a negative impact despite the positive revenue impact. This was because of the timing mismatch between when the revenues of a particular currency booked and when the costs of that currency are incurred.</p>
          <p>Other income, as a percentage of revenue, was 1.99% compared to 1.17% in the previous quarter, driven by ForEx gains and our currency hedges, moderated, of course, by the revaluation losses on account of the quarter-end appreciation of the rupee.</p>
          <p>Effective tax rate was 21% compared to 22.2% in the previous quarter. These two factors, that's the higher other income and lower provision for taxes relative to the previous quarter, mitigated the impact of the Q-on-Q operating margin decline at the net income level.</p>
          <p>Our net income margin for Q2 was 22.5%, up 42 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Our accounts receivable stood at 81 DSO in dollar terms, up one day from the previous quarter. Invested funds as of 30th September was INR107.9 billion.</p>
          <p>In summary, strong and disciplined execution allowed us to mitigate the impact of a sharp change in business mix this quarter and still deliver an operating margin not very far from our aspirational level of 27%. Other financial metrics, EPS, operating cash flow, DSO have all been most satisfactory as well.</p>
          <p>With that, we can now open the line for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Joe Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I was wondering, first of all, why the change in tone on the client side? In other words, why are they making decisions now and were a little bit slower in the first half of the year? And do you expect that to continue into 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that we ever said <mark type="ph" /> there's slow &#x2013; some on  (13:04) decision making. We have always maintained that the decision making has been good. But we have said that the discretionary projects are going through lot more scrutiny and sometimes there could be delays in starting ramp ups. Those are the kind of comments that we have made.</p>
          <p>But what we are seeing is especially the projects around digital, projects around transformation and we have not seen any stoppage, and these projects are happening as planned. And anything more than that is very difficult for me to say because our revenues are not only coming from traditional infrastructure deals. Revenues are coming from projects of different sizes, which basically what I would call as coming from the discretionary budgets. It is happening. And -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I have visited customers and met with customers. I and my team have met with lots of customers and most of our key customers. And we remain confident that customers are staying course. Having said that, we will wait for the budgets for the next year to be done towards December, and I'll give you any update in January.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on the competitive environment, have you seen any changes there? I know you talked about pricing being stable, but any market shifts that you could point out because there has been, obviously, some inconsistency on execution across different vendors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is always situations where somebody is willing to go down on pricing or somebody is more competitive, those things always happens in an environment like this on a specific deal, and then you as a company and as a management have to take a call, whether you &#x2013; how you respond. But I can't say that I'm seeing a pattern. I can't see there is a pattern. But there are instances that it happens, and we just have to take a call and then move on, but there is no pattern that I can see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the last quick question for me. Just as you look forward, how do you frame the balance between growth and profitability? Are there any targets on the profitability side? And do you worry about that long-term, given some of the commoditization that's taking place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that we have said this multiple times. We believe that growth and profitability are not in contradiction. We believe that this industry can operate at a healthy margin, and it's important to shape the business model as we go along in order to be able to sustain that margin, primarily because the rate at which the technology is emerging and the speed at which companies <mark type="ph" /> have divest (16:10), we have to be prepared. The investments that we require, whether it is in skill building, competency centers or in terms of building intellectual property in terms of products and platforms will only continue to increase.</p>
          <p>So that really requires us to operate at a good margin. And we have said in several forums, our CFO has also mentioned it for the last couple of years, at least, that we are looking to operate around the margin at which we are operating, around 27%. Sometimes you get a currency benefit, sometimes you get a currency headwind, but there are enough levers. As long as we don't see huge volatility within a short period of time, we have levers and we exercise those levers in order to operate at a healthy margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Ankur Rudra from Ambit Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong revenue performance this quarter, also to Rajesh for the appointment and finally, Maha, thanks for making the results so boring and predictable consistently. Just for the &#x2013; on the nature of demand and the nature of deals you signed, it just seems like the proportion of discretionary deals is increasing at least in the largest deals you spoke about. Is that true for the broader portfolio as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I think there is a good mixed bag and if I have to categorize the deals, if you typically signed six deals, large deals, probably all the large deals came from large-scale efficiency drive before. And then you worked on smaller-scale projects on the discretionary side.</p>
          <p>Now, what we are seeing at least in this quarter is, we continue to see the discretionary spend throwing up a number of small deals and there is a great adoption on digital technology and that's flowing in nicely. But we have also closed a couple of large-scale deals, which I feel have come from the discretionary spend, good size deals which are transformation in nature, core system replacement and a insurance company, for example, and those kind of deals, at least a couple of them are very, very noteworthy ones. So I think the discretionary spend is happening.</p>
          <p>But whether it happens in BFSI, Manufacturing, everything else, will it happen immediately? I don't know. But we have not seen a stoppage and we are not seeing &#x2013; the decision is not happening, we are just going through the process. We bid and then the schedule is followed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's good to know. Just on the nature of contracting, I've been hearing from some of your peers that given greater competitive intensity and the weak macro economy, contract terms and SLAs for traditional deals are getting a bit more adverse for service providers. I was wondering if you are seeing that and how do you push back on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, there are demands in the traditional deals and we have to take it deal by deal and some we'll be able to respond because we have an advantage, some we are not able to respond, then we have to take a call. And we are just being disciplined in what we do if that's the only way to respond. But there is no &#x2013; I wouldn't broad brush anything. I wouldn't say this is what is happening across the board. I mean, that's not what I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Thanks for that. Best of luck for the rest of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Edward Caso from Volkswagen (sic) [Wells Fargo Securities] (20:05). Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. Good evening. I want to ask about the infrastructure deals, you've been growing very strongly here for quite a few quarters. And is this new work, is this takeaways from the global providers, as those have come up for renewal? And if that's the case, what are you doing to win those takeaways?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think a significant number of them are some sort of takeaways in direct form or in some other transformative form. And there are also some deals where a new solution in terms of a cloud and et cetera is being adopted. But there is a significant portion of them, which is I would say takeaway deals or renewal deals or of that nature.</p>
          <p>And, obviously, I mean, I'm not going to be able to sit down and explain you the sales process here. But TCS has built huge tools in the way we approach these things, and we concentrate and focus on how we differentiate ourselves and how we also execute better. Because sometimes we just need to be so sure that we can execute better, so that the competitiveness can be maintained.</p>
          <p>So these deals have to be competitive. You need to be sure about execution and you need to develop differentiators and we are focusing on all these three things and we have had a passion of this. And I would say that, we again qualify and there are deals where we clearly opt out. And the deals in which we do, we put lot of focus and we are able to win those deals and execute and grow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My other question is around utilization for about five quarters now, the year-over-year declines in your utilization, both with and without trainees has been fairly sharp. And is that &#x2013; and you've continued to sort of bring in, obviously it was a big quarter for freshers. I guess the question is, is that a view that you expect demand to come up? Is this a surprise on the attrition numbers?</p>
          <p>And then maybe any sense on what your plans are for this year's round of freshers? One of your competitors has said they're sort of backing off on the &#x2013; how many intakes, how many offers they're going to make and curious what you can say on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So as far as utilization is concerned, I think we have been operating at a fairly good utilization. It's at 81% plus. This quarter is 81.6% excluding trainees is what I'm talking about. Previous quarter was 81.3%, so it's a 0.3% increase. In Q4 of last year it was 80.6%, it's been going up in the last three quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is no sharp decline at all. On the other hand, I think we have been operating, and in fact all the analysts have been appreciative, writing positive commentary on the way we are running utilization. I also said that we are comfortable even to go to 83%, 84%. And on the trainee front, do you want to add something, Ajoy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, trainees, as you know they start joining from June onwards and we had given offers, they are joining now. As far as next year is concerned from a campus point of view, we are going to hire 25,000 is the number that we are planning and the process is already on. We have already given offers to about 12,000 trainees during the campus interviews.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>The only thing that I would say is that on this point you have to be careful in how you read the hires that we do. We are seeing a good growth and we are operating at a healthy utilization at 81.6%, but we can go up further. On the other end, we are operating at 72.8%. We have room to improve utilization there. We have gone up to 76%, 77% comfortably in the past. So there is a four, five percentage points there at least that we will be comfortable in doing. And also we are able to attract very good talent from the market and some we'll hire here, some we'll hire in the U.S. and Europe and other parts of the world for education, and Latin America, all the education happens at local hires, so that &#x2013; we will do that. So overall, in India the first trainees and campuses we are going with 25,000 people, but we'll be hiring from all other ends and we'll calibrate it as we go.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Moshe Katri from Cowen &amp; Company. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. This is a question for Maha. Can you kind of give us some details on how some of those transformational deals ramp in terms of the &#x2013; maybe the &#x2013; I'll talk about the initial margin impact and then how do you get scale? What sort of a timeframe should we look for, for margin to kind of come back to &#x2013; they have been &#x2013; before some of these deals have been kind of pressuring margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Moshe, there's &#x2013; there has been &#x2013; yeah, well, the first thing I want to say is that the decline in margin is not substantial as far as this quarter is concerned. It's 77 basis point, so &#x2013; and &#x2013; that's the first point. The second point is this that as far as the employee cost &#x2013; if you take it along with the business associates and so on, it has not gone up significantly in relation to the overall &#x2013; in relation to the revenue. I think if I remember correctly I think it was something close to about 22 or 23 basis point, which was really that difference that really took place as far as this quarter as compared to the previous quarter, I'll have to reverify that figure.</p>
          <p>And therefore, when you look at it from an overall perspective; employee cost to some extent has contributed to that decline in margin. There is and in fact &#x2013; there are lots of things that we have got to be looking at at the same time, that is the first one is really in terms of the business associates costs that have incurred. The second one is the project cost, especially when we get complex contracts and we might have to go ahead and get especially some of these contracts that we do in India and &#x2013; but &#x2013; so there are certain project costs that we are incurring project expenses, which is &#x2013; which we need to control and maintain &#x2013; I mean maintain the control over that.</p>
          <p>The third one really in terms of the other operating expenses that we are incurring, see the main thing is that there are a few factors that we have as far as this is concerned. We are investing in newer types of projects. I mean we have talked about the platform-based deals, you know about that we have talked about some of the large projects that we've taken that there are in-sourcing of people that come in. And when the depreciation of the rupee takes place, these are the areas that you can afford to get into a little more aggressively. And therefore, ensure that we stick to our aspirational margins and reinvest the excess into the business.</p>
          <p>And therefore, the point that I'm making is that to your statement as to whether it will come back, first, I'm saying that as far as we are concerned, we have a control over the expenses in overall categories that I described.</p>
          <p>Second thing is that we are also getting into complex and assignments and so on, since the benefit of rupee depreciation gives us scope to do so. I don't see any fundamentally a different reset as far as the cost structure is concerned, which puts the margin picture in doubt.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last question for Chandra. Are we expecting the budget cycle for next year to be kind of on track? Should we &#x2013; based on what you're kind of seeing out there, do you think we're going to get delays, which is kind of what we had earlier this year? Maybe some color here will be helpful.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On track meaning budgets will be on time, or do you think we're going to have some delays in terms of clients formulating budgets for next year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Honestly, I think I should wait another couple of months, but based on all the dealings I've had, I feel and get a sense that budgets are going to be on time. And there is not going to be delays, and I feel that it's going to be a good fiscal next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Mitali Ghosh from Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Congratulations yet again. On the banking vertical, I was wondering if you could comment in terms of what you're seeing the trajectory like. And I mean if you look at the &#x2013; other than the top client, the top 10, especially the six to 10 have grown kind of slower on a year-on-year basis, on a LTM year-on-year basis. So I'm just wondering this could be to do with the banking vertical and maybe we're just seeing the tail of the previous quarters, but it would be helpful if you could help us understand what it's looking like now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as I said, Mitali, we have delivered in rupee terms a 4.7% growth in BFSI, which is pretty much in line with the company. I mean, I think it's been a very good quarter for our BFSI vertical. And even in dollar terms, it's about 4.2%.</p>
          <p>Now, the growth has come from both services and also our product portfolio. And if you really look at the type of engagements, basically three categories; engagements which drive what I call as efficiency or optimization; second is regulatory changes and compliance related; third one is digital, analytics, et cetera. And we have given examples, especially picked in the banking vertical, because I thought you all would like to see that. So if you see the mobility engagements, I have put in quite a number of engagements from the banking sector, so that it will give you color.</p>
          <p>So these are the three types of engagements broadly. And the wins, as I said, out of the 11 large wins I announced, four of them are banking and financial services, one insurance, three BFS. So it's been pretty healthy and the pipeline in banking looks good and I feel that every bank has got an agenda on all the three dimensions.</p>
          <p>On efficiency dimensions, they've got a clear target where they want to be, how they want their IT investments to change in terms of optimizing the investments they have done and they have really got a plan on digital or discussing a plan on digital. And the third one is definitely risk and compliance, regulatory, et cetera.</p>
          <p>Apart from this, there are new initiatives being discussed which are platform-driven. Those things are not counting because there is a lot of discussion happening on the front, which will all translate into real projects. But I think my personal sense is not that somebody has told me, my own assessment is that it is at least four quarters away. It's not going to happen overnight. These things take time. And so this is what is happening in the BFSI vertical.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. That's very helpful. And secondly on the margin front, we've touched upon the aspirational 27% kind of target. So just wanted to understand that this is better because on the one hand, we have been seeing good growth from a lot of the emerging markets. I mean, U.S. has been slightly slower, and also from things like infrastructure management services, the rupee is probably going to appreciate from where it has been. So taking all this into account, how should we think about margins going forward and the aspiration number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I would not like to broad brush emerging markets or lower margin, and so on and so forth. Each market has got a different price point and a different cost point. And it's a question of building those critical mass and those client-centric strategy of full services, which we have been driving. As long as we are successful and do that, we make the right margins.</p>
          <p>Otherwise, for the portion of revenues that you'll see in the emerging markets this quarter, if the margins are going to be significantly down you should have seen a big drop, and that's not the case. So when we say that we have got a view around a particular number, not as a guidance, but that's the kind of margin that we think we can operate at and we should operate at in order to be able to give ourselves room for the kind of investments that we need to make. We remain confident and there are a number of levers.</p>
          <p>As I have said in the past, when the rupee depreciates strongly, we kind of try and leverage that in terms of more investments. And also when the rupee appreciates, then we have to exercise the levers to be able to handle that. So as long as we don't have a huge volatility, suddenly a swing of huge percentage, in general that's our aspiration and I think that's the way to think about it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And just one quick last question on campus hiring, the target this time is lower than the target same time last year. Is this a reflection of the fact that you mentioned you want to take up utilization, or is it a reflection of the fact that maybe the environment is somewhat uncertain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would not like to read anything negative in this statement. I think we are just taking a calibrated view. We are able to attract talent and definitely 25,000 trainee is a good number, attrition has also come down. If you translate the last year number and this year number, there is a significant benefit also we get, and also we are &#x2013; we will do off-campus hiring. And we are also hiring in other markets. So we'll take a calibrated view and initially they are gone ahead with the 25,000 number and Ajoy's team has already done half of it, half of the offers have been made.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. I have two, if I could. You mentioned some more on-site work, particularly for transformational projects in Europe, but just more broadly some on-site. Is that driven by political issues or your own staffing issues? And is that something you think is a permanent part or will you kind of transition back to a normal portfolio? I just wanted to clarify that, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has nothing to do with the political issue or it has nothing to do with our own inability to stop those issues. It is primarily the situation of the particular project. We have taken a huge chunk of work in these three or four engagements, where we have had to also hire local people and also take over some resources from the clients. And also the offshore work has not kicked in because the full transition is going on, so the ramp up even from India, all the ramp up has happened on-site because we are doing a lot of transition. And so the need of the project at this point in time requires us to operate in this mode.</p>
          <p>And since &#x2013; probably if it is just one transformational project, you wouldn't have &#x2013; we wouldn't have talked about it. The fact that two or three of them are going at the same time, and honestly, just the fact that we are operating at good margins gives us the flexibility to go ahead and then <mark type="ph" /> commit to take three &#x2013; (38:22)</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And otherwise, few years ago, probably if our margins are low and you will have to always ask whether we have &#x2013; we can take this on. But currently we are willing to make that investment and not get worried whether we will get hit by 30 basis points or 40 basis points and we'll have a difficulty in explaining to them this. They're not going through that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. Then my second question is, you mentioned that there was a strong deal pipeline across the verticals, and I wanted to just get a sense of distribution, and what I mean by that is, is that skewed by a few larger deals across all the verticals or is it a breadth of deals that you're seeing both large and small? And the reason I ask is, your results look good and your commentary seems bullish. And I just want to understand is this more TCS winning some of the larger deals or is it broader based across the market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think this quarter I'm particularly happy, because there is no one-off kicker. The volumes of 5% have come pretty broad-based. There is no &#x2013; last quarter, we had a huge 1% or close to &#x2013; a significant volume came from the Friends Life kicker. So there is no kicker at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's pretty broad-based. The deals that we have won, the total order book that we have won is pretty good. And it doesn't have a kicker like a Friends Life, which is $1 billion plus. There is no such kicker. It's pretty broad-based, $50 million, $100 million, $150 million types of deals. There are also some $20 million, $10 million deals. So &#x2013; and it has come from BFS, Manufacturing and Retail and so on, and it has come from different markets.</p>
          <p>The same thing in terms of, when you look at the pipeline, it's pretty broad-based. It is not to say that we get an opportunity for a large deal of $1 billion, $1.5 billion, we will not go after that, we'll go after that. But my commentary is not coming based on &#x2013; I know for sure I'm going to win this deal which is $1 billion. There's no such thing. It's just distributed and it's healthy. All my business unit heads and their teams are confident. They are doing the right things and they are seeing traction with their customers. So overall, it's looking good.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you for taking my questions, congratulations to management. Chandra, I just had one question on margins. I mean, I know it's been asked before, but if I look at your Y-o-Y average realized rate, you have depreciated 18% vis-a-vis the dollar in INR-USD terms. Logically this should have given you 600 basis points of margin upside, all else being the same. Now I understand that all of &#x2013; a good part of this might have been put back as investments in the business and some part probably as lazy cost, which can be pulled back.</p>
          <p>But if the rupee would appreciate from here, I just want to understand your ability to pull back and do you think that of the 600 basis points that rightly should have been the gap, you think maybe you could recover the fair portion of that, if need be, if the rupee <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:04) starts to strengthen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Viju, I think this question I have been asked before. As I said that, I think, we should avoid from translating, taking a particular margin when the rupee was INR46 or INR48 and translating it to say that this is the translation of upside, this is the way the dollar has moved against the rupee, then let's translate it immediately into the corresponding increase in the margins. I think I would like to really not suggest that we do that.</p>
          <p>Basically because &#x2013; I'll talk about two things; one is, even on the currency side, it's a basket of currencies always. It's not only the dollar, sometimes the incremental revenues can come from different parts of the world, different currencies, but leave that aside. From the business point of view, we always have to make calls, and we also don't want to be getting into unrealistic margin targets which we cannot sustain. So we see it as an opportunity to be able to take on either a transformational deal or invest more in a single market. We are invested in several emerging markets. There are times we decide, okay, now this is the time to go whole hog. So if you are currently operating in this level, should we be increasing our investment in this market, so that we can get to a critical mass and leverage the one-year window probably we have in order to do that. We make those kind of calls.</p>
          <p>Sometimes we look at our platform; sometimes we look at our market. LatAm, for example; every time we had an opportunity, we invested in LatAm. That's what we did over the last few years. And now, I think, I'm very happy with where we are in LatAm. We have a distinct advantage. We have great clients. We have the margin profile that's continuing to deliver every quarter better results. And we are expecting it to grow, and we will use these cycles to do things diligently. I mean, I don't want to get into very specifics.</p>
          <p>So whether we will pull back and then hit the number exactly on the quarter in which one would like, maybe 30 basis points here, 40 basis points there. But I think we should have the flexibility. I hope you all will understand and give us that flexibility.</p>
          <p>Overall, we think that this business has to be built with respectable margins, which is where we are, because it's going to require investments, and we are prepared to make those investments because the technology cycles are getting really rapid. And unless or otherwise we invest in those cycles and also invest in future offerings, whether it is platform-based play or something &#x2013; or product-based play, something else, we will find ourselves in a difficult situation later.</p>
          <p>So short answer to your question is that we kind of leverage when we get the upside and we remain confident that, that when the currency goes the other way, as long as is it a sensible shifts, we will manage that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Just one more question. Would you say that the environment for discretionary spending has probably picked up into the last three or four months, even if marginally, the mood's better with clients?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Diviya Nagarajan from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, congrats on a great quarter. I've been discussing this issue with you and Kedar in the past as well. But just looking at your top 10 clients, I understand some of them are significantly large where growth has slowed down versus the company average and that's been the trend for the last year or so.</p>
          <p>If I were to look ahead into fiscal 2014 and beyond, these are still 25% of your revenue. So what do you think will compensate for that sluggishness in growth, if you assume that this trend will continue, or if you think there will be a pickup in the top 10 in terms of growth rates and what will drive that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Diviya, the best way to look at it is that, first thing is that they are growing; absolute number, they are growing. And second thing is that I don't have any client-specific problems with any client. Any of these clients, we don't have any specific problems where we are compensating for huge drop of somebody with somebody else. There is no such thing.</p>
          <p>Then the next thing to look at is, we have a significant number of BFS clients. And you have seen that in the last several quarters the BFS growth has been muted and has been consistently lower than the company average. So when you have a large number of clients in the BFS segment and you should expect, and also telco clients have been growing slow when you took up the last four, six quarters. And growth has been coming in those clients, growth has been happening in those verticals, but they have been below the company average. So when you look at the LTM perspective, that will happen. And I don't think that that's a cause of worry and also as we grow larger, we should be prepared that all clients in the 10 bracket will not grow on the company average. Some will grow slower, some will grow faster. But we really look at agility, that's why we have the full services play. And we continue to engage, we continue to try and find and increase our share and increase our proximity and relationships with all these clients.</p>
          <p>So I'm, first of all, not concerned about the growth in the top 10 clients. And I would also say that I cannot uniformly say whether all of them will grow &#x2013; all of them will not grow on the company average. Given our quarter, at least half of them will grow above the company average and half of them will be either on or below the company average, which is okay for us.</p>
          <p>But there is also big clients in the next 10, or in the next 20, or in the next 30, which will grow very significantly, double the company average sometimes, and we need to be able to be very sharp in what we do with clients and be relevant all the time and there is no easy solution. The only thing I can say is every client we got to be relevant. How can we be more relevant? How can we understand what their pain points? How can we understand how they are investing in a relation? What is it that they are doing to reinvent themselves? And that's the question we ask. The only positive thing is we are much, much better prepared, positioned, and have acceptance and a brand, and a relevance of the market today than ever before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, right. And on the question of margins, I know we've spoken enough about it, but not enough. But I'm trying to understand, when you're looking at a pretty &#x2013; we seem to be currently in a very benign margin environment, currency is still a bit of a tailwind. We're looking at attrition coming off quite considerably with market hiring slowing down. Utilization continues to remain robust. I'm trying to understand for us to kind of maintain that 27% level. Other than pricing, what would be the key margin levers from here on?</p>

          <p>I would make couple of comments, then I'll leave it to Maha to answer. So I think, many of our investments and businesses, which we create, they are all continuing to improve margins, whether it is Diligenta, whether it's Latin America, whether it is some parts of Asia Pacific and some of the large-scale contracts, et cetera, and that will always be the case. And don't underestimate that. And some of these investments are made very consciously.</p>
          <p>Also I would like to remind &#x2013; recall that we did improve the margin from 22% to 28% without any currency advantage. So there are lot of things that we do, it's not simplistic. And we kind of have to take it as it comes from &#x2013; but we have levers and we will have to exercise the right ones. Maha, please.</p>

          <p>Diviya, this &#x2013; you need to look at it from a management standpoint. If you take the bulk of assignments of TCS, they deliver a certain gross margin. And we have &#x2013; we continue to monitor that and we make sure that they do that.</p>
          <p>When we talk about investments in some of the newer things or developing a new service line to deliver much higher, we need to go in with a slightly lower margin and then start improving them over a period, whether a different service line or it could be platform-based solutions that we have, or whatever they are. So those are &#x2013; the scale with that which we do that is going to be determined by the ability of this depreciated rupee and so on.</p>
          <p>As far as the SG&amp;A is concerned, we have taken &#x2013; we have controlled it very, very effectively because we have a good spread, but we have made sure that each of those offices keep delivering &#x2013; continue to deliver and increase revenue and so on. So there are &#x2013; there is a certain amount of cost control that is taking place as far as those SG&amp;A is concerned, and we are making sure that they deliver much higher revenue.</p>
          <p>So you'll have to look at it from an overall management pattern. As Chandra said, we have a focus on it. There could be differences from a quarter-on-quarter, one quarter, two quarter kind of perspective. But over a longer period of time, we think that, for instance, if the rupee appreciates significantly, we can certainly push margin improvement in some of these areas that we have invested quite a bit and also look at the choice of assignment, the kind of mix that we ought to have and so on.</p>
          <p>So that's the kind of play that we think we are. We are not essentially fighting a price war at this time. And therefore, I don't think that comes into the equation. So the margins are really all about costs and cost control.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Thanks so much for the detailed explanation, Chandra and Maha. Thanks, and have a good year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Pinku Pappan from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. Chandra, could you talk a little bit about the Telecom vertical, because I think last month when we met Maha, he was talking about not such a positive outlook there. So has anything changed, because this quarter you've seen a good growth there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think Telecom in general, as we have always said, has been a tough industry vertical. But we have won few engagements in the last three or four quarters, and that win has been giving us growth last quarter and this quarter as well. And again, we have signed up a couple of deals this quarter, and we are still not comfortable to say that Telecom is operating as any another vertical, because a lot of the existing clients, large-scale clients are not really growing the way you'd like.</p>
          <p>So we are getting growth. We are winning deals and getting growth, but we are compensating some of that on a large base. Not that we are dropping in many clients; it's just that the growth is pretty low or flattish in some clients. So that is why Maha mentioned it to you, probably in the last meeting, that telco is a soft vertical, and I would like to maintain that. But having said that, we have won deals and we are winning deals and we are ramping up, so we'll see some growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question is, since you confirmed winning the U.K. Criminal Records deal, could you talk about &#x2013; could you give us some details about the deal and maybe talk about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, we don't talk about specific deal details. All I would say is that it's a pretty good deal; it's pretty large, and we have started the engagement and we are getting off, we are right on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Has the revenues flowed in from this quarter or is it going to be from next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a full services deal. We have both IT and BPO, so it's a very nice deal. We like it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Chandra, my question is about the revenues. It started in 2Q itself or is it going to start from the next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will start next quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last question is, given how discretionary spending is coming back and you've seen growth there, do you think 2H revenue growth will turn out to be better than what you had initially assumed at the start of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, because the &#x2013; you mean the second half, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second half, 2H.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, I think the issue in Q3 is that December is pretty soft and we will definitely have furloughs, and we have seen repeatedly all the industrial clients, manufacturing, high-tech, even sometimes CPG retail. So we definitely see furloughs where we'll lose week, two weeks, sometimes three weeks, and that has to be taken into account. So Q3 will be soft and it has been soft every year. I don't have any data point to feel that it will be different this year, and Q3 will be soft. And so I will not say that H2 will be &#x2013; so we've always mentioned that H1 is &#x2013; will be stronger and &#x2013; but we will have growth and we will do well.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that was the last question. I now hand the conference over to the management for closing comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you all for joining us on a Friday evening. Really appreciate your time, and very quality interactions.</p>
          <p>We have had another strong quarter. As I mentioned, we are quite happy with the volume, with the well-roundedness of growth across industry, some vertical and markets. The deal closures have been good. The deal pipeline and the closure cycles are healthy. And our utilization is where it needs to be. Our employee addition is excellent. And our attrition &#x2013; rather retention is very good and attrition is being managed very well by our HR team. And our investments are in the right areas and those are yielding results and lot of traction from customers and willingness to partner with us in many co-creation opportunities. So we remain confident as we look into the future for this year and the next fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, and have a nice day and a great weekend.</p>
