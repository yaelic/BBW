          <p>Good afternoon and welcome to our First Quarter of the Year 2010 Conference call. Here with me is Scot Rank, who is our President and CEO of Wal-Mart de M&#xE9;xico y Centroam&#xE9;rica, and also Mariana Rodriguez.</p>
          <p>It is a pleasure for me to report good results for Wal-Mart de M&#xE9;xico y Centroam&#xE9;rica, an already integrated international company through our consolidating the Central America beginning March 1 of this year. To make it easier to understand, we will start by looking at Mexico results first.</p>
          <p>Scot, would you start with Mexico's numbers please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rafael. I think results for Mexico were good especially as we are slowly coming back from last year's crisis, and consumers continue to be cautious on their spending. Gross margin had an excellent performance despite the investment in prices. It was 21.8% in Mexico, 60 basis points higher than the last year's first quarter.</p>
          <p>Some reasons for this improvement in gross margin are the following. More discretionary formats like Suburbia and Vips that have higher margins had a very good quarter this year, while last year they underperformed. Also all self-service formats and clubs increased their gross margin as a result of better inventory management.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned in our fourth quarter '09 conference call, we ended 2009 with efficient inventory levels. This allowed for fewer markdowns due to less seasonal clearance, better in-stock levels and better inventory mix. Now the biggest challenge this quarter was expenses. They increased 12.7%. It is important to highlight that we opened 275 new stores during the previous 12 months. We also had the effects of the increase in depreciation and rents related to these 275 openings, and significant remodeling investments particular in our Bodega Aurrera business format. So there you have the slide which is the summary of the Mexico first quarter results.</p>
          <p>Next slide, I'd like to highlight the increase in the number of customers we served. In Mexico our customer accounts increased 17.2% in total stores and 5.3% in comparable stores. It is very important to highlight that all our different formats are performing well in Mexico and had positive sales.</p>
          <p>Same stores sales for Mexico grew 4.4% and 4.0% for self-service stores, as Suburbia and Vips outpaced the self service growth this quarter. Within self-service format, Bodega and Wal-Mart had the strongest growth; Bodega, driven by customers and Wal-Mart with a very good mix of growth in customers and average ticket.</p>
          <p>On the next slide we can see that our efforts and prices are paying off and we continue to grow faster than the rest of the market. Despite the tougher comparison with last year, as I just mentioned Walmex same store sales for the self-service formats in Mexico grew 4.0% for the first quarter of 2010, while same store sales for the industry as measured by the National Retail Association, ANTAD, if we exclude Walmex increased only 1.2%. In terms of total sales our self-service formats grew in Mexico 10.9% compared with 4.4% growth of ANTAD excluding Walmex. Our gap versus the rest of market increased this both &#x2013; increased this year, both in comparable stores and total stores.</p>
          <p>Now let's move from Mexico into Central America, Central America operations had an excellent first quarter and though we are only consolidating March figures in our Walmex numbers total income increased 6% on a constant currency basis. Increasing gross margin and a lower level of expenses allowed for operating income to grow a strong 16%.</p>
          <p>As you know, one of the main priorities in Central America is the integration of all stores and distribution centers into Wal-Mart systems. So I'll share with you our current progress. Costa Rica, Nicaragua are the most advanced countries in this transition. Costa Rica already integrated all stores into Wal-Mart systems and will migrate the first distribution center in June of this year. Nicaragua has migrated eight stores and will finish with the remaining 47 stores by July 2010. Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador will have pilot tests in 2010 and will migrate all stores during the year 2011.</p>
          <p>Now let's move into the consolidated results for Mexico and Central America. As we said before, we are consolidating only March information for Central America. So the Walmex total consolidated results for the first quarter are showing the following. Operating margin and EBITDA are higher in the Mexican operation than in Central America. Gross margin is 50 basis points higher in Central America than in Mexico but expenses as a percent of sales were 250 basis points also higher. As a result Central America's operating margin is 200 basis points lower than Mexico.</p>
          <p>Operating margin is 8.0% for Mexico in the first quarter, 6.0% for Central America in March, and 7.9% for Walmex in the first quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>EBITDA as a percentage of sales is 9.9% in Mexico, 7.7% for Central America in the month of March, and 9.8% for the consolidated Walmex figures in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>This is how the consolidated numbers and the growth versus last year look. Total income grew 17% while operating income, EBITDA and net income all grew more than sales. I would like to highlight gross margin that increased 21% and went from 21.2 in the first quarter of '09 to 21.8% in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>The biggest challenge was expenses. These increased 30 basis points compared to last year's level. As I said before, Mexico, the main increases came from depreciation, rents, remodels and this explains 20 basis points of the consolidated increase in expenses.</p>
          <p>The other 10 basis points of increase come from the consolidation of Central America as expenses as a percent of sales are 250 basis points higher than in Mexico. Now Rafael, why don't we move to the comments on the balance sheet?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Scot. As of the end of the first quarter our cash position amounted to MXN17.1 billion, MXN 6.3 billion more than last year. The cash comes from the operation. 14 billion correspond to Mexico retail, one billion to Banco Wal-Mart and 2.1 billion to Wal-Mart Central America, MXN17.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Inventories, at the end of the first quarter amounted to MXN26 billion, MXN5.9 billion more than last year as we incorporated 519 stores from Central America and we opened 275 new units in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Accounts payable to suppliers increased 38.2%, which positively compared with a 29.4% increase in inventory. Supplier financing was 115%. Inventory for the Mexican operation increased 13% while accounts payable to suppliers grew 21%, thus improving supplier financing from 108% to 116%. Central America also operates with a negative working capital requirement. Supplier financing was 112%.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rafael. So far this year we have opened 20 units one Bodega Aurrera, three Mi Bodegas, 10 Bodega Aurrera Express, one Wal-Mart Supercenter, two Sam's Club, one Superama, one Suburbia and one Restaurantes. So we now have 2,010 units in Mexico and Central America. Additionally we have opened 15 new bank branches in Mexico.</p>
          <p>As we announced at our annual analyst meeting, this year we will open 300 stores in Mexico and 30 in Central America, increasing in each region 11.35% installed capacity respectively. We will also open up 168 bank branches.</p>
          <p>Additionally, this year we will open a new distribution center in Villahermosa, Tabasco and we will automate an existing distribution center in Mexico City. Both will be ready by July 2010, increasing our distribution network to 25 distribution centers, 14 in Mexico and 11 in Central America, and contributing to improving our already efficient logistics network.</p>
          <p>The Mexicali earthquake, we've always stated that our people make the difference and this was evident last April 4, when Baja, California and neighboring states recorded an earthquake that measured 7.2 on the Richter scale. The most affected was Mexicali where we have 11 units that reported differing degrees of losses or damages. Nevertheless the teamwork of our associates at all levels was extraordinary, thus enabling us to reopen 10 units, guaranteeing the supply of many necessary items.</p>
          <p>Sustainability, on April 1 we began using wind power to supply energy to 348 Wal-Mart de M&#xE9;xico units. The plants will enable us &#x2013; the plant, wind plant, I'm sorry, will enable us to advance our company's goal of increasing renewable energy supply.</p>
          <p>With the energy furnished by the plant we will avoid emitting 137,000 tons of CO2 each year, which is equivalent to taking 21,000 cars permanently off the road. The park is located in La Ventosa, Oaxaca and it has 27 wind generators with a capacity of 2.5 megawatts each, hence total capacity of 67.5 megawatts.</p>
          <p>Now, before ending the conference, I think Rafael that you wanted to comment on some recognition that we recently have received.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I am very proud to let you know that for the 10th consecutive year we record &#x2013; we were recognized as a Social Responsible Company by the Mexican Center of Philanthropy (CEMEFI) and the Alliance for Social Responsibility in Mexico (AliaRSE). We were one of the 10 companies and the only retailer that has received this recognition for 10 consecutive years.</p>
          <p>World Finance magazine awarded us recognition as a company with the Best Corporate Governance in Mexico. Euromoney Magazine awarded us recognition as the company with the most convincing and coherent strategy in Mexico, and also the company with the most convincing and coherent strategy in the retail sector in all Latin America. <mark type="inaudible" /> de Nogocios Magazine awarded Wal-Mart Centroamerica recognition for the second consecutive year as the most admired multinational company in the region.</p>
          <p>And I would like to remind you that this year the cash dividend of MXN0.70 approved at our last shareholders' meeting will be paid tomorrow, this is April 16. And the split for the two new shares for each existing one are approved and agreed by our Board of Directors will take place on April 23.</p>
          <p>Finally, before ending this conference call, I would like to comment that in April we have a very challenging sales comparison. Mainly because of a less travelled Easter timing and also because we had very strong sales during last week of April of last year as consumers made additional purchases during the flu scare that we had last year. I remind you that last year same-store sales for the month of April were 9.1%.</p>
          <p>Well, thank you very much and with this we end our conference call for the first quarter results. And I remind you that we are available to receive any calls or questions that you may have. Thank you very much.</p>
