          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the H&amp;M Three Month Report. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct the question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And just to remind you, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to the Chairperson, Nils Vinge. Please begin your meeting, sir, and I'll be standing by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&amp;M's first quarter results. The presentation slides are found on our Web site, hm.com. Our CFO, Jyrki Tervonen, is with me today, and we'll be happy to answer your questions after the presentation.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the slide First Quarter 2011. Spanning from December to February, the first quarter was demanding in many ways. The weather was unfavorable in several markets, primarily in December.</p>
          <p>Consumption was restrained in many markets, and there were more markdown and price activities than usual. Conditions were tough also in the sourcing market with accelerating cost inflation, and our main sourcing currency, the U.S. dollar, moved against us.</p>
          <p>Looking at top line, sales grew 9% in local currencies. Converted into SEK, sales decreased 1% to SEK 24.5 billion. Sales in comparable units were up by 1%.</p>
          <p>Looking at sales in our market, please turn to the slide Sales Per Market. We are happy with the development in North America and in Asia, where China, Hong Kong and South Korea all performed very well. Russia was strong, and we see great demand for H&amp;M to open also in the regions outside of Moscow and St. Petersburg.</p>
          <p>Switzerland, Austria and Norway were weaker, but elsewhere in Europe, sales were good in large markets such as Germany, Sweden and Italy. The U.K. too developed well.</p>
          <p>We believe that one important explanation for the positive development in many markets is our further improved customer offering. We have also invested to give customers an even more inspiring shopping experience in H&amp;M stores worldwide.</p>
          <p>The large discrepancy between sales in local currencies and reported currency in the quarter was due to the significant strengthening of the Swedish krona, which deflated top line by 10%. As an increased service to the market we will start publishing the actual quarterly sales figure in SEK ahead of the quarterly reports in connection with our announcement of the monthly sales development in percent.</p>
          <p>Starting already on June 15th, we will publish not only the sales increase in percent for May, but also the actual total sales number in SEK for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Going back to the first quarter, please return to the Slide First Quarter 2011. Gross profit in the quarter was SEK 14.2 billion corresponding to a gross margin of 57.8%, down from the high comparable of 61.9% in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>When comparing the two quarters, one should keep in mind that the first quarter last year benefited greatly from low earning per cost caused by very favorable external factors. And as you all know, these factors reversed, and were strongly against us when we sourced our products for Q1 2011.</p>
          <p>Raw material prices have increased dramatically, most notably the price of cotton, our most important input material, which doubled last year. Trade costs too have increased, and at the same time, capacity at the suppliers increased and the dollar strengthened especially against the euro.</p>
          <p>Comparison is also affected by our old currency hedging policy which had a positive effect of 80 basis points in Q1 2010, and looking at the comparison ahead for Q2 2010, there was a positive effect of 50 basis points. The effect year-on-year will disappear in Q3.</p>
          <p>Markdowns in relation to sales in the first quarter were at the same level as the year before, and thus the effect on the gross margin was neutral year-on-year. We want our customers to always find value for money in H&amp;M, in line with our business concept, fashion and quality at the best price. Like we said before, the gross margin is not and never will be a target in itself.</p>
          <p>We follow closely the conditions in our market, both in the sourcing markets and in the sales market, and for the first quarter we chose not to pass on the increased input cost to our customers. Instead, we strengthened our price position in order to further strengthen H&amp;M's position in the market long term.</p>
          <p>And looking at cost, SG&amp;A was SEK 10.8 billion, an increase of 3% in SEK and 12% in local currencies, mostly related to our expansion. The increase was also due mainly to higher spending in marketing, IT and online, investments that we do in order to strengthen the H&amp;M brand further, as well as to create an even better platform for profitable growth long term.</p>
          <p>The operating margin was 13.9% against 20% last year. Net financial items were SEK 130 million compared to SEK 77 million last year, and profit after financial items was SEK 3.6 billion compared to SEK 5 billion a year ago.</p>
          <p>Tax rates applied for the quarter was 26%, and net profit was SEK 2.6 billion, corresponding to earnings per share of SEK 1.58. And as you know, the number of shares was doubled on the 1st of June last year as a result of our 2:1 share split.</p>
          <p>Before we move on to our expansion, a few words on what has happened after the end of the first quarter. In March there has, as you all know, been a terrible disaster in Japan. Our thoughts are with all the people in Japan and with Japan as a nation.</p>
          <p>All this time our highest priority has been the safety of our employees and our customers. Therefore, we closed our nine stores in Tokyo area for up to two weeks. Following independent safety inspections, all stores are now open again.</p>
          <p>Today we have published our sales development figure for the 1st to the 29th of March. Sales have increased 3% in local currencies compared to the same period last year. The development should be seen in the light of a very strong comparable. Sales rose 21% in March last year. It was the strongest month last spring. Unlike this year, March 2010 included part of the Easter holiday.</p>
          <p>We have strong collections for the upcoming season. In mid April we are launching Conscious, a spring and summer collection made of environmentally smarter materials, such as organic cotton, organic linen, recycled polyester and Tencel.</p>
          <p>Sustainability is becoming an increasingly important part of H&amp;M's offering. With Conscious Collection we are following up on the Garden Collection which was a great success last year in March. Only this time the collection will be available for the whole family.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M continued its store and online expansion in the first quarter. We opened six stores net in the quarter, and had a total of 2,212 stores in 38 countries at the end of February, franchise and our own other brands included.</p>
          <p>Since then, H&amp;M has successfully opened its first two stores in Romania, and is now present in 39 markets. The response from customers at the opening in Bucharest last weekend was great, and exceeded our high expectations.</p>
          <p>Already next week the first H&amp;M store will open also in Zagreb in Croatia where people have expressed a great demand for H&amp;M to open not least via social media. All-in-all we will enter five new markets in 2011, including franchise stores in Morocco and Jordan, and our move into Southeast Asia with the opening of H&amp;M on Orchard Road in Singapore in August.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we expand also in existing markets. We plan to open stores in all of them this year with China, the U.K. and the U.S. being the largest expansion markets. The expansion plan remains intact. Like we communicated in January, we plan to open a net of approximately 250 stores this year within our target of growing by 10% to 15% new stores per year.</p>
          <p>We also continue the expansion of online and catalogue sales where we see strong potential for future growth. We are gradually rolling out the new H&amp;M Online Store and around the turn of the year, we plan to start online sales in the U.S. We see great opportunities also for our other brands, COS, H&amp;M Home, Monki, Weekday and Cheap Monday.</p>
          <p>Those were a few comments on our expansion, and now looking at some key figures for Q1, please turn to the slide Key Data. Stock-in-trade was SEK 10.8 billion, an increase of 29% compared to the same time last year, and 33% in local currency.</p>
          <p>The increase can be explained by the expansions, but should also be seen in the light of last year's historically low level, and the fact that sales in the quarter did not increase as much as planned. The stock-in-trade was well balanced with a larger share of spring garments compared to the same time last year.</p>
          <p>In relation to sales, the stock-in-trade was 10% rolling 12 months compared to an exceptionally low 8.2% last year and still at a good level historically. Cash flow from current operations was SEK 761 million, which is down considerably from the first quarter last year. The main reasons are the profit was not as high as last year while stock-in-trade, current liabilities and tax paid were all higher.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we invested SEK 807 million mainly in new stores. Our investment plan for the year remains unchanged, which means an increase of around 20% in local currency. Meanwhile, our finances remain strong. Liquid funds and short term investments amounted to SEK 24.3 billion. Return on equity was 39.3% rolling 12 months.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, it's with great respect still for the prevailing conditions, both in the consumer and sourcing markets. These are clearly demanding times. At the same time, we are optimistic about the opportunities for H&amp;M.</p>
          <p>Our plan remains to increase sales in comparable units for the full year. We are a company that acts long term, and with our strong business concept and further improved customer offering we have strengthened our position even more. Thus, we have created a new and better platform for continued profitable growth for many years to come.</p>
          <p>We're now happy to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from the line of Richard Chamberlain [Bank of America Merrill Lynch]. Please go ahead, and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, gents.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Richard here from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just a question, if I could kick off with a question on the inventory level. Wondered if you could say whether we should expect increased markdown in the second quarter because of the high inventory level at the end of the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The increase in local currency is 33%, and as we always have said, the stock is a snapshot of a certain moment of time. And the reason for the quite high increase in percentage is, as Nils also said, due to normal expansion, but also that we are meeting first quarter last year when we have a historical low stock-in-trade level. I remembered the discussions one year ago sitting in the telephone conference, and a lot of you guys were a little bit worried about the level, but we were confident, and we produced plus 21% in March last year.</p>
          <p>So we are still having it on a good level. It's 10% of rolling 12 months turnover, and last year it was 8.2%. So that was really, really low. The composition of the stock is considered good and with a larger share of spring garments, and when it comes to the question of markdowns, it's far too early because we have two strong months, April and May, ahead of us still, so that we have to come back to in connection with the Q2 report.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just on that then, how much of the inventory increase related to expansion? And how much due to sales being lower than planned in percentage terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have exactly the figures, but of course, the expansion and the growth there is more or less on the same levels. We expand by 10%. It's more or less in the increase of stock, but the main reason is just that last year it was really low, and as we said last year, the stock-in-trade it can differ almost up to SEK 1 billion within one week.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right. Okay. Okay. Thank you. And just if I may, a question on the pricing in the quarter, wondered if the price gap is changing between markets? I think historically you've talked about pricing being within a 10% range plus or minus of Sweden, and I wondered if that's now widening between markets, so it's still within the 10% band?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Nils here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Nils.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I can't remember when we have quantified the price band, but we've always said that our price positioning remains the same in our market, but the prices can vary due to different cost levels and VAT, competition, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So what did average selling prices do then during Q1? How much &#x2013; were they up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We prefer not to comment on the average selling prices, but we do &#x2013; we are very clear with the fact that we have not passed on the input price, cost increase to the consumers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So did prices go up, but not so much as competitors? Or prices actually came down during the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as Nils said, what we are saying is that we didn't &#x2013; we chose not to pass these increased input cost to the customers, and how we have been reacting on what kind of decisions we have made when it comes to our pricing that we really want to keep to ourselves for competitive reasons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Fraser Ramzan [Nomura International]. Please go ahead, and announce your company name. Fraser Ramzan?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Fraser at Nomura in London.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just a quick question about the lead times on your buying. Am I right to understand you're buying around a six months lead time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the lead time is an often misinterpreted word, and what I've been saying is that the time from we place an order until you see these things come through in the figures is roughly six months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But lead times can vary from a few weeks in extreme case to more than six months, of course. But it all depends on what kind of products you're talking about, and so to have an average is, as I said, very often misinterpreted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But the bulk of what you have sold this quarter you probably purchased between, I don't know, June and August last year. Is that a fair assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The bulk, very simply if I put it, it's six months, so we talk about Q1 the bulk is bought in Q3, the bulk of the orders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So in that case over the next two quarters is it reasonable to assume that factors such as the increased cotton cost, which you have the chart in your presentation, will be even more relevant for you? Because the spike we saw in raw materials was even more pronounced at the end of 2010 rather than in the summer of last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to cotton prices it's, of course, difficult to &#x2013; the lead times. We don't buy cotton directly. It's our suppliers who buy the fabric, et cetera, but the whole industry was affected, clearly affected last autumn. But to conclude, to summarize. Yes, the sourcing conditions were very difficult and demanding throughout the autumn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But what you just reported was product you bought in late summer, not during the autumn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. And then if I may ask one other question, perhaps a more positive question. Why do you think your U.S. business is performing so well?  It really stands out in like-for-like terms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are very happy, and I'm glad you noticed it, and this has been &#x2013; we've been talking about the U.S. for some years now that we have seen. We've been optimistic, and things are going in the right direction, even two years ago when things were looking very bad for the whole industry in the U.S. But we see this as a clear received sign of the fact that the investments we've done and improved customer offering is working and the customers appreciate what we do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is it any different to any other markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's actually the same offering in all our markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Different, competitive and consumer environment maybe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little, you've obviously increased your marketing spend. You've invested in the product, keeping your prices let's say stable for the competitive environment, but the like-for-like hasn't really been coming through. I know it varies a lot by market. Do you feel like you're investing sufficiently? Or will you have to actually increase the investment in the product and increase the investment in marketing to try to drive a more, a punchier for like-for-like? And is there a like-for-like that you guys are actually targeting at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of questions are the same questions. But yes, I mean, we will always improve. We're working hard to improve our offering because it's a very difficult, tough competition, but we definitely see it. I mean, we take the development last year, we increased 15% in local currencies and 5% in like-for-like, and so we see that as a receipt of the fact that the investment worked.</p>
          <p>But as I said this, is a long-term effort we do and you shouldn't judge just from a quarter. But we clearly increased sales also in this quarter by 9% in local currencies and 1% in like-for-like. So we lived up to the targets we had to increase sales in existing stores, even though we had planned for even more increase, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so you're, I guess, happy is probably not the right word, but 1% to 2% like-for-like you're willing to spend as much as you are in marketing to try to drive low single digit like-for-like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Nils said, it's a combination, of course. A lot of those investments we are doing in the custom offering, in the marketing, in IT online. They are really done on a long-term basis as well. And looking back, as Nils said, we are producing 1% up in like-for-like in a quarter with a tough consumer climate, and looking backwards and the conditions during the Q1 with quite heavy storms in December, for instance. And having that in mind, then we are happy with the like-for-like plus 1. Plus as Nils said, we had planned a slightly higher one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And with a 33% increase in inventory, what sort of a like-for-like do you expect that to equate to?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't give any forecast when it comes to like-for-like, but as we said, we always planned for positive like-for-like.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. It's Anne Critchlow from SG [Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale], and I've got a question about some departures you've had over the past year. I know you've lost your design director, the brand director and creative director. Wondered if that had had an impact at all on your ranges or the performance? And does it explain the lower like-for-like sales trends that we're seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean, H&amp;M is much about a team work, and despite, I mean, I'm sorry they left us because they were very good guys, but we have a very strong team and even though they are very strong, they haven't &#x2013; I can't blame the results on those guys <mark type="indiscernible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then just one more question on Japan where sales fell 2% in local currency terms in Q1, and that was only at the end of February. You had almost twice as many stores as last year. I wondered if you could explain the decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's true that even before the earthquake we had &#x2013; it was a tough market in Japan, but you should keep in mind that the opening effect in Japan was tremendous. We had extraordinary sales in the first stores, and of course, as we open more stores, the sales are spread in more stores. So it's a pretty normal development you see there, but the general conditions in Japan have been very tough for the whole month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And I think as Nils said, of course, there is a cannibalistic effect. We have nine out of 10 stores is in the Tokyo area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Credit Suisse. Afternoon, gents. Couple of things, a very simple question. I just wondered how long you expect to have to reposition the brand or to reinforce the brand or whatever is you think you're doing with the brand?  That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Take that first. Again, we've just been discussing this. We don't see it as a repositioning. I think the strategy of the company remains very much intact, but the environment changes all the time and we've seen an opportunity to investing more in the customer offering, which we have been doing last year. And I think it pays off. So that's the best answer I can give you. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you presume that you're already bought for six months in advance, et cetera. So are you going to continue to invest to actually improve the brand in a sort of general type of way over that period? How much closer are you to achieving what you set out to achieve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we always strive to improve our customer offering, but the conditions vary, of course. And exactly how we're going to do it going forward, I'm sorry, again, for competitive reasons I will refrain to answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but our goal will always be to have the best offer in each market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fine. Just one different area. Have you actually changed the base upon which you're committing to stock, given the sort of conditions in the market and maybe less availability of top up stock within the season? Have you committed more coming into a season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean the sourcing, Tony, where we source? Or how much we value season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much you commit firm at the beginning of this season versus how much you expect to chase during the season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's pretty much the same as...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's always a balance, of course. But from a geographical perspective, we have increased sourcing a little bit in Asia last year, so it's more about 75%-ish Asia and the rest Europe, which also reflects, of course, the more presence we have in retail business in China and Asia, which is quite normal then.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Simon Irwin. Please go ahead, and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. It's actually Simon Irwin at Liberum Capital. Can you just talk a bit about the markets, some of the market you're in, in terms of how you think they're behaving?  I mean, it looks, though, there's quite a lot of companies like yourselves who are not passing on the increases, and certainly on a net level. And I mean can you just talk a little bit about kind of pricing within markets, since clearly this is something you're looking at very, very closely?  And also how that relates to inventory, I mean, do you think there's a lot of people out there with a lot of inventory? And are you seeing kind of price rises effectively being negated by higher levels of promotion in these markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Simon. There was a lot of questions at the same time. Could you take it one at a time, please? What do you want to start with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of obviously you're trying to improve your relative pricing. What do you think your peers have done in your major markets in terms of pricing over the last say three months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It all varies, and depending as I said on the different markets, and I don't want to go in <mark type="indiscernible" /> on different markets. But I think it depends also what kind of lead times the different competitors or peers work with. We are &#x2013; since we have pretty quick forward lead times compared to many peers we actually affected quicker than many others.</p>
          <p>So it's difficult to just look at to give you a simple answer to that question. But many, as you know, many peers have been forced to start to raise their prices, and that's why this is actually an opportunity for us if we can keep our prices even to improve our gap to the competitors even more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And are you seeing more promotions and discounting outside of those price rises?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we saw, as we commented in the quarter, was that as December was &#x2013; things have been tough in those markets, it led to more price activities and markdowns in January and also in February in many markets. And of course, that increases the competition in the short-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could I just ask about store openings? Relatively small number in the quarter, and the impact from them was slightly less than we might have expected. Are your average store size &#x2013; is your average store size of new stores coming down a bit as you mix into the other brands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's too early to talk about the space conversion. It has so far been slightly lower than last year. And as we've discussed before, it depends on many different factors, and of course, store mix is one of them. And depending on, for example, if we open more in China and the U.S. where sales tend to differ, still lower than the group, so that is a fact, yes. But it's also roundings and the proportional online, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Just another question on pricing. In your comments during the presentation you said specifically you decided not to raise your prices in the first quarter. Does that mean that you have raised your prices in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again we, for competitive reasons we prefer not to give you any guidance how we go forward, but we will always try to have the best customer offering in each market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's now try another one. A number of your competitors have given figures for the scale of inflation in their supply chain costs round about 8% for the first half. Have you done better than that in terms of the rates of inflation you're seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've heard figures all over the place. I'm sorry, I won't answer that, but we definitely are affected of the input &#x2013; increases, but it depends on where you buy and how you buy, and so I can't give you more guidance. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well one more I'll try.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On stock levels, again, that 33% increase you said was only a snapshot and affected by the flow through of stock. Have you got a figure that you can give us for current stock levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't comment current situation. We have to come back to that in connection with Q2, but as we said, we don't feel this is a dramatical thing because it will &#x2013; it can vary quite a lot within just one or two weeks. So we are confident that we have a good level of stock, and also the composition of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then just, well one last one while I'm on. Elasticity, price elasticity, I think you were saying earlier on this morning that there was very low price elasticity in your markets. Was that a correct interpretation of what you were saying this morning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually didn't comment the elasticity, but there was a question raised and we said that it's very difficult to give a number on the aggregated level, but you have to go down to specific product to look at it, and it of course, varies from product to product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But where you have in areas where you may have reduced prices are you seeing a volume response?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, we talk about the total customer offering, and it's not just about price. It's about fashion, et cetera and the materials and the quality and the price and how we show it to the customers. Now I think, as I said, 2010 clearly shows that this has worked, and if you look at in Q1 there are some markets where you clearly see that we developed much better than the general market. Sweden, for example, where it's been minus 3 or something in the quarter, and we have plus 3 in our sales.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Yeah. Well, we don't give you that because it's so theoretical, but I mean the currencies, as you know, if you go back two quarters, the euro/dollar was more than 10% more expensive.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just for the record. This morning you said that you expected the U.S. dollar to continue to impact negatively in Q2 as you expect the sourcing cost to continue to impact negatively in Q2?</p>

Apparently some of your customers phoned to complain about H&amp;M temporarily moving its operations to Osaka because it's a very sensitive topic over there, and some people were upset that foreigners left Tokyo.

          <p>So they really understood that it was not just going away like I know that it was a lot of criticism that the foreigners even left Japan, but the response but the response from the customers was actually positive when they understood the reasons why we have closed our stores.</p>

          <p>Fraser Ramzan at Nomura back again. Sorry, just one further question about operating expenses. Looking at my notes from last quarter you said like-for-like operating expenses rose by about 7%, and I think my memory of that was you'd had a good third quarter and thought that it was worth putting more staff into the stores for Christmas, and then of course the sales didn't turn out how you expected. What are like-for-like operating costs done in the quarter just gone?  Are they &#x2013; they're clearly up, but probably not by as much, and have you kind of pulled back a little bit on staff levels in store, given the sales experience?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The SG&amp;A OpEx is up 3% in Swedish kronor, and 12% in local currencies and the main reason are relating to the investments in marketing and IT and online, and when it comes to staffing we are confident and having a good cost control, so this is according to the plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you have pulled back on your store staff investment which was more significant last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But this will vary from quarter to quarter because as we said in connection with the Q4, for instance marketing investments they are differently intense depending on what quarter it is. So for instance in Q4, which is more marketing intense quarter, the impact of that is, of course, higher than in Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And these marketing and online initiative when will they annualize the step-up in costs that you see? And when do you expect them to annualize?  Is it in Q3 or do we have to wait till Q4 really?</p>

          <p>Loud and clear.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just two questions, please. Firstly, you mentioned that the sales entities in markets like China and United States was one of the reasons why the conversion ratio was slightly lower in the first quarter than last year. Is that because of ramp up? Or is the structural sales entity in these markets lower than the group average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's because to say really because we are &#x2013; I think it's a combination, to be honest, but in the U.S., I mean it's not a ramp up any longer as we've been there for so many years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think it's a combination, Rebecca.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the Chinese sales entity, I mean I know it's relatively early, but are they sort of noticeably different to the group average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, could you repeat? I didn't hear &#x2013; quite hear your question or questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The China sales entity, is it currently sort of noticeably different to the group average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's still over the average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But as you say, I mean the ramp up is, of course, interesting. As the economy grows in China and we are becoming a bigger brand there should be an interesting ramp up, and we're quite pleased with the development in China. And the expansion for this year looks very interesting with today the plan is to add around 35 stores, so it will clearly be the biggest expansion market this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And my second question just in terms of sort of budgeting going forward, so you're expecting a low single digit positive like-for-like in 2011. Have you sort of revised down your sort of inventory budgeting in view of the lower than expected revenues in the first quarter? Or are you just sort of maintaining the budgeting level in the sort of expectation that like-for-like should improve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rebecca, I mean, if this is a confusion or misunderstanding. We haven't guided financing or we always plan for positive like-for-like, and this is continuously revised or re-budgeted on a weekly basis, so to speak. So always looking out into the planned incoming and planned sales, et cetera. So this is something we do on an ongoing basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And if we don't plan for it then it will be really hard to gather positive like-for-like. Of course, we have to plan if when it comes to our sourcing, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Stephen Alt from <mark type="ph" /> Seer Global. I just have two questions. One, is it fair to say that actually ideally you wouldn't raise any prices for the whole year because in raising prices you would actually be disappointing your customers, and really customers in the long-term of the company are really the main priority?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's correct that we are always having a long-term view when it comes to our customer offering and how we will do in the future and what we have done. That we will keep for our self, but of course, we always have the customer in our focus speaking to our business idea long-term. So in that sense...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess that would be similar to your competitors. Inditex has said that essentially it's not looking to raise prices either. And then the second question I have is the gross margin in this quarter of 57.8%, while they're lower than last year, historically they're still at good levels. Would you say that basically looking forward margins in the high 50s are actually quite good, and so good for the long-term sort of perspective for the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we said, the gross margin is not a goal in itself for us. It's always about to have the best custom offer in each market, and that will of course, be then the result will be the gross margin, and that will of course, vary from time to time. Any long term perspective no one knows how the industry will develop. So it's a moving target all the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And last question. If we look at the cotton price, I think sort of similar to another question that was on the call. We actually are seeing the bulk of the acceleration of the input costs happening in Q3 and potentially Q4, the biggest change year-on-year. So the greatest pressure actually will be in the second half of the year. Is that the way you think about it as well from an input cost standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you referring to the input cost acceleration that in Q3 &#x2013; are you referring to Q3 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Q3 2011. So basically because we have to look with cotton prices six months back</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Essentially when we look at that, that means essentially the biggest impact will actually be in the second half of this year, and we haven't really seen the impact much yet because cotton price hardly moved six months ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you can't just look...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> So it moved...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can't just look at the cotton price because we don't buy cotton directly, as I said before. But I would say, and there are so many different factors in the total input costs, but all-in-all, I would say that, I mean, it was difficult throughout the fall, and it has &#x2013; it's on the same level I would say or I mean then some, if you break it down, capacity actually looks bit better today than in the fall.</p>
          <p>And the U.S. dollar was very much against us, and now it has reversed and for the garments we buy for Q4 actually there's a slight possible effect today year-on-year on the euro/dollar. So you have to look in all the different parts in order to really understand the question, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This positive effect for currencies how much could it be on the positive side for gross margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't break out all the details to quantify them, but all-in-all it's still a very challenging sourcing market for Q2 and Q3.</p>

        <plist>

          <p>Sorry, just a follow-up on what Rebecca was saying on about you always planning for positive like for likes. Assuming that prices do go up at some stage, do you always plan on positive volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on the pricing, of course, but over time in the long-term we always adapt to the conditions in the sourcing and the sales markets. That's all I can say, and we plan for a positive like-for-like, but to break it down in the value and volumes I prefer not to do.</p>

          <p>Hi, gents. Sorry to bother you. It's a question for Mr. Tervonen. I just wondered we've been sort of talking about targets and what you're trying to do in terms of your customers, so I just wondered as the CFO if you could tell us what financial targets the group has?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Of course, we always have a target to have strong financials. That's the one of the strength of H&amp;M to really have a long-term view in our business. So, of course, we're always evaluating all the measures we are doing that will remain a strong financial company and that is actually the situation. We have store financials, and we'll remain working as we have done for many, many years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's just I suspect most people listening to this call probably don't think you've got that strong financials at the moment, and apart from the fact you've got lots of cash. I just wondered if you &#x2013; what your views are on creating shareholder value and how you would measure that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we are thinking, when we are acting long term we think that will create also shareholders' value in the long-run. And of course, for long term investors that is the proof that we have shown in the history is that we're always thinking about the long-term wealth of the company, and at the same time for our shareholders.</p>

          <p>Yes. It's Katharine Wynne from Investec here. Apologies if this has already been addressed, as I haven't heard all the call, but I just wanted to come back on your sourcing strategy in terms of geographical location. You suggested that you've increased your Far Eastern sourcing to 75%. Can you indicate how much that's moved over the last six to 12 months and whether you expect to move it further? Or make any further changes going forward?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. This is, of course, something that varies over time and if we're looking at longer perspective, if you go back 10 years ago it was roughly 50% Asia, rest mainly Europe and this is something, as I said, it's varies. If you go back a year ago it was &#x2013; we talked about two-thirds until pretty recently, to be honest. But this is something that could change in the other direction as well, but right now it's more 75:25 than two-thirds, one-third.</p>

          <p>Yes, hi. This is Anna-Karin Envall from ABG in Stockholm. It would be very helpful, as <mark type="ph" /> Enotech said last week that launching as far as e-commerce in 16 countries in Europe did cost roughly &#x20AC;12 million, and also an expensive rollout for this year shouldn't cost more than that. Can you give us an idea how much your rollout so far has been costing and how much the further expansion will cost?  Just give us an idea?</p>

          <p>Yes, hello. Anna-Karin from ABG again. Can you just give us some flavors on the start of the second quarter? We know that March you have tough comps and you also had some kind of one-off positive effects perhaps from last year boosting the numbers last year. What was that? And which are not repeated this year, and how should we look upon the Easter holiday in April do you think in your perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a very short period to comment really because as we always say, you should look at the development over a whole season, but spring are always very difficult because it depends from year-to-year when the warm weather comes, and you have all the holidays, et cetera.</p>
          <p>But if you take Easter, as I said last year, part of the holiday time which is positive for sales because people go shopping and they don't work, that came in March last year and which it won't be this year. This year the Easter will be in late April, so you'll have the positive and the negative part of April, and then regarding March last year, again, it was the strongest month in the quarter last year whereas April and May were quite weak last year and it was pretty cold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but still, March and it's still a challenging consumer environment, but we strongly believe in our collection still, but as also in the press conference this morning as we said, it's a challenging consumer environment with a lot of consumers facing cost inflation, fuel prices going up, energy prices, et cetera, so it will be a tough environment ahead as well.</p>
