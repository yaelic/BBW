          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk Annual Report 2007 Online Presentation. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk Group CEO Nils S. Andersen. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk Teleconference and dealing with the annual result for 2007, which we released shortly after 1 o' clock, in just a couple of hours ago. My name is Nils Andersen I'm the Group CEO of the Company, and with me today is also our Group CFO S&#xF8;ren Thorup S&#xF8;rensen. Together we will walk you through the presentation and afterwards we will take you, we will give you time for questions and answers. You will be able to find the full annual report already on our home page maersk.com and we've also download the presentation on this site as well.</p>
          <p>But before we go in to the real presentation please read the waver on page 2. And I appreciate that you all have a lot of experiences with wavers I think this is a very short waver perhaps so may be I should just add to it and that actually what we consider quite serious uncertainty is actually the economic situation for the global economic situation going in to 2008. And so maybe on top of the formal waiver this is an important point to note and I suggest that we just skip the highlights and go straight to page 4. And here we have the highlights for 2007, the profit for 2007 came out at slightly above $3.4 billion or 18.7 billion Danish kroner, which was exactly in line with the expectation we announced in 2000 or for the &#x2013; after the third quarter of 2007 and worth noting here is &#x2013; is really that the progress in the container business where the result is $800 million better than 2006. We released off course that even after this very positive development or very big improvement the result is still not were it should be, but we will off course continue to work on this and we believe that the streamline project, which we have initiated give us hope that we should be able to increase comparativeness further. Important also is that we've seen during 2007 increases in oil and bunker price, which have impacted negatively on our container business, but more or less seen the same fall off, the same impact in the positive sense on the oil business.</p>
          <p>We saw very strong markets for offshore activities and we did not fully benefit from this in an operational sense because we took the decision to dispose of some old rigs as well as a number of old supply vessels and are substituting this year, these with new modern equipment, so we've prepared the group for the future in this sense.</p>
          <p>And we saw and increased oil production but we did also see a profit figure that was slightly below the figure of 2006, this is negatively impacted by higher exploration and production cost and but first and foremost by higher taxes and depreciations. And when we look at this cash flow, which we'll come back to in a minute, actually the progress was quite significantly. Until on a totally different note and much less important this is my first presentation of an Annual Result because I was succeeded Jess S&#xF8;derberg on the 5th of November and have had the pleasure since to be the CEO of the company which is actually a great Company and great fun.</p>
          <p>But on the next slide, S&#xF8;ren will guide you through the consolidated financial information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. 2007 was a year with volatile markets. The dollar depreciated compared to Danish kroner and the oil and bunker prices increased significantly. As 70% of our business activities has US dollar as functional currency, reporting and commenting on the numbers in euro and dollar is the most relevant. And for your easy reference we have included selected financial information in Danish kroner in the appendix to this presentation. If we first of all look at the revenue line, it increased by 17% to $51 billion and the net profit increased to $3.4 billion.</p>
          <p>The increase in revenue was mainly driven by the increased rates in our container activities and the increased oil prices and the increased production in oil and gas activities and finally also the full consolidation of the Dansk Supermarked retail activities in the whole of 2007.</p>
          <p>Looking at EBITDA, it increased by $3.3 billion of which the oil and gas activities contributed 2.2 billion and the container business contributed $900 million.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization increased by 48% mainly driven by the increase in the oil and gas activities due to the start of production in an oil field in the UK and the field development plant in Qatar. Sales gains amounted to $1.1 billion in total and the increase was mainly driven by disposal of three jack-up rigs and 24 vessels.</p>
          <p>If we look at the line tax, taxes increased to $4.5 billion and the effective tax rate was 56%, which was at level with 2006 but taxes were negatively impacted by the increase of taxes in Algeria amounting to a little more than $300 million.</p>
          <p>If you turn on to the next slide, Page 6, where you on the top can see that our operational cash flow increased significantly from $4 billion in 2006 to $7.3 billion in 2007 driven by the increased profitability before depreciation, but also improvements in working capital especially in the container activities. Investment cash flow remained at a high level with $9 billion in 2007, and of these $2.8 billion relate to the container business 900 million to APM Terminals, two billion to tank offshore and other shipping and 2.7 billion to the oil and gas activities. Our equity ratio remains around 45% and bearing in mind the current uncertainty in the markets the capital structure is evaluated to be at a suitable level.</p>
          <p>Now I will hand over to Nils who will go through the split of the different business segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you are now on Page 7, and we will -- starting by the revenue, and you will see that the Maersk Line or container activities make up more than 50% of our revenue. Two other significant parts are the oil business, which makes up 19% and other shipping as we call it, but that is tankers offshore activities including the supply boats and its Svitzer and its Norfolk Line and makes up 20% of turnover. On top of this after we've now taken majority interest in the Danish Supermarkets, retail makeup 9% of the turn over.</p>
          <p>When we come down to the operational cash flows the figures look slightly different to say the least, but significantly different. We see that the share of oil and gas activities increased their share up to 50%, which of course reflects a very healthy running situation at the moment in general in the oil business also very of course very heavy investments and depreciations, but 50% comes from the oil and gas activities.</p>
          <p>On top of that, the Tankers, Offshore and other shipping, which is also oil related deliver 14% of the cash flow and the share of container business has now declined from the 52% of turnover to 24% of the cash flow. Then we have Retail contributing with 8% and others Group of others with approximately 4%.</p>
          <p>So the picture has changed quite a lot going from revenue to cash flow. And when you go through then to net profit there are some further changes, we now see that the Oil and Gas actually stays on more or less the percentage of cash flow. It contributes 47% of our net profit. The oil related Tankers, Offshore and other shipping activities, contribute 36% this is partly driven this year because we've had disposals of rigs and tankers and supply boats in this segment but anyway a quite impressive 36% of the net result.</p>
          <p>Retail makes up 11% and the share here of the container business including terminals and related activities is down to 6%, which is of course why we have a challenge in this area.</p>
          <p>But please turn to the next page, where we will go into the Container Business. So &#x2013; and our Container Business and the related activities which are Maersk Line, Safmarine, it's Maersk Logistics, it's Damco and it's also MAERSK APM Terminals and here the revenue increased 6% to 26.7 billion US and the EBITDA increased by more than 50% to $2.4 billion, reflecting mainly off course the much improved results in the Container Business. The net profit turned from a loss of $568 million in 2006 to a modest positive result of $217 million more in line with what we had forecasted. Very important as where was that we saw during 2007, we saw documented and invoicing quality it was improved, which helped us reduce the outstanding freight and significantly improve our operational cash flow which actually for the year came up to, or was improved by $1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>And according to our figures, in during 2007 the global container market increased by approximately 9%. Maersk Line increased its volume business 1% and Safmarine increased by 14%, so in total that's approximately 2%. Maersk Line reduced its volumes on the transpacific trade by 17% mainly due to closure of a number of inline destinations in the US as well as taking out some strings on the business. And volumes on the Asia to Europe trade increased by 12% and the Africa trades increased by 15%. The average freight rates increased by 5% and that's excluding &#x2013; if you exclude the Bunker Adjustment Factor, the increase was approximately 4%. If you take the unit cost, which is a figure that we give out normally, actually the unit cost in Maersk Line decreased by 1% and but this is not a real apple-to-apple comparison because we changed the routes and on top of that we reduced the inland cost in the US because we increased or decreased the number of destinations we served and but anyway it was a decrease but as I said not apples-to apple. And we've implemented a number of activities to improve the profitability of Maersk Line during 2007, a part of that was closure of unprofitable inland destination in the US, a reduction on tonnage on the non-profitable Transpacific trades and moving that tonnage to more attractive trades like Asia and like the Asia-Europe network but also some other networks.</p>
          <p>Under the name Streamline we introduced a number of activities in 2008, which of course is part is cost reduction by reducing the number or employees but also revenue enhancing programs such as filling ships with more profitable cargo, working on reliability, making our long-term, our business in long-term more attractive to customers, empowering our employees and again being very careful on our cost picture. And this year we'd also like to inform on APM Terminals as a separate issue, but I'll just before we go to Page 8 &#x2013; or Page 9, sorry, and just bear in mind that these figures are also included in the above figures I've just discussed. So go, let's go to Page 9, so A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk terminals experienced a 13% increase in weighted number of handled containers compared to last year and we estimate that the general market grew by approximately 11%. That's total development was influenced by a decrease in volumes handle in North America of approximately 9% and mainly driven by the strings that it was taken out by Maersk Line and which was more than made up by very strong 20% increase in the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA margin was 16%, it is lower than what is often seen in this business and due to two main factors, one is that we have still have a number of start-up costs within new terminals and also that some of these terminals are run as call centers with Maersk Line as the main, on some cases only customer, which gives lower risk and therefore also lower returns then when you deal with import, export terminals handling a lot of customers.</p>
          <p>The net profit increase to $111 million and which is of course a mixture of old terminals and new terminals coming into operation and but the profit from terminals, which have been in operation for more than one year increased by 30%. As in 2006 and the result was impacted by the performance and start-up cost and financing cost relating to the start-up of seven new terminal, two expansions and the number of other projects as such as the new state of the art terminal in Portsmouth, Virginia. But S&#xF8;ren will now go through the next pages so please turn to Page 10.</p>

          <p>Thank you. This segment called Tankers, Offshore and Other shipping includes our most tankers activities, most contractors, most supply service, Svitzer, Norfolkline and our car carrier activities. The revenue in this segment increased by 19% to $4.4 billion, and the EBITDA equally increased to $1.4 billion. Total profit for the year increased by 29% to $1.2 billion positively impacted by the performance and gains of sale of the three jack-up rigs and 11 vessels, which before tax amounted to more than $700 million compared to a sales gain last year of $340 million. Cash flow used for investment activities increased significantly to $2 billion naturally impacted by Svitzer's acquisition of Adsteam in the spring and the investment in tanker vessel drilling rigs and semi submersibles.</p>
          <p>Generally the high oil price environment resulted in strong markets for our offshore related business such as drilling rigs and supply vessels but at the same time the high activity level generally resulted in upwards cost pressure. For the first time the annual report for 2007 contains detailed financial information for the main activities in this segment, which can also be found in the appendix to this presentation. Taking the main business we can say that Maersk Tankers profit was $406 million in 2007, somewhat below 2006 impacted by volatile markets and increasing financing cost due to continued fleet expansion.</p>
          <p>The profit from this contract is at $499 million, was considerably above 2006, driven by the gains on sale of the earlier mentioned jack-up rigs. Looking to Maersk Supply Service, had a very strong year with a profit of $284 million mainly driven by the high activity and the strong markets.</p>
          <p>Please turn on to Page number 11, regarding the Oil and Gas activities. In the Oil and Gas activities as you can see revenue increased to $9.5 billion by 37% driven by increased oil prices and increase in this year production. Exploration costs, which also can be seen, increased to $404 million, mainly related to our exploration activities in the Gulf of Mexico, and the British part of the North Sea.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization more than doubled to $2.4 billion, this steep increase is mainly due to the increased depreciation on the activities in the British part of the North Sea, as a consequence of the production start at a new field and also depreciation on the field development plan in Qatar.</p>
          <p>Taxes increased by 33% to $4 billion, partly impacted by the further oil taxation in Algeria, of $330 million. Net profit amounted to $1.6 billion, a little below last year, but better than originally expected, due to higher oil prices and also the fact that certain exploration activities moved from 2007 into 2008.</p>
          <p>Notably, operating cash flow increased by nearly 50% to $3.7 billion primarily as a consequence of the higher oil prices and the increased production. Total investments in 2007, amounted to $2.7 billion higher than 2006, impacted by the extensive development plan in Qatar.</p>
          <p>And if you turn on to the next page, on Page 12, you would actually be able to see in the right-hand side, the physical location of our activities in Qatar. But starting out with the production, A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk production before tax in total increased by 22% impacted by increase in Qatar and the UK while Denmark in total decreased by 8%.</p>
          <p>One of the most important elements in the oil and gas activities in 2007 was the continued development of the Al Shaheen Field which is Offshore Qatar and it progressed as planned in 2007. As earlier announced, the plant comprises more than 160 additional wells over a six-year period and the production is expected to reach a plateau level in 2009 of more than 500,000 barrels per day. In 2007, it reached 340,000 barrels a day. Total expected investment exceeds $6 billion of which $2.4 billion has been invested during 2006 to 2007.</p>
          <p>And now Nils will go through the result for the retail activities, so please turn on to page number 13.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So on Page 13, you will note that it says on the top line it says pro forma 2006 and that is of course because we took over the absolute majority in the Dansk Supermarked Group in the middle of 2006 but the figures you are seeing have been restated. So they actually include the full figures for the business and are not fully comparable to our last year annual report.</p>
          <p>And the revenue of the businesses which are Bilka, F&#xF8;tex, Salling as well as the discount chain Netto grew by 5%, and the EBITDA increased by 11% and the EBIT by 12%. The net profit went down with 1% and that is exclusively because there was some financial losses in the Group from investments as a consequence of the general decline in the financial markets. And you may ask why do we have losses in subsidiary but the reason for that is of course that we have minority shareholders in the business and traditionally the business has been very cash rich, so we still have quite a bit of financial assets in the company. So the decline in the financial markets impacts the result negatively this year and we hope of course this will not be the case for next year.</p>
          <p>If we pass through Page 14, which is dealing with the shipyards industrial companies, and really first and foremost the Danish Bank, you will see here that we have good increase in the net profit which is the most relevant figure on this page because we of course here Danske Bank is not consolidated on revenue, but just on net profit of 33% and that reflects the situation that Danske Bank has given an improvement in their results up till all share came up to 3 billion Danish kroner and the shipyard is doing better, still loss making but better than last year.</p>
          <p>Of developments during the year, Odense Steel Shipyard &#x2013; sold Volkswerft in Stralsund and Balti in Estonia, the disposals did not have a major impact on the results.</p>
          <p>But now please turn to Page 15 where S&#xF8;ren will go through the expectations for 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting with recognizing that the current development in the global economy, especially in the US then we have to recognize that the uncertainties related to 2008 are significant as Nils said in the beginning.</p>
          <p>If we start with the container markets, we expect it to grow below 2007 mainly due to lower growth in the US. Our container business expects generally to grow in line with the market however initiatives to improve utilization may impact the growth negatively. A significant challenge for our container activities is the increased bunker prices which at the present level would increase Maersk Line cost by between 600 to $700 million assuming that 50% of the bunker price increases are covered by our customers.</p>
          <p>So looking at the Group level and assuming that the current level of oil prices and exchange rates are in place, we expect for the whole Group revenue in the order of $60 billion corresponding to about 300 billion Danish kroner at an FX rate of five Danish kroner to the dollar and under the same assumptions we expect net profit in the level of 3.6 to $4 billion or in the level of 18 to 20 billion Danish kroner. The estimated result for 2008 includes one-off costs related to the streamLINE initiatives in Maersk Line, which are expected to be around $250 million in 2008. Sales gains are assumed to be below 2007, including a $200 million gain related to the sale of our car carriers to H&#xF6;egh Autoliners.</p>
          <p>In addition to this, the Group is contemplating a sale of non-strategic assets. If such sales are included in 2008 the sale will have a positive impact on the net profit amounting to around $800 million, which is not included in the expected net profit of 3.6 to$4 billion. It should be noted that the outlook for 2008 is highly sensitive to change in factors such as the oil price, the exchange rates, as well as volumes and freight rates in the container business. And we have disclosed sensitivities in the annual report and for your easy reference we have also included some of these in the appendix to this presentation. The significant uncertainty is also the main reason for solely giving expectations at a Group level.</p>
          <p>This was the expectation for 2008, and I will now hand over to Nils to go through the focus areas for 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, S&#xF8;ren. So at the end of the presentation I would like to talk a little bit about the things which are important for us to work on in 2008 to make this year a success. First and foremost, of course, the ongoing streamLINE project which should improve the competitiveness and hereby long-term profitability of the Maersk Line is a key focus area for us and we have a lot of focus on continuing our expansion of terminal activities. We are looking actively for new projects as well as investing significant amounts to money in to already ongoing expansion activities.</p>
          <p>And also very important especially because the markets are very buoyant at the moment is of course also successful and not least timely start of operations of our new rigs and vessels in the offshore activities. This is going to be a challenge first and foremost because if we need to manage these start off activities, but also because in general as the whole sector is dealing with delays in delivery of production equipment rigs and vessels. Same goes for the field development plan in Qatar, we are very pleased that the 2007 results follow the plan and we want to make sure that this also happens in 2008. And we have already a long tradition for working very well in the safety area and also a long tradition for being leaders in the area of environment within the shipping area. We want to intensify the activities in the environmental area which is of course an issue which stands on top of the list of every business as well as every politician around the world and we think there are room for both improvements in terms of consumption and there may also be some business opportunities in that. So these are the five main issues we are going to work with or areas we want to work with in 2008, but of course we are going to make sure that all our business do well.</p>
          <p>Then as a last point before we &#x2013; on the next page, before we go to question-and-answers, just a few words on the stock option program which we have launched today or published today, it needs to be approved by the general assembly which we consider a formality. And we are launching a stock option program to approximately 110 key employees of the company. It is measured by international standard relatively small program and the cost for 2008 will amount to approximately 30 million measured in Black Scholes values. But we &#x2013; the plan is to hand out approximately 2,700 options and the only condition on this will be that the persons affected or receiving that grant should be employed at the &#x2013; on 1st of April this year. The exercise price will be 110% of the average share price for A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk B shares based on the first trading days after the publication. That means that the clock is running now and the options are relatively short and they can be exercised already after two years and have to be exercised before five years.</p>
          <p>On top of that the Board of Management will be obliged to acquire stock options at market value based on the Black &amp; Scholes calculation. And the number of options will be based on salaries, and the expectation is that the approximately 1,100 options will be sold to members of the Board of Management. So this is a revolving stock or two revolving stock option programs and the reason why we launch them is of course first and foremost, to strengthen the focus on shareholder value and also to secure that there is a long term incentive in the Group which is quite important given the cyclical nature of some of our businesses.</p>
          <p>And I think that is all. You are all more expert in share option programs than I am, so I think this is all I have to say to this. And &#x2013; but thank you very much for listening so far and we now look forward to answering your questions.</p>
          <p>So I would like to hand over to the operator. Thank you once again.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> While we are waiting for the first question, let me remind you that the PowerPoint presentation is available for download on maersk.com. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Tim Marshall from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much for all the information that you've given in this year's Annual Report; very welcome. And I've just got three questions. Firstly, your comments on growing the container business in line with the market, do you think there is more hope for discipline on freight rate pricing? And I make the comment in reference to some of your more recent joint ventures with the likes of CMA-CGM, MSC and Evergreen. The second question is on the cost savings, reports that you mentioned as cost-centives do you ultimately think you can get your costs down lower than the competitors? Now, I noticed with the disclosure on the costs, your fuel costs which I presume are fixed and generally pretty stable across the industry are higher than some of the competition. So can that give us some clue as to where you can get down to? And then finally just &#x2013; it looks like the impact for a weaker dollar is higher now than it was when you disclosed the risks last year, what's the reason for this? And I notice that you are hoping to charge in euros now for some of the Australian routes; is there scope for this to be spread elsewhere? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much for those questions and if I start by &#x2013; I will answer the first two questions regarding the container business and then S&#xF8;ren will answer the questions on the dollar risk. But if you look at the container business as it is today and whether we will we have discipline in freight rates I think this is a very good question, very difficult to answer at the moment as we are heading into discussions on the Trans-Pacific routes just these days. But there is I think one important factor now, and that is that the oil price is such a big part of our operating cost for the ships that changes in oil prices, and we have seen quite a lot of volatility over the last year, must impact freight rates. These are variable costs affecting everybody and unless we are able to pass those increases on to the customers, the industry will go into very tough times indeed. So we do expect that we'll have more discipline on the freight rates than in the past simply because it's a necessity. And that's also why Maersk Line has launched a new BAF [Bunker Adjustment Factor] calculation formula which is more transparent and easier to deal with for both customers as well as the lines. And the second question was whether we could get our cost down lower than our competitors, and that's of course a very good question. There is, in principle, no reason why we as the largest carrier in the industry should not be the most competitive and that's what we want to be. But that does not mean that we have to be &#x2013; have the absolute lowest costs, what it does mean is that we have to make sure that we offer the right services, that really creates value for the customers and offering &#x2013; and that we offer those services at competitive rates. So that's what we want to head for and that means being competitive is a must and we intend to be very competitive, but we do not necessarily intend to be the cheapest carrier in the industry. And now S&#xF8;ren will talk about the dollar risks.</p>

          <p>Regarding the sensitivity towards the dollars and we give these sensitivities because it's important to communicate how all these changes can impact the financial information for the Group, and as you know everything else being equal it's fair to say that this is not very scientific, but the main changes compared to last year is actually the change in the businesses but also the change in our balance sheet. So there are no one point giving the reason why it's slightly different this year compared to last year.</p>

          <p>Well I think basically the market decides which currency we'll be charging in, but if the dollar continues its slide, I think everybody will have to &#x2013; may have serious considerations on what we invoice in and what the global currency really is but for the time being we foresee for 2008 dollar to continue to be the currency.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. A couple of questions, writing about the restructuring cost related to this streamLINE program, can you also comment a bit on the cost benefits that you see on an annual basis and when these are expected to occur? That's the first question.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you would take them. I have &#x2013; yes okay, the second question is whether you can comment a bit about the non-strategic asset sales, whether you can explain that in more detail, what you're thinking about here? And finally whether you can comment about your capacity utilization strategy in &#x2013; for Maersk Line? You are writing that you expect to grow in line with the market in 2008, but that Maersk Line's going to improve utilization may entail the initiatives to reduce growth. Does that mean that you want to divest a lot of vessels or maybe you can elaborate on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay. First in terms of the restructuring cost on streamLINE, its on purpose we have not given any benefits. We do expect to be true with the program in the sense that all the decisions will be taken and communicated during the month of May, but of course the effects will come in gradually during the year and we have simply not found it reasonable to give this information in isolation. So it's included in our guidance for the year and then hopefully of course it will help to further improve the result for 2009. In terms of the non-strategic assets we have &#x2013; appreciate that we have written it in a way that would lead to this question and we apologize for it. It's a Danish stock exchange technical thing that we have &#x2013; the reason why we have put it in, but I will comment and say that we are not contemplating sales of strategic assets and this does not &#x2013; is not sort of headline for disposing of Danske Bank or Danish Supermarkets. The reason why I say that is a journalist &#x2013; couple of journalists have asked those questions. But apart from that we have no &#x2013; really can't comment more than what we have written. And the questions on the container line and growth in line with the market versus capacity utilization, I think is a very good question and it is our wish to grow in line with the market for 2008, but it is our first priority to improve profitability. And that can mean when we say profitable utilization of vessels that can mean that we will turn down cargo which means that we will lose market share. But the short and sweet answer is really we would prioritize profit above market share in &#x2013; also in 2008. Long-term of course we want to grow faster than the market, but it has to be profitable growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that mean that if you turn down some cargo then I guess your growth of course would be much weaker than the market would that mean that you would then align your volume cargo versus the fleet capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we are taking in quite a large number of ships during 2008. So the answer is not that easy but I think you can &#x2013; I'll give you two part answers and one is we will have &#x2013; we will prioritize profitability over growth in 2008, but we think we can do both. We think we can turn down non-profitable cargo and become more attractive to the people who offer profitable cargo in the market.</p>

          <p>But it also, it also may be adding that you talk about selling vessels. We also have a quite significant part of our fleet being on time charters and of course some of those run out giving you certain flexibility on the capacity also in 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello gentlemen. Simple question, we've seen announced in the last few days that you are getting into an alliance with MSC and CMA-CGM in a series of Transpacific routes, are you going to consider alliances of that kind more widely?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the answer to that is that we are open to and it's actually not alliances as such, it's vessel sharing agreements and slot sales. So it's not a future alliance proposition. It is basically something we are doing to cut costs and become more effective and is in particular on the Transpacific in an area where profitability is seriously under pressure.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good afternoon gentleman. Also from my side thank you very much for the increased transparency. First question is on the shareholder distribution, with respect to the non-strategic asset sales of 0.8 billion &#x2013; sorry, $0.8 billion will they be ploughed back into the business or are you looking to distribute some of that to shareholders? And in the beginning you talked a little bit about the optimal capital structure, is there room for further distribution or further increase in the payout ratio in the next two years? I have two other ones but let's take them one by one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you combine the relatively even though $800 million is a big number but combined with the investment level we have, it's relatively modest. So no we don't see that in any way changing the way that if we should consider to payout more dividend and regarding our capital structure we find that appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. With respect to the cost savings program, the company is investing $250 million in 2008, what kind of payback there does the company normally use when it looks at these projects internally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know whether there is a normal payback criteria, we think this will be an excellent investment and definitely necessary to restore or improve competitiveness of the Line, but things like this gives a very fast payback.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess so. I can't give you an exact answer to that, we're more or less through one-third of the program and we'll complete the program as it stands now, the big investments then there will be smaller things but by the end of 2009. So I guess the cost will be more or less evenly distributed over the next years.</p>

So I am very impressed with the organization. And I think we also very positively &#x2013; we have good plans for the future so it's a great company to be the CEO of.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mike Beckett from Containerization, Inc.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good afternoon gentlemen. Thank you for your presentation. Looking at your container shipping and related activities profit for 2007, half of that is actually come from APMT. Now I think you mentioned that some of these terminals were cost centers. How do you feel that this profitability will continue into 2008 and what would be the percentage would you imagine between terminals and the ocean car activities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very good question. We have decided not to give guidance on the individual businesses for 2008 but of course if we talk purely theoretical, the volatility in the container business in the line itself is of course much larger than it is in the terminals business. Terminals business is an infrastructure business that means long-term development and that will take time. And if we expand the speed or build up of that business, it even means that, that profitability growth will be slower. But we have decided not to give individual guidance for 2008. So I hope you'll be satisfied with this rather bully answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I understand that of course. In regards &#x2013; and then we've got this tremendous volatility on the markets today. We see in the euro 1.56, crude oil $110 a barrel and obviously this situation we don't know who does know how that will continue? Do you have a plan B or streamLINE 2 that you'll put in to place if the situation worsens?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First and foremost, maybe you can say that volatility of the market we agree with you in, that sector the reason why we've decided to give a joint figure, a total figure for the Group and not go down in to guidance on individual on the segments with bluntly speaking which is the container business. And if the oil price goes above the present level or even stays at the present level, this will create tremendous pricing pressure on the container businesses and shipping around the world. And we will short-term be hedged by our oil activities. So for 2008, we think we are pretty okay on that. Your second question is, do we have a plan B if streamLINE does not provide enough and here I think we have to be very &#x2013; or be very clear about that you don't really by making one streamLINE project turn business around, it will take time. The important thing is that we get better at understanding customer needs, delivering better service, becoming more cost competitive and this is not something that will be resolved within the six months period, it's something that we'll have to work very, very hard on over the next &#x2013; just to say a time three to five years and to create a real sustainable competitive advantage. But that is what we intend to do and the team in container business is very motivated to do that.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello gentlemen, congratulations with a very, very fine result. There has been a lot of rumors in 2007 regarding your IT problems or your capability of handling a load to various other things, could you elaborate a little bit about, how far your R&amp;D is in P process or integrating of new IT systems in Maersk Line, but also elaborate a little bit about the client satisfactory level you've seen in Maersk Line? This was the first question. The second question is for S&#xF8;ren regarding your financial net position of this negative number of 743, how much of that is negatively impacted by market to market contracts within oil or freight? And the final thing is that you are stipulating I think is on cost number page number 40, 42 that long term A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk could benefit from higher oil price are we talking 2009, 2007?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you good questions. If we first of all start with IT in the container business I think it's important to distinguish between the issues that we had 2006 going into 2007 was in a number of our so called funding systems where customers are making bookings and we are giving quotes, there are significant challenges there and we ended having situation whereby containers went into wrong place and the invoices were wrong. That has become under control so now we generally feel there we are back at a level before the acquisition of the P&amp;O Nedlloyd. So therefore we are back on track, we are back on the industry level that's not the same as saying that we wouldn't like to get better but we are back to where we were before. On the SAP system that you asked about, that is actually more like the financial side of the systems and that's a continuous process to roll that out and therefore that will take a couple of years more but that is not so much impacting the customer side. Moving on to the next question which is rather sort of specific I think if you look through the notes in the financials you will see that the impact of our oil contracts negatively impact last year is in the region of minus 1.4 billion Danish kroner. Then on the question about impact of higher oil prices in the short term and the long term. What we are trying to describe in our annual report is that in the short term an oil price increase will have a negative impact, because in our container business we will not be able to turn that cost over to the customers, whereby in &#x2013; not on the full scale at least, whereby in our oil and gas business, due to the very high taxation we will not get the full benefit of that. So in the short term, the impact will be negative. But if we look towards the longer term then in higher oil price of course for the container business will be lagging industry cost which will be the same for all competitors and therefore over time hopefully passed on to customers. Whereby if we look at our other businesses the contract of business supply vessels and oil and gas activities those businesses will naturally benefit from a high oil price. Hope that was okay.</p>

          <p>And actually a final question of course you have seen that there's been soft inbound loads in the US and relatively steep increase in export containers out of the U.S, you've moved something like 7-18% of your capacity, away from the U.S, how was the first couple of months of the year actually focused are you still seeing relatively strong demand from other markets beyond the U.S? And the final thing is that as soon as you made this big restructuring in the US cutting back on significant inland delivery points, what has the clients experience been, is this a template you also can use in other part of the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>I think that was a very specific question on the current trading conditions, and I think the right thing to say here is that we are taking current trading conditions into our expectations for the year for the whole Group and I don't think there is need to go down into more detail on that one.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. I have two questions one is regarding a possible American recession, what impact would that have on Maersk Line for the first &#x2013; would you need to change your figures for 2008 if that happens? And the second question is I understand you would not give some figures for Maersk Line for 2008, but can you explain a bit about how large the risk there is for another loss in Maersk Line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the questions. Coming to the US recession we do see that the US markets will be very subdued during all of 2008 and that will of course directly impact our Transpacific and Transatlantic routes, which is regrettable, but I think that's what we have to be realistic about. And not necessarily that the volumes will be declining but we cannot count on growth on those routes. And the impact will &#x2013; on top of that the impact will of course come from the indirect effect of a negative economic situation in the US which we know from experience will also impact the trades in the rest of the world. But we are confident that we have included that in our forecasts and as said earlier we really don't want to come in to giving indirect guesses or indications for the different segments.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, a couple of fairly specific questions. One, the new vessel-sharing agreement on the Transpacific with much larger ships, as you say that would reduce your costs. What would actually bring about your Transpacific operations into profitability or will you still be loss making on them? And the other, on the Bunker issue, you have stated intentions to try over &#x2013; the Bunker costs from the customers but the figures you're quoting for the Transpacific make it look as though you were actually recovering less than the people around you? So can you explain exactly where you're going with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the questions. First of all, larger ships will alone not resolve the issue on the Transpacific. The profitability on those routes is really bad for the whole industry and only price increases can resolve that issue. In terms of Bunker cost, the new batch that we are launching should give us a better cost recovery than in the past and if our competitors are recovering more than us, then we'll of course look to see what can be done. In principle, Bunker costs should be recovered 100%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And just one further question, Will it be- I think I saw in the &#x2013; your report that you envisaged less ship sale. So what would be less container ship sales in 2008 than in the last two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, it's a, we are not commenting on where gains will come from. We're just saying that, you can say what we expect for 2008 is a progress from present 3.4 billion net profit to 3.6 to 4 billion and that is, and the assumption for that is that we will sell less &#x2013; or have less gains from sale of ships, rigs, supply ships, whatever than we had in 2007. This does however, not include the divestment of 800 million which may come.</p>

Regarding the oil and gas business you have been increasing your exploration cost quite significantly from 6-2-07 &#x2013; you stated earlier under this is partly caused by the &#x2013; some of the inflation development in Qatar. But could you gives us a bit of guidance to the amount of exploration activities going a bit further besides what you have in Qatar? And secondly a sort of a house keeping question. Just regarding the eliminations on that profit line which are growing quite significantly this year and could you give us a &#x2013; maybe a bit of indication about where this what this relates to and then maybe also a bit about the guidance for '08 there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer the first question and then S&#xF8;ren will take the details on the elimination. But the &#x2013; we are looking for in -- or to an increasing exploration cost level and as you may also have seen from various press statements we do have blocks in Angola in the Gulf of Mexico and recently also acquired in Brazil. And that we will explore over the coming years and these are all offshore, offshore blocks mostly on quite deep water and that means that they are quiet expensive to drill, so you will see an increased level but we can't give you any more details than that. And then S&#xF8;ren will talk on the eliminations on the net profit line.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With a very specific question on the elimination I think if you look at the some of the numbers where we combine the unallocated segment and eliminations, you see a dramatic reduction. That is mainly driven by the losses of non-hedged oil contracts. Some of the other eliminations are mainly within the different segments and that is also within sale between tankers and contractors, but is also between terminals and the container business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Anders Veinberg from Grumman . Few questions, if I may, first on the Qatar oil business, volume was 30 million in second half of '06, went up to 21 million in first half of '07 up to 30 million second half of '07. More than doubling year-over-year, where should we expect that going forward, your part of the contract? Secondly, the total volume went from 117 to 143 should we expect that to continue to grow significantly in 2008? Thirdly, on the Maersk Contractor business, you talked about significance in your investment programs and you also talked about Maersk Explorer in Kazakhstan not being -- in the Caspian Sea not being used, where could profitability go for that division? You don't write very much about that in the report. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you and I think basically the first two questions will be covered by one answer. And the answer is that we don't expect the same growth rate in 2008 in the oil production as we had in 2007, because the growth in Qatar will be, will be slower and also the UK growth will start off of a main -- major field. In terms of Maersk explorer and the general profitability in the Maersk contractors again, we do not guide for 2008 but we are launching new rigs and supply ships into a quite a buoyant market, so we are pretty confident that that should look reasonably good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Final question if I may. No one left in Oriental Life has talked about 17% increase year-over-year for rates in January, up 5% from December, instead of start of the year that &#x2013; would you have seem a similar stock for your business for 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have &#x2013; we have actually we've given, given a guidance for the year and we think it's a little bit too sensitive at this point to talk about, to talk about rate developments especially as we are just heading into major negotiations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The next question comes from Brian B&#xF8;rsting from LD markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, my first question is regarding the container industry as such with the cost pressure you are seeing but you also talk about that you need more pricing discipline within the industry and that you believe we are going to get more pricing discipline. Do you expect the EBITDA margins in the industry as such, to be in the level of 2001, 2002 which were very tough year for industry as a whole? And my second question is regarding the level of sales gains, you said that it's going to be lower than 6 billion you had in '07. You've already realized around 1.5 billion so would a 3-4 billion estimate be appropriate? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and we, we really don't want to give any guidance on margins in the container business at present, but it's quite clear that over the long term we want to see positive margins covering at least our work. In terms of the sales gains we're not talking about 1.5 billion, we are taking about a level which is below the level we had in 2007, which was 1.1 billion. And that is in of course, that lower level is part of the 3.6 to 4 billion level we are guiding on and then we are talking about potentially other divestments in total the 800 million which is not included. So that's the as good as we can answer that and -</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a final question regarding &#x2013; you've seen a very steep increase in the production take in Qatar in '07 compared to the 28% you had in '06, and you've production guidance. Could you also give some longer term production take guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we've not given production guidance. We've just said that in 2008 the increase will be less than it was in 2007, and that's about as much as we've said, and will say.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions regarding Odense Steel Shipyard, what are your expectations for 2008 for this company and the other one is the first company you placed in the non strategic assets or is it in the strategic assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know where its &#x2013; where the profitability is going to be in 2008 or at least it comes definitely under the decision we've taken not to guide on individual business units. And the last one whether strategic or non-strategic is also something that we will think about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Should I, should I regard this &#x2013; that as a new information?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, we have an order book at the shipyards on fuelling for the next few years. So I don't think there is any more to add to what we previously said. There's nothing new on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have a very clear position on Odense Steel Shipyard or Lind&#xF8; and that is, it must make money like any other of our businesses. And we have a full order book until 2010 and orders in to 2012 so I think the yard will just have to produce a profit to secure its future. I guess that's it what you really want to know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we'll take the last question now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The last question comes from Mark McVicar from Dresdner Kleinwort.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, good afternoon. I have two or three questions. First of all, on the non-strategic asset disposals could you talk about if it happens, an $800 million disposal gain here, which will be added to the net profit forecast. Can you give us some idea of the order of magnitude of the total disposal proceeds? Are we talking about a $2 billion disposal or $5 billion disposal, as question one; do you want to try that one first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes with pleasure, but we have &#x2013; we have pooled all the information in the annual report that we intend to disclose on this one and so the only additional information we've volunteered is that it's we're not talking about Danske Bank or Dansk Supermarket and I don't think there is more to add to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fine, thank you. Secondly on the A.P. M&#xF8;ller Terminals, can you give us some idea of the scale of the start-up costs that the business is performing and perhaps more importantly why your expense those start-up costs to the P&amp;L and then do what the pier group does which is to capitalize them until the point of which the relevant terminal opens in the same way as airports do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I will not comment, we've decided not to give more information on the terminals than we've written in the report. But on the last one, I will say it's just because that's the way the Group has done in other area business areas and we want to have a consistent accounting policy across the group. So we'll not particularly looked at the &#x2013; looked at the pier group on that one and there may also be other pier groups in other parts of the business that have different principles. We've taken a proved principle which we find is okay-ish, but a very good question when you look at it, as an industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And really sort of related to that, obviously A.P M&#xF8;ller terminals grew out of the requirement of Maersk Line over the years and I think we understand what you said today, that there &#x2013; that some of the terminals are treated as cost centers, not a profit centers. So they are not really making any money. Given that the financial markets put an even EBITDA multiple of about 5 or 6 on the container line and between 15 and 20 on a terminal, are you not tempted to restructure because effectively the terminal is cost subsidizing the line at the moment, isn't it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. I think the prices we set for Maersk Line should be reflecting a lower level of risk, and we really have not thought about doing &#x2013; changing principles because of the stock market regulation of different parts of the segments. I think we prefer &#x2013; we prefer to be dealing on arms length conditions between the businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one final question could I just ask, can you give us some sense or some idea of the style of the plan anticipated capital expenditure for 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have, we have passed the last question, and we've also here we've decided not to give any guidance, we are not guiding on the cash flow either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>And so I think this was really the last question and I would like to take this opportunity to really to thank you all for listening in. Thank you for many good questions. I hope we managed to answer most of the questions even if at some point we were a little bit reluctant to give out information. But I hope you understand because that is the nature of the business, and over time it maybe even, even &#x2013; more open and we noted with pleasure that the comments on more openers in the annual report for which we thank. So thank you for listening and we will back in the few months time. Thank you very much.</p>
