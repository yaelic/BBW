        <plist>
          <p>Good evening ladies and gentlemen, very pleased to welcome you this year for the publication of the 2009 results. You have I believe the communiqu&#xE9; was released after the close of the stock market. What can we say about these results? They demonstrate excellent resistance, excellent performance given the current global economic crisis of LVMH in 2009.</p>
          <p>Revenues totaled &#x20AC;17.1 billion just under 1% down over the previous year. The operating profit is down 8% and free cash flow has grown strongly.</p>
          <p>How can we characterize 2009 economic crisis in our business groups? What was striking is on the one hand the impact on the activities of market de-stocking, that was the first aspect. And the second aspect was the very strong responsiveness of emerging markets, in which a number of our brands are well established, which made it possible to continue sustained growth for a considerable part of our activity, and if our results are slightly down and our revenue is slightly down, that's essentially due to Wines &amp; Spirits.</p>
          <p>It doesn't mean that the Wines &amp; Spirit group is experiencing a strategic &#x2013; any major strategic difficulty in the midterm, it just means that as always in these economic downturns that occur rather unexpectedly, but generally every six or seven years, these activities, the Champagne business is more affected because they structurally sell to wholesalers and are the first affected by de-stocking. And Champagne is less present in emerging markets than Cognac, which held up well.</p>
          <p>We experienced a drop at the beginning of the year and a rebound in the fourth quarter, with quite a significant improvement in performance across our business, because organic growth was 1% in Q4, with even a record revenue reached in December. And let me say that this trend is continuing and growing in January for the Group of &#x2013; as a whole, and we had the revenue figures very recently.</p>
          <p>In Wine &amp; Spirits, Watches &amp; Jewelry destocking, a major impact on orders. The destocking process has reached its end, and since the end of the year we have seen quite a marked recovery in business in these two areas. What's interesting to note about the Group's results is the financial discipline that we have implemented and strong management efforts have been successful. Thanks to the cost adjustments and investment adjustments we've been able to limit the impact on our operating income, and in 2009 we achieved a record level of free cash flow.</p>
          <p>We were very selective, thanks to the teams represented here across all our investments, and the asset allocations made during the course of the year. So free cash flow increased by 66% in 2009, bringing our gearing to 20%. That's an acceptable ratio, and I hope we'll be able to improve that still further in the coming years.</p>
          <p>So, this performance in 2009 was the result of the strengthening of our star brands, our flagship brands, that have all continued to increase their market share throughout the world. Louis Vuitton, TAG Heuer, Hennessy and Christian Dior, and as I indicated emerging markets sustained growth in 2009, and thereby enabling these star brands to offset the drop in business in the more mature markets that were strongly hit by the economic downturn.</p>
          <p>China, Asia in general, Vietnam, a whole series of countries in Latin America that displayed signs of growth in spite of the downturn, and that growth is continuing. Europe and the United States, for many of our businesses showed good resilience in 2009.</p>
          <p>So, Louis Vuitton is continuing on its exceptional growth trajectory. We'll see that in a moment with double digit growth in revenues, that's quite a unique performance in the luxury universe. This is due to the quality of the products, to the quality of the locations, the quality of service that we provide to our customers. The extraordinary capacity for innovation of this brand.</p>
          <p>And an example of the singularity in the luxury brand, it's the only fashion and leather goods brand that doesn't offer sales, even those who have the misguided notion that they are above Louis Vuitton, so that's quite an exceptional performance and that performance is continuing into the early part of 2010.</p>
          <p>As to the other business groups that were quite remarkable, there's Parfums Dior that increased market share with new products with a good deal of innovation in terms of make-up, in terms of skincare products and the increased and enhanced success of the star perfumes of Christian Dior, J'adore, Eau Sauvage, the men's' fragrance and Miss Dior.</p>
          <p>Lastly, since Mr. Olivier is here I'd like to note the remarkable performance of Sephora, a company that continues to expand &#x2013; continued to expand during 2009 and achieved an excellent year, with improved revenue and income. We're continuing to open new stores, and that company will continue to grow, to expand and let me remind you that we're very happy with its results.</p>
          <p>All the more so when I was holding these meetings with you a few years ago, many of you were asking me what are you doing with this company?  Why are you keeping it?  Why haven't you sold it? I'm speaking to those of you who've been following us for a few years now. So, there you are, perseverance does pay-off.</p>
          <p>So what's going to happen in 2010? The business climate is rather difficult to predict, the recovery, the most talented, the most renowned economists have differing views on the &#x2013; as to the strength of the recovery. Will it continue and all the stimulus packages, will they be left without any attempt to recover those sums.</p>
          <p>There's general consensus to say that interest rates will remain very low in 2010, all that's rather uncertain. We're emerging from a strong, deep crisis. Will it turn into a strong recovery? It's difficult to state that with certainty. The recovery may be faster than expected in the United States it will in all likelihood remain strong in emerging markets. It's less sure that Europe, given all the difficulties experienced in Europe, that the recovery will be as swift as in other parts of the world.</p>
          <p>In spite of that, our business performed well in 2009 in Europe, and if Europe is a little less strong in 2010, tourists may perhaps offset part of the economic slowdown. The lower economic growth in Europe, that's what we have seen in the UK in 2009, where our business results were surprisingly good, because of the low level of the pound and the influx of tourists from around the world.</p>
          <p>This year we're of course going to continue to enhance still further innovation, there's a whole slew of products in the pipeline. I won't review them all here, but Louis Vuitton really with a focus on what is the soul of Louis Vuitton leather. But since the middle of the 19th century, Louis Vuitton is the most renowned leather brand in the world, and there are new products that are currently being developed that are quite extraordinary.</p>
          <p>Dior will be launching a whole set of products, this is a S&#xE9;rum that was invented by the Dior research labs, amongst the most powerful in the &#x2013; and this S&#xE9;rum is starting excellently. So many new products, targeted geographic expansion and we will continue that expansion strategy which &#x2013; and that really is the key to our performance to attract to our Group, the best managers, the best designers, the best creators, the best researchers, because they know that we offer opportunities that are second to none in the luxury goods market.</p>
          <p>So, we made good use of this exceptional period in 2009 to increase our market share and with our strength in 2010 we will continue to win new market share and of course given the fact that it served us well in 2009 we won't give you any forecast and figures.</p>
          <p>I'll now let Mr. Guiony run through the financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good evening. I will tell you about main figures for 2009. I am not satisfied that on 5, February 2009 when I told you &#x2013; gave you the results for 2008 I wouldn't have been so sure about the performance for the coming year.</p>
          <p>So, let us look at the revenue. For the first time in many years we are down 1% in published and minus 4% in organic growth, a negative growth of 4%. There are differences from one business to another. Two areas are in trouble, Wines &amp; Spirits, mostly Champagne and we'll get back to that in a minute and then Watches &amp; Jewelry down 19% in organic growth, 19%.</p>
          <p>So, you have minus 1% in euro and minus 4% in organic growth. You have partly a scope effect minus 6% and the exchange rate plus 2%. In fact, the exchange rate effect was positive 6% the first half of the year and negative in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>If you look at the next slide, the development per quarter. You can see that this was a rather tumultuous year. In dark blue you have organic growth, the year started off with difficultly, minus 7% in the first and second quarter. Second quarter &#x2013; third quarter was still better, minus 3%, but then we moved for the first time to positive territory with plus 1%. Within the fourth quarter, the last month, December was good. The light blue shows the exchange effect plus 6% in the first two quarters, plus 3% in the third quarter and minus 3% in the last quarter, you can see that there are differences in trends for the exchange rate.</p>
          <p>If you look more carefully at changes in growth, especially in the last part of the year, how it breaks down per business area, you have the figures for nine months, minus 6% in organic growth on 30th September. I mentioned before the fourth quarter, we were plus 1% for the Group as a whole. And if you look at all the business areas except for Wines &amp; Spirits we are in positive territory between one and 2% depending on the business.</p>
          <p>We are still down for Wines &amp; Spirits, but if there is one scope effect that was not restated, because there was bulk sales of whisky, large bulk sales which account for two to 3% of the negative growth we experienced. If we have this figure and we look at the Champagne and Brandies, Champagne and wine is down in the first part of the year, but Champagne &amp; Spirits is up in the second half of the year. Christophe will tell you more about that in a minute.</p>
          <p>If we look at the breakdown of sales, our revenue by region we'll go quickly over that. Few changes, paradoxically U.S. and Japan, which had difficult performances in currencies still maintained higher sales. The dollar and the yen went up in appreciation over the euro, so their weight maintained. Asia up, Europe about stable, France slightly down.</p>
          <p>Now if we look at the sales per region. I tried to show you the first three quarters and the last quarter. In the U.S. this was a difficult position, nine first months minus 12%. We were back-up into positive growth in the fourth quarter. In fact, everything was positive including Wines &amp; Spirits. Cognac did extremely well in the &#x2013; at the end of the year. So, in the U.S. we were down only 7%, which is not great, but still this is very encouraging.</p>
          <p>At the end of the year, Japan unfortunately was very low throughout the year, minus almost 20% for the year as a whole. Asia, not including Japan started off well enough, but not brilliantly, stepped up its progression in last quarter. China in particular leaped forward in the fourth quarter. China accounts for 6% of all our revenue and is up 15% as a whole for the year. And Europe, you have a mixed figure. Champagne is an important segment and was always and was in difficult times in Europe as a whole.</p>
          <p>If we look at the income statement, as I said revenue down 1%. Gross margin is slightly down, about 120 basis points to 53.8% for the year.</p>
          <p>Selling expenses and administrative expenses varied in different ways. Selling is minus 1%, administrative plus 3%. If you look at both and we take out the exchange rate effects, because of course some of the currencies went &#x2013; well, appreciated vis-&#xE0;-vis the euro. The selling and administrative expenses on the like-for-like exchange rate basis were down for the year about 4%. So, we have our profit from recurring operations down 8%. We will get to that later.</p>
          <p>Other income and expenses slightly up to 191 million, that includes 80 million in restructuring and reorganization costs and mostly this was in the first half of the year. So, this was already mentioned before and the rest is asset depreciation &#x2013; intangible asset depreciation.</p>
          <p>If you look at the operating profit, we'll look more carefully later on. Income tax is slightly less. The tax rate was 28% in 2008, 32% in 2009. Net profit from minority interest is down because we &#x2013; NGO's share in Vuitton-C is down. All-in-all we have our Group share of net profit down 13%, that's the overall picture for the income statement.</p>
          <p>If we look at the profit from recurring operations in &#x2013; for different business areas, so you still have the same trends, Wines &amp; Spirits down 28% and you'll see the trends per half year in the next slide, Champagne had a major effect, much more than Cognac and spirits. Brandies and spirits, this is also important.</p>
          <p>Watches &amp; Jewelry almost down 50%, but you will see a breakdown from one half year to the next. There was also the TAG Heuer effect that was down but the profit margin remained almost the same which was not a foregone conclusion in due of reduced revenue.</p>
          <p>Fashion &amp; Leather goods up 3%, Louis Vuitton still displays a very healthy profit margin. They worked extremely well in 2009 and we'll see about that in a minute. And Perfumes &amp; Cosmetics, even though revenue was down, the income was up and so there were a few non-recurring items but this was due to this good discipline and Selective Retailing is stable.</p>
          <p>The revenue is slightly up, you have to remember that in the first half of the year we suffered with DFS. Travel retail went down because of &#x2013; there was uncertainty around the H1N1 virus and so there was a turnaround with DFS in the second half of the year, whereas Sephora recorded steady growth and stable growth over the year.</p>
          <p>So, the overall result is down 8% for the profit from recurring operations. If we look at minus 8% you have, you remember minus 12% in the first half, minus 5% in the second half, so there was an improvement &#x2013; a significant improvement into the second half of the year. And if we look at the various business areas, Wines &amp; Spirits and Watches &amp; Jewelry were down, but everywhere else you have a major improvement from one half of the year to the other.</p>
          <p>There's a traditional slide, the exchange rate effect, it's almost nothing this year, almost 2 million. But there is a major difference between the first and second half. It was plus 58 in the first half, minus 48 in the second half. So, you have a significant movement. We were down 15% in the first half without the exchange rate from 12 to 15, whereas in the second half we were only down 2%, stable compared to last year. So, this is a strong signal in terms of currency.</p>
          <p>If we look at the financial income and expenditure, the cost of financial debt is significantly down. This is because of the exchange rate, the average debt didn't change much in 2009, it changed at the end of the year and you can see that there will be changes in 2010, but for 2009 as a whole there was hardly any change to it, mostly the exchange rate, which made it possible to reduce interest expense.</p>
          <p>If you look at the ineffective portion of currency hedge, it's slightly down, you remember it's &#x2013; this is not really an economic figure, because the cost of currency hedge is roughly 60, 70 million per year. This is roughly what we should have &#x2013; we would have, we'll have slightly less in 2009, probably slightly more in 2010.</p>
          <p>The income relating to investments, a change considerably, we had lots of capital gains in 2008 that there was no repeat performance in 2009. In fact in 2009, we had to write-off of a number of assets or at least asset depreciation, but that had been booked on our equity in 2008, so in economic terms this is more to do with 2008 than 2009. But it was only in 2009 that it this showed up on the income statement, hence this slight deterioration of the financial expense line.</p>
          <p>Now, the financial structure not much to say. Equity is up. It was &#x2013; they were 40%, now they're 46% of the balance sheet. We'll look at the debt in a minute. Inventory is slightly down, but what you have to remember, I will mention it in a minute, liquidity cash is good. We have a number of credit lines &#x2013; confirmed credit lines that are ready and undrawn and that proved to be useful during the financial crisis of the fall of 2008. Most of the financial markets were closed off almost.</p>
          <p>The cash flow is of course one of the great sources of satisfaction. But this is particularly the case this year. If we look at the free &#x2013; at the cash flow from operations, while this was down 8%. So, we didn't use artificial effects to produce our profit from recurring operations. In fact provisions were bigger this year than last year, so we had a good performance in terms of cash flow.</p>
          <p>We had in terms of working capital requirements; we in fact generated almost 100 million. So, if you compare to 2008, we &#x2013; the cash flow generation is up almost 800 million. So, we worked quite hard on accounts receivable and of course the accounts payable was down, because purchases were down. So, there were some dramatic effects there.</p>
          <p>As Mr. Arnault was saying, investment was also down. They were kept under control. We were able to contain them. So, we were able to invest 200 less, so the total cash flow is from 1.3 to 2.2 billion. So, this is up 66%, this is a great result and of course this means that the dividend will be proposed to 1.65 up from 1.6 last year.</p>
          <p>Now, if we look at the net financial debt between 2008 and 2009, it was from slightly under 4 billion to less than 3 billion, almost 900 million down over the year. And the gearing ratio from 18 to 20%. It has been a long time since we've had a 20% gearing ratio.</p>
          <p>These were the financial items I wanted to tell you &#x2013; to give you. Now I'll give the floor back to Tony.</p>

          <p>Good evening. With colleagues we'll now look at the details of each division and the image of Monica Bellucci on the screen, the icon of Parfums Christian Dior is a fine introduction to Perfumes &amp; Cosmetics. Revenue posted a decrease of 4% in 2009, because of sluggish global consumption and partly due to destocking by retailers.</p>
          <p>The operating income remained stable. In fact 2009 is another successful stage in our long-term strategy. Our market share is up across key geographies and the operating margin is up 10.6% close to 11.</p>
          <p>What's even more encouraging is that we have remained true to values of high quality and creativity. We didn't compromise on that and with heightened management discipline. In terms of the sell-in, sales achieved a fine increase in Asia, but declined in the U.S., in Europe and in travel retail.</p>
          <p>The star of our portfolio, Christian Dior maintained an aggressive strategy inspired by the universe of couture. The perfume business is achieving excellent momentum because of the growth of J'adore and the re-launch of Miss Dior and Eau Sauvage. Make-up is growing well on the back of the foundation of Diorskin Nude and S&#xE9;rum de Rouge combining both color and care.</p>
          <p>This is the ad for Eau Sauvage, epitomized by a wonderful photograph of Alain Delon.</p>
          <p>Before moving to the order brands, Guerlain is continuing its inroads on the key markets sustained by the success of its new products the Rouge G lipstick and the fragrance Idylle, as well as the Orchid&#xE9;e Imp&#xE9;riale. Parfums Givenchy managed the successful launch of its Play fragrance with the icon Justin Timberlake and Ange ou D&#xE9;mon with Uma Thurman, while Kenzo Parfums focused on enhancing its major lines.</p>
          <p>Lastly, a good performance for Benefit, and Make Up For Ever posting double digit growth. Benefit continued its overall expansion. Make Up For Ever whose High Definition and Aqua lines are preferred both by professionals, the make-up artists as well as by consumers.</p>
          <p>For 2010, we can expect markets posting a slight recovery and a trade, which will no longer be de-stocking, but will remain cautious on its inventories. Our strategy remains unchanged, to win market share through quality and creativity and maintain management discipline.</p>
          <p>The priority is once again on Parfums Christian Dior to fuel its exceptional image based on the unique know-how of the Dior House. First of all to strengthen the flagship lines in perfumes and make-up and the launch of the major innovation of One Essential mentioned by Mr. Arnault, a product that is receiving a great welcome on the market.</p>
          <p>Profitable growth, we're going to enhance the Guerlain pillars, new advertising, very poetic for FlowerbyKenzo line that's celebrating its 10th anniversary; will be launching a cologne. Expansion for the two high personality brands that are never mentioned, Loewe and Acqua di Parma.</p>
          <p>With the image of our 17th Sephora store in Beijing, close to Tiananmen Square. Let's now move to Selective Retailing. Sales are posting a slight growth, whereas the operating profit remains flat as Jean-Jacques indicated. Sales by region are growing in Europe in and the U.S., and slightly down in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Let's start with DFS that posted a strong performance in sales and profitability in a travel retail sector that remained disrupted. 2009 is a key milestone in the increase of Chinese customers that now account for over 20% of sales.</p>
          <p>The Galleria Macao opened in 2008 is a pillar of this growth, as well as the strong increase in Hong Kong, thanks to the renovation of the China Kim Mall. Also very promising is the development at Abu Dhabi airport extending our scope more rigorous than glamour a major effort being on costs and stock levels.</p>
          <p>Let's not forget that you can see on the screen the growth in market share for Sephora year-after-year in France, where let me say that we achieved leadership and in the U.S. it illustrates the success of the brand which in 2009 is posting excellent sales and profitability momentum, remarkable that all markets and Internet sites are up.</p>
          <p>Net new openings totaled 88 for a total of close on 1,000 stores. Innovation remains the distinctive feature of the brand. New exclusive brands, such as Ole Henriksen, Fred Farrugia. The offering of make-up classes and customer ratings on products available on the Internet. Lots of new developments and a known brand that drives its strength from a profusion of color and excellent value for money.</p>
          <p>Le Bon Marche for its part continues to enhance its visual identity and its position as a high-end concept store, the development of the home and leisure universe in the second floor, prepares the strategic expansion of our menswear department, but it has a &#x2013; in a very boring sector.</p>
          <p>In 2010, DFS will remain focused on the long-term strategy to conquer an increasing share of the Chinese market. The second site in Macao, City of Dreams will be opened, whereas the flagship stores of Hong Kong and Singapore will be enlarged and refurbished.</p>
          <p>We expect an increase to further destinations Mumbai, Abu Dhabi, Ho Chi Minh City to confirm their potential as future growth drivers without losing sight of stringent management, which has become a cornerstone of the culture and the competitiveness of the company.</p>
          <p>As to Sephora, our objective is to strengthen our leadership status in selective beauty with a further year of profitable growth. The opening program will be similar to that in 2009 and marked by the opening of a few flagships in February. We're opening one in Milan, Italy.</p>
          <p>A major initiative concerns adopting a new technology on our .com sites to give our customers a richer and more practical online experience. This is necessary to drive the growth of online sales in Europe and to strengthen our connection with multi-channel customers. Those who visit both the stores and the virtual stores. It's a high potential target for several reasons, high level of consumption and a possibility to interact with us and a growing impact as trend setters. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good evening and now a few words about Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy, the performance for Wines &amp; Spirits.</p>
          <p>As we told you 2009 was a turbulent year. The revenue was down 12% to &#x20AC;2.740 billion. You have to point that 80% of the drop in revenue is attributable to Champagne sales going down, especially prestige vintages, whereas spirits &#x2013; Cognac and spirits withstood the storm. If you look at the change in attitude it was both consumers changing habits, but this was also because there was significant destocking of distributors and trade. This is particularly true in Europe and the U.S. Now destocking accounted roughly for 50% of the drop in volumes altogether.</p>
          <p>Now the good news and everybody in the industry is not necessarily in this position, at the end of December for all brands of Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy for all markets &#x2013; that is for all territories. Destocking had come to an end and so stock levels is now &#x2013; are now optimum. This is of course significant news. So demand was low on the part of consumers for high end wines and spirits, but this is particularly true with Champagne, and Mr. Arnault pointed that out. Whenever there is a crisis the one category in Wines &amp; Spirits that suffers most is Champagne.</p>
          <p>There were also significant changes in consuming habits, people drinking at home rather than in hotels or restaurants or cafes. And of course, this is the area where we build our brands and for Mo&#xEB;t and Hennessy. The hospitality industry is significant in the United States and other countries as well there was what is known as trading down, that is people will go for cheaper brands and products.</p>
          <p>Now in spite of it all &#x2013; in spite of what is a difficult year, our brands weathered the storm and contrary to our value strategy. We were able to build up our market shares better.</p>
          <p>Let's take a closer look at Champagne, as I said in terms of category. Champagne was down, but we haven't got the final figures, but Champagne should stand at about minus nine, minus 10% for the Champagne region as a whole.</p>
          <p>And of course, the French market is roughly stable. This is because of course people are resorting to cheaper Champagnes. But there is a significant drop in exports, almost 20% of figures should be confirmed by CIVC in the coming days, but what you have to keep in mind is that throughout the year and after what was a very difficult beginning with the de-stocking. There has been a gradual improvement in sales with a stepping up at the last quarter in what is good news we find that December was a good month. December of course is an important month for the Champagne area. This is true around the world, not just in France, but other European countries and England, and also the U.S. and Asia. of course Asia is a complex market for Champagne brands.</p>
          <p>Now for the prestige vintages, the high-end brands of Champagne, there was a setback, but sales resumed both for high-end and standard vintage Champagnes.</p>
          <p>For Wines, as you know we have still wines and sparkling wines. The year was good as a whole, sales were about stable compared to last year, but there was a significant rally on our traditional markets, namely Argentina and Brazil. Chandon as a brand is very resilient in the U.S. and the year ended well for Chandon in 2009.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the spirits for a minute. The &#x2013; of course the highest brand that is the one that makes the highest contribution is the Hennessy brand. Of course, the performance there was outstanding because Hennessy has been doing better than most of its competitors with in particular a significant increase in its market share. In the U.S. alone we gained as many as four points vis-&#xE0;-vis our competitors.</p>
          <p>Now, volumes as you can see on this slide were up 11% in the fourth quarter alone and all regions, all territories participated in that growth. Now China is a major market, indeed it's a first market for Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy. Again a significant surge in sales at the end of the year, and that confirms a resumption in demand and consumption. Hennessy is a leader in its class in China.</p>
          <p>Good performance also in the U.S. markets, that market is of course the most dynamic market for brands of Wines &amp; Spirits. Even though the position for the industry is in the doldrums, Hennessy was able to keep its position thanks to of course the tremendous efforts made in terms of advertising promotion, but new launches including Hennessy Black which you can see on the picture.</p>
          <p>Regarding the other brands of Spirits, promising performances by Glenmorangie in the U.S., again the U.S. is the first market for malt whiskies. Belvedere is our vodka brand. It did well in the markets outside the U.S. The U.S. market is the largest market for Belvedere. Belvedere had to withstand tough competition and survived the competition quite well, because you have what are known as the super premium vodkas. This is the market where it is very competitive and we are looking to good performances next year.</p>
          <p>Now, our strategy is a high-value strategy, but it is also an innovation strategy and even though 2009 was a rather subdued year we were able to launch a number of new products. We had a nice new advertising campaign for Champagne with Hennessy, you have Scarlett Johansson you saw on the screen right now.</p>
          <p>Live Box for Veuve Clicquot was developed by Porsche Design, the Treasure Box for Krug, the ice bucket Fusion for Ruinart. This was designed by Maarten Baas and he was nominated designer of the year in 2009 at Miami design.</p>
          <p>And for the music Artistry this brand is developing throughout in Asia, Europe and America and for the second year running, and by the way this is a significant event because over and beyond the brand or the image, we want to be number one over and beyond that for the second year running and this I think &#x2013; this is the first time we won brand &#x2013; we got prize for best whisky with Ardbeg.</p>
          <p>And on other markets, we were able to launch a number of new products under the brand Belvedere. You have this black bottle on the left hand side of the screen, IX. New vodkas as well, Black Raspberry, Belvedere Intense. This is a new grade that we introduced in our duty-free stores and they are doing extremely well.</p>
          <p>So, in closing I would say that 2009 was a year of challenge. In times of challenge you have stay the course and all our teams at Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy were able to stay the course, while introducing action plans to mitigate the effects of the crisis.</p>
          <p>It should also be pointed out that and few people were able to do this in the industry. We were able to increase both our prices and our market shares, especially with Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy. This is a spectacular performance and we did what we had to do in terms of cost controls of keeping our costs down. We were able to downsize our promotional expenses wherever there was structural costs that could be reduced, we did that. As Jean-Jacques pointed out, we in terms of stock, we were able to optimize to downsize our purchases in grapes and eaux-de-vie brandies and of course CapEx therefore was down.</p>
          <p>Now, it looks like every 10 years there's a crisis in the Champagne business. It is true that this time around this is a bigger dip. This is hardly scientific. This is just looking back at past trends, but if you look at this chart you can see that whenever there is a dip and usually there is a deep dip, in the year 2000, again you see various troughs.</p>
          <p>The trough in 2009 was rubbed down the screen. You usually need about five years to recover from that dip to get back, but the interesting thing is then after that you go past the historic level, so you &#x2013; it's one step back and two steps forward. And so the challenge here is to try and reduce, shorten the recovery time. And of course with our brands we are doing everything to shorten that recovery time down from five to hopefully fewer years.</p>
          <p>Now what's the outlook for 2010? Well, so far January was a good month and so will February. So, we will &#x2013; we are looking at a good first quarter, which means that destocking is now past us. I know it's a difficult thing to compare. We're comparing first quarter right after the end of destocking at the beginning of the year, where last year at this time, we were right in the midst of destocking.</p>
          <p>So, of course comparisons are difficult to make but we are &#x2013; we have aggressive image programs for our brands, especially Champagne, because the first market for Champagne is Europe. So, we will have to take aggressive steps to gain back lost ground and so for Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy the first challenge is to resume sustained growth for our brands.</p>
          <p>In terms of pricing we maintain our pricing policy, carefully positioning our brands, but we will pursue our efforts to improve productivity, as we've always done. Right now in the Champagne area we have merged a number of our legal entities precisely to cut costs and become more productive. 2009 was a year where new market shares were gained, but we will have to pursue that effort to reassert our leadership, even though Champagne had a negative performance, our leadership is unchallenged in luxury Wines &amp; Spirits.

          <p>Good evening. So, 2009 a very sports year, you have the King Power by Hublot, which was very successful launch. And on the right the Monaco, that's a repeat of the legendary 1969 model that was rapidly sold out. In terms of the figures so, revenue is down by 13% to be compared with what was published this morning by the Watch Federation, watch exports were down by 22% in 2009 and the difference between our published growth and organic growth, there are three points that are due to the exchange rate effect.</p>
          <p>Our profits reached &#x20AC;63 million, that's 8% operating margin against 13% in 2008. And in that challenging context TAG Heuer posted very commendable profitability well above 25% and Hublot demonstrated its ability to maintain its sales and profitability against a very difficult backdrop.</p>
          <p>So, the other brands where very negatively impacted by the business climate. A highlight in 2009 consumer demand that dipped as compared to '08 and '07 and what's more destocking in the multi-brand retailers as we've indicated, hence the importance of tracking the sell-out of our brands in these retailers where stocks of our brands down.</p>
          <p>I'm not sure that it's necessarily the case for the industry as a whole; our sales grew by 5% in Q4. The month of December was up close to 20%, as compared to a drop of 8% for the sector. As published this morning, our January revenue confirms that it's growing at a higher level, confirms that the destocking of our retailers for our brands is well advanced.</p>
          <p>We suffered from strong exposure in the U.S. It's interesting to recall that for the future as part of the recovery of the U.S. market. Strong exposure for TAG Heuer and De Beers and Japan for all our brands we resisted well in Europe. We progressed in Asia on a very weak base in China, where our revenue is of the order 1%. Our share of the Chinese market for watches is about 1%, but we increased our market share.</p>
          <p>In the high-end market with the Hublot brand and on this segment of 2,000 to &#x20AC;5,000 for TAG Heuer, including in the U.S. where we just received the results of the LGI panel giving the sell-out of the whole category, the TAG Heuer brand in the U.S. in its retail sales is down 10%, whereas the overall market is down 20%. That enabled us to gain market share.</p>
          <p>Our productivity was maintained in all our retail sales networks. Our owned stores it was the case particularly of Chaumet and its global networks. Innovation was very sustained on the icons; you see two examples on the screen. The Black Diamond, Big Bang that received the watch prize once again in Geneva and a more classic model that illustrates the return to classics of many watch brands. The Elite Zenith extra-flat in gold.</p>
          <p>We worked a good deal on cost cutting, streamlining our stocks, reducing accounts payable and very targeted investments. All this leading to a strong increase in cash flow generation. We celebrated the 40 years of Monaco from Steve McQueen to the 2008 with TAG Heuer celebrated the launch of the Monaco V4. It's the first chronograph with this transmission and a good retail price of &#x20AC;70,000. Good performance by the Carrera and Monaco lines, continued investment at Kornol in Switzerland to produce our automatic movements.</p>
          <p>Very targeted store openings in a number of markets, Osaka, Tokyo, Shanghai, Beijing, Singapore, I would add Moscow, Seoul and Abu Dhabi. The launch of a Meridiist telephone line, high-end working very well in China in particular.</p>
          <p>As to Hublot, it's without a doubt one of the brands that the most consolidated its brand in the Watch segment with strong growth over 2007. The very successful launch of King Power, the automatic movement, Unico, which will equip part of our own models in 2010. We inaugurated the Hublot watch factory in the middle of 2009. Hublot opened a few franchise stores, Prague, Doha, Istanbul, St. Thomas, St. Maarten and Macau.</p>
          <p>Zenith underwent considerable restructuring to lower its break-even point. Celebrated the 40 years of the auto El Primero movement and drastically refocused its catalog to reduce stocks. It opened a Zum store in Moscow and one in Dubai.</p>
          <p>Dior successfully launched the new model you see on the screen, which is the Mini D which is an elegant women's watch and continued to focus on Christal, while continuing to making its distribution more selective.</p>
          <p>Just a few examples of store openings this year, TAG Heuer stores. These are very well located stores of limited size, so as to promote productivity in high traffic areas in Beijing, Jingdong Place, one of the best shopping malls, Ginza, Shinjuku, Nihonbashi and Osaka in a pedestrian precinct. Seoul, openings of Hublot in Prague and Zenith at Dubai Mall.</p>
          <p>Jewelry now, the market was also challenging for Chaumet. Its own network of stores performed well. However, it was tough going with the franchise stores that almost stopped purchases in the 10 to 50,000 jewelry segment. Here, this is a ring selling for &#x20AC;20,000 one of our best sellers of the year. So, in times of crisis the market doesn't necessarily move to the entry price. What's important is the good work that we do on our icons entry or up market.</p>
          <p>In terms of watch making we strengthened Chaumet with jewelry watches at high-end between 20 and &#x20AC;50,000. De Beers resisted well of the bridal and the classics and the solitaire, but a drop in high-end jewelry in the U.S. and a discontinuation of the franchisees who did not restock in 2009, but sold off existing stock. Fred held up well in France and produced jewelry versions of the Force 10 line and launched a new chronograph.</p>
          <p>The outlook for 2010, firstly we plan to grow our market share whilst achieving sustained growth and improved profitability higher than our revenue. Of course the backdrop of the recovery still needs to be confirmed in the latest figures from the trade minus 8%. Urge caution, we will maintain strict management on 2010 and to leverage on the savings achieved in 2009. There will be very disciplined geographic development with a focus on our main markets China, the U.S. positions to be defended in Europe.</p>
          <p>In terms of innovation we'll be focusing on the icons, as always the women's Big Bang on the left, which really contributes to Hublot's success. So, this is diversification that's been well received by the market and then you have the Zenith El Primero, which will be the first automatic chronograph this year showing the tenths of a second to people who are in a hurry that's an unmissable buy.</p>
          <p>For TAG Heuer we'll be celebrating the 150th Anniversary with very sustained activity across the markets. At the center on the screen the Silver Spin model which is a 1974 vintage that's going to be reedited and that's going to received positively with the up market of the segment of chronographs with 1887 model, and an advertising campaign that was tested successfully in Asia the technical and performance heritage of TAG Heuer.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx we'll be of course focusing on the self reliance of TAG Heuer and Hublot to produce the movements and other components. For Hublot we've just made a transaction, which is to integrate at Hublot a workshop to design and manufacture major watch complications after the failure &#x2013; or the bankruptcy of a supplier, P&amp;B, and we're going to incorporate in Hublot, the founder of this company that is very innovative as well as a &#x2013; some 30 watchmakers &#x2013; creative watch makers, so the Group can indeed attract very competitive talents. It will be an acquisition for the Group. We'll be able to make developments for other watchmakers.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we'll be focusing on improving the productivity of existing networks by looking at a few selective store opportunities for single-brand stores. Just a few examples to conclude, this is the Hublot factory watches' movements. The TAG Heuer campaign giving the 1860-2010 heritage with quite spectacular innovations, contributions to spectacular creativity and watch making. A few examples of stores that we have opened, Melbourne in January and Colon Street for TAG Heuer.</p>
          <p>Chaumet developing in China with very small surface areas, highly productive. Ah, no chart for Chaumet and that's not finished yet. The photograph was taken a week ago. We're due to open in a week's time.</p>
          <p>Place Vend&#xF4;me, Hublot, this is a small construction digital. It will open middle of the year and strategically located between the Chaumet and Patrick Phillipe stores. Hublot will be opening another store on Madison next to the future Hermes store which will provide it with a number of strategic points.</p>
          <p>We had two watch trade fairs for Chaumet in January and there the orders booked on the new collections were higher than expected. And as I said, the month of January was extremely encouraging, but we remain cautious on the rest of the year for the sector. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, well before we give you the figures let me show you this picture, you must have seen in the media. This is the new image of our Core Values campaign, Annie Leibovitz herself was flattered to accept being seen on the picture, and so, but of course she is normally behind the camera. So, she is there with her friend Mikhail, one of the finest dancers in the world. So, we've had astronauts, singers, dancers, now we have &#x2013; and politicians, so this campaign is a source of constant wonder and surprise.</p>
          <p>Now you have the key figures, but of course a big news tonight is that in 2009, Louis Vuitton managed to generate double-digit growth in euro terms, and such double-digit growth was achieved when the previous year we were actually registering growth, including the last quarter of the previous year. But, that growth was generated outside Japan, everywhere around the world. So of course Asia and China as a whole were &#x2013; China and Asia as a whole were strong. But, other parts as well and that growth was generated by the growth in local clientele in France, Germany, Italy, Britain and in the U.S. we also have outstanding growth, albeit not quite as spectacular.</p>
          <p>So, this is something I told you about a huge tent that we built for one evening at Sukhbaatar Square, as you have a new store this is of course a major development and that country is &#x2013; it's in Mongolia, where we are looking to major economic growth in that part of the world.</p>
          <p>And then another picture, this is in CityCenter, Las Vegas. Now of course Nevada, we were wondering what the result would be if we opened a new store in the middle of a crisis in the U.S. But, in fact we are 50% ahead of our most optimistic forecast, which goes to show that the U.S. market is back on with a vengeance.</p>
          <p>Now, why is that you might ask? Well, there are a number of reasons for that. We've conducted a number of significant operations, but as Bernard Arnault said at the beginning of his presentation, our performance is attributable to years and years of hard work, creativity, improving us towards the fact that we should invest in our sales force so that the experience of our customers should be something magical.</p>
          <p>We never have sales or discounts and of course when we buy a luxury item, there is a part of pleasure, but part investment and if you know for a fact that the price of a Louis Vuitton item will never be marked down certainly makes you feel better about purchasing it.</p>
          <p>Now the &#x2013; if you look at the highlights for 2009 we started with the Damier Graphite, that was started last year, but that certainly was a boost for our men's department and the Louis Vuitton in all of its departments has asserted its position as one of the finest men's' store at least for leather goods and fashion items.</p>
          <p>In 2009 you may remember that the profession as a whole, the industry as a whole was looking at down marks and a rather dreary outlook. We had on the contrary a very colorful look with this new colorful bag by Stephen Sprouse.</p>
          <p>And of course we launched this high end jewelry line by Lorenz B&#xE4;umer called L'Ame du Voyage, the soul of travel and it's looking very good. The past few days have confirmed that this strategy was the right one and we certainly expect in 2010 to see the Lorenz B&#xE4;umer creation roll out in various other and possibly more accessible items.</p>
          <p>And then we said that we have new icons every year and new iconic stars are always a source of wonder and surprise, plus Marc Jacobs fashion shows are always a big event and in terms of digital communication we have our know-how. We know that for the past 156 years our know-how has been passed on from generation-to-generation, but it is also nice to be able to advertise this using modern technology and the whole world learns about it. And we were pleasantly surprised when at Christmastime people were looking at parcels with their nice wrapping paper on it; we were looking in our advertising campaigns at a cabinetmaker or rather cobblers or a haberdasher or indeed a seamstress.</p>
          <p>Now that's of course what we showed in our advertising campaign. You will see more of that, but we also have to see what happens upstream, this is a picture of our workshop in Italy, where we have, where we make all our leather. But that leather is used for everything, the high end of the elegant fashion all the way down to loafers. And we opened a special tanning facility in Belgium.</p>
          <p>You may remember when you think of the Louis Vuitton monogram people think of canvas bags and of course this is our icon item but most of the price you pay for, one of these monogram bags is not canvas but, the leather and when I visited this leather tanning &#x2013; tannery, I was impressed to see how the leather is treated in this workshop, it stays there for four days and it's very carefully worked and produced and you should visit this sometime yourselves.</p>
          <p>Now other highlights, you know that distribution was in a difficult time, because many of the major stores destocked, indeed some of them destocked more than they had to, they destocked more than sales were down, so they accelerated the crisis.</p>
          <p>In spite of it all, Fendi to manage to manage its inventory quite well and Peekaboo is a resounding success from year-on-year. Fendi has as many as 187 stores, had opened 170 stores at December 2009 with new openings in Middle East and Asia, and Donna Karan also achieved tremendous results in what was after all a very difficult environment.</p>
          <p>If you look at the other brands of course Marc by Marc, by Marc Jacobs did extremely well. Lola, a new perfume, we look of course at capsules with Givenchy, leather goods and accessories for leather. Berluti started a new line of shoes called Pierre, especially in new territories in China and Korea. Kenzo reorganized its distribution network and started its Internet website. And then we have new designers at C&#xE9;line and Pucci that started a new collection.</p>
          <p>So, what can we say about the outlook for 2010 this by the way is a beautiful Fendi bag. Well, of course we want to consolidate the good fundamentals at Fendi. At Donna Karan, we want to develop our flagship products. We also want to step-up development at Marc Jacobs. Improve new developments at C&#xE9;line, Pucci, Givenchy and Loewe, of course you have to be first successful in creative terms and then you can expect the commercial success.</p>
          <p>Regarding Louis Vuitton we will start new products, of course such new products you will be seeing in the coming months. We have three major advertising campaigns, iconic stars of Core Values, Savoir-Faire, Know-How and this and for Fashion we have Lara Stone lying in the grass. This was the theme designed by Marc Jacobs.</p>
          <p>And in terms of advertising, because as you know the America's Cup is now mired in lawsuits even though on Monday you should have a final ruling, but they could still have yet more decisions afterwards on the water, but we have our own trophy in Thailand, in Sardinia in May and in Dubai, and that is of course important because in the Middle East, even though we didn't mention this is one strong growth territory. It was one. It registered significant growth in November last year &#x2013; sorry, the trophy will be in Dubai in November this year.</p>
          <p>As you know we are now all over the world with the Louis Vuitton stores, there are still a few cities in the world where we yet have to open new outlets, new stores, but it's not just new stores, we have to refurbish our stores. We have to reintroduce new lines and so while the number of square meters is the same. We want to embellish existing stores that we have around the world, rather than opening new stores.</p>
          <p>But having said that we will be opening a beautiful Maison in London on New Bond Street. We have been there since 1888, that's where &#x2013; after the &#x2013; after Paris we opened our second store, we opened a Donna Karan store right next door in London, this will be created by Peter Marino and as soon as it opens in London I strongly urge you come and have a look.</p>
          <p>And then we are working in a new project for 2011. You may have heard about the new casino in Singapore, called Marina Bay and of course this will be a surprise for our customers and audience after the Villa in Deauville and other new retail novelties we'll have in Singapore a Louis Vuitton Island, an artificial island on the bay of Singapore located &#x2013; connected with an underpass, underwater underpass linked to the rest of Singapore, there will be this artificial Louis Vuitton Island.</p>
          <p>And new territories we have Mongolia in 2009, I showed you the tent, then we also have a store in the Dominican Republic, also one in Poland and one in Lebanon. We're not the first ones in Beirut, but of course we come there through a subsidiary that had made headway into Lebanon. And so you have in closing these beautiful pictures, showing our craftsmen and women working in our various beautiful lines of products. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Emmanuel Bruley from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. I have three questions. The first on Wines &amp; Spirits with Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy, I'd like to know whether in the right &#x2013; the good figures of January and February there was a restocking effect or was it just an improvement in end demand or the end of destocking, and does that also concern Champagne, is Champagne also up since the beginning of the year? And a final question on Wines &amp; Spirits, the Chinese New Year comes slightly later this year, is there a more positive impact, were there fewer deliveries in Q4, 2009? So, that's on Wines &amp; Spirits.</p>
          <p>Can I move to the next part, well next theme? Fashion &amp; Leather Goods, you mentioned record results at Donna Karan in spite of the context. Could you give us further information about that? On that rather surprising performance on the other brands, you mentioned a reorganization; could you perhaps expand on that? And final point on Louis Vuitton, understand more targeted openings or fewer openings perhaps increased surface area is that the final turning point?</p>
          <p>And just one last point on Fashion, you call it Fashion &amp; Leather Goods, perhaps with the exception of Louis Vuitton, Fendi, are there brands you consider more luxury and others that are more fashion? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the answer on Wines &amp; Spirits is that this is not a restocking phenomenon. There is some depletion in January. So, this is actual demand, so this is a straightforward answer.</p>
          <p>Regarding the second question about the Chinese New Year. It's slightly later, but we haven't seen any difference in terms of stock taking in China, at least for Champagne at the end of 2009. And the position for Champagne is positive, not just for China, but for all regions in the world.</p>
          <p>Regarding Donna Karan, I can't be specific. This was a year where profitability was at a record high, but sales were slightly down. Especially in a significant part of our business, sell-through was accelerated and hence profitability was improved. But also the quality of the product and our ability to take over existing brands or rather to incorporate our values in our brands was favorable, even though we remain in single-digit growth.</p>
          <p>Regarding the restructuring and reorganizing of other brands, we in the second half of last year, we had reorganizing expenses in our income statement. It was mostly C&#xE9;line. These expenses are to do with the reorganizing of the C&#xE9;line entity in 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p>Regarding Louis Vuitton, as Mr. Carcelle was saying in our stores, in our houses success is such that we end up having too many people and we are not in a position to provide adequate service. Now, even though we don't give figures, we still have many stores out there. So when we take a very effective store, when we decide to renovate or embellish or to expand it, of course we provide better service, much better service, and we find that revenue accelerates as well. So in our strategy with Mr. Carcelle we felt that in June the size of our stores, we decided to allocate part of our investment on increasing, well expanding the size of the store, but also providing better quality service in existing stores rather than creating new stores.</p>
          <p>It doesn't mean to say that we're not going to open any stores, we will, but that's the spirit, we are trying to improve our existing capacity. Our customers &#x2013; this is the highest luxury brand in the world. When customers walk into a Louis Vuitton store they should expect the best service in the world as well, and that's what we are working on.</p>
          <p>Is &#x2013; well distinguishing between luxury and fashion isn't as straightforward as all that because all our brands propose to be high-end luxury brands. If you look at the prices, what you can get with the mid-range brands, of course we are much more expensive, and so all our fashion brands are luxury brands.</p>
          <p>Of course, they may be looking at fashion or leather goods, and of course whoever looks at leather goods, and Mr. Hused has just renovated a store in Spain, which in view of the higher revenue generated by this renovation should make a substantial improvement in the performance.</p>
          <p>I'm not saying this will happen overnight. It takes time. You need to find the right people. They have to be motivated. You have to make the right investments. But we are looking here at a luxury brand, looking at fashion, at leather items even though there are some fashion items.</p>
          <p>Whereas for C&#xE9;line with a new &#x2013; well, designer who was very successful, who got a prize in her very first year with us, there of course fashion will be a bigger portion of the business, but we're still looking at high-end fashion. It's not entry-level fashion. And so, it is luxury in any case.</p>

          <p>Good evening. I am from Sanford Bernstein and I have two questions. In 2009 you mentioned a concern you had about changes in Selective Retailing in Europe. There were a few changes. Do we find that now the system suits your needs better, or is there any &#x2013; are there any opportunities with the Internet where you could have yet another outlet? And then if we look at your outlook for growth in 2010, will you be looking mostly at organic growth, or are there M&amp;A opportunities, maybe brands you might purchase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well unfortunately, the person who knows best about that for the first question has just left the room, and I imagine he had an important meeting in Brussels to address the European rules of retailing and distribution. Of course, if there's news, we will let you know, but unfortunately this self-centered world in Brussels means that people think that everything can be done over the Internet.</p>
          <p>It should be good for European bureaucrats to become aware of the importance of the luxury industry for jobs throughout Europe, France, Spain, Italy and elsewhere. I have met a number of commissioners, and indeed the President of the European Commission, and we tried to tell them &#x2013; and here is our man &#x2013; I was able to give you a brief summary, you probably have another meeting you can attend if you want to, and this gentlemen can speak with you after the meeting. What was question number two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course priority is for organic growth, and mergers and acquisitions come after, price is a bit high and our priority goes to organic growth, and I think we can certainly improve the size of this Group by focusing on those brands that we own and well, we have quite a few many of them, about 60 or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Antoine Belge from HSBC. I have three questions. First, what you said about Louis Vuitton, where the priority is to improve quality of service, could you say something about China, they have more than 40 cities with more than 2 million inhabitants, and 125 cities with more than 1 million. Mr. Carcelle a year ago said he would like to have a shop in every one of these cities. Do you still consider developing such stores, three to five stores a year in China, should there be more?</p>
          <p>And then regarding your expenses in 2009, especially advertising expenses that were down 11% in euro terms and probably more on a constant exchange rate, and CapEx was down 25%. In 2010, are you proposing to spend more in advertising or increase advertising more than other expenses, will CapEx increase in 2010?</p>
          <p>And then a technical question, Mr. Arnault I believe, after 9/11 has shown optimism as to the resumption of growth in the U.S., maybe less so in Europe. Have you seen changes in consumption trends in the luxury industry, or do you believe that when the economy picks up, there won't be that many changes after all? Some people have said that there would be less ostentatious patterns of consumption.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on Louis Vuitton in China, Mr. Carcelle, yes, in China we are keeping up this strategy. We won't be opening 15 stores in one year, but it will be three cities, Nanning in the province close to Vietnam, Hohhot, which is the capital of interior Mongolia and Fuzhou, which is the capital of Fujian across the channel from Taiwan.</p>
          <p>And then we will be opening two houses in Shanghai. We have fine stores in Plaza 66 and paradoxically we never found shopping malls that justified the opening of a second or a third store, and you will not be surprised to see that these two shops will open on 28 April, two days prior to the Universal Exposition.</p>
          <p>You know that as many as 100 million visitors are expected there, most of them Chinese, to visit Shanghai in the next six months. And I was there last week, 200,000 tickets were sold, and so we felt it would be good to speed up the opening of these stores. No changes on China, but it is the country in the world which has most new openings.</p>
          <p>And as regards this business on CapEx, this was of course a year of austerity in 2009, and our budget plans are to increase advertising expenses, but we want to make sure that we will be able to gain market shares in the recovery period, but of course when we &#x2013; but advertising expenses can be flexible. And so we will adapt, depending on how fast recovery picks up.</p>
          <p>But then regarding CapEx, we expect some discipline, but we had some discipline in 2009, we'll still be disciplined and have moderate growth in 2010.</p>
          <p>And finally consuming patterns, it's true that consumers have become experts, and their tastes are not those that were observed in the previous decade. We talked about ostentatious consumption, the glitter and tinsel that seem to overdo it. But now, this sort of a showy way of doing things is less &#x2013; is now frowned upon, and during the crisis, at the height of the crisis people didn't even dare  walk out of a store with a parcel under their arms.</p>
          <p>Now, for our brands what does it mean? Well people want authenticity, they want quality, what makes the product legitimate, and that is one of the reasons why we performed in relative terms better than our competitors, because for most of our brands and particular for Louis Vuitton, but also for Fendi and Dior, what makes our products successful is their comparability, the fact that the products are completely legitimate in terms of the histories that they have, their brand have a history, and that is what our consumers want.</p>
          <p>The consumers do not want something that just happens to have a name on it, a label that they can show off simply because it has this or that brand, they want a product that is authentic indeed without any visible brand, they would want a product that conjures up in everything that a brand stands for rather than the brand itself, and that is one of the great qualities we have at Louis Vuitton is to do just that.</p>
          <p>And of course it would be dicey; indeed it would be hazardous to address consumers from emerging countries, where there is of course still this nouveau riche, ostentatious way of doing things. It would be a &#x2013; hazardous to treat these customers any different from people from developed countries, and indeed the reasons why these countries are doing well is that we treat these customers just as if they were the most sophisticated in the world.</p>
          <p>And indeed our Chinese customers are treated with the same deference as our Japanese deference &#x2013; Japanese customers, and of course our Japanese customers are among the most sophisticated and knowledgeable in the world. And that is what makes all the difference and we &#x2013; plus the fact that we are offering a true authenticity, true legitimacy in what the brand can produce.</p>

          <p>Question from Exane BNP, a question on Fashion &amp; Leather goods. Can you, could say what the wholesale share was throughout the year. Was there a downturn, and in the other businesses that are more wholesale is there a recovery of the wholesale, ex forex?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The wholesale share is of the order of 30%. I'll give you more specific figures later on. Double-digit drop during the year, recovery limited during the year on wholesale only because it was the deliveries of orders booked in the middle of the crisis, so at the end of the year we didn't see, neither at beginning of the year any improvement in the Group's wholesale sales. We'll have to wait for the deliveries of the autumn/winter collections of 2010 as of June.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up question on Fashion &amp; Leather goods. If I look at Q4 growth, there's an improvement; is it attributable to an acceleration at Vuitton?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Answer, no Vuitton had &#x2013; if the question is on organic growth, Vuitton had organic growth that's pretty much on a path throughout year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Final question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>JPMorgan. I have a question, after the last crisis, you said that we shouldn't underestimate Louis Vuitton, not just in absolute terms, but in relative terms it would be the company, the brand that would post the strongest growth. Now, that we're emerging from another crisis, what do you envisage for the next five years for your Group and will Louis Vuitton &#x2013; will it carry the strongest relative growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said last time. I do indeed believe that it's the flagship brands, and Louis Vuitton in particular which is the star brand, which is likely to achieve the best growth, because its strength on the market, its creativity and its ability to establish itself globally is far and away the strongest. The brand awareness, its impact and we measure this in all countries where we're present, its brand awareness, its impact is extraordinary. And for the past five years the professionalism of all the teams at Louis Vuitton has increased further, so far and away it's the brand with the greatest potential in all our book of brands and I'm sure Mr. Carcelle will not deny this.</p>
          <p>But we have other star brands such as Fendi, Dior, are also brands in which we can invest with a very attractive return, because the stores are profitable. And as I often say before investing in a brand in certain stores, we see the success with a great influx of customers, and there we can press down on the accelerator. We've done this at Vuitton for many years. We're going to continue on other brands.</p>
          <p>You asked me about the last crisis, other brands are now in that position and we'll also be using them. That's why I'm confident in the next five years in our ability to increase, and our hope would be to be able to double the value of the Group in the next five years. I don't know if we'll achieve that, but that's more or less what we did over the past five years.</p>
          <p>Mr. Guiony will confirm they are always of course some blips &#x2013; I mean last March when the share price was at 39 it was easy to say well, it's a good thing to buy and now the value has doubled, now they're at 80. I can't say that they'll be at 160 in two year's time. I don't know, but aside from cyclical variations, I mean I'm very confident, and I continue to buy shares.</p>
