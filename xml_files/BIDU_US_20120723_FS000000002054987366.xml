        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining today's call. I'm pleased to report a strong set of results for the second quarter in spite of an uncertain macroeconomic environment and some tough comps with a blockbuster quarter a year ago. This is a testament to our unrivaled ability to understand the needs of our customers and users and to design and execute winning programs to meet those needs.</p>
          <p>One of the real highlights this quarter is our success in growing our customer base. This has been an important priority for Baidu and we are making solid progress here. In top-tier markets, we have taken a number steps to optimize our sales process, including establishing call centers, improving our CRM systems and implementing better incentive systems for our sales staff. These efforts are driving clear results. We are also building strong momentum with small and medium sized enterprises in lower-tier markets.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, we rolled out our annual nationwide search engine marketing campaign. This was by far the most ambitious annual campaign yet with over 200 events in 190 cities around China.</p>
          <p>We are also now partnering with local governments in 14 regions around China on execution of programs that encourage SMEs to embrace online marketing. And we are now offering a number of new SME friendly services. For example, this quarter, we launched a new tool that helps SMEs transform their desktop websites into mobile friendly format. This is a free, easy-to-use service that allows SMEs to create mobile and tablet ready websites in as little as 10 minutes. Already thousands of small businesses have made use of it.</p>
          <p>On the large account front, the macroeconomic slowdown in China has put some pressure on our large customer spending and sentiment. As a result, we have not seen any standout sectors this year that would be comparable to e-commerce in 2011.</p>
          <p>Following last year's e-commerce bubble, the sector is now consolidating but we are optimistic about the future of e-commerce and due to the performance-based nature of Baidu's marketing platform, large successful e-commerce player spending on Baidu remains very strong. To counter the macro headwinds, we are also proactively developing new traditional industry categories like food and beverage. The traditional advertisers have large potential and have started to adopt Baidu's platform in marketing campaign.</p>
          <p>On the monetization front, we made solid progress this quarter and I am pleased to note that contextual ads performed particularly well. New improvements to our contextual ad technology allowed customers to target their ads towards more focused micro market based on user demographics and behavior. So customers now can target their particular interest group such as people who frequently travel overseas or pet owners.</p>
          <p>In the past quarter, we also upgraded advanced <mark type="ph" /> print (5:55) match, one of our Phoenix Nest matching options. This upgrade leverages our vast cache of user data to allow customers to reach broader more targeted audience in more sophisticated ways. The system needs now is better at integrating data such as customers' locations, limitations and keywords with the users search query and IP address.</p>
          <p>Just recently, we also introduced the biggest upgrade in five years to our Brand Link product. Traditionally, brand advertisers have used this area to display basic information like logos and links to their corporate websites. After this major revamp of Brand Link, advertisers can turn this area into a specially customized minisite for their brand. They can invent pictures and videos, micro blog accounts and even advanced functions like user registration areas and dynamic data. For example, a company like Louis Vuitton can now use this area to display branded video ads and interactive information on the search result pages.</p>
          <p>On the user front, mobile continued to grow very well and we are really charging ahead to build a truly frictionless experience for mobile users. Our platform allows users to efficiently access the underlying information, content, apps and services they want through as many mobile operating environments as possible.</p>
          <p>One of our most innovative new initiatives here is our powerful new voice search experience. This is designed to enable smartphone users to search the web, activate apps, and even get local information just by speaking into their phones.</p>
          <p>The accuracy of our voice search technology is unmatched and we are already &#x2013; we have already rolled out some core functions based on it. For example, if a user says, "I am at the Baidu campus", the system will instantly text them on Baidu campus and provide a map of the neighborhood. If the user says, "I want to call mom", the program will instantly start the call. Users can even use voice to search native apps and of course search the web.</p>
          <p>I'm also very pleased to say that users who search the web on their mobiles either through voice technology or through traditional way are now being served results powered by our box computing technology. We are optimizing our open data and open application platforms for the mobile platform and we can now serve out huge amounts of dynamic information, apps and other services to mobile phones. Likewise, our personalized homepage is now completely iOS-friendly and has been optimized for users on the go.</p>
          <p>We are working hard to make sure we provide users with the best tools for their mobile experience. To that end in Q2, we rolled out an updated addition of our mobile browser. It's already being rated a top performer for speed and functionality versus competing browsers, particularly for handling HTML5 based content. We are confident that the Baidu browser is one of the best on the market. And we continue to build important partnerships that ensure Baidu is the gateway of choice for mobile Internet users just as it is for desktop users. As you have heard, users will be able to choose Baidu as their default search on Apple's iOS 6.</p>
          <p>Naturally users are increasingly relying their smartphones to search for local information. We estimate that last quarter 20% of our mobile searches from high-end smartphones were related to local information, which is far higher than the rate we've seen on desktops.</p>
          <p>To meet our users need for local info, we've been working hard to build out new location based offerings centered on Baidu maps. For example, we rolled out a new GPS navigational service and we upgraded the real-time traffic function which is now much more accurate and has a more user friendly display format. And on the backend we are working to build up our database of local information by partnering with more app providers and vertical sites while also extracting local information from the web.</p>
          <p>I'm confident that we have more local location based information than any other map provider in the market. The Baidu Map API is also open to other websites who have such a need both on desktop and on mobile. We are working with lots of valuable partner websites here in sectors like travel, group buying, real estate information and so on.</p>
          <p>One reason that Baidu stands head and shoulders above every other company in the mobile space is our unparalleled cloud computing infrastructure. Our Personal Cloud Storage service, or PCS for short, which we launched last quarter is one of the pillars of this strategy. Over the last few months, we have been working hard to integrate it into more of our applications and services and to promote this to our users.</p>
          <p>Our Net Disk service has been installed millions of times, while still in beta testing, and Baidu users can now also leverage PCS to access their PhotoWonder images from anywhere and any device.</p>
          <p>The ability to synch up with Baidu Album through PCS is a great selling point for PhotoWonder. User numbers for the mobile app have more than doubled from 9 million in Q1 to 20 million by the end of June. And we are working on building PCS integration into many third-party developers' apps and our own products such as Baidu Music. We are now partnering with more than 10,000 third-party developers to integrate PCS functionality into their apps and we are working with major handset producers to offer fully integrated cloud storage to their phone users.</p>
          <p>I also like to quickly highlight that ITE continues to strive and our strong support is clearly driving results.  As you know, online video is a very competitive space, but the high quality of ITE's content is a key differentiator over competitors. User numbers showed encouraging growth in the quarter with 250 million monthly unique users at the end of June. The total time spent on the platform on a monthly basis is demonstrating good growth trajectory. According to Bull's-Eye Research and comScore ITE ranked second in China in this important metric.</p>
          <p>Overall, the second quarter demonstrated how our aggressive investment in deepening customer engagement is enabling us to attract more customers to Baidu and to increase more of our customers' budget on Baidu. Going forward, we will maintain our focus on working closely with customers to understand their needs and leveraging our unrivaled user rates to create the best possible results for them.</p>
          <p>Finally, I am excited to tell you about our seventh annual Baidu World Forum, which will be held on September 3 in Beijing. This is an opportunity for Baidu to bring together some of the best internet work, industry experts and our developer partners to share our strategic initiatives and discuss China Internets trend. I look forward to seeing many of you there.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the call to Jennifer.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robin. Hello, everyone. We were pleased to sustain our robust pace of top and bottom-line growth from last quarter, as we continued our aggressive investment strategy. We devoted a lot of resources this quarter to strengthening our core infrastructure needs, building our customer base and investing in key areas, like mobile. This is a transformative time for the Internet in China and our robust investment strategy will be key to achieving long-term sustainable growth and strengthening Baidu's transition at the heart of China's Internet ecosystem.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to go through our financial results for the quarter with you. All amounts are in RMB unless otherwise noted.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter, total revenues were RMB5.5 billion, representing a 59.8% increase year-over-year. During the second quarter, Baidu had approximately 352,000 active online marketing customers, an 18% increase from the corresponding period in 2011, and a 9.7% increase from the previous quarter. Revenue for online marketing customers for the second quarter was approximately RMB15,500, a 34.8% increase from the corresponding period in 2011 and an increase of 16.5% from the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Traffic acquisition cost as a component of cost of revenue in Q2 was RMB454 million or 8.3% of total revenue compared to 7.9% in the corresponding period in 2011 and 7.8% in the previous quarter. The increase mainly reflects the improvement in contextual ad performance.</p>
          <p>The Baidu Union network is important for us. We have more than 600,000 union partners now, making this the largest partnership network in China. We manage these relationships dynamically and will continue to drive contextual ad business growth. We are benefiting from these partnerships. Our union partners are benefiting too, and we see tremendous room to grow this relationship further. To drive incremental revenue like contextual ad business, we expect tech as a percent of revenue to gradually increase over the long term as stated before.</p>
          <p>Bandwidth and depreciation cost as a percent of revenue in Q2 were 4.4% and 4.6% respectively compared to 4.3% and 4.2% in the corresponding period of 2011. The increase was mainly due to an increase in network infrastructure capacity.</p>
          <p>Selling, general and administrative expenses in Q2 were RMB588 million, an increase of 55.6% year-on-year primarily due to an increase in personnel and marketing related expenses. For the coming quarter, as Robin has mentioned we have a lot of exciting new products and features that we will look to invest the resources to promote. R&amp;D expenses in Q2 were RMB546 million, an increase of 82.7% over the corresponding period of 2011, primarily due to increased headcounts reflecting our continued strategic investment in R&amp;D talent.</p>
          <p>Share-based compensation expenses which were allocated to related operating costs and expense line items aggregate to RMB54 million in the second quarter, RMB35 million in the <mark type="inaudible" /> (19:00).</p>
          <p>Operating profit for Q2 was RMB2.8 billion, an increase of 51.5% over Q2 of 2011. Total head count as of June 30, 2012 was about 17,400, roughly 900 more than the previous quarter. Income tax expense was RMB235 million for the second quarter. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 7.9% compared to 14.9% in Q2 2011. As you will recall, we will conclude income tax for one of our subsidiaries at a non-preferential tax rate in 2011. This subsidiary has obtained a high and a new technology enterprise type license this quarter, accordingly we reversed the provision in 2011.</p>
          <p>Next net income attributable to Baidu for Q2 were RMB2.8 billion, a 69.8% increase from the corresponding period in 2011. Basic and diluted earnings attributable to Baidu per ADS, for the second quarter of 2012 amounted to RMB7.87 billion and RMB7.86 billion, respectively. Net income attributable to Baidu excluding share-based compensation expenses, a non-GAAP measure for Q2 was RMB2.8 billion, 69.3% increase year-on-year. Basic and diluted earnings attributable to Baidu per ADS excluding share-based compensation expenses, both non-GAAP measures, were RMB8.02 billion and RMB8.01 billion, respectively.</p>
          <p>As of June 30, 2012 the company had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of RMB18.3 billion. Net operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2012 was RMB3 billion. Capital expenditures this quarter were RMB722 million.</p>
          <p>Now let me provide you with our top line guidance for the third quarter of 2012. We currently expect total revenues for the third quarter of 2012 to be between RMB6.245 billion and RMB6.41 billion which represent a 49.6% to 53.5% year-on-year increase. I do wish to emphasize that this forecast reflects Baidu's current and preliminary view which is subject to change.</p>
          <p>I will now open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning thank you for taking my questions. My first question is on mobile. I wonder what is the management view in terms of is mobile traffic additional or is it cannibalizing among the Q2 traffic? And in addition maybe if the management can comment on some of the monetization schedule and advertising formats such as Click2Call and also how advertisers in general are looking at mobile <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:52)? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Dick. We believe that mobile traffic is largely incremental to desktop search traffic. If you think about the search activities, the information needs for users are usually very short lived. If they have a mobile phone on hand, they will do the search; if they don't have a mobile phone they will have probably forgot the information needs before they reach to a desktop computer. So we think the mobile traffic is largely incremental to the current desktop traffic. But having said that, I would have to say that mobile Internet is in its very early stage. There are a lot of similarities between the mobile Internet now and the desktop Internet many, many years ago when we didn't have enough amount of information or application available for users to search. So we would expect the mobile traffic will have many, many years of hyper growth going forward.</p>
          <p>And speaking of monetization, again, we think this is in an early stage of mobile Internet. We are in no hurry to aggressively monetize our mobile traffic. We are indeed exploring a lot of different mechanisms on the mobile advertising front, including Click2Call and we will report to you back when we &#x2013; when this kind of activities are more material to our marketing platform.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning. Firstly congrats on pretty solid results in a pretty challenging macro environment. My question is on VIE. As you know, this probably has resurfaced recently. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit of color on some of the VIE structures that you have and some of the plans you may have going forward to continue to strengthen your VIE structure in terms of providing the protections or securities for the shareholders. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Jiong. The VIE structure has been around for over a decade and as you know most overseas listed Chinese companies operate under similar structures to enable them to list abroad. I do mainly utilize the VIE structure to hold its license to operate in China we assure that as much of our economic value resides with the WFOE entity as possible. We have contractual agreements as set up and oversights are provided to these VIE entities and all the controlling power actually resides with the WFOE. And the economic interest is mostly allocated to almost all of the controlling interest of the VIE is allocated to WFOE. Operating cash flows are all at the holding company level and large majority of our asset cash position and all that are all at the holding company level. So we have mechanism and daily operations to assure that there is minimum exposure to VIE.</p>
          <p>If you read our 20F we provide sufficient disclosure and much coverage on the VIE and hopefully that gives you that kind of comfort. We do have consistently operated with a very transparent and good corporate governance practice and we have a number of independent board members to be ensured that minority investor interests are protected. We ensure that the relationship we have with our holding company between the holding company and the VIE is structured in a way that safeguards the investors interests and the long-term future of the company and fundamentally we don't think there is any particular government policy change per say in the near term, but this has been a structure that has been in place and is working, and Baidu is doing everything to protect the shareholder interest, and I hope that covenants, our governance structure, our track record our disclosures that we have provided gives the investor the kind of comfort.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone, and congrats on a very solid quarter. My first &#x2013; I have two questions, number one is that can you comment on the growth rate between number of paid to click versus the CPC &#x2013; and how would you envision the growing mobile search will transfer both facets of these to operating metrics? And then number two is, can you just give out some comments on the revenue growth momentum between larger accounts and SME in the quarter? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the first and the third one. Alex thank you for your questions. For Q2 we had pretty solid revenue growth, and as Robin highlighted in his statement, there are numerous things that we are doing to counter this macro environment headwinds. Some of the things we implemented related to monetization improvement and for monetization it delivers click as well as some pricing in the system. For Q2, what we have experienced is both metrics the Click as well as CPC has helped on the revenue growth. These both metrics are moving in a very healthy state and there are much more work that we will continue to do to make sure that we deliver the kind of ROI to our customers, at the same time there is a healthy level of pricing in the system.</p>
          <p>In terms of large and the small business growth, as we highlight this quarter, for Q2 in particular, we have been strong momentum on the SME side. There is a lot of good work that we have put into the system starting last year including improving sales process, developing tools to help the customers have better experience using our platform and all that good things. And we carried out the national marketing campaign this quarter and that was bearing very good fruit. So our SME business is growing robustly and I think one of the benefit we have is we have a very diversified customer base. And so the whole Baidu platform is much more resilient in this environment and of course, our sales force execution effort did a great contribution to the performance.</p>
          <p>Large advertisers as we were saying for this particular quarter, the sentiment because of the macro environment, we do feel the sentiment of conservatism among the large customers and their spending is somewhat contained compared to the robust star performance that we saw last year.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we are doing numerous things to counter this situation. We want to service our customers with more richer product offerings and services and at the same time, our new industries, new customer that we try to develop and as Robin mentioned some new sectors such as food and beverage we're seeing good progress and traction. So obviously large customers' growth this year is no comparison to last year, but it still remains very solid and we're doing many things to continue to grow this sector.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The mobile something had to do with mobile, Alex.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the Q4 operating metrics in there, pay to click growth and the CPC growth, how would you envision the growing mobile search will change the growth patterns on the key metrics &#x2013; is the CPC going to be affected by the mobile search?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay, as you know that the monetization capabilities for mobile is not as good as desktop search at this time. So the CPC understandably is lower on the mobile platform, but like I mentioned before we think the mobile internet is in its early stage, just not enough amount of applications or data or content that's available for users to search. So users are not as dependent upon search on mobile as they do on the desktop yet. So going forward, when the users are increasingly relying on their mobile phone to get information, we think that the monetization will follow.</p>

          <p>Good morning Robin, Jennifer and Victor, thanks for taking my questions. I have some questions that you have had. It's finally good to see the contextual ads is picking up more meaningfully this quarter. So can management share your view with how China contextual ads market to grow in the next few years? And what are some of the industries that are more receptive to the contextual ads currently. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hi, Alicia. I think as mentioned it for some time now. Contextual ads business is a focus for us and the team has been doing good work over the past year or even now more. It started from a very small base and it has been consistently taking traction. And in the past I think because of the base is small, you wouldn't feel, you wouldn't see that so that 0.5% of revenue.</p>
          <p>As the business is gaining momentum, the team continues to roll out improved product, technology, and services to our customer. It is growing very nicely and we're very encouraged by this sector growth. In terms of customer adoption, there is a wide range of customer that can adopt this. The large customers obviously like this because it serves their brand needs and our SMEs small and medium sized businesses also like the contextual ads because of the improved product feature, for better target and give them better ROIs. So we are seeing good adoptions of our customers both on the large customer side as well as the SME. Because this, as you just noted, we're only starting.</p>
          <p>I think there is still a lot of room for us to continue to develop the contextual business. It is only really beginning and even from our end, we see much continuity improvement that we can implement to improve the product. And it's a virtual it's a circle, our product gets better customers' acceptance is better and with there is more feed better information that's made available to us. And we can continue to improve on that. So I think there is a lot of room for us to continue to develop this sector of business.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thank you. A couple more questions regarding on the mobile, I know the market share measurement on the mobile is quite different than how people measure PC market share for  search. If you look at in pure cost per click or on a per revenue basis, do you know what your market share is in search because I know now it's been done on bits per second which is not exactly comparing apples-to-apples here. And second of all, when you look at the demand environment from mobile, are your customers coming to you and saying they want to just advertise just purely on mobile and looking for a different pricing structure, or a different TAC structure just for the mobile or are we are too early in the process to even think that way? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to your first question is we don't know. We don't know the exact market share for us and for the competition. It's like the desktop search 10 years ago, you don't really have any reliable data on the market share distribution amount of the search players. But what we know is that our mobile traffic continues to grow at a very high speed at least a triple digit growth and we believe that it's more important to look internally on this metric in the early stage of mobile internet regardless of our relative market share. We think it's more important for us to help form a user behavior that's so much dependent on search on the mobile platform. If they try to do search for everything they need then we will become a winner. If they don't do that even if we have like 90% of the market share that doesn't mean much to us. And on the mobile advertising front, I mentioned before that there are not enough content and apps yet on the mobile platform that can make the user so dependent upon yet, that also includes the advertisers' mobile friendly website too. If they don't have a mobile friendly website or content or apps, the ROI for them on the mobile platform will not be as good.</p>
          <p>And a different type of customers require or expect a different kind of performance on the mobile platform, in most cases, they need to do their work to make their site more mobile friendly and get a better sense on how they measure the performance and on our site, there are a lot of things we can do and we are also trying very hard to help our customers to establish this kind of mobile friendly environment so that they can advertise on the mobile more. So it's really the early stage and people are talking a lot of different things and we are just trying to form an enrollment that's mobile-friendly, then the performance should be okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Robin and Jennifer [Question inaudible] (39:36-41:07).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding to your first question, yeah at this time users spend a lot of time on applications and probably less time on browser. Again, I think that's due to the early-stage nature of mobile Internet, that's also like in the early stage of desktop Internet. There are only a few of the websites that the users frequently go, but as the Internet became larger and larger, more content and websites became more diversified, then users spend a lot of time on the long tail. I think that will be true for mobile Internet too over time when there are more mobile-friendly data or content available, users will become more &#x2013; will spend more time on the browser or even applications. To me, there is no fundamental difference between a application and a browser-based content. We are actually seeing the trend that more and more services become web-based apps that the backend is basically the content on the cloud side.</p>
          <p>Even for all kinds of native applications, I think we can come up with better ways for users to search for apps. Right now, the mainstream model for apps is app store. They are not really friendly or fair to those less used apps and therefore it's not good for this ecosystem. We are developing all kinds of technologies that allow our users to find information or apps or services from one search box. So whatever they are looking for either the content behind the browser or applications, we will be able to find that for our users and by doing that our users will spend more time with us or more dependent on gateway we built.</p>
          <p>On your second question I think mobile search will be different from desktop in the sense that we have more information about the user about the location and a lot of contextual information that's  available. So not only we can build a better query-based or thought-based search experience for our users, we can do more in the sense that in a lot of cases before the user even types in a query we already know what the user wants and we can deliver that to them. If you remember last year when we rolled out the new personalized home page that was the main drive behind it. So for the mobile it's the same thing. In a lot of cases we know what the user wants even before he or she types in that query. And we again, we are devising all kinds of technologies to make that experience better and better for our users.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I was wondering whether we should interpret the deceleration in the average revenue per customer growth on a year-on-year basis as reflecting more of the large customers spending less or more of the SMEs actually lowering the average spend? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Catherine, I think that while ARPU continues to grow at a healthy rate, this year in particular, the SME has been a very strong driver in terms of revenue growth. That is different in 2011. So it is true that when it comes to SME doing promotional work with us, their ad budget is no comparison to these large advertisers. So you can say &#x2013; none of these advertisers are spending less, they are all increasing their spending, it's just that the SMEs are doing more of the work compared to the large customers if we use 2011 as a base. So both are growing but SME is the main driver and SME has the smaller budget.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations on a solid quarter in a tough environment and thank you for taking my call &#x2013; my question. I have a question on mobile if I may, I recall in the last quarter you mentioned that mobile as a share of total search <mark type="ph" /> clearing was about a fifth (46:34). I was wondering if you had an update on that figure or some color around that? You also mentioned that you <mark type="ph" /> were pleased with 8% growth rounded out with (46:44), handset I was wondering if you had an update on that as of the end of Q2? And the final question related to those that the amount of revenues that you <mark type="indiscernible" /> pre-installed (47:00) if you could give us any color as to what that number might be, is it 20% or 25% mobile in terms of revenues and how you account for that? Is that net of acquisition costs or do you state revenues net of that number. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer the first two and Jennifer will answer the third TAC question. For the mobile search percentage, as I mentioned before, with mobile traffic, mobile search traffic continued to grow at skyrocket rates. So, as a percentage of the total search traffic mobile continued to increase, but we are not going to disclose this number quarter-by-quarter. The overall trend has not changed, if there is a change, we will of course let you know. On the pre-installation of our search app or our search box we think we have signed up all the major selling brands on the market in China to pre-install our search services as well as some of our other applications we have developed.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of revenue share, it is the arrangements with these players is a revenue sharing arrangement. So if we generate mobile revenue then we will share a little bit of that with our partners. Also, each partner the contractual arrangements can be somewhat different, I won't get into the details, but the nature of the work is we do advertising work, we will record the total revenue and we will treat the sharing part as TAC.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Just quickly on two things. Is there any operating metrics that you can share with us about the popularity of Baidu Map? And then I would also like to get any guidance for the tax rate for the full year given the lower tax rate in the same quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About Baidu Map, we have a dominant market share on the desktop and we continue to enhance the features. We think that LBS will become a very important part of the mobile Internet side. So we have been aggressively pushing the Baidu Map service on the mobile, we have seen tremendous amount of growth on the mobile platform. And so going forward, we will try to integrate more services to the Baidu Map service. So we'll really become an LBS service instead of just a map service, there are a lot of things to be done on that front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Eddie, on our tax question, yes, basically what happened in tax was we were accruing at a higher base last year. So if we were using the favorable tax rate, last year's income would be higher and this quarter, Q2, just for conservative principle, once we get the license, we will recognize the tax benefit and there is kind of a catch up of last year's higher accrual and we reversed that this quarter. The overall tax rate for the year, I have provided a guidance earlier in the year. The whole year, we're looking at close to mid-teens, that's the tax rates that we expect.</p>

We focus on investing in infrastructure as well as office space to host more and more of the talent, particularly R&amp;D. We do expect the 2012 CapEx to step up and if you refer to the 2009, 2010, 2011 change in terms of the year-on-year step up that is the trajectory or the trend that you should be expecting for 2012.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you management for taking the time. I have one question, the 2Q 2012 had a very good control of margins, a very good control in cost and GP margin was up, OP margin was also up by 4 percentage points sequentially. This is mainly due to lower bandwidth and server costs and also S&amp;M expendage as a percent of sales was also lower. Are these sustainable going into second half and is there a clear visibility to the second half economy compared to the first half, any signs of picking up from your observation in the business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Cynthia. Yeah, as you noted I think we continued to deliver very strong and healthy margins. Sequentially, for seasonality reasons Q2 is typically higher in terms of OP margin compared to Q1. So I think the way to look at our margins if you are doing comparison is to look at the year-over-year trend. And in terms of year-over-year trend, I think that was very managed, that fared out very well as well. Last year, we had extraordinary performance in terms of margins. We benefited from the extraordinary growth in the eCommerce sector, the group buying sector, all of the good things like that, and that helped on the margin.</p>
          <p>And we have made it clear that we are in a very robust investment cycle and particularly in this time, the transformative time of the internet space in China it's very important for us to make strategic investment for the long-term sustainability of this business. And we will do so in a very disciplined approach. So as we continue to carry our business, we see much opportunities to continue to drive revenue growth at the same time important initiatives like mobile and the cloud are very important areas for us to invest and we invest of these search business the revenue and the cash flow that we generate in this future business is very important for us. So we have been doing this over the past some time and will continue to do so. The landscape continues to evolve, the market opportunity is tremendous. We want to make sure that we carry out our duties throughout this time and to maximize our opportunities for the future.</p>
          <p>In terms of second half business outlook, I think we provide quarterly guidance and the Q3 guidance is a very solid guidance. I think everybody is aware the macro environment is challenging. However, I think that because of the beautiful search product, the performance-based nature of our service, we and our execution capability, we want to make sure regardless of the macro environment we are charging ahead to deliver solid results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Obviously you have worked on developing new applications like mobile browser and mobile LBS applications for your customer. At the same time you also have made some big investments in 3G in China before. So from a political standpoint, how do you decide when to buy a product or services and when do you decide to do it in-house?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We don't try to differentiate this based on what kind of things to buy and what kind of things to build. In most cases, I would say that I prefer buy to build because that takes less time and gives us competitive advantages. It's just in a lot of cases, there are not good enough applications or products or services for us to buy so we have to build. For the two investments you mentioned Qunar and <mark type="ph" /> Chyi (58:22), they fall into the categories like a vertical. So we, in the previous call, we mentioned this so called landing based strategy, when people do search on Baidu, they probably land on another site. If that site belongs to an important vertical and we believe we can come out with an equally good or even better quality of content or service, we will consider owning that by even &#x2013; by either acquisition or built by ourselves.</p>

          <p>Hi, morning, thanks for the call. My question is related to eCommerce search. The last time you mentioned that you wanted to grow a more vertical search engine capability, and in terms of eCommerce search please tell us regarding progress. It seems that eComm has made a big improvement on their search engine. What about Baidu, would that be a threat, major competition against Baidu? And also if Baidu &#x2013; does Baidu has any plan to go back to the eComm market? Would these also affect your LBS strategy, how you are going to work closer with the merchants in order to develop your LBS services? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We think we have very good eCommerce search capabilities that is demonstrated by the loyal customers or advertisers from the eCommerce categories. They all spend a lot of money to advertise on Baidu and they just cannot buy enough amount of inventory from us. We continue to try to enhance the user experience for eCommerce related queries. We have a mechanism called open data platform and open application platform, related parties with this data can submit their data to our platform and we can show that to our users when necessary.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I think there are still a lot of room for improvement for the eCommerce related search. We have devoted resources &#x2013; engineering resources to improve that experience. We do not necessarily need a separate product for eCommerce search. We still believe that users can find the necessary information from one search box.</p>
          <p>LBS, it's a potentially huge sector. There are lots of things we can do and like I mentioned, our product and the strategy is centered on Baidu map, we will &#x2013; we are actually adding a lot of information, merchant information and shopping information travel information, all kind of information on this platform and we believe it will become more useful to the users and deliver better value to merchants going forward.</p>
