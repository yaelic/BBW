      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Oracle's second quarter fiscal year 2009 earnings conference call. With me on the call are Oracle's Chief Executive Officer, Larry Ellison, Oracle's President, Safra Catz, Oracle's President, Charles Phillips, and Oracle's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Epstein. We will begin with a few prepared remarks and then take your questions.</p>
          <p>Let me begin by reminding everyone that today's discussions may include predictions, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. While these forward-looking statements represent our current judgment on what the future holds, they are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. You're cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation. Please keep in mind that we are not obligating ourselves to revise or public release the results of any revision of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.</p>
          <p>Throughout today's discussion, we'll attempt to present some important factors relating to our business that may affect our predictions. You should also review our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. A PDF copy of our press release and financial tables which include a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be viewed and downloaded on the Oracle Investor Relations website, oracle.com/investor.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Epstein for his opening comments. Jeff.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Roy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll review our non-GAAP financial results, focusing on constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. During the quarter the euro, the British pound and many other currencies fell substantially compared to the U.S. dollar. This currency impact reduced new license revenues by 8%, total revenues by 7%, and earnings per share by 9% or $0.03 per share.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, our new software license revenues were $1.6 billion, up 5% in constant currency, and down 3% in U.S. dollars. EMEA grew 7%, the Americas grew 3% and Asia grew 5%.</p>
          <p>Technology new license revenues were $1.2 billion, up 12% in constant currency and up 4% in U.S. dollars. EMEA grew 16%, Americas grew 10% and Asia grew 8%. BEA contributed approximately $127 million in new license revenues this quarter.</p>
          <p>Application new license revenues were $469 million, down 9% in constant currency and down 15% in U.S. dollars. EMEA was down 16%, Americas were down 6%, and Asia was down 2%.</p>
          <p>Our software license updates and product support revenues were $2.9 billion, up 21% in constant currency and up 15% in U.S. dollars. Renewal rates continued to be very high, because customers value the benefits they receive from our updates and support, fueled by our $3 billion annual investment in research and development.</p>
          <p>Our Services revenues were $1.1 billion, up 5% in constant currency, and down 2% in U.S. dollars. On Demand revenues grew 19%, Consulting grew 4%, and Education fell 3%.</p>
          <p>Our total revenues were $5.7 billion, up 13% in constant currency, and up 6% in U.S. dollars. Operating income was $2.6 billion, up 25% in constant currency, and up 18% in U.S. dollars. Our non-GAAP operating margin grew by 460 basis points in U.S. dollars to 46%, a record level of profitability for Q2.</p>
          <p>Our tax rate was 29.0%, higher than our guidance of 27%, due largely to the foreign exchange impact on our earnings mix. We have a higher tax rate in the United States than abroad, so a strengthening dollar will tend to increase our overall tax rate.</p>
          <p>We increased our stock repurchase activities in the quarter, buying 108 million shares at an average price of $17.14, for a total of $1.8 billion for the quarter. As we have previously stated, the rate of our buyback will fluctuate each quarter, taking into account our stock price and alternative uses for our cash.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.34, up 18% in constant currency, and up 9% in U.S. dollars. Our non-GAAP EPS was negatively impacted by $0.03 per share due to the strengthening dollar.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, we have $10.6 billion in cash and investments, after our $1.8 billion stock buyback. Our days sales outstanding improved from 55 days last year to 52 days this year, as we continued to focus on the quality of our receivables and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. We believe our bad debt reserve is appropriate and our reserve policy remains consistent with prior periods. Overall, we generated a record $7.6 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters, growing 15% over the prior year.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to guidance for the third quarter. Like last quarter, we will give guidance both in constant currency and in U.S. dollars. Using today's exchange rate implies approximately 8 points of negative currency impact on our Q3 growth rates. For the third quarter, we expect new software license revenues to grow a negative 2% to plus 8% in constant currency, and minus 10% to flat assuming today's rates. We expect non-GAAP and GAAP total revenues to grow 8 to 11% in constant currency, and 1 to 4% assuming today's rates.</p>
          <p>Assuming a Q3 tax rate of 28.5%, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.34 to $0.36 in constant currency, and $0.31 to $0.33, assuming today's rates. We expect GAAP earnings per share to be 0.26 to $0.27 in constant currency, and 0.22 to $0.24 assuming today's rates.</p>
          <p>We would like to highlight three observations. First, we have a large revenue and customer base diversified by product, by geography and by industry, in both the public and private sectors. We believe this broad platform allows us to outperform our competitors. Second, our software license update and product support revenues on a trailing 12 month basis were $11.5 billion, or approximately 48% of our total revenues, with very high renewal rates. During the last technology downturn from 2001 to 2003, our support revenues grew by 10%. Third, we believe in continued investment in research and development. At the same time, we are sensible in our approach to controlling costs. As a reminder, during the last downturn, our operating margins grew by 180 basis points from 2001 to 2003.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn the call over to Safra.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. As Jeff mentioned, and all of you know, the dollar strengthened substantially during the course of Q2, and the impact of the move in the currency also depends very much on the timing of the moves in the quarter. As you know, the dollar was under 1.30 against the euro for the entire month of November, and for us that's both the last and the most important month of Q2.</p>
          <p>As Jeff indicated, we hit our license growth target on a constant currency basis and in dollars currency impacted our new license revenue growth by 5 points more than the 3 points assumed in our September guidance. This brought us to a total of an 8 point year-over-year headwind effectively bringing our Q2 new software license revenue guidance from the 2 to 12% to negative 3 to 7 based on currency alone.</p>
          <p>What's not so obvious is the impact of currency on all the other line items. Such a substantial swing in currency during the quarter impacts us across the board including, for example, the nearly 2 points on our tax rate, which by the way accounted for another cent of EPS. The strengthening dollar affects our revenue mix, subjecting more of our revenue to the U.S. tax rate which is, of course, among the highest in the world.</p>
          <p>To give you a tangible example of the currency impact on tax, the shift in the dollar alone during the quarter completely overwhelmed the benefit we received from the R&amp;D tax credit. Even ignoring the tax rate impact I just spoke of, had the dollar not strengthened so substantially throughout the quarter, our non-GAAP EPS would have come in at around $0.37, again, $0.03 higher than what we reported today.</p>
          <p>Now, of course, obviously currency was not the only news going on in the quarter in the outside world and yet we feel just extremely good about our results. We'll continue to make smart choices as we manage the business, but as Larry and Charles will address, the product and competitive positioning of the company is strong and that shows in the results.</p>
          <p>When you combine our product strength with our financial strength, already delivering the highest margins among our peers and nearly twice as high as SAP, we believe we are well positioned relative to all of our competitors.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Safra. I'm going to highlight three separate product areas, middleware, sales automation On Demand and our new database machine. Middleware sales continued to grow very strongly, even in this economic climate, even after correcting for the strengthening of the dollar. We believe we are at least the same size as IBM in middleware and we may have passed them to be the number one middleware company. If we haven't passed them we are very, very close in terms of revenue. And our middleware business is growing dramatically faster than IBM's middleware revenue.</p>
          <p>In Sales On Demand, our primary competitor there is salesforce.com and this quarter was conspicuous in a series of competitive wins against salesforce.com. One, which was our largest ever on demand or cloud computing, whatever you want to call it, competitive win over salesforce.com was actually a replacement of salesforce.com. The customer will be de-installing salesforce and replacing it with Oracle Sales On Demand. So we're very excited about that, that business is now growing. When we compete head-to-head with salesforce we win more deals than we lose and that's new in the last couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>And finally, the Oracle database machine which we introduced in Open World or we announced in Open World and we've begun selling this past quarter. As measured by pipeline growth and pipeline size, this has been the most successful introduction of a new product in Oracle's history. So there's huge interest out there and quantified by an enormous pipeline which we've built. We think it's going to be a while before we're able to convert this pipeline people out. We've got a number of demonstration machines both from Oracle and Hewlett Packard being put in the hands of customers but that business looks very, very promising and should help us drive growth over the next 18 months.</p>
          <p>With that I'll turn it over to Charles Phillips.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Larry. Just to give you a sense of the activity of what's going on out there, our customer is continuing to engage in discussion, evaluation of new projects and technology. Our community is very active. Our sales event attendance which is a good indicator of future activity is still growing and up year-over-year as is our pipeline and obviously we have to see how that closes out in the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>But our strategy of having an integrated stack that expands database, middleware, CRM, ERP and industry applications plays very well in an environment where customers are having to rationalize technology investments and reduce complexity. So we can help customers to consolidate these systems, retire customizations and move to low cost platforms better than any other company. So those messages aren't new for us. We've been consistent in saying them but they are certainly much more relevant to customers right now.</p>
          <p>A few comments by product area, database area to highlight as Larry mentioned was the HP Oracle Database Machine which is certainly attracting a lot of interest out of the gate. Just to give you a sense of why that is, Mobile Tel, for instance, is evaluating our database machine for faster performance on 65 billion records of data. Their initial query performance is 10X to 72X faster than their current systems. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange; they had a query that was taking four minutes. They tested it; it ran in 10 seconds. They weren't even aware that the query got completed. So that's type of performance that we're seeing in and the machine is starting to sell itself.</p>
          <p>Moving on to middleware, middleware was clearly the standout in the quarter. We continue to post strong numbers there and market share gains. I just wanted to clear up a little controversy on kind of how we're doing post BEA since there been some questions out there. So number one, all the products within Fusion Middleware are growing very strongly including SOA, Portals, BI, Identity Management, and Content Management. We now have 80,000 customers. We are growing at four to five times the rate of IBM Websphere. We're clearly taking share.</p>
          <p>So I want to give you a sense of the types of head-to-head wins we are enjoying against IBM Websphere. Just in Q2 alone, companies like Raytheon, the IRS, DFW Airport, U.S.DA, Nucor Steel, China Mobile, Dubai Insurance Group, Toshiba, the Good Guys in Australia. Nebraska State College, South Bank, the German Federal Employment Office, KB Finance Group, Telefonica and there's more we could talk about. So we continue to enjoy a strong performance in middleware and gain market share there.</p>
          <p>Other general wins for middleware on the general platform, Wellington Management, Application Server, PG&amp;E where we replaced NetWeaver, Verizon Communications, Equinox, where we replaced Jboss, for the SOA platform University of Arizona, IEEE.</p>
          <p>For performance management, the Hyperion products; Saint Jude Medical, Internal Revenue Service, even though they're using an SAP back end, they want to consolidate in our product. Business intelligence we had good wins over Business Objects and SAP at Wipro, Fitch Ratings, Network Rail in the UK.</p>
          <p>Content management, good wins at Allstate, Department of Labor, and Accent Australia. In identity management, International Paper, where we replaced Computer Associates, and MegaFon.</p>
          <p>In the applications area, Larry mentioned that we're doing very well in CRM On Demand and we're certainly getting our traction now. What we think is happening as the market's becoming more sophisticated, as enterprises start to deploy at scale and they're demanding enterprise grade integration, scalability and security. So strong customer adoption, at Siemens we had 12,000 seat win. That's a stale SAP implementation and we'll become the standard there, U.S. Food Service where we beat salesforce.com, about 7,000 users there. Matria Healthcare, displaced salesforce.com there and in West Pack where we also beat salesforce.com. So we have had quite a bit of momentum there. And I forgot to mention Swisscom as well, another 3,000 seats.</p>
          <p>We're making good progress on AIA our Integration platform, four new process integration packs in the quarter. That makes the total of 20. We shipped JD Edwards to Demantra, Siebel Trade Management to Demantra and several others.</p>
          <p>Some additional application wins to highlight, ERP, Gentrix Corporation over SAP, TIAA-CREF, in the area of CRM on premise, HP at Eli Lilly for Agile PLM, Telmar Networks, Digital Health Group. Demand planning; NCR Corporation, Land O' Lakes, Transportation Management, McGraw Hill and Valspar. In the area of banking, Brazilian American Merchant Bank and Union Bank of California.</p>
          <p>Our communications GBU had another good quarter. We won Cox Communications, which was replacement win over Amdocs, Swisscom, Tacona Digital Networks another win over Amdocs, and Vodaphone UK. In tax and utilities GBU, good wins at the Mexican Tax Institute, Trust Pari in SOA And in Health Care, Schering-Plough and Elan Pharmaceuticals.</p>
          <p>This is also a good time for people to consider focusing on upgrades and getting to the latest release and we're seeing a lot of good activity there. Once they're on the latest releases, they become eligible for more add-on and product sales for us through up sell and cross sell.</p>
          <p>So just to give you a sense of that, Siebel 8.0, 42% of the customers on the latest release, PeopleSoft 9.0, 40% as well and we're seeing more customers move about 4 to 5% a quarter for each of the major product lines.</p>
          <p>So we had about 25 new releases this quarter for our major applications. All those major product lines are certified on 11G, that helps our uptick there as well.</p>
          <p>And then lastly some go-lives in the quarter that are important to track, Facebook and HBO, on enterprise EBS R12; Green Mountain Coffee, Duke University. In addition we had Payless Shoes, Pfizer Animal Health, Monster Worldwide, Synaptics and Las Vegas Water Supply.</p>
          <p>So with that, I guess we'll turn it back over to Roy for open up for questions.</p>

          <p>Great. Thank you Charles. I think with that we would like to open up the line for questions. Operator?</p>

          <p>Thank you. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operating Instructions] We'll go first to Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two quick questions. First, on the maintenance revenue, it sounds like there was a currency impact in the quarter on a year-on-year basis, obviously. Can you talk about the currency impact sequentially, and maybe drill down on your comment about renewal rates being consistent? Was there any change on the pricing side or any other mechanics around the maintenance stream?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The renewal rates were consistent, and in non-GAAP constant currency year-on-year license updates and support was up 21%. And I think that's the right way to look at it. There's a little bit of seasonality in support, but -- so year-on-year is an appropriate metric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could just touch quickly on the technology business. It sounds like middleware was an area of strength. You still grew on a constant currency basis, despite how tough the market was. Can you talk a little bit about the other areas, the core database, and maybe some of the options, which you saw from a segment perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In the core database business, we were &#x2013; let's see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at it on a combined basis, of course, we don't break out the numbers between middleware and database. But I'd say that obviously, the options continue to do very well, with the database machine out there, obviously we have a strong pipeline building there. All the components of middleware were doing well, also. So, I think we've been fairly consistent with recent quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terrific. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're up 12% in constant currency in database and middleware all together, compared to 22% last year.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll go next to Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions. Just can I follow-up on Adam's question on maintenance again because clearly that's what we love about the Oracle model is the maintenance line, but as customers came back through the quarter, did you find that they were trying to negotiate down maintenance, maybe taking a lower service level, and just broadly how resilient do you think that line can be as we go into the kind of teeth of this recession?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is Larry. We only offer one service level for maintenance. I mean, we offer standard seven day a week, 24 hour a day enterprise level maintenance. So there's &#x2013; we offer a full service system and we don't have different levels. We don't have a gold, silver, platinum kind of maintenance.</p>
          <p>In addition to that we offer advanced customer services, which people can buy on an hourly or on a daily basis. A few customers tried to negotiate but that's nothing new. We experience that all the time, and our renewal rates were consistent with previous quarters and I'd say nothing out of the ordinary happened. Anyone want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sarah, as you know, usually this maintenance on software is a extremely small percentage of many of our customers' IT budgets. The bulk of their budgets actually is labor, both their own and systems integrators and things like that, so their maintenance bill is &#x2013; added up for use for all sorts of different companies' software now, as we've acquired more and more companies. But the renewal rates remain very, very high because the software is usually absolutely critical for them to continue operating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. No, that makes a lot of sense. And then secondarily, just to come back to the application business, clearly it's a tougher area I think than maintenance as we go in &#x2013; as we're in a recession. How do you &#x2013; are you changing anything with regard to go to market, maybe thinking more about smaller tactical deals, just to keep momentum on the application side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think customers are signing up for fewer multi-year $100 million projects and implementation but fortunately we have a very broad portfolio. We continue to add to it with Primavera, things like Dementra, a number of things we've purchased allow them to implement very specific best-of-breed applications and get a very, very rapid return on investment where it's not a multi-year project or an incredibly expensive project before they get a benefit. So we're seeing more of those projects than, let's say, a huge multi-year ERP system coming in, though we get those also. I mean, we're winning deals in the government. We just recently won another state in a very, very large &#x2013; with a very, very large ERP implementation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much. That's great color.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. I had a question, Safra, in regards to your close rate assumptions for license revenue. I'm just wondering how you go about handicapping the close rate assumptions, given how challenging the current environment is.</p>
          <p>And then I had a follow-up question on operating margins. I mean, these are margin levels that are usually reserved for your fiscal Q4 and I just was wondering if you could share with us what type of efficiencies &#x2013; what drove the efficiencies this quarter to get the margins that high and how should we think about your ability to continue to get the efficiencies out of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me answer your second question first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've already forgotten your first one. You'll remind me when I'm done. The issue with margins for us is really much less about cost as it is about the mix of our business. And as we've told you all for really a number of years, the large subscriber base &#x2013; we have the large number of existing customers that are already using our software, who pay for update rights so they don't have to re-buy the licenses, is a very profitable part of our business. And as that number gets bigger and bigger, it is really impossible for us to actually spend our way through it. And so in general, that is sort of the overriding thing that guides our margins consistently higher.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; there are &#x2013; in any particular quarter there will be anomalies here or there, based on a number of different things. But that's really in general the most important thing and that's why really for a number of years we've been explaining to you that our margins are going to continue to go up, as long as we manage the business smartly.</p>
          <p>The second question &#x2013; the first question you asked actually was about close rates, and what we did this quarter, as we do every quarter, is we have to make some sort of close rate assumptions based on the size of the pipeline. Now, our pipelines are and remain very large and continue to grow. But we are taking into account the environment. We &#x2013; as I always say, read the same newspapers, watch the same shows, financial shows you all do. So we've decided that we would take a lower close rate for our Q3 guidance than we have ever had before during the Q3, just because we want to be thoughtful about what Q3 holds for us. So we have gone ahead and used a lower close rate than Q3 usually comes in at for our current license guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question -- John DiFucci with JP Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a follow-up to Heather's question on the guidance, Safra, one of the areas you actually got a lot of efficiency here was on the cost of services, so you have services margins greater than you normally have and just &#x2013; even just looking forward, how should we model that going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all I just want to remind you, as much as I told you about currency on the revenue side, there is impact of currency on the expense side too. Now, of course because our margins are so high, the benefit of it is obviously smaller, so just understand that currency impacts all those lines also. So it's &#x2013; it will make things look slightly different. The fact is that there is a lot of leverage in the &#x2013; in some of these different services lines, in some of these services lines. And so as we get bigger, you can have some expanding margins. A number of our businesses were &#x2013; operated more efficiently in the services line this past quarter and that's not really where the big win is. The big win is as license update rights expenses don't grow nearly as much as license product support revenues grow and that's where the big leverage is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a quick follow-up, actually to Adam's question, because I know we'll all be asked this tomorrow. On the maintenance line showed nice growth year-over-year of 14%, and I don't want to keep asking this but it actually was a sequential decline of 3% and that's why people are a little &#x2013; wondering about the sequential impact as far as foreign exchange because typically you don't see that in this quarter. So if you could just address that so we don't have to all sort of wonder about it tomorrow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is mostly foreign exchange.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was your answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh. Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll go next to Peter Goldmacher with Cowen and Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. When you do your win loss analysis following this quarter, what were the most consistent themes in why you were winning deals and particularly why you were winning competitive deals and if there was a deal you happened to lose, why you might have lost that deal or deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're in a lot of product areas but I will say that one new thing that we used to use all the time was consolidating system and rationalizing environments, those old messages are working very well for us and this is a good environment to standardize on a single stack. So our strategy plays well to people who are looking to lower costs right now and they're thinking about it a little bit differently.</p>
          <p>In middleware, it's just sheer product performance. We have so many feature advantages there and just a comprehensive product suite. If we can get someone technically to look at the product line, we always win. If we lose, it's based on some legacy relationship that IBM had but that's happening less and less. I feel very good about where we are in middleware.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you compete in the applications business and you guys present an ROI for an all Oracle solution, is there a standard ratio of what an all Oracle solution can be relative to say an SAP-IBM or potentially an SAP-Oracle solution would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's not just cost. We are less expensive, just because we use some of our own technology, but the fact that we have features and processes that are automated, they simply don't have. They don't have a core banking application. They don't have a retail merchandising application. So some of these areas it's us versus building it yourself or buying it from a very small company and so we use those areas as differentiators. You can have that same functionality and domain expertise but based on &#x2013; from a large company on a standard platform. So if we can get people to actually look at the actual software and do demos, that's when we win.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one last question, Safra, you had mentioned that you had ratcheted down your close rate assumption, given your time in front of CNBC. Are you comfortable sharing any metrics about how much you're ratcheting down close rate expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really significantly lower, both in the average, than any previous year. It's quite significant, frankly, though it may end up being overly low, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We hope.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. On R&amp;D you had a pretty strong sequential drop. I was wondering if you could comment. You typically haven't seen that in past years, Q1 to Q2. How much more room is there in the R&amp;D line and was this just a shift of expense or was it an absolute stop of some of the expense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a bunch of different things. As I said, some of it is related to currency, some of it has to do with just a bunch of different things. It is not as a result of a head count decline. It just so happens it's between mix and comp payments and I don't know how much you know about our R&amp;D team but we have a very large number of folks outside the United States in India and currency had a significant impact between U.S. and the Indian rupee and there's a bunch of different things related to compensation, etcetera.</p>

          <p>And Larry mentioned at the Analyst Day the pace of acquisitions would pick up in a tougher environment. If you could just characterize, are you thinking about doing a blend of smaller transactions or are you still keeping in mind some larger transactions as the environment gets tougher into '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're very opportunistic. We're always shopping and we're always looking for things that make sense for us and &#x2013; but we are continuing to follow our regular rules of return requirements, etcetera, and strategic fit. So we continue to be on the same path we've been on and we look at things, whether small or large, all the time. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's exactly right. Some companies have much more attractive valuations right now but -- and I'm not sure they'd be wildly enthusiastic about selling for cash at this point in time. So we're going to wait and see how things play out, and we're looking at a number of small acquisitions in the vertical areas and some potential opportunities for a large company acquisition if the price is right.</p>

          <p>Operator, we have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. With time for one final question, we'll go to Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I wanted to follow up on Europe. We saw another second unusually weak quarter out of Europe on the app side relative to the other categories and other geographies. Any plans to make changes or anything to address that weakness there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Actually, this is really no different. First of all, it wasn't just in Europe. Both Q1 and Q2 are absolutely impossible comparisons on the app side, year-over-year comparisons, and that's exactly what you're seeing. We actually, virtually telegraphed it during the Q1 call for you all. Last year those quarters, both Q1 and Q2, were up over 50% and &#x2013; let me just look, lean over &#x2013; yes, up 77% in Q1 and 72 as reported, and even in constant dollars you see it's in the high 50s, and that just ends up a number in the base. And so those &#x2013; it's really a matter of a comparison; it was exactly the same issue. If you look at the table we distribute with the earnings announcement, you'll see that that is exactly what played out in Q1 also and it impacted not only Europe, but it's virtually in all the regions.</p>

          <p>All right. I think, well, that does it for today. So I want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us and participate in today's call. A telephone replay will be available for 24 hours. The replay number is 719-457-0820, with the pass code 4426811. You can also access the webcast replay on Oracle's Investor Relations website. The webcast replay will be available through the close of market on December 24.</p>
          <p>I'd like to also inform everyone that we will no longer be issuing supplemental tables with the press release. You can access those supplemental tables directly on our website. To receive notice of Oracle's IR news and events directly you can describe to Oracle's Investor Relations RSS feeds, via the RSS link on our IR website. Thank you, again, and with that I'll turn the call back to the operator to close.</p>
