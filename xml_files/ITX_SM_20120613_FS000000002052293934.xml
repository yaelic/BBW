          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the presentation of Inditex Results for the Interim Three Months of 2012. The presentation will be chaired by Mr. Pablo Isla, Chairman and CEO. This presentation will be followed by a Q&amp;A session, comprising two parts. The first part will be dedicated to questions received on the telephone, and the second part to the questions received through the webcast platform.</p>
          <p>Mr. Isla, you have the floor. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex results for the interim three months of 2012. I am Pablo Isla, and here with me today are Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, our CFO, and Marcos L&#xF3;pez, Capital Markets Director.</p>
          <p>The results for the first quarter 2012 show that Inditex continues its ongoing global multi-concept growth and a strong execution of the business model. Sales in the quarter have increased 15%. Our operations have also shown high efficiency and tight operating control over the period. As a result, EBIT has grown 34%.</p>
          <p>Let me also tell you that in terms of expansion, our store opening plan and online sales roll-out for the year is on track. We have opened the stores in 26 different markets over the period, demonstrating the global reach of Inditex business model. We have also launched online operations in selected new markets in the quarter. We continue to see significant growth opportunities for Inditex globally.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over to Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, who will provide you with some details behind the headline numbers. I will join you later for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2012, <mark type="ph" /> all the lines (02:05) in the profit and loss account saw significant growth, as a result of our operating performance. Inditex has achieved net sales of &#x20AC;3.4 billion, EBITDA of &#x20AC;764 million and net income of &#x20AC;432 million. In the first quarter of 2012, sales have grown 15%. Sales in local currencies have grown 14%. Gross profit has increased 18% to &#x20AC;2.1 billion, resulting in a 60.2% gross margin results.</p>
          <p>We have sustained our commercial policies over the period. Operating expenses are tightly under control. They have grown 13%, reflecting mainly the growth in sales and include all the startup costs for new openings. Operating working capital remains negative as a consequence of the business model. The working capital reduction is in line with the performance of the business.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Marcos L&#xF3;pez, who will elaborate on the performance of the Inditex concepts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of space addition, we are on track, as we have opened 91 net stores in the first quarter 2012, to reach a total of 5,618. Continuing with our global expansion, we have opened stores in 26 markets over the period.</p>
          <p>Regarding the performance by format in the first quarter of 2012, Zara and the other concepts grouped together have performed broadly in line with each other, with some minor differences. Regarding the younger concept, Stradivarius and Pull&amp;Bear have performed above the average and we saw Massimo Dutti below the average. The changes versus last year relate mainly to the comparable base.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Pablo for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to our expansion in 2012, let me highlight that our store opening plan is on track. Regarding the outlook for the first half of 2012, I would like to add that the store sales in local currencies from February 1 to June 10 have grown 14%. For the rest of 2012, we will continue to invest profitably, expanding our business in a number of markets with attractive long-term returns through our multi-concept and multi-channel strategy.</p>
          <p>Inditex is now present in five continents and in all the key markets, showing our global reach. We manage a diversified sales platform in 85 markets. The current base offers huge growth potential for the coming years.</p>
          <p>Zara has established an online presence in Europe, the United States and Japan. We have launched online sales for Zara in Poland in March. We plan to roll out Zara online sales progressively in other selected markets to enhance our global presence. To this end, we will launch Zara online sales in China in September.</p>
          <p>Following the launch of online sales for all Inditex concepts, we have been expanding their presence in selected European countries. Before closing, I would like to cover a number of initiatives carried out by Inditex concepts over the quarter, and some selected store openings of recent months.</p>
          <p>Zara is currently expanding its product department to scale it for future growth. The addition of 70,000 square meters to its current base of 90,000 square meters will be completed next year-end, and is already included in our capital expenditure plans. Inditex has launched Zara, Pull&amp;Bear, Bershka and Stradivarius simultaneously in Ecuador in May. The stores at Quicentro Shopping will be followed by additional openings in the country.</p>
          <p>The Pull&amp;Bear store in Rotterdam has received a LEED Platinum award, the highest possible, due to its eco-efficient credentials. Massimo Dutti has opened two very relevant flagship stores, Corso Vitorio Emanuele in Milan and Queen's Road in Hong Kong. Following the launch of Bershka in Japan a year ago, we have opened a flagship store in Osaka with a very strong reception. Bershka currently operates six stores in Japan and continues its expansion.</p>
          <p>Stradivarius has developed a new store image that will be launched in all new stores. Oysho has launched a new beachwear collection now present in all its stores worldwide. The campaign has been shot at the renowned Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles.</p>
          <p>Zara Home continues its expansion with very prominent stores in The Hague and Stratford Centre in London. Uterq&#xFC;e has launched online sales in Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands. Our Zara store at 666 Fifth Avenue, New York, is a global flagship of more than 3,600 square meters that has had a significant impact on the commercial landscape of one of the world's most prominent fashion destinations.</p>
          <p>Zara has opened its sixth store in Berlin at Boulevard Mall. This is Inditex's store number 84 in Germany. Zara has opened a very relevant store in Krasnodar at Red Square. This is Zara's store number 59 and Inditex's store number 274 in the Russian Federation.</p>
          <p>Zara has opened a very relevant store in one of Tokyo's most emblematic buildings, Skytree. We continue to expand our presence in China with highly prominent stores. Zara has opened at Chongqing Starlight Place, a key retail destination in the city, which brings our store count in China to 305.</p>
          <p>Zara has opened a new store in Bangalore at Brigade Orion Mall. We have opened our 33rd Zara store in Brazil at Park Europeu in Blumenau. And finally, we would like to close this presentation with the Zara store at Gateway Mall in Durban.</p>
          <p>And this is all from us. We will be pleased now to answer any questions you may have.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, the telephone Q&amp;A session starts now. We remind you that online questions will follow. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. The first question comes from Anne Critchlow from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. I'd like to ask a question on online. Could you give an update on the performance of the non-Zara formats online and how you're going to expand those globally? And also say whether the website in China will be in a local language?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, first of all, regarding our online business, and as you were asking about the performance of the non- Zara format, what we would say is that we are also quite happy with the evolution of our online activity regarding also the other formats. You know that online for us is very relevant from two different points of view. Of course, first of all, it has to do with the level of online sales, but at the same time online is being a wonderful platform for us to communicate our products to our customers, to go &#x2013; to show our look books.</p>
          <p>I do take advantage of your question to tell you, for example, in the coming days it will be available new application in the case of Zara for smartphones and for the iPad that I'm sure you are going to like very much. So for us the online activity has to do, of course, with online sales, but at the same time it has to do with &#x2013; as we always say, with a way to communicate our products to our customers, the look books. I don't know you have seen, for example, the last one in the Zara webpage or in the other webpage of the different brands. So globally, what we can say is that we are happy with the evolution of our online activity in the different markets and with the different brands.</p>
          <p>And regarding any detail about our online launch in China, I would prefer to wait a little bit more to be more specific about the details. What we can confirm you is that we are planning to launch our online sales in the month of September, so at the very beginning of the next autumn/winter season.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And do you think you'll be making the websites more interactive so that customers can leave comments, or maybe some sort of social networking angle at any point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, this world &#x2013; online world is a world that is evolving permanently, and this is something that would be also our case. But for us, the most relevant thing is always to show our collections, to show the new arrivals to our stores or to our webpage permanently in the best possible way and to have this customer experience that we are also having inside the stores.</p>
          <p>We think that this approach, this multichannel approach, is very, very strong, very positive. And as we have talked in previous meetings or conference calls, you must also have in mind that because of our business model, our online activity is totally scalable. So it has a lot to do with what we are used to do with this twice per week deliveries to all our stores in the world. So for us, it's been a very natural way of doing things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Richard Edwards from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a quick question on the gross margin. I wonder if you could give us some sense of the contribution from reduced markdown in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding the gross margin, you know that we do not like to elaborate very much on a quarterly basis. We prefer to look at the gross margin on a full year basis or at least on a seasons basis. So as you can see, we are having a strong sales growth. And, of course, when you have very positive like-for-like sales growth, it also has a positive impact regarding the gross margin. But I wouldn't like to elaborate much more, because, as you know, we always prefer at least to wait until the end of the season to be more specific.</p>
          <p>But you also must have in mind that, as we always say, the gross margin is a combination of many different things. So we try not to isolate one particular aspect regarding the gross margin, and even more when we are talking about the first quarter results of the year. But it has a lot to do with the very good evolution of like-for-like sales growth during the season.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then if I can ask about online sales, just following on from Anne's question. Can you give some sense of how significant online sales are now within the Group sales mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We prefer &#x2013; I'm sorry to disappoint you, but we prefer not to be very specific about figures. We continue to be very focused on the execution. We are just &#x2013; for example, you know that in the U.S. and Japan, we began in the last autumn/winter season. This season we are beginning in China. Two months ago, we began our operations in Poland. For the brands, we are just at the very beginning implementing our online business in different European countries. We think it is too early to talk about figures and we prefer to continue focus on the execution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Simon Irwin from Liberum Capital. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, chaps. Congratulations on a good quarter. Could you just talk a little bit about pricing in the quarter? It looks as though prices have gone up in apparel across Europe and in, well, most major markets. Can you just say whether your pricing has followed the market up during the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stable prices in the different markets, probably stable prices in the different markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And looking forward, given that it's likely that most &#x2013; many of your Asian-sourced peers are going to have to push prices up further, what would be your strategy to kind of &#x2013; to continue with stable pricing or do you think you would follow the market upwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. As you know, we are &#x2013; as you know what is our approach. Of course, our commercial position is that we are offering to our customers very high fashion, high quality and affordable prices. And our policy of maintaining stable prices in different markets is something that we are not planning to change in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could you just talk a little bit about openings in the U.S. You didn't actually increase your net store count in the U.S. last year. Is that going to change going forward, particularly given that you've now got the big flagship and a much bigger presence in the U.S. with online?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. What we would say &#x2013; well, first of all, what we can say about the U.S. is that we have had one opening, but this is an opening that is equivalent to many, many openings. And that has been this very big flagship in Fifth Avenue we were mentioning before, and we have talked about this opening before. So it's a one store, but it's one store which is socially relevant.</p>
          <p>Thinking about the &#x2013; our future plans in the U.S, I would tell you we are a global company, we are opening stores in all the different geographies and, of course, it's also going to be the case in the U.S. market. Currently, we are present with Zara, but you know we are planning to enter with Massimo Dutti, because Massimo Dutti &#x2013; the former Zara store in Fifth Avenue will become Massimo Dutti in the next autumn/winter season, also with Massimo Dutti opening in Georgetown, in Washington and in the future in other U.S. cities. And we will continue, of course, opening stores &#x2013; high-quality stores with Zara in the U.S. market, as in any other market. In one particular period, you could see more openings or less openings, because it also has to do with the normal evolution of the company and the real estate opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tremendous. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Frank Walding from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to ask if you could give us any color on the regional split. Obviously, not on a like-for-like basis, given that it's a quarterly set of results. But could you say whether you are positive in all regions on a comp FX basis?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, could you just quantify the contribution from consolidating some of the franchises that you bought in &#x2013; at the end of last year? Is that a material number that we should be thinking about in your comp FX performance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, starting with your second question, there is not a very material impact coming from the consolidation of franchises. Okay? Because <mark type="ph" /> you think (19:41) the franchises that we acquired in terms of units were not very, very big.</p>
          <p>And secondly, what I would like to say about the regional split, you know that we prefer to talk about this on at least six months basis. What I would like to say is what we mentioned in March. We have a global business. We're now in 85 different markets, in five continents, Northern and Southern hemisphere. If you are referring to the different split, I believe it's better to wait for the six months. And I think that we have provided a trading update, which shows that our sales are growing at 14% from the February 1 to June 10. So at this point in time, this is what we want to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Warwick Okines from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. Could I ask about the gross margin two years ago in Q1 where the gross margin increased quite dramatically to about 60%? You said one of the factors was an increase of proximity sourcing. I was wondering if you could just tell us whether the mix of proximity sourcing increased year-on-year in the past quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, proximity sourcing, we think because &#x2013; I would come back to what I was saying before that to think about one quarter is a too limited period of time to talk about the gross margin. We always prefer to talk about the gross margin on a full-year basis, or at least, as I was saying before, on a six-month basis.</p>
          <p>Of course, proximity sourcing and this like-for-like sales growth evolution, and then the positive impact of the gross margin, all these things are related. But to elaborate more on this, I would prefer to wait at least until the end of the season, so at the first half results presentation. But, of course, these types of things are always related. When we have a strong like-for-like sales growth, then we have this flexibility of our business model with proximity sourcing with a positive impact we have in the gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much. And on a different subject, clearly you've announced quite a major increase in your product departments at Zara. Could you just give us some more details about exactly what it is that your full capacity for right now and what the extra space will give you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we want to do is, as we always do, this increase in the size of our commercial departments, 70,000 square meters, is very similar to what we do when we increase logistic capacity. We always try to be a little bit in advance to the &#x2013; I would say, to the needs of the company.</p>
          <p>So the company is growing. All the teams, as you can imagine, are becoming stronger. We have now this very strong team in the southern hemisphere. Marcos was referring to it. We have now a strong team for our online business. All the commercial departments for Zara in the women's section, in the men's section, in the children's section are growing.</p>
          <p>Zara Home, which is also based here, is growing. All the different commercial department. So what it shows is that it has a lot to do with the growth potential of the company that we are seeing for the coming years in the different markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Great. Thanks very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Two questions. The first one is whether you could provide an indication of the leap year effect, if that was material? And the second is, again on sourcing in proximity, we were wondering whether you have seen some sort of deflationary effect from your sourcing in proximity, taking into account the macro conditions, difficult macro conditions, of some of these countries included in proximity? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Well, I will answer a little bit with your second question. Perhaps, Marcos, you later on can elaborate on the first one. What we can see about our proximity sourcing is that what we are seeing is quite a stable sourcing environment. This would be the answer, that we are seeing a quite stable sourcing environment from that point of view. Marcos?</p>

          <p>And regarding the leap year effect, Marta, what I can add is that, we're talking about one day in 90 days of trading in the quarter. But, obviously, this effect will be fully diluted over the year.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Richard Chamberlain from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good morning, everybody. Just interested in your comment, you making the statement about start-up costs for new openings. Given the number of stores opening in Q1 was lower than last year, I just wondered if you can say how many stores you expect to open in the second quarter. And whether you expect start-up cost to remain at high level in the second quarter, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Richard, regarding the store opening plan, you know that for the year, we plan to open 480 to 520 stores. Obviously, the calendar of openings is &#x2013; every year is not exactly the same. But if you look at the openings of the first quarter, you will see that there are less stores, but there are more Zara stores. So in terms of space, we're fully on track with the plan for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I'm with you, okay. But overall, for the first &#x2013; we should expect more space in the first half of this year, is that correct, compared to the first half of last year, as a percentage of the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Not significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In general, the calendar of openings is slightly biased towards the second part. So we don't expect a significant timing difference in the openings this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Marcos. And just a follow-up then on store numbers. Can you say how many stores you have now in China and how many you expect to open in China in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in China right now, we're operating 305 stores, and you know that the plan for the year is to open something around 130 stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And again, that phasing of store openings in China would be in line with the Group, would it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With the phasing of the store openings in terms of first half, second half split in China, would that be in line with the company as a whole?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Our cash is in funds, invested in high quality sovereign debt. So this is, as you see, a very sound and very, let's say, prudent investment to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:32).</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And just a question on inventories, please. I think they were up 3.2%. Is there anything that has happened, or is this just a timing issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know that our inventory position does not reflect the &#x2013; what for us is more relevant is the level of commitment at any point in time. But perhaps, Ignacio, you can &#x2013; you want to elaborate a little bit more on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We have mentioned in previous quarters the inventory position is just <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:06) and doesn't properly reflect the commitment of the company at any given point in time. Our focus is to manage tightly our commitment level, to have flexibility to the inventory to meet demand.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Fraser Ramzan from Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning and congratulations on a very strong quarter. I just wonder, given the obvious success of the collections in the first quarter so far, and I know you need to look at it on a seasonal basis, what the potential benefit to like-for-like sales was from price mix? And I don't mean like-for-like price. I mean average unit retail selling price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's mainly volume driven, as it is always the case in any particular season. But as you know, and as I was saying before, we prefer to wait until the end of the season to elaborate a little bit more on this type of things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mainly volume driven <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:15).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to clarify, when you talk about seeking to hold like-for-like prices and not increasing prices, of course, that comment relates to like-for-like items. But obviously, if there is a particular success of your collection in the period and/or indeed customers buying higher quality items, then that can drive up average unit retail selling price of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But, Fraser, this is always the case, because the mix is not the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're talking about fashion and for us, it's very important to identify the key selling items. But in general, as we have mentioned, the growth in like-for-like is mainly volume driven, because our prices are &#x2013; tend to be very, very stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fantastic. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning to all. One question related to gross margin. I know this is just the first quarter. But just to clarify, if you maintain your gross margin target of flat gross margin for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:43) of the year. As you were saying in your question, this is only the first quarter and we maintain our statement about stable gross margin for the year. Of course, always knowing that stable for us could represent plus or minus 50 basis points. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. We are now going to go through the questions that we have received through the webcast platform. The first question is from Francisco Riquel of Nmas1 Equities. Can you comment on the current situation in Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I would like to say, first of all, that in the first quarter results, we do not like to elaborate very much about our sales in any particular market, and also that &#x2013; as we have said previously, that we are not a good macro proxy.</p>
          <p>But I would also like to say that, as far as you raised this question, that I have full confidence in the potential of the Spanish economy. We must have in mind that a comprehensive set of very important reforms in different key areas has been passed over a very short period of time. And in addition, the institutional framework has been improved in a very significant way, with clear mechanisms and commitment to fix the public finances, especially at the regional level.</p>
          <p>So as I was saying before, I would say that I have full confidence in the future of the Spanish economy. And I firmly believe that the effects of the reforms that are being adopted will start to become evident in the coming quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have another question. It's regarding the store &#x2013; the new store image at Zara. Are you happy with the new store image? What impact is it having on sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are quite happy with the store image of Zara, with the new store image of Zara. We are quite happy because our customers are very happy with the new store image. All the feedback that we are receiving from our customers is very positive. They feel very comfortable inside the stores. They can see, in a much better way, the product in a very attractive way. So we are quite happy.</p>
          <p>Now, it has already been rolled out in very relevant stores, of course, in the new openings, in New York Fifth Avenue, in Moscow <mark type="ph" /> Robenski (33:31), Taipei 101. And through new openings and refurbishments in the coming months or years, it will be rolled out in our most relevant stores, and we can say that globally, we are quite happy. Then our customers what &#x2013; that is what is more relevant for us, are also very, very happy and receiving, in a very positive way, our new image.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have &#x2013; the next question is regarding Japan. Can you comment on your recent experience in Japan following the opening of Zara stores and also the launch of Bershka and online in the country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Japan, as you know, it's a market that we know quite well. We have been in Japan during many years. We are developing our Zara brand in Japan. I would say we are quite happy with the performance of the market and also for Bershka, with the openings in Tokyo. Now, with this opening, we were referring to during the presentation in Osaka is being very, very well-received by the Japanese customers. So it's clearly a growth market for us, thinking about the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very good. We've had some other questions which have been covered during the Q&amp;A session on online, on China expansion, on regional sales trends. So that concludes the questions coming in from the webcast platform. Thank you.</p>
