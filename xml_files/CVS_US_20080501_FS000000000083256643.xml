          <p>Good morning.  My name is Amanda and I will be your conference operator today.  At this time I'd like to welcome everyone to the CVS Caremark Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call.  All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.  After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.  Please go ahead ma'am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Amanda.  Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today for our First Quarter Earnings Conference Call.  I'm here with Dave Rickard, Executive Vice President and CFO of CVS Caremark who will provide a business update, a financial review of the first quarter and guidance.  Also with us is Howard McLure, President of Caremark Pharmacy Services, who will participate in the question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>First I'll note that we expect to file our 10-Q by the end of the day today and it will be available through our website at investor.cvs.com.</p>
          <p>This morning we will discuss some Non-GAAP financial measures in talking about our company's performance, namely free cash flow, EBITDA and adjusted EPS.  Free cash flow is defined as earnings after taxes plus non-cash charges plus changes in working capital less net capital expenditures, so free cash flow excludes acquisitions and dividends.  EBITDA is defined as operating profit plus depreciation plus amortization.  Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS eliminating the effect of amortization only and assuming our overall effective tax rate for the amortization.</p>
          <p>We will provide guidance today using adjusted EPS as we did on our last call.  In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a reconciliation of the of the Non-GAAP items I mentioned to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website at investor.cvs.com.  As always today's call is being simulcast on our IR website.  It will also be archived there for a one month period following the call to make it easy for all investors to access the call.</p>
          <p>Following our remarks we will have a Q&amp;A session and we ask that you limit yourself to one to two questions including follow-ups so that we can get to as many analysts and investors as possible.</p>
          <p>Let me quickly touch on a couple of items before turning this over to Dave.  First, a reminder that our annual analyst and investor meeting will take place on the morning of Wednesday, May 21 at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York City.  We've had an enormous response to the meeting and we look forward to seeing several hundred of you there.  If anyone else would like to attend and needs the specifics on the meeting, please call my office and we'll do our best to fit you in.  The presentations will also be available via webcast.  This is the one time per year that we provide broad access to an extended group of our senior management team so we do hope you can be there in person.</p>
          <p>Given that we have our big meeting in a few weeks, today's business update will be somewhat more brief than usual.  We will focus primarily on the quarter's results.</p>
          <p>There's one item that I'd like to address with respect to disclosure going forward.  Many of you have asked me what our practices will be with respect to announcing PBM contract wins and I want to share with you our intentions in that regard.  First of all, keep in mind that many clients do not give us permission to announce or discuss the details of our contracts publicly.  So we will provide summary updates on our overall selling season on our quarterly earnings call.  We'll generally not provide information regarding contractual wins and losses between calls.  However, in rare instances we may make an exception between quarters and announce a contractual event for unusually large contracts that are the subject of market rumors or speculation that may affect our share price.  Hopefully that gives you some sense of our intentions.</p>
          <p>Now before we continue our attorneys have asked me to read our Safe Harbor Statement.  During this presentation we will make certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  Accordingly for these forward-looking statements we claim the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  We strongly recommend that you become familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factor section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K.</p>
          <p>And now I will turn this over to our CFO, Dave Rickard.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Nancy, and good morning everyone.  I hope you've all had a chance to read through the terrific financial results we reported this morning.  If you did, you may have noticed that we posted record first quarter sales, operating profit, operating profit margin, net earnings and diluted earnings per share.  Before I run through these results in detail I want to touch on a few key areas we've been getting questions on.  These include the PBM selling season, MinuteClinic, Pharmacy and front store trends in our retail business, and our new store program.</p>
          <p>So how's the PBM doing?  Well the 2009 selling season is going very well and we're pleased with our progress to date.  As most of you know, about a third of our contracts come up for renewal each year.  For 2009, we've already renewed more than half of our business that's up for renewal this year.  These include some marquee accounts such as AT&amp;T, Bank of America, 3M, and the State of Connecticut.  As previously announced, in the case of AT&amp;T, we've picked up some incremental business as well as they consolidated all of their PBM business with CVS Caremark instead of having the BellSouth piece separately contracted.</p>
          <p>Our clients are telling us that we've kept our focus on service which was their primary concern following our merger.  They've also expressed their enthusiasm for our new model because they understand that our unique combination can lower their overall costs while improving access, convenience and health outcomes for their members.  We'll provide many more details on our new value proposition at our May 21 analyst meeting.</p>
          <p>So our retention thus far has been terrific.  What about new PBM business?  Well we've already had some early successes this selling season as well.  It was previously announced that we won the PBM contract to service the Employee Retirement System of Texas, or ERS, and the BellSouth portion of the AT&amp;T contract. Those two contracts together are worth nearly a billion dollars in annual revenues.  In the aggregate, we've already won the right to serve about 40 other clients, most beginning in January, 2009.  I'm delighted to report that these new contract wins to date in total should have first year revenues of about $3 billion.</p>
          <p>Included in that number, I am very pleased, to note that we've been selected to provide specialty pharmacy services for a large, top-ten Blues plan beginning during the second quarter of 2008.  We'll provide a fully integrated specialty model including not only specialty mail, specialty retail and disease management programs but also access to care through CVS retail pharmacies.  They've chosen this integrated approach as an enhancement to their current solution.  We'll use the vast resources of our enterprise to help them control their specialty pharmacy costs most effectively, improve patient access, and deliver better health outcomes.  Overall our progress and momentum in this PBM selling season are just what we'd like.  It's very clear that our new model is resonating in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to an update on MinuteClinic.  We treated 300,000 patients during the first quarter alone and customer feedback on our clinics continues to be highly positive.  We're providing quick and cost-effective access to high-quality health care professionals for everyday common illnesses.  MinuteClinic leads the industry and has 350 clinics more than our nearest retail clinic competitor.  We operated 510 clinics at the end of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Our initial goal for the MinuteClinic business was to gain first mover advantage, building our lead in selected markets, and we've done that.  Now we've made the strategic decision to reduce the number of clinics we add this year, so that we can better focus our efforts in 2008 on expanding services, contracting with additional third-party payors and working with PBM clients to offer new products and services.</p>
          <p>We now expect to add approximately 100 clinics in 2008 and end the year with between 550 and 600 clinics compared to the approximately 700 we previously forecast.  Also we may close some clinics not currently in CVS stores or Caremark client locations.  We remain very optimistic about the prospects for MinuteClinic and believe we're taking the right steps to best position it for long-term success.</p>
          <p>Now let me touch on the retail pharmacy side of our business, and again it's a good story.  IMS data shows CVS steadily gaining share.  We're up again this quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2007.  We hold a 17% national retail market share and a 22 share across the markets in which we operate.  Our script growth in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter of '07 is ahead of all other chain stores.</p>
          <p>Pharmacy comps for the first quarter were 3.7% that included approximately 450 basis points of negative impact from new generics.  So adjusting for new generics, we would have reported 8.2% pharmacy comps.  The flu had a negligible impact on pharmacy comps in the first quarter.  Our generic dispensing rate in our retail segment was 66.6% up from 61.7% last year.</p>
          <p>Pharmacy comparisons were influenced negatively by the deceleration of Med D growth compared to last year when it was still ramping up.  In addition the switch of Zyrtec from a prescription to an over-the-counter product obviously reduced prescriptions filled.  On a positive note, however, we had a private label over-the-counter version immediately available upon the switch.  So the overall impact of the Zyrtec change, while negative to pharmacy, was beneficial to front store sales and especially margins.</p>
          <p>Our front-end business continued to demonstrate healthy growth in both customer traffic counts and average dollars spent per transaction.  Front-store comps increased 4.3% in the first quarter.  That included a benefit from the Easter shift of approximately 115 basis points.</p>
          <p>I'd like to touch on our same store sales results for the combined March/April period in light of the Easter shift which of course impacts front store sales in the second quarter as well as the first quarter.  For the combined March/April period front store comps were 3.4%.  In March front store comps were 6.5% and in April front store comps were -0.2% due to the impact of the earlier Easter.  So you should factor that in when building your models for second quarter sales.</p>
          <p>We've told you in the past that the front store business now makes up only about 15% of our revenues and profits and that only 20% of that is considered discretionary.  Many of you have been asking what if any impact we're seeing from the softer economy on our front store business.  I can report that we recently looked at the discretionary versus non-discretionary categories to evaluate whether there was any change in trend.  Our data shows no evidence of a consumer slowdown based on this analysis.  My interpretation is that consumers are making tough choices on big ticket purchases but they aren't yet focused on Snickers bars.</p>
          <p>And how does all this stack up relative to the competition?  Well, I'm pleased to report that we continue to grow share in the key front store categories that make up the vast majority of our sales, OTC, beauty, private label, and digital photo.  In fact, we experienced share gains versus food, drug and mass competitors in categories representing more than 90% of our front store sales volume.  In addition, our private label business continues to grow across our store base.  In the first quarter private label made up 14.8% of total front store sales.  That's up 90 basis points versus the prior year.</p>
          <p>We continue on our path to achieve our goal of private label and proprietary brands to represent 18 to 20% of front store sales in the next three to five years.  And that will help drive margins.  In both the front store and the pharmacy, comps in the former Osco/Sav-on stores, acquired in 2006, continued to outpace our core stores in the first quarter.  So we're very pleased with the continued good progress in our acquired stores.</p>
          <p>I'll also note that our front store margins continue to improve.  That's importantly driven by the use of our ExtraCare Loyalty Program to drive more profitable sales.  More than 65% of our front end sales across the store base currently use the ExtraCare card.  We have well over 50 million active card holders and we continue to find more ways to use the data to drive better results.</p>
          <p>Before diving into the financials, I'll touch briefly on our real estate program.  In the first quarter, we opened 94 stores including 41 new and 53 relocations.  We closed 19 others.  So we added 22 net new CVS pharmacy stores in the quarter.  For 2008, our plan remains to open 300 to 325 stores about 175 to 185 will be new and the rest will be relocations and we expect to achieve approximately 3.5% retail square footage growth.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to the details of our financial performance in the first quarter that we reported today.  After that I'll provide guidance for the second quarter as well as the remainder of the year.  I'll start by reminding you that we lapped the one year anniversary of the merger of CVS and Caremark at the end of March.  So the March 2008 quarter is the last quarter in which the absence of Caremark in the reported prior year results skews our growth statistics.  Going forward our reported results will be apples-to-apples comparisons with the exception of integration and other one time costs.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to our first quarter income statement.  Total revenues on a consolidated basis increased 62% to $21.3 billion.  This figure is net of inter-segment eliminations of $1.3 billion.  In our retail drugstore segment, revenue increased 5.4% to $11.8 billion.  Same store sales for the quarter were 3.9% in line with our guidance.  And how about the PBM segment?  Well, net revenues of 10.8 billion increased 2.3% over the comparable 2007 first quarter figure.</p>
          <p>Adjusting that growth rate for the impact of generics, net revenues would have grown 10.6% for the PBM.  The impact on the change in PharmaCare's revenue recognition method on the first quarter was the addition of approximately $710.5 million in reported revenues before inter-company eliminations or about 555.4 million after eliminations.</p>
          <p>So on a comparable basis what drove the growth of PBM revenues?  Total retail network revenues were $7 billion rising 12% from 2007 levels, setting aside the increase from PharmaCare's revenue recognition change, retail network revenue increased 0.6%.  At the same time retail network claims grew 5.7%.  This was predominately driven by new business including the growth spurt in our PDP which experienced healthy growth in Med D lives this year.  The PBM's retail generic dispensing rate increased to 65.2% compared to 59.9% in the first quarter of 2007. This significant increase in the generic dispensing rate explains the disparity between retail network revenue growth and retail network claims growth.</p>
          <p>As expected, mail claims decreased for the quarter by 17.7% on a comparable basis.  The impact of new clients was more than offset by previously announced terminations, namely, FEP, State of New York and Ohio State Teachers Retirement System.  As a reminder, the portion of the FEP business that we no longer service is the mail order piece, including PBM mail and Specialty mail.  We continue to service FEP's retail networks.  Total mail revenues declined 12.4% to 3.6 billion and within total mail revenues, PBM mail was down 21.1% compared to the first quarter of 2007, while our Specialty mail revenues increased 4.6%.  If you exclude the FEP business from last year's data, total mail revenues increased 4% and Specialty revenues grew 14.4% in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The mail generic dispensing rate rose to 52.8% from 45.8% a year ago.  That's a healthy 700 basis points of growth.  Excluding FEP, the increased drops to 600 basis points, still very significant.  Our overall mail penetration rate decreased 5 percentage points from 2007's first quarter to 23.1%; again, largely as a result of the absence of the FEP mail business.</p>
          <p>Moving on to gross profit for the total company.  The overall business did extremely well thanks to strong performances within both segments.  Within the Retail segment, gross profit margins were up 200 basis points over the first quarter of 2007 to 29.6%.  The primary drivers of this on the pharmacy side continued to be the substantial margin expansion we experienced from the increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals, as well as merger-related purchasing synergies.  At the same time, front store margins improved.  That reflected not only an improved product mix and reduced shrink in our acquired stores, but also the benefits of the ExtraCare Card that result in a lower percent of products sold on promotion.  Offsetting these gains somewhat was continued pressure on generic reimbursement rates, as well as an increase in the percentage of pharmacy sales handled by third-party insurance.</p>
          <p>Gross profit margins in the PBM segment on a comparable basis expanded to 7.3%.  That's up 10 basis points versus 2007's first quarter, and includes the 52 basis point drag from the conversion of PharmaCare's contracts.  Like the Retail segment, our PBM pharmacy margin continued to benefit from the purchasing synergies derived from the merger as well as an increase in the conversion of branded drugs to generic equivalents.  And as I mentioned on our last call, we anticipate a greater impact from new generics in the second half of the year.  In addition, recall that I also told you that our PBM would see higher profitability later in the year from the Med D business in light of the widened risk corridors and the related accounting.</p>
          <p>So what about expenses?  Overall operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved due to the change in mix between retail and PBM.  In the retail segment operating expenses increase as a percent of sales from 22.1% to 22.5%.  This was primarily caused by the significant growth in generics, which pressured sales dollars while improving profitability.  Adjusting for the growth in our generic dispensing rate at retail, operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the retail business actually improved by more than 80 basis points.  In the PBM segment comparable operating expense as a percentage of revenues improved by 10 basis points to 2.3%.  So I'm very pleased with our continued solid expense control in both our retail and PBM segments.</p>
          <p>All things considered, we saw a notable expansion of our operating margins, particularly in the retail segment.  The retail segment's operating profit margin grew by 150 basis points over 2007 to 7.1%, while the PBM segment's operating profit margin improved by 20 basis points over 2007's comparable results.  Our PBM's industry-leading EBITDA per adjusted claim increased to $3.41 excluding integration costs in the first quarter, or 6.9% over last year's $3.19.  Excluding the FEP mail business, we would have had double-digit growth in EBITDA per adjusted claim, so the underlying growth of the business is excellent.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the rest of the income statement, we saw quarterly net interest expense on the consolidated income statement increase to $131 million reflecting additional interest from our increased debt position due to the merger as well as our balance sheet restructuring.  Our tax rate was 39.6% in the quarter, in line with expectations. And our diluted share count was 1.47 billion shares.  Of course, that's up significant from last year's first quarter since last year's first quarter shares were only weighted with merger-related shares for the final ten days of the quarter.</p>
          <p>So what did all this mean for EPS? Well, adjusted EPS rose 18.3% to $0.55 up from $0.46 in 2007 and at the high-end of our guidance.  So we produced solidly robust earnings year-over-year despite the additional financing costs.  GAAP-diluted EPS rose 17.4% to $0.51 for the quarter compared to $0.43 in the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet and cash flows, we generated 346 million in free cash flow in the first quarter.  Net capital expenditures were 395 million in the quarter, which reflected proceeds from sale/lease-back transactions of 5 million netted against the gross capital spent.</p>
          <p>Now during our last conference call I announced that in November we had entered into a $2.3 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement, which we expected to complete during the first quarter we did just that.  And while the outflow of cash happened entirely during the fourth quarter we received an additional 5.7 million shares in the first quarter to complete the transaction.  So we've placed those shares into our treasury account.  We are now finished with the authorized repurchase programs that were born of the merger.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to guidance for the second quarter and full year 2008.  In the second quarter we expect revenue growth for the total company to be in the range of 3 to 5%.  We expect PBM revenue to be up slightly in the second quarter.  And we expect retail revenues to be up 5 to 7%.  On the retail side we had the positive impact of the Easter shift in the first quarter, so of course, in the second quarter we get the reverse effect of that in our front-store sales.</p>
          <p>We anticipate second quarter adjusted EPS of between $0.59 and $0.61 per diluted share up from last years $0.51 per share.  That equates to adjusted EPS growth of 16 to 20%.  GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57 per diluted share up from last years $0.47 per share.</p>
          <p>Given the continued strength across our businesses, we remain optimistic about our growth for the full year.  Let me walk you through our current guidance assumptions.  For the total company we expect revenue growth of about 13 to 16% for the full year after inter-company eliminations of approximately a billion dollars per quarter.  For both segments generics will play a role in dampening top line growth.</p>
          <p>For the PBM segment on a comparable basis, we expect revenues to be about flat with 2007.  This is an improved outlook and reflects some contract wins starting later this year as well as a higher level of price inflation than we originally anticipated.  But we expect reported revenue growth of over 20% for the year since the merger closed in late March of 2007.  Remember this revenue estimate also includes an impact of approximately two billion dollars year-over-year from the change in PharmaCare's revenue recognition methodology from the net to the gross basis and for the full year as opposed to a partial year.</p>
          <p>For the retail segment, we expect revenue growth of between seven and 10% for the year.  Same store sales are expected to be in the range of 4 to 7% percent for the retail segment for the year.  For the total company, gross profit margins are still expected to be down modestly due to the mix impact as we average in a full 12 months of Caremark.  However gross margins are expected to increase by roughly 25 to 50 basis points for the PBM segment on a comparable basis despite the gross up of the PharmaCare contracts, and we now expect gross margins for the retail segment to increase 50 to 75 basis points.  In part, that's due to the delay in implementation of the Medicaid AMP cuts.</p>
          <p>As we said on the fourth quarter call, we are assuming fewer new generic introductions in 2008 than in 2007.  We also continue to believe that these introductions will be back end loaded.  As such we won't see the bulk of them until third quarter.  So our 2008 outlook assumes that generics do help our gross margins but are less favorable to margins than they were in 2007.  Additionally our gross margin will be helped by purchasing synergies. We still expect more than 700 million in synergies in 2008 much of which is from purchasing.</p>
          <p>As for expenses, we still expect total company operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to improve significantly, that's largely due to mix.  The total operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the PBM segment on a comparable basis, may be in the neighborhood of last year's numbers, as general good housekeeping could be directionally offset by the 2008 start-up cost of all that new business Howard and his team have been bringing in for 2009.  The retail segment has no such headwind and we still expect it to show moderate improvement.</p>
          <p>We expect total consolidated amortization for 2008 of approximately $400 million and depreciation of about $850 million.  All of that again leads to solid improvement in operating profit margins for the total company as well as for each segment.  As I said on the last call, we could nicely exceed 6.5%, our current operating margin high-water mark which we achieved back in the year 2000.  We forecast net interest of about 475 to 500 million and a tax rate approaching 40%.  We expect approximately 1.49 billion weighted average shares for the year and no further share repurchases are included in this guidance.</p>
          <p>All things considered, we are raising the low end of our full year guidance range by a penny.  We currently expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $2.44 to $2.50 and GAAP EPS of $2.27 to $2.33.  That represents growth of 18 to 21% on both an adjusted and GAAP EPS basis.  Net capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 1.3 to $1.4 billion for 2008.  Free cash flow is expected to be around $3 billion driven largely by the strong earnings growth we expect to deliver in 2008.  As you can see our business is very strong and we remain optimistic about 2008 and beyond.</p>
          <p>So in summary, in the first quarter we delivered strong revenue growth, significant margin expansion, 18% adjusted EPS growth and healthy free cash flow.  Our retail business continues to grow strongly and gain market share in the front end and in the pharmacy.  The PBM selling season is off to a great start and shows every indication of a terrific year.  Our new offerings are catching on.  Payors increasingly understand that we can improve convenience and access for their members while lowering their overall health care costs and our guidance confirms that our confidence and continued robust business growth and financial performance.</p>
          <p>Now we'd be glad to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Dave I wanted to drill down a little bit on retail and PBM EBIT because retail looked incredibly good and PBM looked a little light.  Just on the retail side to start, Easter I would assume had a modest but not overwhelming benefit.  Is that fair?  And it looks like you're continuing to see a fairly good generic environment despite the comparisons.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the Easter period, because it was several days shorter than last year, we had actually planned to be down and it was down but not as much as we planned.  So you can say it had a benefit in the way it played out versus our expectation.  We had a good sell through, we had a good season but it was simply a shorter number of days.  As far as generics, yes, we had very good performance in generics in both the retail and PBM side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does it surprise you on the retail side how good the lift was from generic or it's pretty much what you thought?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually on both sides of the business we were generally in the territory that we expected to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Then on the PBM, was any adverse hit from FEP in New York State that would be abnormally large because it's the first quarter and you are transitioning away from that business or was that not much of an impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd say this: you have to keep in mind that FEP, the mail side of FEP was in the third year, last year, 2007, so third year is always the most profitable year in a PBM contract and so the comparison is tough for that reason. It was also a substantial specialty business so again that means that it had more profitability than some and simply the absence of that in comparison obviously is a year-to-year reduction.</p>
          <p>Now had we bid and won the contract, we would have had a significant reduction anyhow because of the fact of new rates and so forth in the new contract but nonetheless, the absence of it was a significant factor.  I would say though that we didn't have a substantial number of incremental costs in the first quarter related to stepping away from that. We obviously, to the degree that we had obligations and announced terminations and such provided for those by accrual in the fourth quarter of last year, so there wasn't any clutter in the first quarter, if that's your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well just trying to get at how representative was the one quarter performance for Caremark because the margin and the EBIT just looked light relative to trend. I wanted to see what was impacting the performance versus where we were coming out of '07 and is the first quarter representative? And I guess it's kind of representative but do you think for variety of reasons the margin is going to get a lot bit better as the year goes on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd say the one factor that we talked about importantly when we gave the initial guidance for the first quarter was that the Med D program was evolving as CMX intended it to and as everyone knows that it was going to and an important part of that was the widening of the risk corridors. Given the fact that we have to account for the insurance piece of the business in each quarter as if it were a full year, we end up recording our worst performance in the first quarter when we have many costs and not as much revenue pro-rata. So the pattern of earnings gets worse when you add insurance business or you add risk to an existing insurance business which we did this time.</p>
          <p>A third factor that impacts &#x2013; and that we talked some about on the last call. A third factor that impacts this significantly is the pattern of generic conversions and whereas we did have some in the first quarter we also expected, and still expect, the big quarter this year is going to be the third quarter. Last year we had proportionately more in first quarter.  So there were two or three things here that structurally, would have resulted in the pattern that you've seen.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Your next question comes from Lisa Gill, JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for the details.  First, a follow-on, Dave, just so we understand on the Part D side, are you really talking about bringing up your reserves around Part D because of the change in the risk corridors for this year and therefore, as we move throughout the year you could potentially start to take down those reserves?  Is that how we should think about that component of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not a voluntary change in reserves.  It's a mandatory accounting that in effect says all of the revenues and all of the costs get booked within each quarter discretely as if it were a full year.  Many other parts of accounting allow you to look at the full year and take a pro rata portion.  This particular accounting has its own specific rule that we have to abide by and that's how we have to account for it.  So the upshot is we can't smooth higher loss ratios that are incurred early in the program before we get into the doughnut hole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And then just a couple of other quick PBM questions. When you talked about this $3 billion of new business is that on a net basis or on a gross basis for 1/1/2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  That's on a gross basis.  What I am trying to help you to understand is how the year is going but we're not yet at a point where we have a very, very clear fix on what 2009 is going to be and so I would encourage you not to fire up the model for 2009 based on these very, very early results. The message is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But is that the plan over time, to give us a net number...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we'll give you as much shape as we can in the third quarter call as we usually do.  That's when we know 95% of what's going to happen and we can give you an accurate read.  All we can do right now is just indicate how the year is going and it's going quite well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And just lastly, I know you haven't done this in the past, but do you want to give us any kind of guidance as to how we should be thinking about EBITDA per script?  I think what John was trying to get at is that most of us were pretty far off in the first quarter, and obviously I think FEP, being in the third year, was more profitable than many of us thought it was.  Any way we should be thinking about that as we go throughout the year?  It sounds like it's going to get better as it progresses, but is there anything else that's unusual as we move throughout 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously that is also affected by mix of contracts and so forth and that's still evolving, so it's a little bit of a shot in the dark.  But I would expect that you should expect pretty consistent improvement in that as we go through the year.  But that's a general expectation and I could well be wrong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one last follow-up.  When you talk about clients and new clients that you've signed on, we've all been waiting to hear about some of the programs that they're really looking forward to.  Can you maybe just give us some color around some of the things AT&amp;T liked or some of these new 40 clients that you've signed on that they've really liked about the combination of the two entities?  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I can do that but Howard can do it better.  I'm going to ask Howard to take the podium here.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>The May meeting, the Analyst Meeting that Nancy referenced will have a lot more detail on.  And without talking about what any specific client found meaningful, I think what clients are seeing resonating is the value proposition from the unique and integrated health model that we're putting together.  One thing that is in the marketplace today is what we call ability.  Oftentimes clients or participants don't get their mail order prescriptions in on a timely basis, and they can't get turned around; consequently they're left with a gap in care.</p>
          <p>One of the products we have introduced, we introduced it April 1st, is the ability for them to go to a CVS store and get that five days' worth of medication, no incremental cost to either the patient or the participant -- excuse me, or the client.  So those are the types of programs and you'll hear more about them in May so I don't want to go into a lot of detail on them today, but those are the types of programs that are out there that clients are seeing.  The component that we've all talked about that you've heard over and over again is the consumer facing ability that we have that is really unique to our PBM retail model.</p>

          <p>Dave, could you just give us some color on the decision to cut back on the MinuteClinic growth, maybe just providing more details on the variables that led to that decision?  And then is there any real meaningful EPS benefit from not opening up as many clinics this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, I didn't get the second part of your question.  Can you repeat that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any meaningful EPS benefit relative to your prior guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Well I'd say this, in any new business you learn as you go, and you adjust priorities accordingly.  Early on we focused on expanding the footprint.  We've now brought it to a point where we think we have a basis for a very good business.  And now we really need the team to focus on enriching the platform while it continues to expand at a more balanced rate.  And also the management team needs to finalize agreements with some plans in certain markets and continue our marketing efforts.  So it's more an enrichment now than it is expansion, although we will continue to expand.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the financial effect, this strategy change is actually going to be a little bit more expensive than the original strategy as it turns out.  But we think it's the right thing.  And we think it's much more likely to lead to a terrific, successful little business that's an important adjunct to our PBM efforts than simply the land grab that we were in for a while there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have staffing issues had anything to do with this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't run into any significant staffing issues yet.  That's not to say that we won't.  We would expect to down the road, especially as our competitors also are expanding quickly.  But that hasn't yet been an issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And your retail gross margin obviously was very strong this quarter, up 200 basis points.  Walgreens gross margin was flat.  Your front-end gross margin's up.  Theirs was down.  This might not be a fair question, but could you maybe help us understand how you're producing such strong results when your biggest competitor is not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I don't want to comment too much on my competitor's results.  But I understand that they have said that they are finding a need to spend more promotionally.  We're finding the reverse of that.  We're not having to expend as much promotionally.  We also have favorable mix change.  The growth in our private label is a good example of that.  So we've got a lot of things going positively in that business.  And ExtraCare is a unique weapon.  It's something we have and they don't have.  And it permits us to manage our promotional spend much more precisely and to much greater effect than broad campaigns or circulars.  We've known that for years and it's an advantage we have in our business, it's structural.  We also are getting some benefits in purchasing that they may or may not be getting so all I can tell you is that the programs that we have in place are working and I don't know really any details about their progress.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>We said early on that we expected about 1500 to 2500 MinuteClinics across the system, we really haven't revisited that so I don't have new news on that. We still would expect it will be something like that.  But we'll solve the very long term in due course.  Right now we want to make sure we are having as great an impact as we possibly can with the model.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that's the right way to think about it. Obviously we are expanding the services that we are offering, so it is going to be a richer content as we roll it further, but we also have to back fill now with that richer content into the first 500 stores.</p>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we don't have any new announcement to make today on new programs there. Obviously it's a lot of cash.

        <plist>
          <p>Wanted to dig in a little more on those new PBM contract victories.  You know there was &#x2013; there is a lot of chatter going on out there in the marketplace that these were just price focused wins. Is there anything you can really relay to us to indicate that was not the case, that there were actual attributes that they liked about the new combined offering?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know it's been my experience as we've gotten more deeply into PBM dynamics that the loser of contracts always says that.  And there have been a lot of losers out there.  We think that the reality is that we do have to be competitive in terms of price, but that what we are bringing to the table is value.  We are bringing a better product that we can uniquely deliver because of our structure.  And our customers certainly are cognizant of that and are very enthusiastic about that.  So I think what we're seeing here is the beginnings of what we expected to see when we talked about this combination of CVS and Caremark originally. That is the ability to add service and convenience and ease for customers, improve outcomes and lower cost for clients.  And that's what we're doing and they are responding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And did those contracts include any discounts for on the front-end or any flexible prescription capabilities or anything like that yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Howard is saying that they don't.  I know that before the merger we had a couple of programs like that. We had a feature like that in the state of Connecticut contract and the Daimler Chrysler contract, so it is certainly something that is available to us as a tool.  But it is not a primary tool.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to ask about the prescription trends out there, we have seen some softening in the prescription volume trends across the industry. Can you give any insights as to what's going on there?  Do you think there is any component in this that is the consumers reacting to the economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't see at this point evidence or market research that would suggest that consumers are changing behavior, more pill splitting or things like that.  We do monitor that. You know, the Zyrtec phenomenon certainly is a piece of it.  The absence of the growth that we had in last year's numbers due to Med D is a piece of it but the PBM utilization rate is up and our share is up.  So we're still seeing reasonable trends on the pharmacy side.  I'm not going to rule out the possibility that consumers will start to adapt differently to a new economy but we just haven't seen it yet.</p>

          <p>Well first of all the way that those synergy benefits come through the P&amp;L is simply by having lower prices on purchased goods as each retail and PBM use the inventory.  So it isn't an allocation decision.  It's not something that we sit here and say okay now how much should we put here and how much should we put there.  It just flows through cost of goods like any other cost or benefit.  So it's not an allocation.  Both retail and PBM, therefore, are getting very, very substantial benefits out of the purchasing synergies which is, as you know, the bulk of the 700 million.</p>
          <p>On the overhead piece, the 100 million or so, goes disproportionately to the PBM because it just so happens that there were call centers and things like that that were able to be closed.  And those were costs to the PBM and so those flow to the PBM disproportionately.  But the purchasing goes both ways.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Would it be fair to say that in the inventory that was ordered in the first quarter, that the retail side of the business benefited more from the lower costs as a result of the synergies than the...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Remember that you have the big PharmaCare gross up in sales that has no profit impact and you did have the FEP contract.  And if you factor in those two things you pretty much can explain the trends that we're looking at here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It just seemed such an outstanding first quarter for the retail side and I was just looking for any sort of simple explanation between what you did against expectations.  So congratulations on that.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the Sav-On Osco stores, how much have they helped to contribute as well to improved performance?  And are you looking now to accelerate more aggressively into Northern California, Pacific Northwest, mountain regions, and will that be organic or will you consider acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Osco Sav-On out-performed core CVS both in sales and in margins.  It has the advantage that it started with a shrink opportunity that we are rapidly capturing, and so that's helping the margin comparisons.  And simply the sales is the result of really bringing the CVS discipline to the way those stores are run.  It's a mature base now, the management, the systems, everything is in place and it's working better.</p>
          <p>In terms of Northern California, we are anxious to be in Northern California but it is an extremely tough real estate environment and we will be doing, and are doing now, the groundwork necessary for organic expansion.  So if we stumble across some acquisition along the way, certainly we'd want to consider it, but right now our view and our plan is to do it organically.</p>
          <p>I should point out -- let me circle back to the Osco Sav-On question -- I don't want to over-emphasize the size of that.  Recall that it was 700 stores in total, and so...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just that when you look at the population per store of the Sav-On Osco stores, it's twice that of the CVS average.  Yet the scripts per week seem to be quite similar.  I'm just wondering, do you see a significant opportunity for those stores to exceed the average because of the population densities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the actual sales per square foot overall are lower than core CVS by a meaningful amount.  And so, yes, we do see a very substantial opportunity there, both front and pharmacy.  And we're getting it; I mean it's coming along.</p>

          <p>Your next question is from Meredith Adler with Lehman.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  I wonder if you could just talk to us a little bit about what impact the PharmaCare gross up had on the PBM numbers.  You made a comment just now but it would be helpful if you just sort of fleshed that out.  Is that one of the reasons that optically you seem to see better results in retail than in the PBM?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that is absolutely true, Meredith.  You know it's an increase in sales without a corresponding increase in profitability at any line so it is going to have an optical effect that would appear to make the PBM results less impressive than they actually are.  Couple that with the Med D phenomenon and you have two very sort of non-operational negatives, if you will, in the first quarter for the PBM. PharmaCare gross up, by itself, costs 52 basis points in reduction to margins.  So had it not been for that you would have seen the margins you know 50 basis points higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I know that you didn't change the accounting for PharmaCare like the day you closed the transaction, so how long do you think we should expect that that will be a dampening effect?  And would you also say, my understanding of the PDP is you might actually have another quarter where the accounting forces it to be a drag as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are quite right.  The second quarter will have a similar phenomenon and actually, if you recall, we did the conversion of those contracts and therefore the accounting starting in September of last year.  So it will have a full quarter effect in the second quarter and a partial quarter effect in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then another question I have is just to talk a little bit about the start up costs for the new contracts in the PBM?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know too much about what kind of magnitude we should be thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you think about the nature of those costs. If a contract as typically is the case calls for a call center you have to have that call center ready to go on day one.  Typically January 1 contracts, so you're hiring and training. You're providing for the space needs. You may have to rent additional space depending on the circumstances. You have to hire some medical professionals within the mix of that. You need to put in place the management structure to manage it.  So these are the kinds of costs, and of course we're talking about contracts which in the aggregate are in the billions of dollars.  So there's a lot of activity and there's going to be a lot of bodies associated with servicing those contracts.  We also, with this kind of expansion, would expect that we will need more client service people.  And they tend to be higher-cost professionals if you will.  So there are those kinds of costs.  So on three-plus billion of additional revenue you certainly should expect several million in costs to get ready.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then a question maybe if you could talk about, I mean you explained that the slowdown in script growth is not a function so far that you can see of changes in consumer behavior.  But we have seen a slowdown.  And I was wondering if you have any sort of view, opinion, about what might be causing that slowdown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well again, we don't see any major individual factor for that.  We've talked about Zyrtec going OTC.  That affects us on the margin.  That affects the percentage disproportionately.  Absence of new product introductions of any size is certainly a factor.  We've also seen IMS data that shows a slowdown in the past that didn't turn out to be as much of a slow down as we actually thought at the time.  So this could be one of those little dips as well.  Hard to know.  All I can tell you is we have decent trends in our business.  We're happy with the share growth that we've achieved.  And overall we're satisfied and tracking at a level that we were quite comfortable with and within the ranges of our plans.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You talked about increases in terms of specialty mail revenue growth.  Can you elaborate on that?  And also, anything new on the disease management side?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well specialty mail, as I said on a comparable basis adjusting for FEP grew about 14.5%.  That is in the neighborhood of where it has been growing.  But I suppose a couple hundred basis points lower than at about this time last year.  But it's still a very high growth attractive market for us.  Did you have a second part to that question?  I'm sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  And anything new on the disease management side, which also &#x2013; I know it's been a big focus in terms of driving Specialty revenues?  Can you also just elaborate on what you're doing with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me; well, there's nothing necessarily new on the disease management front other than the capabilities that we're getting out of bringing together the two entities.  We're starting to see some folks who are &#x2013; Dave talked about the big specialty win that we had.  One of the big factors there was an ability to bring the retail environment into helping manage the care of these individuals.  These individuals are using very high-priced medications.  They have a number of different co-morbidities.  So that's an area that we think &#x2013; one of the reasons they liked it was the consumer facing component of this.  And we saw that in this particular contract discussion that people really were pleased with the ability to bring that together.</p>

          <p>Good morning, David.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Dave, Nancy and Howard.  In under the wire here.  Just a quick question about just the retail side.  You've mentioned you are not seeing the consumer impact.  Is that true for all the regions including Florida?  And then the second part of the question would be just given the success you're seeing in retail right now that sounds like it's being driven by the ExtraCare Card to a large degree and the cash flow you're generating this year, could we see some maybe bump up in the growth rate organically over the next year or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, one of the frustrations in looking at the data for me is that several people are saying Florida and California are the markets in which the consumer slowdown has occurred most or fastest or most visibly.  And of course those for us are newer markets.  And so we are still enjoying the extra growth that you get from being relatively young in a marketplace.  And so we're not seeing weaker trends in those markets than the overall business.  So I can't help you there.  And it may well be that a slowdown is being experienced there, but it's simply masked by the vibrant growth of the relatively young fleet that we have in both of those cases.</p>
          <p>In terms of acceleration of growth as we go into '09 and '10, it's hard to judge that from here.  It's hard to know how long this economy is going to wobble as it has been doing here.  We do think that a major influence on our economic wellbeing is going to be the pace of generics.  2009 may be similar to 2008, and it's broadly expected, and I expect, that 2010 and 11 are going to be pretty big years.  So I guess right now, as I said, 2009 looks like a very solid year.  It probably is going to be economically a bit better on average than 2008 on average.  So I look at 2009 with moderate optimism.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But for the time being we should just expect 3.5% organic square footage growth until we hear differently, but &#x2013; it's an option though?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  I think that is absolutely right.  3.5 is our comfort zone, and we haven't obviously done our plan for 2009 at this point.  But if I were laying a base assumption, that is certainly the one I would use.</p>
